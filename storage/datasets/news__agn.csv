Hello again 
Allergan was developing a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin 23  IL 23  called brazikumab for the treatment of Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis  AbbVie recently launched its own IL 23 inhibitor  risankizumab  under the brand name Skyrizi for the treatment of psoriasis

The unit will remain in Irvine  Calif  and be led by Carrie Strom  who currently serves as the senior vice president of U S  medical aesthetics at Allergan  Strom  who will become president of Allergan Aesthetics as well as being a vice president of AbbVie  will report directly to AbbVie s CEO Richard Gonzalez 
The rest of Allergan  including its eye care and treatments for central nervous system  women s health  and gastrointestinal diseases  will be integrated into AbbVie  In the deal  AbbVie gets antispychotic Vraylar  irritable bowel syndrome treatments Linzess and Viberzi  and oral contraceptive Lo Loestrin  among other drugs  as well as a pipeline of potential new therapies 

The health company plans to split the Botox franchise  People supporting its use as a cosmetic for reducing wrinkles will stay with Allergan Aesthetics  while Botox therapeutics will be integrated into AbbVie  The drug is approved for nine different indications that can benefit from the muscle relaxing neurotoxin  including overactive bladder  migraines  and spasticity  where muscles continually contract 
AbbVie expects the acquisition to immediately improve its bottom line with earning per share  EPS  expected to increase 10  over the first full year following the close of the transaction  The company estimates at its peak  the deal will add more than 20  to EPS ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfkbw,2055319

104181,325696,AGN,Should You Buy Allergan Before the AbbVie Acquisition Closes ,news,"Allergan s  NYSE AGN  days as a standalone company are numbered  We don t know exactly when AbbVie s  NYSE ABBV  pending acquisition of Allergan will close  but it should happen sometime in the first quarter of 2020 
This deal certainly lit a fire beneath Allergan stock  with the drugmaker s shares soaring 45  since the transaction was first announced  But is Allergan still a stock to buy with the AbbVie acquisition likely to close so soon 

Understanding the deal
It s first important to understand the terms of AbbVie s acquisition offer  Allergan shareholders stand to receive 0 866 AbbVie shares plus  120 30 in cash for each Allergan share that they own 
When the deal was announced in June 2019  this translated to a total transaction value of around  63 billion  Based on AbbVie s share price at the time  the acquisition valued Allergan at  188 24 per share 
Today  though  AbbVie s shares are trading more than 10  higher than they were seven months ago  And Allergan s share price is now around  192  a little higher than its valuation when AbbVie s plan to buy the drugmaker was disclosed 
Joined at the hip
These transaction terms should be at the forefront of investors  minds when considering whether or not to buy Allergan stock  The reality is that AbbVie and Allergan are already joined at the hip even before the deal is finalized 
If you re hoping to make a quick profit  Allergan s share price will depend largely on whether AbbVie s shares go up  Even if Allergan announces wonderful news over the next few weeks  shareholders will still only receive  120 30 in cash for each Allergan share they own  But any significant good news for Allergan should push AbbVie s share price higher  which in turn will benefit Allergan shareholders when the transaction closes 
Long term investors thinking about buying Allergan stock should focus even more on AbbVie s prospects  This isn t a merger of equals  AbbVie is a much bigger company than Allergan is  AbbVie s shareholders will own 83  of the combined entity 
It s important to remember the main reason why AbbVie is buying Allergan  Sales are declining for AbbVie s top selling drug  Humira  in the face of competition from biosimilars in Europe  Biosimilars will enter the U S  market in 2023    and that s when the pain will really intensify for AbbVie  The Allergan acquisition is being made to reduce AbbVie s dependence on Humira  but the immunology drug will still contribute close to 40  of the company s total revenue even after the Allergan transaction closes 
Buy Allergan if   
Basically  there are only three reasons to buy Allergan right now 

You expect some big catalyst for Allergan or AbbVie in the very near future and plan to sell on any major jump in Allergan s share price 
You think that AbbVie will be able to deliver solid returns over the long run with Allergan s products and pipeline in its lineup 
You re seeking income from dividends 

If the first reason is your primary motivation for buying Allergan  my view is that you re making a mistake  There s no guarantee that either AbbVie or Allergan stocks will pop over the next few weeks before the acquisition closes 
However  I think that the second reason listed to buy Allergan right now makes sense  Although Humira s best days are behind it  AbbVie has other drugs that should drive growth  especially including cancer drugs Imbruvica and Venclexta and new immunology drugs Rinvoq and Skyrizi  Allergan s Botox and antipsychotic drug Vraylar should also boost AbbVie s sales 
If you re an income seeking investor  buying Allergan before the AbbVie acquisition closes seems like a pretty astute move  You ll get a lot of your cash back relatively quickly thanks to the cash portion of AbbVie s acquisition offer  You ll also own shares of one of the more attractive dividend stocks on the market  with AbbVie s dividend currently yielding nearly 5 4  
All this  of course  assumes that AbbVie s acquisition of Allergan will wrap up as expected  Could something derail the deal  It s possible but very unlikely at this point  If you re considering buying Allergan  your fortunes are almost certainly linked to AbbVie  too ",2020-01-26,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pm-ut,2067917

104199,325714,AGN,Dealmakers eye cross border M A recovery as mega mergers roll on,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Pamela Barbaglia
NEW YORK LONDON  Reuters    A rise in large mergers and acquisitions  M A  helped offset a plunge in cross border deals in 2019  and many dealmakers say they expect subsiding geopolitical risk to embolden companies to pursue more tie ups across regions in 2020 
The value of M A globally totaled about  3 9 trillion in 2019  making it the fourth strongest year for dealmaking  according to preliminary figures published by financial data provider Refinitiv  This is only slightly lower than the  3 96 trillion in deals recorded in 2018 
Cross border M A totaled  1 2 trillion  down 25  year on year to its lowest level since 2013  as rising geopolitical uncertainty and regulatory scrutiny of deals made many corporate chiefs and boards wary of expanding beyond their home markets 
 Companies were more comfortable this year doing deals within their own regions given the macroeconomic risks such the trade tariffs and Brexit  so cross border M A was down   said JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  global M A co head Chris Ventresca 
Large deals  on the other hand  were on the rise  as companies were spurred on by their strong stock performance and cheap financing to pursue transformative acquisitions 
The number of M A transactions worth more than  10 billion increased 8  year on year to 43 this year  their highest level since 2015  according to Refinitiv  Some 21 deals  each worth more than  20 billion  accounted for almost a quarter of global volume in 2019 
 Mega deals were the main feature of this year s deal making  especially in the United States  where the bulk of these transactions took place   said  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS  global M A co head Gilberto Pozzi 
The biggest deals of the year included U S  drug maker Bristol Myers Squibb Co s  N BMY   74 billion acquisition of  Celgene Corp   NASDAQ CELG   U S  defense contactor Raytheon Co s  N RTN  merger with the aerospace business of United Technologies Corp  N UTX  into a  135 billion company  and U S  pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc s  N ABBV   64 billion purchase of Botox maker Allergan Plc  N AGN  
The United States accounted for close to half of global M A volume in 2019  with  1 8 trillion worth of deals announced  up 6  from a year ago  Europe and Asia tied for a distant second  with a little over  740 billion worth of M A transactions announced in each region 
 Europe has been hit by macroeconomic headwinds in key markets  including Britain  Germany and France  where Brexit uncertainty  slow growth and social unrest have been some of the main hurdles   said Pier Luigi Colizzi   Barclays  Plc s  L BARC  head of M A for Europe and the Middle East 
In Britain  Europe s largest M A market  dealmaking dropped 4  year on year to  220 6 billion  with much of the year dominated by political debate over when and how Britain will leave the European Union 
 Market uncertainty in the UK has played in favor of private equity funds  which have been very active and have carried out a number of take private deals  including Merlin Entertainments  Sophos and Cobham   said Cyrus Kapadia  chief executive officer of Lazard Ltd s  N LAZ  British operations 
In Asia  China s economic slowdown led to M A volume in the country dropping 14  year on year to  380 3 billion  while the political turmoil fueled by Hong Kong s pro democracy turmoils unnerved dealmakers in the wider region 
ROOM FOR M A TO PICK UP
After world stocks added over  25 trillion in value in the past decade  and a bond rally put  13 trillion worth of bond yields below zero  some investors have been asking whether a recession could be around the corner that would put the brakes on the wave of dealmaking 
Yet companies have not been holding back on M A because of concerns about an economic slowdown  deal advisers say 
 The next economic downturn is not expected to be as severe as the 2008 financial crisis  and when it happens many well capitalized companies may seek to capitalize on a drop in corporate valuations to pursue their dream deals   said Perella Weinberg Partners Chief Executive Officer Peter Weinberg 
The U S  economy grew 2 9  in 2018  but forecasts for 2019 are for around 2 5  growth  due to the fading impact of U S  President Donald Trump administration s tax cut package and slowing global growth  At this level  dealmakers say the environment would be conducive for more transactions 
 A lukewarm economy is ideal for acquisitions  because companies need M A to ensure growth  and business sentiment is sufficiently strong for CEOs and boards to be comfortable with pursuing deals   said Sullivan   Cromwell LLP partner Frank Aquila 
Moreover  some of the geopolitical risks that weighed on cross border M A in 2019 are gradually dissipating  The United States and China are close to signing their Phase 1 trade deal  while a strong electoral victory for Britain s Conservative Party earlier this month offered clarity on the country s timetable for Brexit 
 About a month and a half ago  activity levels started to pick up  and it seems people feel a lot better about the M A pipeline   said Alan Klein  co head of Simpson Thacher   Bartlett LLP s M A practice 
Despite the boom in dealmaking over the last few years  global M A volumes are below their long term average when viewed against the value of equity markets or global economic growth  Some deal advisers cite this to argue M A volumes are not close to reaching a ceiling 
 In real terms  we have a good but not great level of M A activity  with the potential for upside   said  Citigroup  Inc  N C  global co head of M A Cary Kochman ",2019-12-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/dealmakers-eye-crossborder-ma-recovery-as-mega-mergers-roll-on-2050427,2050427

104210,325725,AGN,Allergan  AGN  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Allergan  NYSE AGN  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This Botox maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 61 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 5  
Revenues are expected to be  4 07 billion  down 0 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8 33  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Allergan 
For Allergan  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 04  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Allergan will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Allergan would post earnings of  4 25 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 25  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Allergan doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allergan-agn-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200502329,200502329
104211,325726,AGN,Merck s Dificid Gets FDA Approval In Pediatric Indication ,opinion,"Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   announced that the FDA has granted approval to its new drug application   NDA   and a supplemental NDA  sNDA  for its antibacterial medicine Dificid  fidaxomicin   The NDA sought approval for an oral suspension formulation of Dificid  which is presently available in tablet form  The sNDA aimed at approval for Dificid tablets to treat Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea   CDAD   in children aged six months and above 
The approval for Dificid tablets and oral suspension was based on data from the phase III SUNSHINE study 
Shares of Merck have increased 17 6  in the past year compared with the  s rally of 14 9  

 
The SUNSHINE study evaluated Dificid in patients aged six months to less than 18 years in comparison to antibiotic  vancomycin  Data from the SUNSHINE study showed that while CDAD clinical response was similar for both drugs  sustained clinical response was higher for patients receiving Dificid 
The company stated that there are almost 500 000 infections caused by Clostridioides difficile every year in the United States  This bacterial infection is also estimated to cause approximately 29 000 deaths within 30 days of initial diagnosis  These numbers suggest that the drug has significant potential in the targeted indication 
Merck has many pipeline candidates in advanced stages of development  targeting multiple disease areas such as oncology  cardiovascular diseases  diabetes  infectious diseases  neurosciences  respiratory and immunology diseases  and vaccines  Some of the important pipeline candidates include selumetinib  which is under review in the United States for pediatric neurofibromatosis type 1  MK 6482 in mid stage study for renal cell carcinoma  V114  15 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine  and chronic heart failure candidate  vericiguat in late stage studies Merck   Co   Inc  Price

 These practices should receive careful attention as part of the Commission s investigation into the effects of this proposed merger and if an adequate remedy can not be found  the Commission should challenge this acquisition   the group said in their letter ",2019-09-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/consumer-groups-unions-urge-caution-on-63-billion-abbvie-deal-for-allergan-1977128,1977128

The U S  healthcare industry has seen a string of multi billion dollar deals and consolidation is expected to remain a major theme for the rest of the year 
Bristol Myers Squibb s  N BMY   74 billion buyout of  Celgene Corp   O CELG  and AbbVie Inc s  N ABBV   63 billion bid for troubled smaller rival Allergan Plc  N AGN  were among the largest deals announced this year 
The deals proposed by AbbVie and Bristol Myers raise significant antitrust issues  the senators wrote  calling on the FTC to  take appropriate action  to protect consumers from mergers that may threaten competition  raise drug prices or reduce patient access to essential medications 
They also raised concerns that the deals may reduce innovation in drug development and give the merged companies increased negotiating leverage to secure positions on drug formularies and greater ability to condition buyers  access to their multi billion dollar drugs 
 This industry consolidation is occurring against a backdrop of ever rising prescription drug spending    It is more important than ever that the FTC take appropriate action to protect consumers   Klobuchar wrote in the letter signed by senators Bernie Sanders  Kamala Harris  Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker among others ",2019-09-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-senators-urge-ftc-to-scrutinize-multibillion-dollar-pharma-mergers-1980129,1980129

AbbVie and Allergan said they still expect the deal to close in early 2020  and were cooperating with the antitrust regulator 
The scrutiny into the deal  which combines two of the world s biggest pharmaceutical companies  follows a request by a dozen advocacy groups and unions to the FTC to block the purchase 
In a letter seen by Reuters  the groups noted that the deal would create the fourth largest pharmaceutical company at a time when rising drug prices have become a hot political issue

104247,325762,AGN,5 Reasons Why Ironwood Stock Should Be In Your Portfolio,opinion,"Cambridge  MA based Ironwood Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ IRWD   is focused on the development and commercialization of treatments primarily addressing gastrointestinal   GI   diseases  The company has one marketed product   Linzess   in its portfolio that has been approved for treating irritable bowel syndrome with constipation  IBS C  or chronic idiopathic constipation   CIC   Here we provide five reasons why adding Ironwood s stock to a portfolio can be beneficial in 2020 Strong Quarterly Results  Ironwood has delivered strong year over year growth in earnings and sales in the first nine months of 2019  The company reported adjusted earnings of 25 cents per share during the said period against adjusted loss of 74 cents in the year ago period  Moreover  earnings have surpassed estimates in the past two quarters  Notably  the company generated profits for the first time in the second quarter  following the separation of its Soluble Guanylate Cyclase  sGC  pipeline in April  The company reported positive operating cash flow in the third quarter The company derives majority of its revenues from the sales of Linzess in the United States  The drug generated net sales of  572 million in the United States  up 2 9  year over year in the first nine months of 2019  Ironwood and Allergan equally share Linzess  brand collaboration profits or losses  Ironwood s share of net profits from sales of Linzess in the United States  included in collaborative revenues  was  223 8 million in the third quarter  up approximately 22 5  year over year Moreover  Linzess  prospects look encouraging owing to strong demand trends and the drug s expansion to new patient population and geographies  Ironwood expects annual sales of Linzess to cross  1 billion by the end of 2020 Rising Estimates  Ironwood s earnings estimates for 2020 have increased 30  in the past 60 days  In fact  the company has reported impressive earnings performance and exceeded expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  Ironwood recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 135 01  Favorable Share Price Movement  Strong performance of Linzess has enabled Ironwood to outperform the   Shares of the company have rallied 34 7  in the past year compared with the industry s growth of 14 5  Label Expansion Efforts for Linzess  Ironwood and Allergan are looking to expand Linzess  label to include new indications and populations as well as develop the drug as a non opioid  pain relieving agent for IBS patients  In June  Ironwood and Allergan announced positive top line data from the phase IIIb study on Linzess for treating multiple abdominal symptoms in adult patients with IBS C  The company will file a supplemental new drug application to expand the drug s label to include the indication soon  It is also striving to expand the drug s label to include pediatric patients with IBS C Ironwood is also developing a delayed release formulation of Linzess  MD 7246  in a mid stage study to treat abdominal pain associated with IBS with diarrhea  The company is also developing an interesting candidate called IW 3718  It is currently enrolling patients in two identical phase III studies  evaluating IW 3718 for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease  Results from the studies are expected in the second half of 2020  Positive data will be a boost for the company s share price Global Collaborations and Partnerships  Ironwood co develops and co commercializes Linzess in the United States and Europe with Botox maker Allergan   NYSE AGN    The company has a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN   for development and commercialization of Linzess in China  It also has a deal with Astellas for the development of the drug in Japan These deals enable the company to reduce development costs for the drug and also provide support for better commercialization of Linzess as the partners have strong presence in their respective territories ConclusionStrong demand for Ironwood s Linzess has driven the top line consistently in the past few quarters  The strong performance is expected to continue in 2020  With the separation of its sGC pipeline  operating expenses are likely to decline as well However  the company is over dependent on Linzess for its growth  Any negative news related to Linzess will affect the company and its growth prospects  The company s pipeline candidates are also in mid  to late stage development  It is unlikely that any of these candidates will be commercialized in 2020  Linzess also faces competition from Bausch Health s   NYSE BHC   Trulance as well as Takeda s Amitiza and Motegrity among others  Several biotechs are focused on developing novel therapies targeting IBS  In September  Ardelyx s Ibsrela was approved by the FDA for treating IBS C patients  The rising competition can pose threat to Linzess  dominance

104287,325802,AGN,Gilead to Boost Stake in Galapagos as Part of  5 1 Billion Deal,news," Bloomberg      Gilead Sciences Inc   NASDAQ GILD   agreed to pay  5 1 billion to raise its stake in biotechnology company Galapagos NV to deepen its research into inflammatory diseases and other disorder  sending the Belgian drugmaker s stock to an all time high 
The deal is the largest Gilead has executed since new Chief Executive Officer Dan O Day took the reins in March as he attempts to bolster the San Francisco giant s drug pipeline  Gilead is in danger of becoming a victim of its own success after launching some of the top drugs of all time  its bestselling hepatitis C franchise  Sales from those therapies have since declined due to increased competition 
Under the agreement  Gilead  which will pay  3 95 billion upfront to Mechelen  Belgium based Galapagos and invest  1 1 billion to raise its stake to 22  from 12 3   the companies said in a statement  The investment  at 140 59 euros a share  is 9 7  higher than the Belgian company s closing price on Friday  Galapagos shares surged as much as 17  on Monday  reaching 149 55 euros a share 
 Gilead will significantly expand its pipeline in a smart and financially savvy expanded partnership deal with Galapagos  essentially gaining options on everything in their pipeline without having to acquire the company full out   Jefferies analysts including Michael J  Yee and Andrew Tsai wrote in a note 
As Gilead seeks to fill the growing hole left from its hepatitis drugs  the Galapagos announcement may signal a shift in focus  The smaller biotech has no oncology programs and instead focuses on research into diseases that have to do with inflammation and fibrosis  which is a kind of internal scarring 
Gilead has also had research programs in such diseases  including through its collaboration with Galapagos  though some had speculated it may stake its future on cancer  Gilead is already the biggest shareholder of the Belgium company before the increase in stake  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  Now it gets the option to license all of Galapogos s future  late stage drug candidates 
Gilead CEO
O Day  who joined Gilead from cancer giant Roche AG  said he s not done making good on his promise to expand the pipeline  He noted the deal almost doubles Gilead s research capacity and establishes a strong research base in Europe where the company has historically not been as active 
 In no way is this the only thing that we re looking at or the only thing that we re going to do   O Day said in an interview   You can look at this like it s the beginning  
Gilead and Galapagos held talks about an expanded partnership prior to O Day joining the company  He was briefed on those discussions after taking the top job and within the first couple of weeks  got to know the CEO of Galapagos better  Following those talks  the pair decided to being finalizing the agreement 
Jobs in Europe
This is a  science driven deal   Onno van de Stolpe  founder and chief executive officer of Galapagos  said in an interview  Gilead will be taking on more of the commercial side for Galapagos  helping the smaller company to focus on research   We can now do more of what we re good at  
The money being invested beyond the equity stake will be used largely to double Galapagos s R D staff to 1 000 from 500 over an unspecified time  Van de Stolpe said  Those jobs will be added in Belgium  the Netherlands and France   It s massive funding    we don t have a detailed plan yet on how to spend it   he said 
The pact includes a provision in which Gilead s stake could rise to 29 9   if Galapagos shareholders approve two warrants  The companies were already partners on an experimental drug for rheumatoid arthritis  That drug  filgotinib  hit its main goal in a late stage study in March  triggering the Belgian biotech company s shares to surge by the most in six months 
Galapagos shares have risen 59  since the start of the year  compared with the 5 9  gain in Gilead s stock 
O Day had a reputation as a dealmaker while at Roche  likely one of the reasons he was selected for Gilead s top job at a time when the company needs to look externally to drive growth  He said that in this case  the companies opted for a partnership style deal rather than a full takeover because full mergers can often destroy innovation as research and executive teams disband  Roche s deal philosophy is much the same with the Swiss giant opting to leave many its units independently managed  even if it owns them in full

104290,325805,AGN,Roche Spark Deal s Mystery Delay Makes Investors Jittery,news," Bloomberg     Delays from the Federal Trade Commission and concerns about the timing of Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG s planned  4 8 billion deal to buy small cap drug developer Spark Therapeutics Inc  are stoking concerns across Wall Street as investors question what the agency is hung up on 
Some in the investment community argue that thanks to a more nit picky FTC  a deal that should have been cleared with flying colors continues to be clouded with questions  Many on the Street guess that the holdup is tied to competitive concerns for Roche s blockbuster Hemlibra  a medicine for the clotting disorder hemophilia  and a gene therapy for the disease in development from Spark 
However  the FTC s closed door meetings and the secrecy about its reasoning have left investors in the dark  That s prompted jitters among investors  from those that specialize in risk arbitrage to the sell side analysts that closely follow the space 
 Those of us in the public markets don t have much of a clear view  on why the deal is held up   and that creates a lot of potential execution risk for anyone else looking to make a move and vertically consolidate with a gene therapy or gene editing player to add their own disruptor   SVB Leerink analyst Mani Foroohar said in an interview 
Betsy Lordan  a spokeswoman for the FTC  said the agency can t confirm or comment on potential investigations  Roche has repeatedly declined to comment on the source of the holdup  Chief Executive Officer Severin Schwan wouldn t elaborate either at a meeting last week  but said he s  very confident  that the transaction will close by the end of the year  Swiss financial markets were closed on Thursday  and the company again declined to comment ahead of an FTC meeting in Washington 
Bolt on bottle neck 
A slowdown in smaller deals or the FTC halting the Spark Roche tie up would whipsaw some biopharma high fliers that many on the Street see as logical bolt ons for larger companies looking to replenish their pipelines  A number of the year s top performing biotechnology companies  such as gene therapy focused drugmaker uniQure NV  have seen shares appreciate on drug expectations paired with speculation that they may be the next shoe to drop in the sector s spending spree 
Deals are seen as the lifeblood of biotech and drug development  with smaller companies that lack the infrastructure to bring drugs to market frequently opting to sell to those who can 
Some on Wall Street have questioned how deals for a company like uniQure would be affected by the FTC s more hands on approach  which may have implications for companies looking to double down in a specific disease area 
 For anyone trying to make that deal there s a paralyzing effect   Foroohar said   What would ve been seen as a low execution risk  low regulatory risk  straightforward deal is suddenly something caught up for a year and a half  and you have to look at divesting  the drug which drove the deal in the first place  he said 
Increased scrutiny
Six of the nine deal specialists Bloomberg News surveyed said they are concerned the FTC has shifted its approach  as evidenced by the Roche delays  The same proportion agreed that the stumbles for Roche and Spark may have a chilling effect on innovative deals within the space until more is understood 
The majority of concerned investors said an earlier stage deal like Roche s planned purchase of Spark should not warrant the level of scrutiny it s facing  Some analysts forecast sales of Roche s Hemlibra may near  4 9 billion annually by 2028  more than the current offer for the entirety of Spark 
 When one of the largest companies in the world is buying a minnow  and it s being held back   that s very concerning   Brad Loncar  chief executive officer of Loncar Investments  said in a phone interview   You have to start wondering if this scrutiny will slow down or prohibit these kinds of deals  which would be a huge deal for the sector  
While Roche s planned purchase of Spark has garnered the majority of headlines triggering nervousness for those betting on deals  it isn t a one off  Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  Co  has agreed to divest one of  Celgene Corp   NASDAQ CELG   s best selling drugs to placate regulators in hope of closing their planned  74 billion deal 
Bristol Myers s plans to sell off the psoriasis pill  Otezla   was a very big surprise   according to SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges  He called the FTC actions  very strange   adding that investors in  AbbVie Inc   NYSE ABBV   and Allergan  NYSE AGN  Plc are now focused on the future of AbbVie s psoriasis treatment  Skyrizi 
Biopharma mergers aren t the only deals within health care that have drawn regulatory concern  Illumina Inc  NASDAQ ILMN   s proposed purchase of Pacific Biosciences of California Inc  has been held up by both U S  and U K  agencies  while the deal s spread remained near its widest since the announcement 
The next event on the FTC s calendar is an Aug  1 meeting in Washington  The group voted 5 0 to keep the meeting closed  further adding mystery to who will be in attendance and what the topic will be 
 Adds Roche declining to comment in fifth paragraph  ",2019-08-01,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/rochespark-deals-mystery-delay-makes-investors-jittery-1942034,1942034
104291,325806,AGN,Who is next in big pharma s merger spree ,news," Reuters    Consolidation in the U S  healthcare industry  which has already witnessed a string of multi billion dollar deals  is expected to remain a major theme for the rest of 2019 
Bristol Myers Squibb s  74 billion acquisition of Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  set the M A ball rolling in January  and was followed by AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  Inc s  63 billion bid for troubled smaller rival Allergan  NYSE AGN  Plc 
Regulators are pressuring companies to cut drug costs and takeovers have become the preferred method of combating looming patent expiries on some of the top selling medicines they have relied upon in recent years 
Following is a list of big healthcare companies and their recent deals and possible future acquisitions 
BIOGEN INC 
   Since the halt in its development of a promising Alzheimer s therapy wiped  18 billion off Biogen s stock in March  Wall Street has been calling on the company to beef up its drug development pipeline through acquisitions 
   Possible deals would give the company access to drugs for lucrative therapeutic areas such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and depression 
   Recent deal was the  877 million buyout of gene therapy developer Nightstar Therapeutics  and as of June 30 the company still had cash reserves of almost  2 billion 
ELI LILLY AND CO  
   Lilly spun off its animal health unit earlier this year  and has reiterated its commitment to making bolt on acquisitions to diversify its portfolio  as its long term top sellers Humalog and Cialis face intensifying competition 
   Company has also been focusing on cancer drug development and its  8 billion buyout of Loxo Oncology helped it delve deeper into the lucrative business 
   The company reported  2 29 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30 
PFIZER INC 
   The world s largest drugmaker has repeatedly said it would steer clear of large scale M A  citing confidence in its own drug pipeline  But in April it said it would look at bolt on deals worth  a few  billion dollars to complement its pipeline
   The spin off and merger of its consumer healthcare unit with GlaxoSmithKline Plc  as well as its off patent branded drugs business has simplified the company s business structure 
   Analysts say that may still leave room for smaller deals like its  10 6 billion buy of Array Biopharma  which boosted its arsenal of oncology drugs and set the stage for the company to become a leader in colon cancer treatments 
   Shares of the company are down 20 6  so far this year 
AMGEN INC  
   A recent U S  court ruling win on Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  patents for rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel is seen as having left the company free to pursue business development plans  including M A 
   The drugmaker said previously it would look for both big and small deals to push deeper into areas like cancer and metabolic disorders  where it already has a firm footing 
   Analysts have also suggested buying Celgene Corp s psoriasis drug Otezla  which Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  Co is looking to sell in order to allay antitrust concerns 
   Amgen had  5 53 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30  Shares of the company are up nearly 5  this year 
MERCK   CO INC 
   Investors have raised concerns about Merck s increasing dependence on blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda  highlighting the need for the drugmaker to engage in M A 
   The company has said it would focus on bolt on deals rather than a large  transformative acquisition 
   War chest stood at  6 7 billion in cash and cash equivalents  as of June 30 with shares up nearly 11 3  this year 
GILDEAD SCIENCES INC  
   CEO Daniel O Day has raised expectations for consolidation since taking the helm in March  prioritizing pipeline diversification and announcing a  5 1 billion investment in Belgo Dutch biotech Galapagos NV  which pushed deeper into areas such as fibrosis and arthritis 
   California based Gilead  NASDAQ GILD  had cash and cash equivalents of  11 24 billion as of June 30  Shares up about 1  this year

The Dividend Aristocrats have outperformed the broader market for the past decade  In the past 10 years through November 29th  the Dividend Aristocrats generated total returns of 13 8  per   compared with 12 7  annual returns for the S P 500 Index 
The Dividend Aristocrats also provide higher levels of investment income  which is particularly important for investors in or nearing retirement  The following 3 Dividend Aristocrats each have long histories of dividend growth  plus current dividend yields of at least 4   And  these 3 stocks are highly likely to continue raising their dividends for many years to come 
Dividend Aristocrat  1  AT T Inc   T 
AT T  NYSE T  is a giant telecommunications company with a market capitalization above  280 billion  AT T is a large telecommunications company with over 100 million customers in the U S   as well as a significant presence in Latin America  The company provides a wide range of telecom services  including wireless  broadband  and television through its cable operations and its DIRECTV satellite business 
AT T generates more than  180 billion in annual revenue  It has increased its dividend for 36 consecutive years  including a recent 2  increase on December 13th  AT T s primary competitive advantage is its scale  The U S  telecom industry is dominated by AT T and rival telecom Verizon  NYSE VZ  
In addition  AT T has highly valuable media properties  the result of its  81 billion acquisition of Time Warner  While AT T s telecom businesses provide the company with strong cash flow and steady growth  its content assets will help drive its future growth  AT T now owns multiple media brands  including TNT  TBS  CNN  and HBO  as well as the Warner Brothers movie studio and sports rights across the NFL  NBA  MLB  and NCAA 
AT T reported solid third quarter financial   Revenue came in 3  lower year over year but higher profit margins resulted in 4  growth in adjusted earnings per share  The company also said it expects 2022 adjusted earnings per share in the range of  4 50 to  4 80  which at the midpoint would represent roughly 10  annual growth  It also expects revenue to climb between 1  and 2  each year  We expect 4  annual EPS growth for AT T over the next five years  AT T is a cash machine  The company expects free cash flow of  30 billion to  32 billion by 2022  This will allow it to steadily pay down debt and continue to reward shareholders with high dividend payouts 
AT T is an undervalued dividend stock  with a price to earnings ratio of just 10 5  In addition to earnings growth and the 5 4  current dividend yield  we view AT T as a blue chip dividend stock 

Dividend Aristocrat  2  AbbVie Inc 
AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  is a pharmaceutical company that was spun off by  Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT  in 2013  AbbVie currently has a market capitalization of  133 billion  AbbVie has generated strong growth in recent years  but investors are concerned that growth could slow down moving forward  Its flagship product Humira which by itself represents approximately 60  of AbbVie s total revenue has lost patent exclusivity in Europe  Complicating matters further is that AbbVie will lose patent exclusivity for Humira starting in 2023 

Fortunately  the company has a well stocked pipeline to help replace any declines in Humira sales  For example  in the most recent  AbbVie generated 3 5  revenue growth  New products like Imbruvica led the way with 29  sales growth  Overall  AbbVie reported 9  adjusted earnings per share growth  a very satisfactory result 

Along with its quarterly results  the company raised its full year guidance  AbbVie  now expects 2019 adjusted EPS in a range of  8 90 to  8 92  up from  8 82 to  8 92 previously  The new guidance range represents full year adjusted EPS growth of 12  to 13   at the midpoint  In addition  AbbVie raised its quarterly dividend by 10  

AbbVie has multiple organic growth opportunities to replace Humira declines  In addition  acquisitions are a major catalyst for AbbVie  it recently acquired Allergan  NYSE AGN  for  63 billion  This acquisition will meaningfully boost AbbVie s growth  and further diversify its product portfolio  The combined company will have annual revenues of nearly  50 billion  AbbVie expects the transaction to be 10  accretive to adjusted EPS over the first full year following the close of the transaction  with peak accretion of greater than 20  

Based on expected 2019 earnings per share of   8 91  AbbVie stock trades for a price to earnings ratio of just 10 1  We view AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  as significantly undervalued  considering its growth potential  The stock has a high current dividend yield of 5 2   making it an attractive dividend stock for value and income 
Dividend Aristocrat  3  People s United Financial  PBCT 
People s United Financial  NASDAQ PBCT  is one of the lesser known Dividend Aristocrats  With a market capitalization of just  7 4 billion  it flies under the radar relative to the many large cap stocks on the list of Dividend Aristocrats  But People s United Financial has a strong business model  as a leading regional bank and financial services company 
It provides various services including real estate and mortgage lending  equipment financing  consumer loans  life insurance  brokerage services  wealth management  and traditional banking  The company has a network of 400  branches  with total assets of  52 billion 
People s United Financial reported strong results last quarter  While net interest margin remained flat year over year  due to falling interest rates throughout 2019  operating earnings per share increased 3   The company grew non interest income rose 15  for the quarter 
Continued growth is likely for this Dividend Aristocrat  due to its recent  759 million  of United Financial Bancorp  This acquisition will enhance the presence of the company in central Connecticut and western Massachusetts Earlier in 2019 it also acquired VAR Technology Finance  which focuses on serving the technological sector  and BSB Bancorp  The company should be able to continue growing earnings per share at a mid single digit pace going forward  as it will benefit from stable growth of the U S  economy 
People s United is a rare stock  as it is the only bank stock on the list of Dividend Aristocrats  It has maintained steady dividend growth  even during recessions  which are typically very damaging to banks  For example  from 2007 2010  earnings per share declined 54  as the Great Recession took its toll  With that said  it remained profitable throughout  and continued to increase its dividend through the Great Recession 
We believe the dividend remains secure  with room for continued growth  The company is expected to maintain a dividend payout ratio of 52  for 2019  which indicates a sustainable distribution And  the stock is valued at just 13 times this year s earnings per share  People s United stock is trading for a reasonable valuation  along with a high dividend yield of 4 2  ",2019-12-18,Bob Ciura,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-top-dividend-aristocrats-to-buy-for-the-long-term-200493307,200493307

104333,325848,AGN,Stocks   Dow Falls Triple Digits Amid U S  China Trade Standoff,news,"Investing com   Wall Street traded lower on Tuesday  with the Dow falling by over a hundred points for the second straight day  as markets worried that neither the U S  nor China would back down in order to reach an agreement in their current trade dispute 
The Dow Jones fell 190 points  or 1 5   at 26 248 66 points by 9 38 AM ET  13 38 GMT   the S P 500 lost 23 points  or 0 8   to 2 909 90 points  while the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite traded down 65 points  or 0 8   at 8 057 83 points 
 The Chinese public wants an agreement  but meanwhile is well prepared for other potential outcomes  including a temporary breakdown in talks   said an editorial in the Global Times  an English language publication that regularly serves as a mouthpiece for official Chinese foreign policy 
The comments came after U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer confirmed that the U S  will raise tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10  to 25  as of Friday  a step that sharply escalates the trade dispute between the two countries after months of talks that appeared to be making progress in avoiding such an outcome 
Many analysts commented that both sides may only be posturing ahead of the high level trade talks between Lighthizer  U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday 
But the determination of both sides not to  flinch first  has markets concerned that the increased tariffs will come into force 
 It s imperative that trade tensions are resolved in a way satisfying for everyone because clearly tensions between the United States and China are the threat to the global economy   Reuters quoted International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde as saying in Paris on the sidelines of a meeting with the French government 
Markets want trade  results   Investing com analyst Pinchas Cohen said 
Cohen warned of further volatility ahead  noting that   CBOE contracts speculating on market volatility spiked to levels not seen since late January  closing at the highest levels since late March

104337,325852,AGN,NASH Scorecard Year To Date  The Winners And The Losers,opinion,The promising but challenging indication of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  hit headlines following two major developments Firstly  the frontrunner in the NASH space  Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ICPT    broke positive news at the start of this week  The company recently announced that the FDA accepted its New Drug Application  NDA  for obeticholic acid  OCA  seeking accelerated approval for the treatment of fibrosis due to NASH  The regulatory agency also granted Priority Review to the same  The authority assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  target action date of Mar 26  2020 for the NDA  It indicated to hold an advisory committee meeting for discussing the application  However  the conference date is yet to be finalized and the timeline for the NDA review is subject to change A potential approval of OCA for NASH will significantly boost Intercept s prospects  given the market opportunity for patients with fibrosis due to NASH Concurrently  CymaBay Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ CBAY   announced the termination of mid stage study of seladelpar for NASH  The company stopped its phase IIb study of seladelpar in patients with NASH and its recently initiated phase II study of the drug in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis  PSC   Moreover  it is putting a hold on all studies of seladelpar in patients with primary biliary cholangitis  PBC   The decision to discontinue these studies was based on initial histological findings observed in the phase IIb study of seladelpar for NASH after data showed some patients experiencing liver damage  These planned  blinded  histological assessments of the first tranche of liver biopsies in the study demonstrated atypical histological outcomes including histology characterized as an interface hepatitis presentation  with or without biliary injury In June 2019  Conatus   NASDAQ CNAT   announced that top line results from its ENCORE LF clinical study of emricasan failed to meet its primary endpoint  Consequently  Conatus and partner Novartis mutually agreed to cease the collaboration agreement for the global development and commercialization of emricasan As a result  the spotlight is back on this space  The market for NASH holds promises and is expected to be tapped by most pharma biotech bigwigs in the near future  It is poised to witness rapid growth unlike other lucrative yet saturated markets like cancer More on NASHA chronic liver disease  NASH is caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver or steatosis  Per statistics  it affected up to 15 million people in the United States causing inflammation  hepatocellular injury  progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis  The ailment is anticipated to be the leading reason for liver transplantation by 2020  Currently  NASH is the primary reason for liver transplants in people under 50 across the United States  Such patients also suffer obesity and type II diabetes  With no treatments presently approved to address this disease  the market scope is substantially huge and many companies are investing a major chunk of their R D budget in the same Pharma Players With an Edge in NASHThe latest news from industry players in the NASH area underscores the complexity of treatments being developed  The winner so far in the race seems to be Intercept Pharmaceuticals  courtesy of the aforementioned news Let us take a look at some other players with promising candidates for the indication France based Genfit s lead candidate elafibranor  which is in late stage studies  also buoys hope in this regard  The phase III study RESOLVE IT is evaluating the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 120 mg versus placebo in patients with NASH and fibrosis  Most recently  the Data Safety Monitoring Board  DSMB  issued a positive recommendation for the continuation of the study evaluating elafibranor for NASH without any modifications  The 42 month DSMB safety review supports Genfit s continuation of the RESOLVE IT study  This DSMB sanction marks the seventh review with no safety signals that would justify modification or shelving of the study including review of safety data from patients enrolled in the study  who have received elafibranor for three years   An NDA is expected to be filed by 2020 end Allergan plc   NYSE AGN   too has an interesting candidate in its pipeline  cenicriviroc  for the treatment of NASH  The 2016 Tobira acquisition added the candidate to its profile  The candidate is being evaluated in a phase III study  AURORA Clinical stage biopharmaceutical company Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd    NASDAQ GLMD   is firmly eyeing the development of Aramchol  a liver targeted  oral SCD1 modulator  The company recently began a phase III IV ARMOR  a double blind  placebo controlled  global study  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aramchol in patients with NASH and fibrosis  The company targets to complete enrollment by the second quarter of 2021 and report top line results by the fourth quarter of 2022  Galmed currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  You can see  Madrigal

directed  thyroid hormone receptor  THR    selective agonist  for NASH  Earlier in the year  the company commenced a phase III study on MGL 3196 for NASH Bottom LineGiven the fact that NASH has a

104338,325853,AGN,Market Serves Up More Records For Thanksgiving ,opinion,"This impressive holiday week continued on Thanksgiving eve as each of the major indices enjoyed new all time highs  just as they did yesterday and the day before 
	The NASDAQ jumped 0 66   or about 57 points  to 8705 17  while the S P rose 0 42  to 3153 63  The Dow started the session in negative territory but eventually finished higher by 0 15   or around 42 points  to 28 164 
	This marks the fourth straight day of gains for the indices and the third consecutive session with each of them reaching new highs 
	That s quite a difference from last year  You ve probably blocked it out of your mind  but Thanksgiving week 2018 started with back to back selloffs  The Dow lost nearly 1 000 points on Monday and Tuesday and we were in the midst of a  tech wreck  
	The Wednesday before the holiday last year was mostly positive  but the indices nearly squandered a morning rally  And this all came after a horrible month of October 
	Now here in 2019  the market is about to put together its third straight month in the green   With Thanksgiving so late this year  Friday will be it for November   And its also enjoying record highs 
	And you know what the funniest thing is  We re STILL waiting for some real progress on the trade front  Just as we were last year 
	In fact  optimism over signing a Phase 1 trade deal is probably the biggest reason why we re enjoying such a rollicking start to the holiday season 
	It s been the best of both worlds recently  with the market running higher on positive trade headlines while taking the negative ones in stride without any major selloffs  Fortunately  the recent headlines have been encouraging ones with both sides boasting of progress being made 
	Along with hopes for a trade deal  we also enjoyed some positive economic data on Wednesday  Most importantly was that GDP for the third quarter was revised upward to 2 1   compared to the previous reading of 1 9    
	Investors don t need a holiday to be thankful for the market of late  It should be easy to appreciate just how good things are right now  especially when compared to 2018 
	What they DO need  however  is a strong holiday shopping season and a trade deal

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Booking  NASDAQ BKNG  Holdings  BKNG   Allergan  NYSE AGN   AGN  and Honda Motor Co   HMC   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Booking Holdings  shares have underperformed the Zacks Internet Commerce industry year to date  10 1  vs  20 4    The Zacks analyst believes that a secular growth trend in the online travel booking market and growing mobile usage penetration are tailwinds 
Booking Holdings reported third quarter results  wherein both earnings and revenues have grown year over year on the back of improving gross bookings  Moreover  solid growth in the booked room nights and strong momentum across global accommodation space contributed well  Also  strong efforts toward ramping up of merchant business drove the top line growth further 
Moreover  the company s strong position in international markets and growth opportunities in the domestic market are major positives  However  continued softness in agency business of the company remains a headwind  Further  macro headwinds and increasing advertising spend are concerns 
 You can  
Shares of Allergan have gained 34 5  in the past six months against Zacks Generic Drugs industry s rise of 4 7   The Zacks analyst believes that Allergan s key products like Botox and new products such as Viberzi and Vraylar support sales 
Allergan also continues to deliver on its R D pipeline with some major product launches expected over the next couple of years  Biosimilars also represent significant opportunity  The acquisition by AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  could prove to be rewarding for Allergan s shareholders  Allergan s stock has outperformed the industry this year so far  
However  in 2019  sales are being hurt by loss of exclusivity of key drugs  product recalls  pricing pressure and currency headwinds  Its blockbuster eye drug  Restasis  is also expected to face generic competition this year  Meanwhile  new competition for key growth drivers  Botox  Restasis and Linzess  is a concern 
 You can  
Honda Motor s shares have gained 23 1  over the past three months against the Zacks Foreign Automotive industry s rise of 15 3   The Zacks analyst believes that focus on the development of EVs and self driving cars bodes well for the company  given the changing circumstances in the automobile industry 
The firm s frequent collaborations with companies like General Motors  NYSE GM  and Hitachi  among others  are expected to expand business and bolster prospects  Its healthy balance sheet  improving cash flows and investor friendly moves are other positives 
However  in anticipation of a slowdown in India and North America  along with a stronger yen  the company has narrowed sales and profit forecast for fiscal 2020  Further  high capex to develop advanced technologies may also limit its cash flows  Frequent recalls also remain a concern  As such  investors are recommended to wait for a better entry point

Bristol Myers Merck  Novartis  Pfizer   NYSE PFE    AstraZeneca  AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   beat estimates for both earnings and sales  Lilly and Sanofi  PA SASY  beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings but missed the same for sales  Allergan  NYSE AGN  met estimates for earnings while beating the same for sales Overall  new drugs and label expansions of blockbuster drugs drove the top line of most of the big shots backed by higher demand  which countered headwinds from generic biosimilar competition for older medicines  However  greater pricing pressure in the United States increased competition and negative currency impacts hurt the top line  Importantly  the better than expected results coupled with an optimistic outlook for the fourth quarter led most of the companies to raise financial guidance for the year  buoying investor optimism The Zacks industry  comprising some of the biggest drugmakers in the world  has risen 4 7  since Oct 15  after J J reported its earnings results   the first for the big pharma sector  Please note that the sector was down 0 8  from Jan 1 till Oct 14  This clearly indicates how the solid third quarter performance gave an impetus to stocks in this industry Moreover  the industry belongs in the top 30  of the 254 Zacks ranked industries and there are many stocks in the industry  which can boost investors  portfolio The sector faces headwinds like government scrutiny of high drug prices  pricing and competitive pressure  generic competition for blockbuster treatments  slowdown in sales of some of the most high profile older drugs and most importantly  major pipeline setbacks Nonetheless  we believe increase in product sales backed by rising demand  pipeline success  frequent FDA approvals  35 new drugs approved so far in 2019   cost cutting  share buybacks  product launches  higher M A and collaboration activity and appropriate utilization of cash will boost the sector In this scenario  investing in stocks with a

have risen 5 1  and 1 9   respectively over the past 60 days A significant part of Merck s outperformance this year so far has been driven by its PD 1 inhibitor  Keytruda  and positive regulatory updates related to it  Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally  The drug generated sales of almost  8 billion in the first nine months of 2019  reflecting a massive 63  surge year over year The Keytruda development program is also progressing well with Merck spending billions for research and development of this medicine to secure more approvals in earlier lines of treatment  Undoubtedly  Keytruda has strong growth prospects based on increased utilization  approval for new indications and expectation of additional approvals worldwide  In addition  Merck s other new products  Lynparza  and Bridion are contributing meaningfully to its top line The company has also been on a strong footing in terms of collaborations and M A

with its late stage pipeline  The company has had major positive data read outs on multiple new medicines in HIV  oncology  immuno inflammation and respiratory in 2019  Glaxo has also made significant progress in its oncology pipeline recently and now has 16 assets in development  up from 8 as of July 2018  Meanwhile  Glaxo now has a number of molecules with diverse mechanisms of action  offering an opportunity for many innovative cancer combinations The company has its share of challenges in the form of stiff competition  genericization and pricing pressure on key drugs in the Pharma segment

What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on August 6  2019  Allergan reported EPS of  4 38 versus consensus estimate of  4 34 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3 89  
For the current fiscal year  Allergan is expected to post earnings of  16 7 per share on  15 56 billion in revenues  This represents a 0 06  change in EPS on a  1 45  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  16 85 per share on  15 83 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 0 88  and 1 76   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Allergan may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Allergan has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 10 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 4 8X versus its peer group s average of 4 7X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 11  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective

Allergan shares have added about 33 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 22 8  
What s Next for Allergan 
While Allergan has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Allergan was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

companies whose opioid based drugs were responsible for fueling nationwide opioid epidemic  In May  Teva agreed to pay  85 million to the state of Oklahoma s in this regard  Last month  it settled with two counties of Ohio  Cuyahoga and Summit  thereby resolving the counties  opioid claims  which removed Teva from the Track 1 opioid litigation Importantly  Teva has entered into a proposed nationwide settlement with attorneys general of the four states  which requires it to supply  23 billion worth of generic Suboxone and pay  250 million in cash over 10 years  On the third quarter

104473,325988,AGN,Bristol Myers to buy Celgene for  74 billion in largest biopharma deal,news,"By Michael Erman and Ankur Banerjee  Reuters    Bristol Myers Squibb Co  N BMY  said on Thursday it would buy  Celgene Corp   O CELG  for about  74 billion  combining two of the world s largest cancer drug businesses in the biggest pharmaceutical deal ever  Both Bristol Myers and Celgene face separate challenges  and some Wall Street analysts questioned whether the combination   which the companies said would create  2 5 billion in cost savings and significantly raise earnings   would solve them  Amid clinical setbacks and other missteps  Bristol Myers shares fell 15 2 percent in 2018 while Celgene plunged nearly 40 percent last year   Bristol s most important cancer immunotherapy and growth driver  Opdivo  has lost much of its luster as Merck   Co s  N MRK  rival drug Keytruda seized dominance in advanced lung cancer  the most lucrative oncology market  Meanwhile  Celgene has endured high profile clinical failures and U S  exclusivity on its flagship multiple myeloma drug  Revlimid  will start being phased out in 2022  On Thursday  Bristol s stock ended another 13 3 percent lower at  45 12   Doing this transaction clearly indicates that risk to Opdivo in lung cancer is obviously a concern   SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said in an interview  There is also shareholder concern that drugs in development would not have enough sales to offset major products losing exclusivity between 2022 and 2026  But cash flow from Revlimid buys Bristol Myers time to pay down debt and position for another transaction  Boris said  Revlimid is expected to record nearly  10 billion in 2018 sales  Celgene shares were up 20 7 percent at  89 43   Both of them were coming into this year kind of limping   said Brad Loncar  who runs the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF  The deal makes  the combined entity a lot stronger   he added  Including debt  the deal is worth  95 billion  eclipsing Pfizer s  89 billion purchase of Warner Lambert in 2000  according to Refinitiv   Graphic    Some analysts  including Baird Equity s Brian Skorney  said it raised the possibility of a new era of big drug deals  much like in 2009  when  Pfizer  Inc  N PFE   Merck  and Roche Holding AG  S ROG  all pulled off transformational acquisitions  The news pushed up shares of rivals  Gilead Sciences Inc   O GILD   Allergan Plc  N AGN   Biogen Inc  O BIIB  and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  O REGN   Bristol expects to achieve the  2 5 billion in cost savings by 2022  with 55 percent coming from cuts in sales  general and administrative expenses  35 percent through reduction in research   development spending and 10 percent from manufacturing  It said the deal will add more than 40 percent to its earnings in the first year after the deal closes  expected in the third quarter of 2019  Under terms of the deal  Celgene shareholders will receive one Bristol Myers Squibb share and  50 in cash for each share held  or  102 43 per share  a premium of 53 7 percent to Celgene s Wednesday close  Celgene shareholders will also receive a so called CVR payment  or contingent value right  of  9 if three treatments in development achieve timely approvals  Those are the high profile multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod  lymphoma treatment liso cel by Dec  31  2020 and a CAR T therapy for multiple myeloma known as bb2121 from a partnership with bluebird bio  O BLUE  by March 31  2021  BLOOD CANCER DOMINANCE  What s important to us is the sustainability of Celgene s leadership position in hematology through their pipeline  even after Revlimid loses patent protection  Bristol Myers Chief Executive Giovanni Caforio said in an interview  His company s strength has primarily been in solid tumor cancers  The New York based drugmaker said it expects six product launches over the next two years   five coming from Celgene s pipeline  It also highlighted promising early clinical assets it would gain with the New Jersey based biotech  Celgene brings experience with potentially revolutionary CAR T therapies from its  9 billion purchase of Juno Therapeutics and the bluebird collaboration  The therapy takes immune cells from a patient  engineers them to better recognize and attack cancer and returns them to the patient  The deal could also provide a graceful exit for Celgene CEO Mark Alles  who has only committed to staying through the transition  His rocky tenure included management shakeups and the loss of more than half its market value since October 2017 as an expensive experimental Crohn s disease drug touted as a future multibillion dollar product failed and the expected approval of ozanimod was delayed  Alles  on a conference call  urged shareholders to support the deal  Jeremy Bryan  portfolio manager at Gradient Investments  which has small positions in both companies  said the Celgene purchase puts Bristol Myers  on the clock  to do more deals   When you have a significant amount of cash coming in in the next three years  it gives you the flexibility     for deals if they are out there or to buy back significant amounts of stock   Bryan said  Talks between Bristol and Celgene opened in September  with Bristol approaching Celgene  according to two sources familiar with the matter   Bristol has obtained fully committed debt financing from  Morgan Stanley  Senior Funding Inc and MUFG Bank Ltd   Morgan Stanley   Co  NYSE MS   LLC is the lead financial adviser to Bristol Myers  and Evercore and Dyal Co LLC are its financial advisers  Kirkland   Ellis LLP is its legal counsel   
J P  Morgan Securities LLC is serving as lead financial adviser and Citi is the financial adviser to Celgene  Wachtell  Lipton  Rosen   Katz is its legal counsel ",2019-01-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bristolmyers-to-buy-celgene-for-74-billion-1736008,1736008

104478,325993,AGN,Allergan  AGN  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q3 Release,opinion,"The market expects Allergan  NYSE AGN  to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This Botox maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 25 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  3 89 billion  down 0 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 95  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Allergan 
For Allergan  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 51  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Allergan will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Allergan would post earnings of  4 34 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 38  delivering a surprise of  0 92  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Allergan appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allergan-agn-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q3-release-200479584,200479584

104480,325995,AGN,AbbVie  ABBV  Set To Report Q3 Results  Can Things Turnaround  ,opinion,"AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   is set to report its third quarter results before the opening bell on Friday  November 1  The large cap pharmaceutical company has seen its shares decline over 15  in 2019 thus far  lagging behind the broader pharma market s gain 
The Humira manufacturer boasts a hefty dividend that it has steadily increased over the past several years and is actively adding new medications to its portfolio  but should it be enough for investors to bet on the company  Let s take a closer look at AbbVie and how the company might report its third quarter results 
Allergan  NYSE AGN  Acquisition 
AbbVie has become almost synonymous with its best selling drug  Humira  as it has generated the majority of its revenues for the past couple of years  Despite the success the company has had with Humira  it has done anything but become complacent 
AbbVie recently acquired Botox manufacturer  Allergen  for about  63 billion  The blockbuster deal strengthened AbbVie s portfolio of drugs and gave it more avenues to find new potentially high revenue treatments  Allergan s pipeline has a number of promising products that can accelerate revenue growth in the company immediately as well as in the long term 
This includes its depression treatment Vraylar as well as a new pipeline of drug candidates intended to treat gastroparesis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   In addition to these revenue boosting pipelines  Allergan s Botox and implant products are also expected to remain solid revenue drivers for AbbVie once the merger comes together 
The sheer size of the deal with all that it brings to the table for AbbVie helps the pharmaceutical company secure a portfolio of drugs that can provide stable revenue streams for years to come  The Allergan acquisition comes just as AbbVie needed to start weening itself off of its financial dependence on Humira 
Outlook 
AbbVie s leading income generator  Humira  is expected to decline in sales over the next several years as the company s patent expired in 2016 and low cost biosimilars were introduced in Europe late last year  The European biosimilars will likely lead to eroding international sales but Humira should continue to dominate the domestic market until biosimilars are introduced in around 2023  Currently  Humira accounts for 60  of AbbVie s sales  but following the merger  Humira accounts for only 40  of the company s revenues 
AbbVie has also been ramping up its development of its own drugs to combat eroding Humira sales such as Skyrizi  Venclexta  and Imbruvica  Skyrizi  a medicine for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis  was approved in both the US and Europe in April  and generated  42 million in revenues during the second quarter  Venclexta and Imbruvica had combined sales of  1 2 billion for a 35 5  year over year jump 
Our Q3 consensus estimates forecast a bottom line hike of 7 01  to  2 29 per share on the back of a 2 14  pop in sales to  8 41 billion  Humira is projected to generate  4 92 billion for a 3 95  drop off from the year ago quarter  Imbruvica is estimated to grow 22 98  to  1 2 billion and Venclexta is projected to more than double from Q3 2018 s figure to  207 5 million  Looking at fiscal 2019  our estimates call for earnings to grow 12 9  to  8 93 per share and for net sales to rally 1 46  to  33 23 billion 
Takeaway 
AbbVie has been making several moves to bolster and diversify its portfolio as it recognizes the decline of its Humira sales will be imminent as biosimilar products hit the markets  The company s investment in the Allergen acquisition while debt heavy  is a move in the right direction as the company prioritizes the long term trajectory of the business  Keeping busy with patent files for newly developed drugs like Skyrizi should also drive the company s top line for years to come 
Apart from its hefty 5 45  dividend yield  ABBV stock is currently trading at a discounted forward multiple relative to the industry average that provides a good entry point for investors who are feeling bullish about the company s newly structured portfolio  AbbVie s earning estimates have been revised higher earning the stock a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

104481,325996,AGN,Is A Beat In The Cards For Regeneron  REGN  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN   is scheduled to release third quarter 2019 results on Nov 5  before the opening bell Regeneron has a decent track record  In the last reported quarter  the company beat earnings expectations by 11 07   It surpassed earnings estimates by average of 6 14  in the last four quarters Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up for the to be reported quarter Why a Likely Earnings Beat Our proven model

best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  Regeneron has an Earnings ESP of  4 41  as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  6 35 and the Most Accurate Estimate at  6 63 Zacks Rank  The company has a Zacks Rank  3 Factors Influencing Q3Regeneron s key drug  Eylea  drove performance in the first half of 2019  a trend that most likely continued in the third quarter  Eylea was developed in collaboration with Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY    The drug is approved in the United States  the EU  Japan and other countries for the treatment of neovascular age related macular degeneration  wet AMD   diabetic macular edema  DME  and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion  which includes macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion and macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion In May  the FDA approved Eylea injection to treat all stages of diabetic retinopathy  DR   Label expansion into additional indications would provide the drug access to a higher patient population and increase its commercial potential  We expect sales to have benefited from the first full quarter for this expanded indication In August  the FDA has approved the Chemistry  Manufacturing and Controls  CMC  Prior Approval Supplement  PAS  for the Eylea injection prefilled syringe  Consequently  the drug became the only anti VEGF approved to treat four retinal conditions with a single dose strength prefilled syringe Apart from Eylea  investors will be focusing on the uptake of Dupixent and its label expansion Asthma drug Dupixent s sales have been impressive in the first half of 2019 on continuous label expansion and the same is expected to have prevailed in the third quarter  Label expansion of the drug in the last few months has most likely boosted sales  In May  the European Commission approved Dupixent for use in adults and adolescents 12 years and older as an add on maintenance treatment for severe asthma  In June  the FDA approved the drug for use with other medicines to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis  CRSwNP  in adults whose disease is not controlled  The European Commission approved another label expansion of Dupixent  extending its approval to include adolescents 12 17 years of age with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  who are candidates for systemic therapy Regeneron also has Kevzara in its portfolio  Kevzara  an anti interleukin  IL  6 receptor monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of adult patients with moderately  to severely active rheumatoid arthritis  was approved by the FDA in May 2017 Investors will also focus on the performance of PCSK9 inhibitor  Praluent  and Libtayo  Sales of Libtayo came in at  40 8 million in the second quarter  In June  the drug got approval in Europe for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma  CSCC   who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation  Consequently  sales have most likely increased in the third quarter as a result of geographical expansion Praluent sales came in at  73 7 million in the second quarter  In April  the FDA approved a label expansion of the drug to reduce the risk of heart attack  stroke and unstable angina requiring hospitalization of adults suffering from established cardiovascular  CV  disease  Hence  this is likely to have driven sales in the third quarter Apart from top line numbers  investors will focus on Regeneron s pipeline updates  The company announced positive pivotal phase III results for evinacumab  an investigational angiopoietin like 3  ANGPTL3  antibody  in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  HoFH  Share Price PerformanceRegeneron s stock has lost 18  in the year so far

April 2019 Total revenues of  131 2 million comprehensively beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  96 01 million  Revenues nearly doubled year over year  The significant increase in revenues was due to

Ironwood amended this license agreement with Astellas Pharma for an upfront payment of  10 million and recorded it as revenues in the third quarter  Per the amended terms  Astellas will be manufacturing linaclotide API in Japan and Ironwood will receive royalties on net sales of Linzess in the country In China  Hong Kong and Macau  Ironwood has a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN   for development and commercialization of Linzess  Ironwood also amended the agreement in the third quarter  Per the amended terms  Ironwood has granted AstraZeneca exclusive rights to

TakeIronwood reported encouraging third quarter results with sales and earnings beating estimates  Linzess  prospects look encouraging owing to strong demand trends and the drug s expansion to new

104526,326041,AGN,Exclusive  Big Pharma returning to U S  price hikes in January after pause,news,"By Michael Erman and Robin Respaut NEW YORK SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters     Novartis  AG  S NOVN  and  Bayer AG   DE BAYGn  are among nearly 30 drugmakers that have taken steps to raise the U S  prices of their medicines in January  ending a self declared halt to increases made by a pharma industry under pressure from the Trump administration  according to documents seen by Reuters   Other drugmakers set to raise prices at the start of 2019 include Allergan Plc  N AGN   GlaxoSmithKline Plc  L GSK    Amgen Inc   O AMGN   AstraZeneca Plc  L AZN  and Biogen Inc  O BIIB   the documents show    The hikes will pose a new challenge to President Donald Trump s pledge to lower the costs of prescription medications in the world s most expensive pharmaceutical market  The U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  has proposed a slew of policies aimed at lowering prices and passing more of the discounts negotiated by health insurers on to patients  Those measures are not expected to provide relief to consumers in the short term  however  and fall short of giving government health agencies direct authority to negotiate or regulate drug prices  Twenty eight drugmakers filed notifications with California agencies in early November disclosing that they planned to raise prices in 60 days or longer  Under a state law passed last year  companies are required to notify payers in California if they intend to raise the U S  list price on any drug by more than 16 percent over a two year period   The details were provided to Reuters in response to a public records request to California Correctional Health Care Services  which provides healthcare services to the state s corrections department  The department spends more than  3 billion annually on drugs for inmates  more than any other state    Requests and public shaming haven t worked  to lower drug prices  said Michael Rea  chief executive of RX Savings Solutions  which helps health plans and employers seek lower cost prescription medicines   We expect the number of 2019 increases to be even greater than in past years    Pfizer  Inc  NYSE PFE  rolled back planned price increases in July after President Trump said in a tweet that the drugmaker  should be ashamed  and that his administration would respond to the hikes   Pfizer said it would defer hikes until January 2019 to support the administration as it pursued its new pricing policies  Pfizer s move prompted many of its industry peers  including Bayer  Novartis  Allergan  AstraZeneca and Amgen  to follow suit   Drug price increases implemented by the 20 biggest drugmakers did slow down during the second half of 2018  with those companies raising prices on just over half the number of drugs as in 2017  according to data compiled by consultancy RX Savings Solutions   Pfizer has already announced plans to hike prices on 41 of its drugs in mid January  60 DAY NOTICE        The California corrections department documents indicate that the companies plan to increase prices as early as Jan  1  Most do not detail for which drugs or by how much  but specific details were given in the case of Novartis and Bayer  Novartis is planning to raise prices on more than 100 indications of over 30 different drugs in January  the documents show  with increases ranging from 4 5 percent to 9 9 percent  Drugs on the list are expected to account for more than  20 billion of Novartis  revenue this year and include multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya  psoriatic arthritis treatment Cosentyx  and leukemia treatment Tasigna   The list also includes Diovan  the brand name version of blood pressure treatment valsartan  generic versions of which are currently in shortage after a potential carcinogen was detected in active ingredients made in China  prompting widespread recalls  Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff said the company plans to raise U S  list prices on 14 percent of the medicines it sells in the country in 2019  for an average increase of 4 7 percent on those drugs   Our rebates and discounts  however  continue to grow even faster   Althoff said  As a result  the company expects a net price decrease of nearly 5 percent across the whole U S  portfolio  he said  Over the last three years  net price decreases for its U S  business have ranged from 2 percent to 2 6 percent  the company said  Bayer filed notifications with California agencies to increase prices on six of its drugs in January  many of which are birth control products  Most of these price increases are 5 percent   Bayer said that the U S  wholesale price of its products are not representative of what most consumers pay and that  list price increases are expected to be offset by higher rebates and discounts paid to insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers   Amgen did not respond to requests for comment  AstraZeneca and Biogen declined to comment for this story   GSK would not give details about its specific price increases  which are set to take effect on or around Jan  1 and could change before then  Allergan said that all of its price increases will be aligned with its pledge made in 2016 to limit drug price increases on its products to less than 10 percent annually  The United States  which leaves drug pricing to market competition  has higher drug prices than in other countries where governments directly or indirectly control the costs  making it the world s most lucrative market for manufacturers  Lowering prescription drug prices was a top priority in Republican Trump s 2016 presidential campaign  Rival Democrats are expected to step up congressional scrutiny of drug price hikes next year after gaining control of the U S  House of Representatives in elections in November   Drug companies raising their prices and offsetting them with higher rebates benefits everyone but the consumer   HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said in a statement

104530,326045,AGN,Johnson   Johnson s  JNJ  Legal Problems Continue To Worry Investors,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   is set to report their third quarter results as pending lawsuits loom over the company  The pharmaceutical giant s shares have barely moved in 2019 thus far  rising only 1 9   but the stock has outpaced the broader large cap pharmaceutical market s 0 8  decline 
The firm has seen its litigation challenges mount recently  A Philadelphia jury recently ruled that J J should pay a whopping  8 billion to a man who claimed its anti psychosis drug Risperdal caused him to develop gynecomastia  enlarged breasts   The lawsuits the company faces from over 100 000 plaintiffs have spurred uncertainty over the company and the large cap pharmaceutical industry as a whole  
Litigation Looms Over Large Cap Pharma 
As previously mentioned  Johnson   Johnson is facing lawsuits from thousands of plaintiffs over its product safety and marketing tactics  Juries and judges have ordered the health care company to pay billions in recent trials that blame its signature baby powder and other products for health complications 
The large cap pharma company s marketing tactics is accused of fueling the opioid addiction epidemic that still goes on today  Two Ohio counties recently settled with Johnson   Johnson and drug manufacturers like Allergen   NYSE AGN   and Endo International   NASDAQ ENDP   for lawsuits that accused the companies of fueling the opioid crisis  And back in August  an Oklahoma judge ordered the company to pay  572 million to the state for its contribution to the opioid addiction epidemic 
In 2018  a St  Louis jury mandated for J J to pay  4 7 billion to 22 women who alleged that they developed ovarian cancer because of their use of J J s signature baby powder  Johnson   Johnson appealed the decision and insists that their baby powder product is safe and does not cause cancer 
The recent amount of litigation the company is facing has skyrocketed from years ago  J J was facing legal action from over 100 000 plaintiffs in the middle of 2019  up significantly from the roughly 8 500 plaintiffs it faced in October of 2011  Talcum powder lawsuit plaintiffs rose to 15 500 as of June  30th 2019 from 1 400 in early 2016 
Possible Long Term Effects
Investors are split over how this might play out for J J in the upcoming months  Some believe that the pharmaceutical giant should settle some of the larger opioid cases so it can avoid long costly trials that would be largely publicized and be potentially detrimental to J J s reputation in the health care field  Furthermore  some lawyers believe that the longer the litigation is dragged on  the easier it would be for the plaintiffs to win their cases as potential groundbreaking developments in the case may be uncovered 
The  8 billion ruling the company was ordered to pay in Philadelphia can also spell further trouble for the business  it opens up the possibility of J J having to deal with billion dollar payouts for its roughly 13 000 Risperdal lawsuits  J J s legal team is likely to appeal the magnitude of the fine but the loss still represents a major liability 
J J is facing litigation on a large scale for multiple products  and Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   analysts estimate that the opioid litigation alone could cost the company  5  10 billion to settle 
Takeaway 
J J is in jeopardy of potentially losing a groundbreaking case that can set off a domino effect in the rest of its other cases  Its reputation as a renowned health care company and billions of dollars in reparations are at stake in the upcoming months and as a result  investors are right to be worried about the staggering number of pending lawsuits the corporation is facing 
Our Q3 estimates forecast J J to report a 2 44  drop in earnings to  2 00 per share while sales are expected to fall 1 31  to  20 08 billion  JNJ stock sits at a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

104531,326046,AGN,Allergan  AGN  Shareholders Approve Acquisition By AbbVie,opinion,"Allergan plc   NYSE AGN   announced that its shareholders have approved its pending acquisition by AbbVie  Inc    NYSE ABBV    Allergan said that approximately 68 6  of shareholders eligible to vote at Allergan s extraordinary general meeting of shareholders as well as a special court ordered meeting of shareholders voted in favor of the transaction 
Allergan announced the definitive transaction to be acquired by AbbVie in a cash and stock deal in June this year  AbbVie is offering  120 30 in cash and 0 866 of its share  worth  67 94  for each share of Allergan  The total transaction value is nearly  63 billion  The acquisition is expected to close by early 2020  if all necessary approvals are obtained 
Allergan s share price has risen 26 4  this year so far against the  s decrease of 8 8  
 

 
AbbVie s offer represented a premium of 45  to Allergan s closing price on Jun 24  thereby proving to be rewarding for its shareholders  Moreover  with blockbuster eye drug  Restasis expected to face generic competition  fears of new competition to Allergan s key drug  Botox and some recent pipeline setbacks  the merger with AbbVie could prove to be the best way out for Allergan 
Meanwhile  AbbVie s rationale behind the Allergan deal is to add a new blockbuster product to its portfolio  Botox  ahead of generic competition for its blockbuster inflammatory medicine  Humira  Generic versions of Humira are already denting revenues in Europe and are expected to be launched in the United States in 2023  AbbVie is heavily dependent on Humira and is looking to diversify its portfolio 
Approved for therapeutic and aesthetic use  Botox is a key top line driver for Allergan and looks fit to be the next revenue driver for AbbVie after Humira loses exclusivity  Overall  the Allergan acquisition should diversify AbbVie s revenue base to markets categories outside AbbVie s present drug portfolio and accelerate its non Humira business 
However  after the deal was announced  some investors expressed concerns that AbbVie has overpaid for Botox as new competitive pressure looms large 
In February 2019  Evolus  Inc  s   NASDAQ EOLS   Jeuveau injection  indicated to improve the appearance of glabellar or frown lines  was approved by the FDA  which can pose competition to Botox  In the fall of 2019  Revance Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ RVNC   will file for approval of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection  DAXI   a rival treatment to Botox for the frown lines indication  It has demonstrated longer duration of efficacy compared to Botox in late stage studies

BOSTON  Reuters    Stephen Fraidin  a prominent mergers lawyer who has been a top executive at billionaire investor William Ackman s hedge fund  is joining law firm Cadwalader  Wickersham   Taft LLP 
The firm plans to soon announce that Fraidin will join its New York office as a partner  Cadwalader s managing partner  Pat Quinn  told Reuters 
Fraidin  78  joined Ackman s Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Capital Management as vice chairman three years ago after working for five decades as a Wall Street lawyer 
He arrived at the hedge fund soon after Ackman teamed up with pharmaceutical company Valeant as it sought to buy Botox maker Allergan  NYSE AGN  when the investor looked ready to structure more deals that require intense in house legal supervision  Pershing Square s later investment in Valeant failed  contributing to a string of losses and reduced deal making appetite 
Fraidin is leaving the activist hedge fund which generally makes only about a dozen long term investments  for a law firm that has been in business since George Washington was the U S  president  and now frequently works for Ackman s  8 billion hedge fund 
 This is an opportunity to return to helping clients deal with challenging corporate governance and mergers and acquisitions situations  and I think it is a good move for me   Fraidin told Reuters 
At Cadwalader Fraidin he will reunite with Richard Brand  co chairman of the firm s corporate group  who often handles legal matters for Pershing Square  The two men had worked together at Kirkland   Ellis  Before that  Fraidin was a partner at Fried  Frank  Harris  Shriver   Jacobson 
He returns to practicing merger law as dealmaking is off to a strong start this year  But gradually rising interest rates  concerns over U S  trade policy  and worries about unfriendly regulators have raised questions on Wall Street whether the robust pace will continue 
During his career  Fraidin has advised prominent clients including private equity firm 3G Capital Partners which teamed up with Warren Buffett to buy H J  Heinz Co for  28 billion in 2013  In 2014  he represented the  London Stock Exchange  Group  LON LSE  in its  2 7 billion acquisition of U S  index compiler Frank Russell Co 
Fraidin will keep ties to Pershing Square and remain on its advisory board  Ackman  52  who has known Fraidin since his teenage years and calls him a mentor  said  I am looking forward to working with Steve in his new role at Cadwalader  ",2018-06-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pershing-squares-fraidin-to-join-cadwalader-as-ma-lawyer-1478589,1478589

104660,326175,AGN,Lilly  LLY  Up 1 9  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Eli Lilly  LLY   Shares have added about 1 9  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Lilly due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Lilly Q2 Earnings Beat  New Drugs Drive SalesLilly reported second quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share of  1 50  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 46  Earnings rose 1  year over year as higher operating costs were partially offset by a lower tax rate and reduction in shares outstanding due to share repurchase Revenues in DetailRevenues of  5 64 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 65 billion  Sales however grew 1  year over year  backed by strong demand for its newer drugs  namely Trulicity  Taltz  Jardiance  Basaglar  Olumiant and Verzenio  which compensated for lower sales of older products like Cialis due to the loss of U S  exclusivity and the impact of Lartruvo s impending product withdrawal Foreign exchange hurt sales growth by 2  in the quarter  Also  lower realized prices had a negative impact of 3  on sales mainly due to increased coverage gap funding requirements in Medicare Part D  which hurt prices of some diabetes medicines like Trulicity and Humalog  Volumes rose 6   Excluding Cialis  loss of exclusivity and the impact of Lartruvo  volume grew nearly 15  New pharma products  products launched since 2014  drove 13  of sales growth and 15 4  of volume growth in the second quarter     and represented nearly 43  total revenues  up from 39  in the previous quarter  The loss of exclusivity hurt volumes by 650 basis points primarily attributed to Cialis U S  revenues were flat at  3 25 billion while ex U S  revenues rose 2  to  2 38 billion Among the established products  Forteo sales declined 17  to  360 8 million  Alimta sales rose 4  to  577 8 million  Humalog sales dropped 12  to  677 6 million  Humulin sales declined 7  to  322 6 million Cialis sales declined 63  to  200 2 million as U S  sales were hurt by entry of generic products  Outside U S  sales were also hurt by generic competition  lower realized prices and currency headwinds  Generic erosion is expected to hurt Cialis sales in the third quarter and thereafter begin to normalize in the fourth quarter Among the new products  Trulicity generated revenues of  1 03 billion  up 32  year over year driven by higher demand in the United States and higher volumes in ex U S  markets  which offset the impact of lower realized prices and changes in segment mix  The prices were lower mainly in the United States due to higher contracted rebates and increased coverage gap funding requirements in Medicare Part D Cyramza revenues were  241 8 million  up 11  year over year driven by higher sales in both the United States and international markets Jardiance sales surged 58  to  231 9 million  driven by increased demand trends within the SGLT2 class of diabetes medicines in the United States and increased volume outside the United States  which offset the negative impact of currencyBasaglar recorded revenues of  290 7 million  up 44  year over year  In the United States  sales rose 48   benefiting from higher demand and the impact of higher realized prices  Outside U S  sales growth of 29  was driven by increased volume  which offset the impact of currency headwinds Taltz brought in sales of  353 8 million  up 61  year over year as U S  sales gained from higher demand  Ex U S  sales were driven by increased volume from launches in new countries  which offset the impact of currency headwinds Olumiant generated sales of  102 4 million in the quarter backed by increased demand in international markets  compared with  82 1 million in the previous quarter  In the United States  Olumiant recorded sales of  10 7 million  higher than  6 4 million in the previous quarter Verzenio generated sales of  133 9 million in the quarter  which was more than  109 4 million in the previous quarter  This was because of increased demand in the United States wherein Verzenio recorded sales of  105 2 million Emgality generated revenues of  34 3 million in the quarter compared with  14 2 million generated in the previous quarter  In the United States  Emgality sales were  33 8 million compared with  12 2 million in the previous quarter  Emgality captured 41  share of market for new prescriptions in the United States  an increase of almost 9 points from the end of first quarter Gross Margin   Operating IncomeAdjusted gross margin of 81  in the quarter expanded 120 basis points driven by favorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold and greater manufacturing efficiencies  which offset the impact of unfavorable product mix  due to lower volumes from post patent products  and negative impact of price on revenues Operating income decreased 7  year over year to  1 58 billion  Operating margin was 27 9  in the quarter  down 250 basis points year over year due to lower gross margins and higher operating costs Total operating expenses  including research and development and marketing  selling and administrative expenses  rose 8  in the quarter as the company invested in recently launched products and late stage assets  Marketing  selling and administrative expenses rose 7   R D expense rose 10  in the quarter due to higher development expenses for late stage assets Adjusted effective tax rate was 10   lower than 16 7  in the year ago quarter  driven primarily by the impact of U S  tax reform 2019 Earnings Guidance RaisedLilly raised its expectations for full year earnings while keeping its revenue guidance intact   The earnings forecast was increased from a range of  5 60 to  5 70 per share to  5 67 to  5 77 driven by a lower tax rate  The range indicates growth of 4  to 6  from the year ago levels  The guidance excludes discontinued operations results for Elanco  following disposition of Lilly s remaining ownership in the company The revenue guidance was maintained in the range of  22 0 billion    22 5 billion  which indicates 5  growth  at mid point  over 2018 level on a constant currency basis Gross margin is still expected to be approximately 80   Adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 13 versus 14 expected previously  Adjusted operating margin is expected to be 28  in 2019 Marketing  selling and administrative expense are expected to be in the range of  5 9 billion to  6 1 billion versus  5 7 billion to  6 0 billion expected previously  Research and development expense is still expected to be in the range of  5 5 billion to  5 7 billion In the second half  revenue growth is expected to be driven by higher demand for its newer drugs including Trulicity  Taltz  Basaglar  Jardiance  Verzenio  Cyramza  Olumiant and Emgality  However  generic competition for several drugs including Cialis  rising pricing pressure in the United States due to rebates and legislated increases in Medicare Part D cost sharing  price cuts in some international markets  currency headwinds and the impact of the failed Lartruvo study are expected to put pressure on the top line Initial 2020 GoalsIn 2020  Allergan  NYSE AGN  expects to grow sales at 6  to be able to meet the 2015 2020 target of minimum compounded annual growth rate of 7   It sounded confident that its new products will help it achieve growth as the headwind from Cialis LOE and Lartruvo will abate in 2020 It expects to achieve adjusted operating margin of 31  in 2020

104661,326176,AGN,Will Opioid Litigation Take Its Toll On Pharma Companies ,opinion,The recent verdict by an Ohio district court against J J   NYSE JNJ    related to its involvement in the abuse of its opioid based drugs  has brought the rising litigation related liabilities of several other large pharma companies into focus  There are thousands of pending lawsuits in several states  which may run into billions of dollars in penalties or settlements and significantly impact the companies  margins going forward The U S  Opioid EpidemicOpioid drugs  which are used as painkillers  have high abuse potential  Use of drugs like morphine  codeine  oxycodone and fentanyl are opioid based and highly controlled by the FDA However  the marketing practices of pharma companies including Teva   NYSE TEVA    Allergan   NYSE AGN    Mallinckrodt   NYSE MNK    Endo International   NASDAQ ENDP   and privately held Purdue Pharma  since late 1990s  increased prescribing of opioid based drugs as painkillers  These pharma giants assured that patients will not get addicted to opioid pain relievers  It is rumored that Purdue Pharma was the biggest beneficiary of this crisis as it aggressively marketed its opioid analgesic  OxyContin  and made huge profits from the sale of the drug  used either as a medicine or for addiction Per the National Institute of Drug Abuse  opioid overdose claimed lives of 47 000 Americans in 2017  About 1 7 million people in the United States  taking prescription opioid pain relievers  suffered from substance use disorders in the same year  Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s estimate  prescription opioid misuse alone creates a total economic burden of  78 5 billion every year  In the past two decades  400 000 deaths occurred related to opioid based drug abuse With a significant increase in the number of deaths or instances of misuse of these drugs  and high costs related to opioid abuse  it has become a public crisis  Several government organizations are taking steps to contain the widespread misuse of these drugs  Lawsuits have been filed against pharma companies for generating funds through penalties for abatement plans  J J is the first company this year to have received an unfavorable ruling  It has to pay a penalty of  527 million in the opioid abuse case brought by the state of Oklahoma  Two other defendants in the same case  Teva and Purdue Pharma  settled earlier by paying significant amounts  Meanwhile  Endo International and Allergan reached settlements in opioid abuse case with the state of Ohio Impact of Pending LawsuitsJ J has decided to appeal against the ruling in the litigation with the state of Oklahoma  The company stated that though it acknowledges the opioid crisis as a real problem  its drugs or marketing campaigns are not responsible for the widespread abuse  Other companies that have settled outside the court also denied any wrongdoings  J J is set to face a federal multidistrict litigation in October  which includes several defendants and multifarious claims There are more than 2 000 cases against J J and similar penalties in all these cases will aggregate to billions of dollars  Although J J has significant cash resources to meet these liabilities  it will likely hamper its future earnings  Moreover  appealing against such decisions will also increase litigation costs  Following the Oklahoma ruling  Moody s has revised its outlook on J J to negative Meanwhile  Purdue Pharma and its owners  the Sackler family  are reportedly in discussions to settle all pending litigation related to the company s opioid based drugs for payment in the range of  10 billion to  12 billion  However  no agreement has been reached yet  The company would file for bankruptcy if a deal materializes to meet the settlement payment The path forward for Teva  Allergan  Mallinckrodt and Endo International will also not be rosy  following J J s penalty and Purdue Pharma s rumored settlement discussions  Most of these companies are already reeling under pressure due to pricing pressure in the generic market as well as rising competition in the branded segment  Based on the current scenario  cash resources of these companies are likely to be insufficient to meet settlement costs or penalties  They may follow the path of Purdue Pharma and declare bankruptcy  A decision related to the multidistrict litigation  due in October  will provide a better picture Please note that although AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  is not named in any opioid abuse litigation  the company s pending acquisition of Allergan may have an impact on the company  Negative rulings will prove to be unfavorable for the merged entity Will Cannabis Become the Next Opioid The current state of opioid crisis has raised some questions related to recent legalization of cannabis marijuana in certain states  which is a highly regulated substance  Cannabis based drugs also have a high potential of abuse  These drugs may lead to a more severe crisis than opioid in the next couple of decades  However  cannabis is not yet legalized at the federal level in the United States and none of the U S  based pharmaceutical companies can market cannabis based drugs  at present  However  a few companies with cannabis based drugs are registered outside the country and they do market their drugs in the United States  These drugs should be made available in the U S  market only after thorough research to avoid another financial burden J J  Endo  Teva  Allergan and Mallinckrodt carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

104662,326177,AGN,Allergan Settles Ahead Of Multi District Opioid Litigation,opinion,"Allergan   NYSE AGN   announced that it has settled with two counties of Ohio for almost  5 million  resolving all claims against itself related to the federal multidistrict litigation for opioid drug abuse scheduled in October Per the settlement terms  Allergan will pay  1 9 million to Summit County and  3 1 million to Cuyahoga County  which will remove the company from the defendant list in the first ever multidistrict litigation related to opioid drug abuse  The company stated that these settlements have been done keeping in view the timeline for the trial outcomes and costs related to it  The settlement should remove an overhang on the company Please note that the two Ohio counties  Summit and Cuyahoga  are the bellwethers in the multidistrict litigation  and will represent nearly 2 000 political subdivisions   cities    counties  townships  and others  Thus  the settlement will relieve Allergan from a major chunk of opioid abuse claims  The company is seeking indemnification with other related parties  Moreover  Allergan stated that it does not have any pending generic claim as the company had sold its related assets to Teva   NYSE TEVA   in 2016  It has not been actively involved in marketing or promotion of opioid products since 2013 Last month  Endo International   NASDAQ ENDP   announced a settlement in a similar litigation for  10 million  There are several other pharma companies still on the defendant list in the multidistrict litigation  We expect similar settlements to be offered by some of them Allergan s shares have increased 19 5  so far this year against the  s decline of 9 1  Opioid based drug abuse has come to the limelight as 400 000 patients are estimated to have died in the past couple of decades due to overdose  Per the United States Department of Health and Human Services  pharmaceutical companies encouraged use of opioid pain relievers by assuring that patients will not get addicted to the drugs  More than 2000 lawsuits have been filed against pharma companies in multiple states  holding them responsible for the opioid epidemic and deaths due to opioid overdose The multidistrict litigation  scheduled to start next month  will provide a clearer picture of the impact on pharma companies as it represents nearly 2 000 different lawsuits clubbed under a single trial  The trial is expected to span over seven weeks However  the market is already predicting a gloomy outlook for pharma companies due to the risk of increasing litigation costs  In August  an Ohio district court provided its ruling in the opioid litigation brought by the state of Oklahoma  directing the only defendant  J J   NYSE JNJ    to pay  572 million  Teva and Endo had settled their litigation with the state of Oklahoma prior to the start of the trial Meanwhile  Purdue Pharma and its owners  the Sackler family  are reportedly in discussions to settle all pending litigations related to its opioid based drugs for payment in the range of  10 billion to  12 billion  However  no agreement has been reached yet  The company will file for bankruptcy if any deal materializes to meet the settlement payment Allergan plc Price

104706,326221,AGN,Currency  Conundrum And Fixed Income Follies Spark Market Volatility,opinion,"The world is getting more connected through technology and travel  Cuisines are evolving  Some people are scared of globalization  but I think people will always take pride in cultural heritage  John Mackey
A few years ago  there was a movie called Benjamin Button about a person living backwards from death to birth  It starred the handsome Brad Pitt  he of Angelina Jolie fame  In the story  there is a segment where the main character suffers an unfortunate accident  The story goes on to account for every single action the character made and how it delayed his time horizon  which affected the characters timeline  which ultimately produced the problematic incident  I bring this up because one can make a case that in many situations  lots of independent events are linked to produce an outcome  Essentially  to see the world is to understand how small events in one area can affect larger countries even though they do not appear related  Let s turn to the current market environment with this thought in mind 
As I am sure you are quite aware  global equity markets have been experiencing heightened volatility over the last few weeks  There are quite a few important issues that are related here  First  China s economy has a large export component  nearly 50  of all GDP  China has made the domestic economy a focus  to reduce it s dependence on exports over the last decade  Second  we all know about Mr  Trump s announcement of another 10  tariff on all Chinese exported goods to the United States  Last Monday  China announced  it would alter it s currency band of Yuan  Renmimbi  that is pegged to the dollar  It was lowered to above the all important 7 1 ratio  If you are not familiar with currency markets  when I say lowered  what I mean is that one U S  dollar would exchange for more Chinese Yuan  in this case  more than 7 yuan to one U S  dollar  Currency markets also reacted to central banks across the globe further lowering their interest rates  which included India  Currency markets affect interest rates  which affect the bond market  In Japan  the Yen is considered a safe haven during heightened economic stress  so buyers bought the Yen  strengthening it against the dollar  it means one U S  dollar exchanges for fewer Yen   Japan is an important country to look at when you consider the effect of weak monetary policy  For more than three decades  the Japanese government has tried to help their domestic economy by keeping interest rates quite low  currently yielding a   144  on the Japanese 10 year JGB  As a result  their banking sector is under serious economic pressure as many smaller banks cannot make enough interest income from loans to be profitable or compete with the larger banks  The larger Japanese banks have turned to global markets to find areas to make more interest income  especially in the United States  Here is a very nice  from the WSJ which details this issue  With the heightened volatility in the currency markets  scared investors rush into the bond market to buy Treasuries and other government bonds  Bond yields fell  so much so that they broke the 1 7  level this week before recently rebounding  Relatedly  stock markets were pummeled on Monday after all of these moves  with the Dow falling nearly a thousand points in one day  You notice we did not bring up what is taking place in Britain either  With a new Prime Minister  the always politically correct Boris Johnson  the deadline for a complete and hard Brexit is fast approaching  which is the end of October  Investors see this as quite problematic  and the pound has been pounded nearly every day  as have British equities  Logically  the political events in British and Europe naturally affect all markets as well  So you can see  like Benjamin Button s situation  global markets are very much related  It is important to keep that in mind  especially when looking for investment opportunities

104739,326254,AGN,Shire rejects  63 billion Takeda bid as Allergan drops pursuit,news,By Greg Roumeliotis  Ben Martin and Ben Hirschler NEW YORK LONDON  Reuters    Rare disease drug maker  Shire  Plc  L SHP  said on Thursday it had rejected a  63 billion cash and stock acquisition offer by Japan s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd  T 4502   while Allergan Plc  N AGN  reversed course on pursuing a rival bid   The high stakes drama underscores the surge in dealmaking this year in the pharmaceutical sector  as large players look for promising assets to improve their pipelines  An acquisition of Shire by Takeda would be by far the biggest acquisition of a drug company year to date  Botox maker Allergan confirmed on Thursday it was considering an offer for Shire after Reuters reported on its interest  sending its shares down 7 percent  Later on Thursday  Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders decided to drop his pursuit of London listed Shire after receiving pushback from some of his shareholders  who were concerned about the company overstretching its resources  according to people familiar with the matter  who asked not be identified discussing confidential talks  Allergan then issued a second announcement stating it did not intend to make an offer for Shire  Dublin based Allergan  which has a market capitalization of  52 billion  had  30 billion in debt as of the end of December  the legacy of a string of acquisitions  This has weighed on Allergan s ability to carry out big acquisitions   Allergan s exploration of a bid for Shire was part of its wider strategic review  Allergan said in a statement  This review is currently unlikely to lead either to a major acquisition or a breakup of the company  one of the sources said  Reuters also first reported on Thursday that Takeda had made a cash and stock offer of 46 50 pounds   66 20  a share for Shire  This prompted both companies to confirm the move and announce that Shire had rejected it  although their negotiations are continuing  Buying Shire would be the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and propel Takeda  led by Frenchman Christophe Weber  into the top ranks of global drugmakers  It would be Weber s boldest move by far  significantly boosting Takeda s position in rare diseases  including a blockbuster hemophilia franchise  gastrointestinal disorders and neuroscience  where Shire is a leader in drugs to treat hyperactivity  But it would be a big financial stretch since Shire  with a market value of more than 34 billion pounds   48 3 billion   is worth a lot more than Japan s biggest drugmaker  which has a market capitalization of 4 1 trillion yen   31 billion   An acquisition of Shire would have given Allergan heft in the rare diseases space at a time when Saunders is seeking to cement its status as a purveyor of innovative drugs  Saunders  plans to sell Allergan to  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  for  160 billion were scuppered two years ago after the U S  Treasury changed the rules on corporate tax inversions   Saunders  was a huge deal guy and everyone was kind of waiting for the next big deal   said Kevin Kedra  an analyst with Gabelli   Co  which holds shares of both Allergan and Shire  If there was to be a big share component to a deal it would have to come before a vote of shareholders  he noted   Shareholders seem to be voting this morning   Kedra said  Takeda said it would remain disciplined in its approach and intended to maintain its dividend policy and investment grade credit rating  adding that   Discussions between the parties regarding a potential offer are ongoing    MORE CASH WANTED Shire confirmed it had received three conditional proposals from Takeda  but said they significantly undervalued the company s growth prospects and drugs in development  Takeda s latest 46 50 pounds offer was made on April 12 and comprised 17 75 pounds in cash  which would be paid in U S  dollars  and 28 75 pounds worth of new Takeda shares  Shire said that valued it at approximately 44 billion pounds   62 6 billion   based on total issued and to be issued share capital  The two earlier cash and share offers were worth 44 and 45 50 pounds per share  respectively  Under UK takeover rules  Takeda has until April 25 to make a firm offer or walk away  after it said last month it was considering a bid  Based on Takeda s market capitalization  Shire shareholders would end up owning approximately 51 percent of the enlarged group  Shire noted  Bernstein analyst Wimal Kapadia said Shire was likely to be pushing for a larger cash component in current talks but Takeda was already stretched  suggesting the chances of a deal being consummated were still  reasonably risky   Shire has been under pressure in the past 12 months  with its shares down by a third before Takeda s interest was made public  due to greater competition from generic drugs and debts from its  32 billion acquisition of Baxalta in 2016  Shire said in January it would run its attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  ADHD  business  which consists mainly of its blockbuster drug Vyvanse  separately and possibly seek a separate listing  Earlier this week it struck a deal to sell its cancer drugs for  2 4 billion to unlisted French group Servier

and Ajovy  respectively were all launched in 2018 Meanwhile  in February  Evolus  Jeuveau injection indicated to improve the appearance of glabellar or frown lines was approved by the FDA  which can pose competition to Botox  In the fall of 2019  Revance Therapeutics will file for approval of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection  DAXI   a rival treatment to Botox for the frown lines indication  It has demonstrated longer duration of efficacy compared to Botox in late stage studies U S  General Medicine net revenues were up 10 3  year over year to  1 46 billion in the reported quarter as strong growth of Vraylar  Viibryd  Linzess and Lo Loestrin was offset by lower sales of drugs that lost exclusivity Linzess sales rose 2 2  to  196 0 million  Lo Loestrin sales grew 13 8  to  145 5 million while Bystolic sales rose 1 6  to  150 5 million  Vraylar sales were  196 1 million in the second quarter  71 7  higher than the year ago quarter  while Viibryd sales were  107 8 million  up 24 3  from the year ago quarter  In May  Vraylar was approved for the new indication of bipolar depression  which may have contributed to higher sales of the drug in the quarter The International segment recorded net revenues of  847 7 million  down 4 3  from the year ago period  excluding the impact of foreign exchange as growth in Facial Aesthetics and Ozurdex implant was partially offset by regulatory changes for textured breast implants and lower glaucoma and eye drop revenues Profits DeclineAdjusted operating income decreased 6 3  to  1 85 billion in the second quarter due to lower revenues and higher costs Selling  general and administrative expenses increased 2 5  to  1 16 billion in the second quarter  owing to higher marketing spending in Medical Aesthetics and for product launches Research and development  R D  expenses rose 14 9  to  447 0 million due to pipeline progress 2019 GuidanceAllergan slightly raised its sales guidance for 2019 while maintaining the previously issued earnings view Allergan expects sales to be in the range of  15 43  15 63 billion  up from the previous guidance of  15 13  15 43 billion  The company still estimates its adjusted earnings to be more than  16 55 per share Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 13  in 2019 versus 13 13 5  expected previously  Adjusted R D expense guidance was maintained in the range of approximately  1 6    1 7 billion while the SG A range was increased from approximately  4 1    4 3 billion to approximately  4 4    4 5 billion  Adjusted gross margin is expected to be approximately 85  85 5   maintained  Our TakeAllergan beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the second quarter and raised its sales guidance for the year  As expected  Allergan delivered a sequentially stronger top line performance in the second quarter  Shares were up less than 1  in pre market trading on Tuesday  So far this year  Allergan s share price has risen 20 2  against the  s decrease of 5 9    Allergan s key products like Botox and new products such as Viberzi and Vraylar are supporting sales  Allergan also continues to deliver on its R D pipeline with some major product launches expected over the next couple of years  Biosimilars also represent significant opportunity  Allergan is also consistently paying down debt and cutting costs  However  in 2019  sales are expected to be hurt by loss of exclusivity of key drugs including Restasis Meanwhile  Allergan refrained from holding a conference call due to its proposed acquisition by AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   for a total transaction value of nearly  63 billion  The companies had announced the buyout deal in June  The deal is expected to close in early 2020  The acquisition by AbbVie could prove to be rewarding for Allergan s shareholders  Moreover  with Restasis expected to face generic competition  fears of new competition to Botox and recent pipeline setbacks  the merger with AbbVie could prove to be the best way out for Allergan Allergan currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

104751,326266,AGN,Top Research Reports  Chevron  AbbVie  Phillips 66   More,opinion,"Tuesday  August 6  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features updated research reports on 16 major stocks  including Chevron  CVX   AbbVie  ABBV  and Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   These research reports have been hand picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Chevron s shares have outperformed the Zacks Integrated Oil industry year to date   9 1  vs   2 7    Chevron s second quarter earnings increased 26  year over year and exceeded the consensus estimate  Free cash flow rose and production hit a record level  The Zacks analyst thinks Chevron s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry  targeting volume growth of around 4 7  in 2019 thanks to planned expansion in the Permian Basin  Chevron pumped 55  more out of the West Texas shale play in the quarter compared with the year ago period  with output set to soar in coming years  Moreover  growing free cash flow should enable Chevron to distribute steady and attractive dividends in the future  However  drop in refining earnings once again cut into gains from rising E P income  Its massive capex might also play spoilsport  Hence  investors are advised to wait for a better entry point 
 You can   
Shares of AbbVie have lost  29 2  year to date  versus the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s decline of  2 9   AbbVie beat estimates for earnings and sales in the second quarter and raised its earnings guidance for the second time this year  The Zacks analyst thinks AbbVie s key drug  Humira  is performing well based on strong demand trends despite new competition  Additionally  Imbruvica has multibillion dollar potential  AbbVie has been successful in expanding approvals for its cancer drugs  Imbruvica and Venclexta  Moreover  it has an impressive late stage pipeline  comprising several products with multibillion dollar potential which are expected to be launched in the near term  The acquisition of Allergan  NYSE AGN   if successful  should diversify AbbVie s revenue base and accelerate its non Humira business  Sales erosion due to direct biosimilar competition to Humira in international markets is a big headwind 
 You can   
Phillips 66 s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil Refining and Marketing industry over the past year  losing  22  vs   36   The Zacks analyst thinks Phillips 66 is strongly positioned to gain from the rising demand for midstream assets in the United States  where takeaway capacity constraint is a significant problem  Moreover  the company is well placed for the upcoming change in regulations  namely IMO 2020  with its updated refining assets  It is also committed to returning cash back to stockholders through dividend payments and share repurchases  Recently  the company reported strong second quarter 2019 earnings  courtesy of contributions from pipeline transportation businesses  However  a lower crude utilization rate has hurt refining operations  Moreover  uncertainties in the global market are likely to hamper demand for petrochemicals  which will affect the firm s Chemical business  Rising operating costs are also a threat to the company

104793,326308,AGN,Is A Beat In The Cards For Bristol Myers  BMY  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   is scheduled to report second quarter 2019 results on Jul 25  before the market opens 
The company s shares have lost 16 1  in the year so far compared with the  s decline of 0 1  

 
Bristol Myers delivered average positive earnings surprise of 11 85  in the trailing four quarters  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive surprise of 0 92  Bristol Myers Squibb Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   
 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter 
Why a Likely Beat 
Our proven model shows that Bristol Myers is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because it has two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for the same 
Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP for Bristol Myers is  0 28    You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Bristol Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat 
Note  we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Factors Driving Growth
Bristol Myers  key immuno oncology drug  Opdivo  is expected to be the primary revenue driver in the to be reported quarter  extending its previous performance  The drug  which is approved for multiple indications  generated sales of  1 8 billion in the first quarter  increasing 19  year over year 
Blood thinner drug  Eliquis  witnessed strong growth   28   and became the top revenue generator for the company in the first quarter  We expect the momentum to continue in the second quarter 
Oncology drug  Sprycel  is also maintaining momentum  In January  the FDA approved a label expansion of Sprycel  in combination with chemotherapy  to include pediatric patients aged a year or above with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive  Ph   acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL   The European Commission also approved the drug for the same indication in February  We expect the recent label expansion to boost sales of the drug in the second quarter 
Orencia and Yervoy should also continue their stellar performance in the second quarter  
However  the Hepatitis C and HIV businesses continue to face competitive pressure  Sales for the franchises are expected to decline 
Concurrent with the first quarter results  Bristol Myers reiterated its adjusted earnings and revenue expectations for 2019  The company projects earnings of  4 10  4 20 per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  4 16  It expects worldwide revenues to increase mid single digits 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter sales and earnings is pegged at  6 03 billion and  1 06  respectively 
Apart from the top  and bottom line numbers  investors will also focus on pipeline updates on label expansion of drugs  The phase III CheckMate 498 trial evaluating Opdivo plus radiation versus temozolomide plus radiation in patients with newly diagnosed O6 methylguanine DNA methyltransferase  MGMT  unmethylated glioblastoma multiforme  GBM  did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival  OS  at final analysis 
Moreover  CheckMate 459  a randomized phase III study evaluating Opdivo compared to Nexavar as a first line treatment in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC   also did not achieve statistical significance for its primary endpoint of overall survival  OS  
Key Anticipated Updates
Investors will also focus on further updates on the company s impending acquisition of Celgene Corp    NASDAQ CELG    The acquisition earlier was being opposed by a few large shareholders  Wellington and Starboard  of Bristol Myers  expressing multiple concerns regarding its growth following the acquisition  The acquisition was finally given a green signal a couple of months back 
Meanwhile  Bristol Myers needs to sell one of Celgene s blockbuster drugs  Otezla  to complete the impending merger on a timely basis in light of concerns expressed by the U S  Federal Trade Commission  FTC   We remind investors that the company has a tyrosine kinase 2  TYK2  inhibitor  BMS 986165  in its pipeline  which is being evaluated in several autoimmune diseases  including psoriasis 
The regulatory agency was concerned about a possible overlap between Otezla and BMS 986165 in the pipeline  Hence  Bristol Myers decided to sell Otezla 
Moreover  the company now expects to complete the merger by the end of 2019 or beginning of 2020  The divestiture of the drug also puts a question mark on the targeted synergies and anticipated sales of the combined company  per Bristol Myers 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some stocks you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

104795,326310,AGN,AbbVie  ABBV  Set To Report Q2 Earnings  What To Expect,opinion,"AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   is set to release its Q2 earnings before market open on Friday  AbbVie stock has performed very poorly YTD  falling 26  
 

 
Overview
AbbVie Inc  is an American biopharmaceutical company based in Illinois  AbbVie was established as a spin off of Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT  in 2013  AbbVie is the marketer and producer of Humira  the best selling drug in the world  Humira is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis  Crohn s disease  ulcerative colitis  and other issues related to these diseases 
AbbVie has also made a couple of acquisitions over the past couple of months  In June  AbbVie acquired Botox producer Allergan  NYSE AGN  plc for  63 billion  In July  AbbVie announced it would acquire Mavupharma  which would help bolster the company s cancer drug pipeline 
Since the Allergan acquisition announcement  ABBV stock has fallen 13   Currently  AbbVie shares are trading at 7 39 times earnings  which may make the stock seem undervalued compared to its industry s average P E of 14 37  However  ABBV s lower P E is most likely due to its falling stock price in recent months and may not be a good representation of the stock s value 
Additionally  AbbVie is a solid dividend stock  Since November 2017  AbbVie has increased its dividend three times  the most recent being an 11  increase that came in February 2019  The annual dividend is currently at  4 28  which amounts to a dividend yield of about 6 2  
Q2 Outlook   Earnings Trends
Revenues for Q2 are expected to fall 2  year over year from  8 28 billion to  8 10 billion  according to our Zacks Consensus Estimates  After years of year over year revenue growth  predictions suggest this will be the second quarter in a row of shrinking revenues 
 

 
In Q1  revenues fell 1 3  from Q1 2018  The primary source of the revenue decline was a decrease in international sales  International sales of Humira declined by nearly half a billion dollars  or over 25   Humira accounts for over 50  of AbbVie s revenue  so investors are clearly worried about the firm s overreliance on the drug 
Our  predict international Humira sales will slip by a similar amount again for Q2  While U S  sales are expected to increase slightly  from  3 521 billion in Q2 2018 to  3 785 billion  But this growth is simply not enough to make up for the expected international revenue decrease from  1 664 billion to  1 028 billion  The decrease in international Humira sales is a result of competition in Europe 
Meanwhile  AbbVie s earnings are expected to grow by 10 5   The quarterly growth will help contribute to an expected fiscal 2019 growth of 11 5   which would give fiscal EPS of  8 82 compared to  7 91 in 2018 
Bottom Line
Humira s patent in the U S  expired in 2016  but domestic competitors are not expected to hit the market until 2023 due to AbbVie s strong and persistent litigation leading up to the patent expiration  Until then  AbbVie needs to continue to grow its portfolio and the addition of Botox was a big one as it can help make up for some of the revenue that will be lost to Humira competitors  The firm s international competitors have already taken a large toll on AbbVie s revenue  And the arrival of domestic competitors will most likely have an even more significant impact on the company

104836,326351,AGN,Allergan  AGN  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q2 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Allergan  NYSE AGN  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This Botox maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 7  
Revenues are expected to be  3 91 billion  down 5 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 65  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Allergan 
For Allergan  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 52  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Allergan will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Allergan would post earnings of  3 55 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 79  delivering a surprise of  6 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Allergan appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allergan-agn-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q2-release-200441348,200441348

104865,326380,AGN,U S  pharma executives expect deals to pick up after tax overhaul,news,"By Caroline Humer and Carl O Donnell SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The Trump administration s tax overhaul should accelerate major acquisitions by drugmakers in 2018 after a slow year for deals in 2017  according to senior executives from some of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers  The  1 5 trillion bill  which U S  President Donald Trump signed into law in December  lowers the income tax rate for U S  companies to 21 percent from 35 percent  encourages them to repatriate cash  and modifies numerous deductions  Brent Saunders  chief executive officer of Allergan Inc  NYSE AGN   expects tax reform to finally clear the decks for big industry consolidation  Such moves will likely materialize over months as companies study the new bill and devise appropriate strategies   In the first half of the year  he expects to see more oncology deals like the one  Celgene Corp   NASDAQ CELG  announced on Sunday  a smaller acquisition of cancer drug developer Impact Biomedicines   Bigger  transformative deals   like the ones where large cap pharmaceutical companies consolidate with rivals and biotechnology players   will likely take longer  bankers said    I think the industry ultimately consolidates   Saunders said in an interview at the J P  Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco   I have a sense  though  in terms of a bigger wave of  mergers   it will either happen in the back half of 2018 or in 2019   The U S  pharmaceutical industry has been consolidating for years even without tax reform  Large companies like Merck  NYSE MRK    Co Inc  Bristol Myers Squibb Co and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  regularly buy or do licensing deals with small companies to help maintain a continuous pipeline of new medicines   But large scale deals   like Merck s  41 1 billion acquisition of Schering Plough in 2009  or  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  Inc s  68 billion purchase of Wyeth   have dried up   In early 2016  the Obama administration introduced rules that would punish companies for so called inversion deals  in which a U S  based acquirer bought a smaller firm overseas and moved the combined corporate headquarters abroad to benefit from lower tax rates  The move scuttled Pfizer Inc s proposed  160 billion purchase of Dublin based Allergan  Saunders said Allergan would only begin to look at smaller deals in the second half of the year as the company  known for its Botox anti wrinkle treatment  as it is currently focused on cost cutting  BRINGING BACK THE CASH Saunders  comments echo those of healthcare industry bankers  who say that uncertainty around the tax bill  drug pricing and Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare had cooled merger activity in 2017   Now that the tax law is in place  these bankers say  it should provide a catalyst to drugmaker deals by allowing them to repatriate billions of dollars in foreign profits held abroad  and by making it easier to agree on a value for their acquisition targets since they have a better idea of the company s tax rate   Several drugmakers have already announced plans to bring overseas cash into the United States  including  Amgen Inc   NASDAQ AMGN  and Bristol Myers  incurring some short term charges  Horizon Pharma CEO Tim Walbert said that when larger companies benefit from that repatriation of cash  they are likely to lift the whole market   To the extent that you see acceleration of large cap deals     that will bring more confidence in the sector and allow for more strategic opportunities for everyone   Walbert said  Horizon does not have substantial money parked overseas  and expects to continue its current strategy of small  and medium sized acquisitions for drugs treating rare diseases  its primary focus      DEALS TRENDED LOWER Drug industry deals have been trending lower for the past two years  Thomson Reuters data shows that in 2017  there were  52 billion worth of pharma and biotech deals  less than 25 percent of 2015 s  212 billion in deals and down from 2016 s  54 billion   Johnson   Johnson Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said during a conference session that one reason deals were not getting done was that companies needed to borrow money in the United States  and because it was difficult to structure a deal with low enough taxes  And Eli Lilly   Co CEO Dave Ricks said that among the uses for cash it repatriates   it has  10 billion overseas   would be more business development including the small  early stage mergers and acquisitions that are typical of the Indianapolis based drugmaker  Merck said that tax reform could spur large deals among companies that are focused on general cost savings  However  that is not Merck s deal focus  CFO Robert Davis said the company will continue to seek smaller acquisitions to enhance its portfolio of medicines   That being said  getting access now to foreign cash  in a way where you don t have to worry about the location of the cash will improve our flexibility    he said

104875,326390,AGN,Can Allergan  AGN  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Allergan  NYSE AGN   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Generic Drugs industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This Botox maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5 07  
For the most recent quarter  Allergan was expected to post earnings of  3 55 per share  but it reported  3 79 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 76   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  4 15 per share  while it actually produced  4 29 per share  a surprise of 3 37  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Allergan lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Allergan currently has an Earnings ESP of  2   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-allergan-agn-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200436836,200436836

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for AGN  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system

Investors should also note AGN s current valuation metrics  including its Forward P E ratio of 10 17  This represents a premium compared to its industry s average Forward P E of 6 61 
Investors should also note that AGN has a PEG ratio of 1 57 right now  The PEG ratio is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but this metric also takes the company s expected earnings growth rate into account  The Medical   Generic Drugs was holding an average PEG ratio of 1 at yesterday s closing price 
The Medical   Generic Drugs industry is part of the Medical sector  This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 103  putting it in the top 41  of all 250  industries

104878,326393,AGN,AbbVie  ABBV  Shares Down So Far This Year  Here s Why,opinion,AbbVie  Inc    NYSE ABBV   stock has declined 20 8  this year so far against an increase of 2 9  recorded by the  A couple of pipeline setbacks as well as erosion of sales of its blockbuster drug Humira in EU due to biosimilar launches hurt the stock this year despite several regulatory approvals and pipeline successes  Importantly  its proposed acquisition of Botox maker Allergan   NYSE AGN   last month did not go down well with investors as AbbVie s stock declined thereafter AbbVie s rationale behind the deal was to add a new blockbuster product to its portfolio  Allergan s Botox  as its own blockbuster drug  Humira faces patent expiration  Humira generics are already denting revenues in Europe  Moreover  biosimilars are expected to be launched in the United States in 2023  AbbVie is heavily dependent on Humira and is looking to diversify its portfolio  Approved for therapeutic and aesthetic use  Botox is a key top line driver for Allergan and AbbVie feels it could be the next revenue driver for AbbVie after Humira loses exclusivity  The acquisition is expected to close by early 2020  if all necessary approvals are obtained However  investors have their doubts as far as necessary approvals are concerned although the lack of overlapping products abates anticompetitive concerns  Some investors expressed concerns that AbbVie has overpaid for Botox as new competitive pressure loomslarge In February 2019  Evolus  Inc  s   NASDAQ EOLS   Jeuveau injection  indicated to improve the appearance of glabellar or frown lines  was approved by the FDA  which can pose competition to Botox  Revance Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ RVNC   is also developing RT002  a rival treatment to Botox for the frown lines indication  which has demonstrated longer duration of efficacy compared to Botox in late stage studies Meanwhile  AbbVie faced a couple of major pipeline setbacks this year late last year  which hurt stock price In early December  AbbVie   evaluating its cancer candidate rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova T in second line small cell lung cancer  SCLC   In March 2018  Rova T fell short of expectations in a phase II TRINITY study evaluating it in third line or later SCLC  Rova T was added to AbbVie s portfolio following the  5 8 billion acquisition of Stemcentrx in June 2016  The failure of TRINITY and the clinical hold on TAHOE raised skepticism about Rova T s potential and has brought into question the viability of the Stemcentrx deal  In March 2019  the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on all studies evaluating Venclexta for the treatment of multiple myeloma  The decision was taken after  in the ongoing phase III BELLINI study  a higher proportion of deaths were observed in the Venclexta arm compared to the control arm of the study  Though  in June  the partial clinical hold placed on CANOVA phase III study was lifted  all other multiple myeloma studies on Venclexta remain on partial clinical hold  In May  a phase III study evaluating AbbVie s pipeline candidate  depatuxizumab mafodotin  Depatux M  failed to show any survival benefit in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma  an aggressive form of brain cancer  Enrollment has been stopped in all ongoing Depatux M studies Though Humira has been performing well based on strong demand trends  direct biosimilar competition in Europe is eroding international revenues from the drug significantly  Several companies have made biosimilar versions of Humira  In the United States  per settlements with seven manufacturers  Humira biosimilars are expected to be launched in 2023  With Humira accounting for around 61  of AbbVie s sales  the entry of biosimilars would have a huge impact on the company s financials Nonetheless  AbbVie has been successful in expanding approvals for its cancer drugs  Imbruvica and Venclexta  AbbVie has an impressive late stage pipeline comprising several products with multibillion dollar potential expected to be launched in the near term  Key recent FDA approvals include that of Orilissa  elagolix  for management of pain associated with endometriosis  a common gynecologic disorder  in July 2018 and Skyrizi  risankizumab  for plaque psoriasis in April 2019  AbbVie estimates that both the drugs have multi billion dollar sales potential Another important pipeline candidate is upadacitinib  which is under review in the United States  PDUFA date  third quarter of 2019  and EU for rheumatoid arthritis and in late stage studies for Crohn s disease  psoriatic arthritis  ulcerative colitis  atopic dermatitis and giant cell arteritis  Risankizumab and upadacitinib have demonstrated differentiated clinical profiles versus Humira and are on track for launch in 2019 AbbVie currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment

104915,326430,AGN,AbbVie  ABBV  Stock Falls After  63 Billion Allergan Acquisition Announcement  ,opinion,"AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   stock fell over 15  through Tuesday morning trading  The significant drop came after the company announced that it will acquire Allergan PLC   NYSE AGN   in a deal worth approximately  63 billion  The drop brought AbbVie stock to a new 52 week low of  66 56 per share  Meanwhile  Allergan stock jumped about 27  after the news 

AbbVie and Allergan agreed on compensation of  120 30 in cash and 0 8660 ABBV shares per AGN share  This valued AGN stock at  188 24  a 45  premium from its closing price on Monday  AbbVie is the producer of the world s best selling drug Humira and Allergen is the producer of Botox 
Allergan shareholders still need to vote to approve the deal  but it looks to be a great one for Allergan as many analysts believed the company was headed toward a split to increase shareholder value  AbbVie  in its press release  stated that it expects  the Acquisition will provide annual pre tax synergies and other cost reductions of at least  2 billion in year three   Combined R D resources as well as a reduction in supply chain and manufacturing redundancies are said to be the main sources of these synergies 
Along with synergies  AbbVie expects the acquisition to provide significant cash flow generation  AbbVie and Allergan generated a combined operating cash flow of  19 billion in 2018  AbbVie is looking to use the new cash flow to reduce its debt and continue its dividend growth  which are reasons for investors to be happy 
AbbVie is heavily reliant on revenue from Humira  which brought in  20 billion in revenue last year  But AbbVie has been looking to diversify its portfolio as cheaper alternatives are already becoming available in Europe  Plus  AbbVie s patent on the drug will expire in 2023 in the U S  Adding Botox  the most popular cosmetic procedure in the U S   to its portfolio is a good way for AbbVie to diversify 
Allergan also has products in other major sectors  These sectors include neuroscience  eye care  women s health  cystic fibrosis  and cardiovascular and infectious diseases  Allergan s stock has struggled since an attempted merger with Pfizer  NYSE PFE   failed in 2016 in which Pfizer valued AGN at  363 63 per share  nearly double the amount AbbVie is set to pay 
Before Tuesday s announcement  AGN stock had fallen around 32  over the past 12 months  while ABBV was down over 15   The acquisition could provide a boost for AbbVie s stock down the road as it is projected to increase the company s cash flow as well as diversify its product portfolio

Shares of the company have soared 732 3  in the past year compared with the  s growth of 4 6  

 
AXS 05 is a novel  oral  investigational non competitive N methyl D aspartate  NMDA  receptor antagonist with multimodal activity under development for the treatment of central nervous system  CNS  disorder   The company is conducting a phase III STRIDE 1 study of AXS 05 in treatment resistant depression  TRD   and a phase II III ADVANCE 1  study in agitation associated with Alzheimer s disease  AD   The company completed a phase II ASCEND study in MDD  and a phase II study  in smoking cessation 
If successfully developed  AXS 05 will be the first orally administered NMDA receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of MDD  According to the company  the results of either the GEMINI study in MDD or the ongoing STRIDE 1 study  if positive  would  in combination with its previously completed ASCEND study  be sufficient to support the filing of an NDA for AXS 05 for the treatment of MDD  
The company expects top line results from both the STRIDE 1 and GEMINI studies in the second half of 2019

AbbVie is on the hunt for their next big revenue driver as their patent for the world s top selling drug  Humira  is nearing its end  AbbVie just made a  63 billion deal to acquire Dublin based Allergan in an attempt to keep their drive alive This deal would represent a roughly 45  premium over Allergan s closing price yesterday  ABBV investors aren t thrilled with this excessive premium at the end of an economic cycle with the stock falling over 15  so far today  AGN investors  on the other hand  couldn t be more thrilled with their stock surging north of 26  this morning and still 13  below the  188 per share offer price AbbVie   AllerganHumira makes up over 60  of AbbVie s top line and this patent is said to be expiring mid 2023  The Allergan acquisition would significantly boost their portfolio s diversification and reduce the reliance on Humira Allergan s top line has been driven by eye care products  which has been losing momentum  as well as its medical aesthetics segment  which is the firm s saving grace  Medical aesthetics  aka cosmetic appearance products  drives 40  of their revenue and continues to illustrate double digit expansion  Their neuroscience and urology segment has also been driving a lot of growth for Allergan These two pharmaceutical companies don t have an enormous amount synergies considering that their portfolios and pipelines don t overlap  The synergies will arise from distribution leverage  larger R D departments to push expansive pipelines  and portfolio diversification Although this premium appears high on paper  the actual valuation of AGN is much more reasonable  AGN is trading around its lowest forward P E since the company started below 8x  miles below the pharma industries 20x multiple  The transaction would value Allergan at 11

revenue slows to decline Take AwayThis acquisition could make or break these firms  As I said above  both these firms need to revitalize their top line and this merger could be the rejuvenating

104921,326436,AGN,AbbVie  Growth  Dividend Growth And Compelling Valuation,opinion,"Introduction
I have held AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  since it was originally spun off from Abbott Labs  NYSE ABT   Moreover  I have been aggressively adding to my position for clients needing current income and dividend growth  All in all  it has been an excellent performer in spite of the fact that it is being ridiculously undervalued by Mr  Market  No matter what widely accepted valuation measurement I look at  AbbVie appears insanely cheap 
As of yesterday s close  June 24  2019  AbbVie was trading at a blended P E ratio based on adjusted operating earnings of 9 4 offering a dividend yield of 5 5   This represents a significant discount to its historical normal P E ratio of 14 5 and its intrinsic value P E ratio of 15 
Furthermore  as of yesterday s close  AbbVie was also trading at a price to EBITDA of 7 8 which is a significant discount to its normal price to EBITDA of 10 9  Additionally  and I consider this important since AbbVie is a dividend growth stock  AbbVie s normal price to operating cash flow was 9 3 compared to its normal price to operating cash flow of 13 4 and its fair value price to operating cash flow of 15 
AbbVie was also trading at its lowest price to sales ratio of 3 66 since it was spun off and was available to investors at attractive double digit earnings yields and cash flow yields  But most importantly  all these incredible valuations were supported by strong above average historical growth and expectations for continued future growth in each of the above metrics 
On June 20  2019 AbbVie also maintained its  1 07 per share quarterly dividend which is in line to be a significant increase over last year s  3 95 dividend per share  Which by the way  is also well covered by both operating cash flow and free cash flow  Furthermore  according to Argus research in May of this year  AbbVie updated its adjusted earnings 2019 guidance to  8 73 to  8 83 which was up from its prior guidance of  8 65 to  8 75   Note  I will be elaborating on all these metrics and more later in the FAST Graphs analyze out loud video  
Why Are AbbVie s Valuations So Low 
Anyone who has been following AbbVie realizes that the company generates more than half its revenues from its flagship drug Humira which lost its patent protection outside of the US and faces competition from several recently launched biosimilars  However  Humira does not face greater competition from biosimilars in the US until 2023  Nevertheless  according to Argus research  Humira sales fell 23  to  1 23 billion outside the United States  This was in line with company guidance and they also project a 30  decline in Humira sales outside the US in all of 2019 
Humira sales growth in the United States increased 7 1  to  3 2 billion  However  although this is still strong growth  US sales growth has slowed from double digit rates in previous quarters  AbbVie has been fighting back with the recent approval of Skyrizi in both the US and Japan for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis which clinical trials showed it to be superior to Humira  Skyrizi is also on track for approval in Europe  However  this is only one of many candidates in AbbVie s pipeline  The following description of AbbVie Inc  NYSE ABBV   courtesy of the Wall Street Journal illustrates the diversity of their pipeline 
 AbbVie  Inc  is a research based biopharmaceutical company  which engages in the development and sale of pharmaceutical products  It focuses on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases in rheumatology  gastroenterology and dermatology  oncology  including blood cancers  virology  including hepatitis C virus  HCV  and human immunodeficiency virus  HIV   neurological disorders  such as as well as Parkinson s disease  metabolic diseases  comprising thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis  pain associated with endometriosis  and other serious health conditions  The company was founded on January 1  2013 and is headquartered in North Chicago  IL  
Nevertheless  AbbVie s valuation has been clearly impacted by people s fear of the potential loss of sales for Humira in the not so distant future  However  I think it s important to recognize that this future is still unknown  while AbbVie s current operating results remain excellent  and there is potential in AbbVie s pipeline to not only replace Humira sales but continue growing sales far into the future  Consequently  I am choosing to follow Warren Buffett s suggestion to be  greedy when others are fearful  
Although there is always risk in evaluating the pipeline of any pharmaceutical company  AbbVie clearly has a strong pipeline with numerous candidates in phase 3 and several recent approvals  For those who would like to take a deeper look at AbbVie s pipeline here s a link on their website 
 But That Was Yesterday And Yesterday s Gone 
As the English duo Chad and Jeremy so aptly put it in their 1963 hit   but that was yesterday and yesterday s gone   The preceding was the beginning of my article on AbbVie where I was planning on building the case that AbbVie s fundamentals were significantly stronger than their stock price  Nevertheless  today s announcement that AbbVie was acquiring Allergan  NYSE AGN  solidified and even enhanced my view on this blue chip dividend growth stock 
Suffice it to say that I agree with and even support management s decision to acquire Allergan  I agree with AbbVie s management that this transaction represented a  unique opportunity to acquire attractive and durable growth assets at a highly compelling value   Furthermore  I agree with the additional three highlights that AbbVie s management believes the Allergan transaction offers as depicted on the following slide 

The rest of the slideshow which highlights AbbVie s positions on why they think this is an excellent transaction is worth looking at closely and can be found here 
AbbVie s CEO Richard Gonzales provided his views on why he believes the purchase of Allergan makes good sense for AbbVie and its shareholders  The following excerpts from the video played on CNBC found here highlights his views 


Allergan Cheap Before the AbbVie Acquisition  Still Cheap Afterwards
AbbVie s  63 billion purchase of Allergan is essentially equal to the company s current total enterprise value  TEV  of  65 3 billion  On a per share basis the transaction works out to approximately  188 a share which is approximately a 45  premium to Allergan s closing price on July 24  2019  For Allergan shareholders the deal consists of  120 30 of cash and  8660 shares of the combined company 
To put this transaction into perspective I offer the following earnings and price correlated graph on Allergan where I put a magenta dot on the graph approximately indicating the price that AbbVie is acquiring Allergan at  The important takeaway is that AbbVie is purchasing Allergan shares at a discount to the company s intrinsic valuation and historical normal valuations 
Furthermore  I think the reader should note that Allergan was significantly overvalued in 2015 before earnings weakened  However  the reader should also note that the price reaction in 2018 and thus far in 2019 are clearly significant overreactions to a flattening of the company s operating earnings  Stated differently  Allergan remained a very profitable business where earnings growth merely slowed while stock price collapsed  Again  I believe that was a significant overreaction by the market that appears quite clear when viewing the graphic 

AbbVie Was Already Cheap But Just Got Cheaper
As I indicated in my intro  as of yesterday s close  June 24  2019  AbbVie was already extremely undervalued based on past  present and expected future operating performance  Furthermore  this was supported by virtually every widely used valuation metric  The following adjusted operating earnings and price correlated graph clearly tells that story  As the reader should note  earnings are expected to grow approximately 11  in 2019 which is the midpoint of company guidance as well as the consensus of leading analysts following the company  Furthermore  the reader should also note that earnings beyond 2019 were also expected to increase by 8  and 9  respectively for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 

Most importantly  the earnings expectations on the above graphic represent AbbVie s management and consensus leading analyst expectations for the company prior to the announced acquisition  As the following slide depicts  AbbVie s management expects those numbers to be exceeded as a result of the Allergan purchase  Consequently  AbbVie has become even more valuable today than it was yesterday considering the significant price drop coupled with the higher expected future growth

MorningStar published a stock analyst note this morning on the AbbVie transaction titled  AbbVie s Acquisition of Allergan Looks Opportunistic and Offers Diversification From Humira  In the analyst note MorningStar suggested that Allergan s portfolio of branded drugs should strengthen AbbVie s moat and that Allergan s pipeline and Botox entrenchment did not seem to be fully factored in Allergan s price  Consequently  they suggested that many of the fears over Humira biosimilar competition would be partially alleviated  Therefore  they continue to believe that AbbVie is undervalued  MorningStar also believes that the  2 billion in annual savings projected by AbbVie s management seems reasonable 
Barron s
At 2 05 PM June 25  2019 Barron s magazine reported that AbbVie shareholders will get no vote on the purchase of Allergan  They did suggest that even though shareholders of Allergan will vote on the sale they believe it s unlikely that it will face opposition considering the stock has increased over 26  thus far today

Summary and Conclusions
Although it is very difficult for many investors to accept the idea that the market often mis appraises the market value of publicly traded stocks  my personal experience tells me that it often does  Consequently  I have learned over the many years I ve been doing this to trust fundamentals more than I do short term price volatility  Moreover  my personal experience also tells me that short term market price behavior has a very insidious nature  Unfortunately  investors tend to trust and or believe more in significant levels of overvaluation  than they do significant levels of undervaluation 
To clarify further  investors will ignore the enormous danger of overvaluation and flee like rats from a burning building from the incredible opportunity of significant undervaluation  In other words  investors want to buy when they should sell and sell when they should buy  Therefore  it has never been a surprise to me that so few people make long term money investing in stocks  Stocks rarely recover from massive overvaluation  and almost always recover from significant undervaluation  Nevertheless  when emotions rule reason goes out the window 
Today s reaction to AbbVie s announcement that they were purchasing Allergan represents a quintessential case in point  Prior to the announcement  investors were fearful that AbbVie was going to suffer from the potential competition facing their flagship drug Humira  However  when management announced this transaction that in addition to other benefits should partially mitigate the potential reduction of future Humira sales  the market reacts negatively instead of the more logical positively  Oh  the peculiar illogic of Wall Street 
Personally  I have believed and continue to believe that AbbVie has a bright and profitable long term future ahead of it  After today s announcement  my belief is both solidified and enhanced  Furthermore  my beliefs are primarily based on the actual results that AbbVie is producing  and to a lesser extent on the company s future potential  Common sense suggests that all pharmaceutical companies face pipeline risks and AbbVie is no different  On the other hand  recent successes coupled with several drugs already in phase 3 and notwithstanding the Allergan pipeline suggests my confidence is not without justification 
Nevertheless  there are risks that the Allergan transaction will not go through  If that does happen  I still believe that AbbVie possesses the potential future growth that I showcased in the beginning of this article  Consequently  I believe that the Allergan opportunity represents potential icing on that cake  All stock investments possess risks  and AbbVie is certainly no exception  On the other hand  it is very rare to find a stock that possesses all the attributes and the incredible long term return opportunity that AbbVie currently does  The combination of an extremely high and fast growing current dividend yield coupled with incredible capital appreciation potential make this a risk worth taking  At least in my humble opinion  But with that said  I have elected to let the market digest this news before I add to my positions  which I eventually intend to do  Caveat emptor

104933,326448,AGN,Affimer   Potential Best In Class Antibody Mimetic,opinion,"Avacta is developing its Affimer technology for use in therapeutic and diagnostic reagent applications  The potential of the Affimer technology lies in its formatting capabilities  particularly in the creation of bispecific and TMAC Affimer drug conjugates  Its lead therapeutic asset  AVA004  is a programmed death ligand 1  PD L1  targeting Affimer for which the company expects to submit an investigational new drug  IND  application in Q420  AVA004 will serve as the first clinical validation of the Affimer technology and will form the base of the clinical development of a PD L1 LAG 3 bispecific  AVA021  and the first TMAC Affimer drug conjugate  AVA004 100   We value Avacta at  51m or 44p share 

Formatting capabilities point to future potential
Avacta is progressing its therapeutic Affimers towards the clinic with its PD L1  AVA004  and PD L1 lymphocyte activation gene 3  LAG 3   AVA021  product candidates expected to start oncology clinical trials in 2021 and 2022 respectively  Post the clinical validation of AVA004  we expect Avacta will focus on the development of the AVA021 bispecific  a component of which is AVA004  and its TMAC Affimer drug conjugate  AfDC   in collaboration with Tufts University  that targets PD L1 and uses an I DASH toxin together with a novel fibroblast activation protein  FAP   cleavable linker  AVA004 100  
TMAC drug conjugate into the clinic in 2020
Avacta has accelerated its tumour microenvironment activated drug conjugates  TMAC  programme and will now test the novel FAP  cleavable linker in a Phase I trial in 2020  The FAP  cleavable linker will be conjugated to a well known chemotherapeutic agent  doxorubicin  rendering it inactive until the linker is cleaved in the tumour microenvironment  The FAP  cleavable linker forms a key component of AVA004 100  for which Avacta expects to submit an IND application in late 2021 
Partnerships continue to validate technology
Avacta s partnerships continue to show the potential of Affimers for multiple applications  most recently it announced a deal with LG Chem worth over  300m    royalties  to develop a range of therapeutic Affimers  In February 2019  Moderna exercised its option on an Affimer developed in its partnership with Avacta 
Valuation   51m or 44p share
We value Avacta at  51m or 44p share based on a sum of the parts valuation built on an rNPV for AVA021  the LG Chem partnership and the peer valuation of the reagents diagnostic and animal health divisions  in addition to adding in net cash  AVA021  PD L1 LAG 3  contributes approximately 50  to our valuation

Investment summary
Company description  Antibody mimetics
Avacta is a UK biopharmaceutical company specialising in the development of its proprietary Affimer platform  Its lead assets are its PD L1 Affimer  AVA004   its PD L1 LAG 3 bispecific Affimer  AVA021  and its PD L1 TMAC drug conjugate  AVA004 100  for use in cancers  both in preclinical development  In addition to Avacta s therapeutic platform  it has a diagnostic reagents division and an animal health division  Avacta has multiple partnerships  notably with LG Chem  Moderna and Tufts University  Avacta raised net  10 9m in August 2018  c 46 000 shares at 25p share  and had net cash as of 31 January of  11 8m  In 2018  Avacta s average employee count grew to 114 compared with 103 in 2017 
Valuation   51m or 44p share
We value Avacta at  51m or 44p share  This is based on a sum of the parts model including a risk adjusted NPV of AVA021  PD L1 LAG 3 bispecific   rNPV   23 9m  and LG Chem research partnership  rNPV   7 7m  and a peer valuation of both its reagents and animal health divisions  c  7 2m   in addition to adding in net cash   11 8m   The main driver of our valuation is AVA021  which contributes approximately 50  of the total valuation  We assume AVA021 is out licensed before the Phase I start in 2022 and model c  300m of milestones split across an upfront payment  clinical and commercial milestones  Due to the early nature of its development  we model its market potential in a basket of relapsed refractory cancers that are PD L1 LAG 3 positive and for which patients have already received PD L1 treatment  This is benchmarked against the total PD L1 global market  resulting in approximate market penetration of 5   generating peak sales of c  800m  The next most advanced asset  the AVA004 100  PD L1 I DASH  product candidate  first product from the TMAC platform   is of significant scientific interest  however  due to the very early nature of development and the complexities involved in the asset  we await for its advancement into the clinic before considering its inclusion into our valuation  Potential significant upside exists if Avacta is successfully able to develop the TMAC platform  For the LG Chem partnership  we model the  180m milestone payments for the deal with payments spread to 2030 on assumed classical drug development timelines  eg Phase I start  
Sensitivities  Clinical validation needed
Avacta is subject to the risks typically associated with biotech company drug development  including the possibility of unfavourable outcomes in clinical trials  trial shortfalls or failures  cash flow limitations  success of competitors and negative commercial decisions by partners or potential partners  Cancer immunotherapy has become a highly competitive landscape and Avacta s technology platforms are still in relatively early stages of development  The key short term sensitivities for Avacta relate to crystallising value from the early stage pipeline  particularly the PD L1 LAG 3 bispecific  AVA021   Additionally  the entry of the first Affimer into the clinic  PD L1 Affimer  will be critical inflection point for the company as the technology is tested in humans for the first time  If Affimers are found to be immunogenic or generate severe side effects  it would affect any potential applications  We note AVA021 represents 50  of our valuation and any failure of the asset or changes to timings would materially affect our valuation 
Financials  Cost base expected to rise as the clinic approaches
The net loss for H119 was  5 2m  vs  3 95 in H118  driven by the decrease in revenues and increase in R D investment  Net cash at 31 January 2019 was  11 79m and we forecast a current cash reach into 2020  We forecast illustrative debt of  10m in 2020 to fund operations into 2021 
Affimers  First human data will be a key inflection point
Avacta is built around its proprietary Affimer platform of engineered proteins  acquired IP in 2012  current patents   which are engineered to possess binding capabilities similar to antibodies  antibody mimetics   Since the FDA approved the first antibody in 1985  muromonab   antibodies have become the dominant therapeutic options for countless diseases with total sales of antibodies recently reaching  120bn globally in 2018  source  EvaluatePharma   Although antibodies are  and will continue to be  the dominant therapeutic option in many diseases  there are numerous disadvantages including their relatively bulky size  complexity in creation and manufacturing  difficulties in formatting  making drug conjugates  bispecifics etc  and a high cost of production 
Avacta has developed Affimers to address many of these problems and offer an array of potential advantages including high expression levels  in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells   customisable kinetics  Koff  Kon etc   stability  AVA04 demonstrated stability up to seven months in phosphate buffered saline at 4 C  and solubility  400mg ml dimeric Affimers  200mg Affimer Fc   One of the key capabilities of Affimers is their formatting flexibility which allows the relatively simple construction of complex molecules such as TMAC drug conjugates  AVA004 100  and bispecifics  AVA021   This could be an important differentiator for the platform  While technically promising  the platform remains in its infancy  not yet tested in humans  and significant risk remains in their ability to perform in a therapeutic clinical context  Questions including whether Affimers will generate an unwanted immune reaction and subsequently be neutralised in the body  preclinical data to date have determined a non immunogenic nature   whether they are therapeutically safe and if there inherently short half life will limit efficacy are all still to be answered  formatting with other component as a bispecific or AfDC will increase half life   Key to Avacta s future prospects will be it rapidly achieving Affimer data in human patients  IND forecast to be submitted for AVA004 in Q420  
All therapeutic Affimers are based on stefin A  Exhibit 1   a human protease inhibitor  They are typically 12 14kDa in size  approximately 10 fold smaller than antibodies   which brings the advantage of typically better tissue penetration and increased packing density  for diagnostics reagent applications   However  their small size means Affimers have a relatively short half life  hours   This can sometimes be advantageous in limiting systemic toxicity  the Affimer acts at site of interest and is cleared from the body before it has a chance to act elsewhere   there are often multiple scenarios where a longer half life is need  Avacta has developed half life extending technologies in the form of serum albumin binding  Affimer XT platform  to address this  Preclinical data to date have demonstrated minimal disruption of Affimer binding to its target when using the XT format  Additionally  the ease of formatting of Affimers means novel drug conjugates and multi specific Affimers can be created  which offer unique ways to increase the half life 
Affimers are selected by phage display   1010 library size  and produced in E  Coli protein expression systems  The time between the initial screen of the Affimer to animal models is typically six months  putting it on par with therapeutic antibody development  Lot to lot variability is a common problem for antibodies  mainly for polyclonal and less so for monoclonal and synthetic   however  as Affimers are manufactured by a non eukaryotic process there is more lot to lot consistency  Due to Affimers  simple  stable  known structure  they can be easily functionalised  which aids in the ability to produce drug conjugates of bispecific molecules without the loss of binding or stability 
While the aforementioned capabilities are key for Affimers to differentiate themselves from antibodies  one key strength is the unencumbered patent protection Avacta holds on the technology  This is a result of Affimers not being based on antibodies and gives Avacta freedom to operate in areas where antibody patents exist and  for example  allows it to go after many well known targets  eg PD L1  without infringing on other antibody patents and is a significant attraction for potential partners 
Therapeutic pipeline
Avacta has multiple Affimer assets in early stage development  Exhibit 2  across three key technology areas  checkpoint antagonists  AVA004 and AVA017   costimulatory agonists  AVA026 and AVA023  and drug conjugates  AVA004 100   Although AVA004  AVA017 and AVA023 are similar to other assets in development in the sector  its Affimer TMAC drug conjugates  of which AVA004 100 is the most advanced  could prove be a key driver of value in the long term  The Affimer TMAC drug conjugates are based around a FAP  cleavable linker that connects a deadly toxin with a tumour targeting Affimer  The FAP  cleavable linker is cleaved in the tumour microenvironment  demonstrated to date by data in animal and in vitro models  and it could enable the localised release of tumour killing toxins in humans  Combined with the multiple formatting options of Affimers  a range of possible combinations and product candidates could emerge  The proprietary  FAP   cleavable linker to be used in AVA004 100 will be tested separately next year  while an IND application testing the full Affimer drug conjugate is expected to be submitted for AVA004 100 in late 2021 
Its most advanced asset in the pipeline is AVA004  a PD L1 targeting Affimer for which Avacta expects to submit an IND application by the end of 2020  Most recently it was announced that a clinical development candidate has been selected for AVA004 and that the Phase I study is expected to test AVA004 in 20 to 30 patients with PD L1 positive solid tumours  The trial will test both intravenous and subcutaneous routes of administration  This clinical trial will provide the first proof of concept for Affimers in humans and would de risk the entire platform if successful  While the data produced by AVA004 will be informative  we do not expect Avacta to progress the asset past Phase I trials and will instead utilise it to inform the design of its bispecific PD L1 LAG3 AVA021 and drug conjugate AVA004 100 trials  We believe this decision will be driven by the significantly increased potential value of developing  if successful  a unique therapy instead of a similar version of an already available commercial product  eg another PD L1 monotherapy in the case of AVA004   We believe long term value for Avacta is developing the AVA021 bispecific  component of which is AVA004   which is expected to enter the clinic in 2022 and its TMAC AfDC  in collaboration with Tufts University  that targets PD L1 and uses an I DASH toxin  AVA004 100  coupled together with a FAP  cleavable linker  IND filling expected in H221  

Checkpoint antagonists  PD L1 and LAG 3
Avacta s lead assets are based on targeting PD L1 and LAG 3  The most advanced is AVA004  in development as a PD L1 inhibitor  Avacta expects to submit an IND by end 2020 with data potentially in 2021  This will be a major inflection point for Avacta as it will represent the first human dataset for an Affimer  As usual  the initial Phase I trial will focus on safety but evidence of efficacy could prove an important early indicator of how the Affimer technology compares to antibodies  particularly PD L1 inhibitors  Preclinical mouse model data have demonstrated that AVA004 produced comparable changes in tumour volume to that of atezolizumab  Tecentriq   Exhibit 3  and avelumab  Bavencio  and durvalumab  imfinzi   We forecast that AVA04 will not be developed past Phase I  as it will have enabled the proof of concept of Affimer technology in humans  and Avacta will focus on AVA021  LAG 3 PD L1 bispecific  and AVA004 100  PD L1 I DASH AfDC  
AVA017 is designed to be an Affimer LAG 3 inhibitor  It is in lead optimisation and Avacta expects to select a lead candidate in H219  Avacta has no plans to develop AVA017 as a monotherapy into the clinic and will utilise it as part of AVA021  which will combine AVA017 and AVA004 into an LAG 3 PD L1 bispecific  Avacta predicts the first patient is likely to be treated with AVA021 in 2022 

Since the commercial launch of Keytruda  Merck  and Opdivo  Bristol Myers Squib  in melanoma in 2014  PD L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  ICIs  have become the standard of care in many cancers  FY18 sales of Opdivo and Keytruda were  7 6bn and  7 2bn respectively   PD L1 is a transmembrane protein that plays a key role in immune regulation  The binding of receptor PD 1 to its ligand PD L1 activates suppressive signals that limit immune activation  an effect that cancerous cells exploit to limit the response against them  PD L1 inhibitors have been developed to try and prevent this immune suppression and have proven successful across a range of cancers  PD L1 ICIs  alone or in combination  have quickly become the standard of care for many patients  however  the best responses generally remain confined to high PD L1 expressing patients  For example  Keytruda s approved label  Keynote 042  in stage three non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  demonstrated it had a 39  overall response rate  ORR  as a monotherapy in first line patients whose tumour proportion score  TPS  for PD L1 expression was above 50   however  in a broader patient population  TPS score of 1  and above   the ORR fell to 27   Across indications  companies are now looking to test ICIs in combination with other treatments to broaden their therapeutic window  Avacta is aiming to address this with assets including its AVA021 bispecific and its first TMAC Affimer drug conjugate AVA004 100 
LAG 3 demonstrating potential in the clinic
Like PD L1  LAG 3  also known as CD233  is a transmembrane protein immune checkpoint receptor found on T cells  LAG 3 is typically upregulated to control T cell activation and prevent over activation of T cells  and subsequent autoimmunity   In cancer models it has been demonstrated that persistent expression of antigens to T cells enables continuous LAG3 expression and subsequently T cell exhaustion  limited killing  proliferation and cytokine production   It is thought that inhibition of LAG 3 could prevent T cell exhaustion and lead to tumour killing activity  The target has received significant interest and there are currently 45 LAG 3 trials ongoing  according to clinicaltrials gov  either alone or in combination with other therapies  One of the most advanced is relatlimab  Bristol Myers Squib  and is in 19 active studies across multiple cancer types  the most advanced of which is a Phase III study testing relatlimab in combination with nivolumab  Opdivo  in first line advanced melanoma 
Data were presented at ESMO 2017 on the combination of relatlimab and nivolumab in melanoma patients who have previously progressed on anti PD L1 therapy  Overall  n 68  ORR  one complete response  six partial responses  and disease control rate  DCR  were 11 5  and 49  respectively  In patients with LAG 3 expression  1   the ORR was 18   n 33  compared with 5  in patients with LAG 3 expression  1   n 22   The combination demonstrated a similar AE profile to that of nivolumab alone 
Multiple other LAG 3 antibodies are in development  GSK GSK2831781  MacroGenics  MGD013  Merck  MK 4280   notably FS118 from F star  a bispecific  targets LAG 3 and PD L1  that is in a Phase I trial across a range of advanced metastatic cancers  expected enrolment of 51 patients   F star originally partnered FS118 with Merck in 2017  however  it has recently had the rights returned and will now develop and commercialise it 
Whether a LAG 3 PD L1 bispecific will be more potent than separate mAbs in combination has yet to be clinically determined  however  early pre clinical data hint at the potential  Data on AVA021  LAG 3 PD L1 bispecific  remain early but recently presented data  at the Avacta R D day  February 2019  demonstrated that in ELISA binding assays  AVA021 bound PD L1 and LAG 3 as well as single target Affimers  Exhibit 4   demonstrating the conjugation of the two Affimers did not affect binding  More advanced pre clinical data demonstrating the potential of a LAG 3 PD L1 bispecific come from F star  which demonstrated in a colon carcinoma mouse model that FS118 more potently inhibited tumour growth than a combination of an LAG 3 mAb and PD L1 mAb  Recently F star presented data at ASCO 2019 from its enrolling Phase I trial that demonstrated no dose limiting toxicities were observed to date in the first 29 patients recruited 

Partners  Affimers attractive across applications
Avacta s range of partnerships continues to demonstrate the potential of Affimers for multiple applications  Exhibit 5   These include classical discovery partnerships with LG Chem and Moderna  deals focused on specific applications such as the development of AfDCs with Tufts University and partnerships focused on testing the potential of Affimers in cell and gene therapies with Oncosec and Memorial Sloan Kettering 

Tufts Bach Biosciences  Novel conjugate potential
The collaboration with Tufts Bach Biosciences aims to develop novel AfDC using Tufts novel linker chemistry that is designed to release attached drugs in the tumour microenvironment  This TMAC platform coupled with the Affimer technology could generate a unique pipeline of assets  The first proof of concept AfDC will involve the use of a PD L1 Affimer  AVA004 100  PD L1 I DASH   an FAP  cleavable linker and an I DASH small molecule inhibitor  Exhibit 6   Avacta recently accelerated its TMAC programme and will now test the novel FAP  cleavable linker in a Phase I trial in 2020  The FAP  cleavable linker will be conjugated to a well known chemotherapeutic agent  doxorubicin   rendering it inactive until the linker is cleaved in the tumour microenvironment  The FAP  cleavable linker is key to Avacta s drug conjugate ambitions and these clinical data will be an important inflection point for the technology  The first Affimer drug conjugate to use the FAP  cleavable linker is AVA004 100  for which Avacta expects to submit an IND application in late 2021 

The third component of AVA004 100 is the I DASH inhibitor  The inhibition of DASH enzymes has been demonstrated both in preclinical and clinical populations to promote tumour regression  Positive Phase II study in NSCLC   However  one of the key problems with DASH inhibitors to date has been the dose limiting toxicities commonly associated with chemotherapies  Phase III trial testing talabostat receives a clinical hold and is later terminated   Avacta and Tufts believe AfDC can address the toxic problems seen with DASH inhibitors as administration of I DASH is theorised to be limited to the tumour microenvironment  Additionally  the inherently short half life of Affimers could be beneficial in reducing toxicity  however  it could limit efficacy  As AVA004 100 remains in the early stages of development  clinical data will be needed to confirm or disprove these hypotheses 
Reagents and diagnostics  Stable base
Avacta s reagent and diagnostic division  a separate team based in Wetherby  therapeutics team based in Cambridge  continues to be a key component of the business and Avacta continues to develop in house technologies with the aim of providing a stable revenue base for the company  The ability of Affimers to retain their chemical and thermal stability in a wide array of environments means the technology is suited to a variety of applications  combine this with the ability to easily functionalise Affimers with an array of compounds  enzymes  dyes etc  and Affimers quickly present themselves as ideal research tools 
Avacta has ongoing paid technology evaluations with numerous undisclosed partnerships  including global in vitro diagnostic  pharma  biotech and bioprocessing companies  Avacta is pursuing three commercialisation strategies 
Paid for evaluations of Affimer technology with the aim to generate licence deals where the technology is incorporated into partner products  multiple evaluations ongoing  
Custom Affimer services to support partner in house R D  eg anti idiotypics  
Development of diagnostic assays to be partnered out  Aim to generate two diagnostic assets with supporting data packages during 2019  with the aim of out licensing them once the work is complete 
Paid for evaluations and the development of diagnostic assays remain important for the long term growth of the division  In the short term  custom reagents  particularly anti idiotypics  remain important income generators and continue to demonstrate revenue growth  Anti idiotypics are antibodies or  in Avacta s case  Affimers that bind to the idiotope  variable part of an antibody that includes the unique antigen binding site  of another antibody  These are needed in setting up pharmacokinetic assays that measure total or free drug levels in pre clinical clinical samples  an important step in the drug creation process 
Anti idiotypics are a significant growth area for Avacta  It recently launched a marketing campaign and set up multiple new contracts   40k revenue per anti idiotypics   As the majority of antibodies in development will typically need an anti idiotypic  Avacta believes there is significant market potential and estimates an ongoing revenue stream of several million pounds at peak  We note that while Affimers potentially offer advantages in the creation of anti idiotypics  market leaders such as Bio Rad will be difficult to displace 
In October 2018  Avacta agreed an Affimer reagent licensing deal with NEB to commercialise a product incorporating Affimer technology  The product is for use in both life science research and diagnostic assays and is in final stages of testing  Under the terms of the agreement  Avacta will receive royalties on sales  may occur as soon as this year   NEB and Avacta will continue their collaboration with the aim to generate further products

Avacta Animal Health remains a legacy of the original Avacta business before the acquisition of the Affimer IP in 2012  Employing approximately 20 people  Avacta Animal Health is focused on four main categories  allergy diagnostic tests  immunotherapy vaccine sales  export sales and contract research organisation services  Trading in H119 was broadly in line   0 69m vs  0 77m in H118  with H118 and Avacta expect a pick up in H219 numbers as the seasonal effects of the allergy business boost sales  The division continues to market its capabilities with the pet allergy awareness campaign in its fifth year  In the long term we expect Avacta to spin off or sell the animal health division as it continues to focus on its therapeutic ambitions 
Antibody mimetics continue to generate interest
As the limits of antibody technology become ever clearer  more investment is being made into the sector to develop antibody mimetic technology  Here we highlight a few key competitors 
Molecular Partners  MOLN  is a Switzerland listed biotechnology company  market cap  CHF340m  focused on developing its DARPin platform  The platform is based on a large library  1012  of small proteins with single domains  15kDa  that are used as building blocks for its therapeutic molecules  currently up to six DARPin proteins can be linked together   Multiple assets are in clinical trials with lead assets MP0250  inhibit VEGF and HGF  in multiple myeloma and Abicipar  inhibit VEGF  in wet age related macular degeneration  Abicipar is in development with its partner Allergan  NYSE AGN   which expects to file a BLA in H119  Recently a clinical trial testing MP0250 in combination with Tagrisso in EGFR mutated NSCLC was placed on clinical hold due to adverse events 
Pieris Pharmaceuticals  PIRS  is a Nasdaq listed biotechnology company  market cap   184m  focused on developing its Anticalin technology  The technology is built on engineered lipocalins  a family of proteins that transport small hydrophobic molecules  18 40KDa   which  in a similar vein to Affimers  have a ridged backbone and a  four loop  variable region  Its most advanced assets are in Phase I clinical trials  including a PRS 343  a 4 1BB HER2 bispecific being tested in a range of HER2 positive solid cancers and PRS 060 a IL4Ra inhibitor for use in asthma  partnered with AstraZeneca  
Bicycle Therapeutics  BCYC  is a recently Nasdaq listed biotechnology company  23 May  market cap   278m  focused on developing its bicycle technology  Bicycles are short synthetic peptides constrained to form two loops to stabilise their structure and form regions for binding  The company has one asset in the clinic  BT1718  which targets membrane Type 1 Matrix Metalloproteinase  MT1 MMP  and is believed to be indicated in cancer metastasis  A Phase I trial  carried out by Cancer Research UK  in an array of solid tumours is ongoing 
As evidenced by MOLN  PIRS and BCYC  there is significant investor interest in antibody mimetic platforms  particularly those with clinical assets 
Valuation   51m or 44p share
We value Avacta at  51m or 44p share  Our sum of the parts valuation allows the assessment of a diverse set of technologies that have different applications albeit all based on the same Affimer technology  This is outlined below 
The Affimer therapeutic platform based on rNPV of its PD L1 LAG 3 bispecific and LG Chem research partnership examined against comparative transactions and recent IPOs 
The Affimer reagents  research and diagnostics  business  based on a sales multiple 
The Affimer animal health business based on a sales multiple 

Affimer therapeutic platform
We base our rNPV of the Affimer therapeutic platform on AVA021  PD L1 LAG 3  and the LG Chem research partnership  We do not value the rest of the early stage pipeline or any other partnership 

For AVA021  we model its market potential in a basket of relapsed refractory cancers  which are PD L1 LAG 3 positive and for which patients have already received PD L1 treatment  The early nature of its development means the exact cancer population that AVA021 will be tested in has not yet been defined  Based on comparative trial with F star s PD L1 LAG 3 bispecific FS118  which is being tested in a Phase I trial in an array of advanced metastatic cancers following progression on PD L1 treatment  We believe a similar trial design is reasonable for Avacta  In the long term  the competitive positioning of AVA021  if clinically successful   particularly the cancer in which it is used  will be key to any success  We assume AVA021 is out licensed pre Phase I start  but after initial Phase I data from the PD L1 Affimer AV004  in 2022 and model in c  300m of milestones split across an upfront payment  clinical and commercial milestones  We have additionally assumed a tiered royalty rate of between 5  to 10  and a launch probability of 2 5   Our model is benchmarked against the total PD L1 global market resulting in approximate market penetration of 5   generating peak sales of c  800m in the US and EU  We will update our AVA021 model accordingly as the clinical programme progresses  We forecast a launch in both the EU and US in 2030 at a starting price of c  100 000 in the US and at a 30  discount in the EU 
For the LG Chem partnership we model the  180m milestone payments for the deal with payments spread to 2030 on assumed classical drug development timelines  eg Phase I start   however  as we have no information on the therapeutic indication or target  significant sensitivity relates to these timelines  and milestones could be spread over longer or shorter periods or could not be received at all  We also do not model royalties due to a lack of information on potential patient populations  We forecast that the first Affimer will enter a Phase I clinical trial in 2022 and will update our model once more information is available 
While the other assets in the pipeline are important for Avacta s long term ambitions  we have limited visibility over their development  While AVA004  PD L1  is more advanced then AVA021 we note that there are no plans to develop it past Phase I trials as Avacta plans to focus its late stage development on AVA021 once AVA004 has provided proof of concept of Affimers in humans  Additionally  due to the crowded PD L1 market we believe AVA004 has little commercial potential on its own although its unique IP position  as an Affimer  could be attractive to partners 
The next most advanced asset  the AVA004 100  PD L1 I DASH  product candidate  is of significant scientific interest  however  due to the very early nature of development and the complexities involved in the asset  we await for its advancement into the clinic before considering its inclusion into our valuation  We additionally note that Avacta has multiple partnerships outside of the LG Chem deal  however  due to limited financial visibility on these partnerships we do not include them in our valuation 
Reagents diagnostics and animal health
We value the reagents and diagnostics divisions on a sales multiple of a relevant comparable  In 2012 German monoclonal antibody company Morphosys divested its research antibody business Antibodies by Design  AbD Serotec  to research tools company Bio Rad to focus on its human therapeutic antibody business  AbD  which had FY12 sales of  18 3m  was divested for  53m  which included cash in the business of  5m  This implies an enterprise value  EV  of  48m and a sales multiple of 2 62x 
We have estimated the FY18 sales of Avacta Animal Health and Avacta Reagents to have been  1 57m and  1 19m  not including assumed milestone payments  respectively  Combining the sales of the Avacta services businesses and the implied AbD sales multiple  we derive a component valuation for the Avacta services businesses of  7 24m  While the AbD services business was much more mature than Avacta s services businesses with c 6x the sales of Avacta s reagents and animal health businesses  we have not included any growth in Avacta s services businesses  despite Avacta s FY19 sales targets for the services business growing by 25  to  1 5m 
Benchmarks  Upside potential on entering the clinic
Due to the early nature of Avacta s therapeutic assets and the range of variables in a potential valuation  we have benchmarked our sum of the parts valuation for Avacta to recent relevant deals and IPOs 
On the deal front  the transaction signed between F star  a private Cambridge  UK based preclinical stage developer of bispecific antibody fragments and Merck for an anti LAG 3 PD L1 bispecific  FS118  provides a useful comparison  The deal was signed in June 2017 on the basis of preclinical data and included payments of  115m in the first two years for a total transaction value of  1bn  While we note that the ownership of F stars PD L1 LAG3 bispecific FS118 has been recently transferred back to F star  we believe the comparison still valid  Utilising a risk adjusted VC  venture capital  based methodology  a 15 year timespan of milestone payments  a 12 5  discount rate and a 50  risk adjustment for whether a similar deal would be signed we obtain a  201m valuation including Avacta s cash and services business 
Alternatively  substituting the exit valuation of the F star transaction with the average IPO valuations  less cash  or enterprise valuations  of two recent relevant NASDAQ IPOs  Harpoon Therapeutics and Bicycle Therapeutics  both in Phase I for their lead assets  results in a VC valuation of Avacta plus its cash and the services businesses of  82m 
Based on these benchmarks we believe Avacta s sum of the parts valuation of  54m or 47p share is valid considering the pre clinical status of its lead asset 
Financials  Funded into 2020
H119 revenue was  0 97m  a 44  decrease from H118   1 47m  driven by a significant reduction in life sciences revenue to  0 29m  vs  0 69m in 1H18   This was a result of the planned reduction in Moderna R D income as development at Avacta completed and assets were transitioned to Moderna  In H219  Avacta expects revenue to pick up as the LG Chem partnership comes online and we forecast FY19 revenues of  3 2m  vs FY18   2 8m  driven by income from LG Chem and Moderna in addition to the reagents diagnostics and animal health divisions  We note a substantial increase in FY20 revenue compared with previous years due to the assumption of additional milestone payments from LG Chem 
Admin expenses remained one of the biggest contributors to the cost base and increased slightly to  4 12m  vs H118   4 0m   COGS fell in the period from  0 46m in H118 to  0 31m in H119 and R D costs increased substantially to  2 41m  vs H118   1 47m  as a result of increased investment in the Affimer therapeutics programmes  We forecast FY19 administrative costs of  8 6m  vs FY18   8 5m   COGS of  0 83m  vs FY18   0 9m  and R D of  6 1m  vs FY18   3 8m   The substantial y o y increase in R D costs is a result of the expected ramp in AVA004 related expenses as the asset moves towards the clinic 
Net loss for H119 was  5 2m  vs  3 95 in H118  driven by the aforementioned decrease in revenues and increase in R D costs  We forecast FY19 net loss of  10 5m 
Net cash as of 31 January 2019 was  11 79m  mainly as result of the net  10 9m capital raise in August 2018  We forecast a cash reach into 2020  however  we forecast a cash raise  by illustrative debt  in 2020 of  10m to fund operations into 2021  This is for illustrative purposes only and the funding gap could be provided by additional partnerships  an equity raise or debt  Further funding needs beyond 2021 will predominately depend on the income received from new and existing business and the ramp of R D costs in relation to the clinical programmes ",2019-06-14,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/affimer--potential-bestinclass-antibody-mimetic-200431518,200431518

104938,326453,AGN,Ironwood s Linzess Lowers Abdominal Symptoms In IBS C Patients,opinion,"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ IRWD   along with partner Allergan   NYSE AGN   announced positive top line data from the phase IIIb study on Linzess  linaclotide  for treating multiple abdominal symptoms in adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation  IBS C  
The study met both primary and secondary endpoints with statistical significance and showed that Linzess improved the overall abdominal symptoms of bloating  pain and discomfort in adult patients with IBS C as compared to placebo 
Shares of Ironwood were up almost 8 1  following this news on Tuesday  In fact  the stock has rallied 11  so far this year  outperforming the  rise of 6 6  

 
Linzess is marketed to treat IBS C as well as chronic idiopathic constipation  CIC  in the United States and across 30 other countries  It is commercialized in collaboration with Allergan in the United States  Ironwood and Allergan co develop and co commercialize Linzess and equally share the U S  collaboration profits or losses as well as development costs of the drug 
Linzess is marketed by Allergan for IBS C in Europe and Canada under the brand name  Constella 
However  in the United States  majority of adult IBS C patients complain of symptoms  such as abdominal bloating  pain and discomfort at least once a week  If approved  this new indication would expand the eligible patient population for the drug and drive its sales higher 
This double blind placebo controlled phase IIIb study evaluated the safety and efficacy of Linzess 290 mcg in adult IBS C patients  who took the drug once daily for 12 weeks  followed by a four week withdrawal period  The primary efficacy endpoint measured the change in patients  abdominal score based on daily assessments of their abdominal bloating  discomfort and pain  Additional endpoints included change in the spontaneous bowel movement frequency  complete spontaneous bowel movement frequency  stool consistency and straining 
Ironwood plans to present additional results from this analysis at an upcoming scientific conference and via peer reviewed publications 
Notably  Linzess has performed encouragingly on the back of strong demand and expansion in new patient population and geographical regions  Sales of Linzess were impressive in 2018 and the drug also started 2019 on a strong note  It generated net sales of  161 3 million in the United States during the first quarter of 2019  Label expansion and approval in new countries for this medicine are driving its sales higher  The product is set to achieve a blockbuster status by 2020 end 
Earlier this month  Ironwood and Allergan initiated its dosing in the phase II study on MD 7246  a delayed release version of Linzess  The study is evaluating the candidate on patients suffering abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome alongside diarrhea  IBS D   Top line data from the study are expected in the second half of 2020 
Earlier this January  Linzess received an approval in China for IBS C  The company along with its partner AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN   will launch the same in the country in the second half of 2019  This  in turn  is likely to boost Ironwood s top line 
Zacks Rank   Key Pick
Ironwood currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A better ranked stock in the same sector is Evotec AG   OTC EVTCY    which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
Evotec s earnings estimates have been revised 14 4  upward for 2019 and 41 2  for 2020 over the past 60 days  The stock has surged 32 7  year to date

104962,326477,AGN,Orexo  A Robust Q1 Despite A Seasonally Weak Market,opinion,"Orexo AB  ST ORX  s Q119 results reinforced its continuing profitability with total revenues rising 25  y o y to SEK174 3m  Zubsolv led the revenue charge comprising 93  of total revenues and growing 23  y o y despite the seasonally weak first quarter of the opioid use dependency market  The effect on US Zubsolv  which increased in price by 4  from January 2019  from four Suboxone film generic entrants is so far minor 

No real surprises in Q119
Growth of 23 3  in US Q119 Zubsolv revenues to SEK161 7m  SEK131 1m in Q118  continues to dominate Orexo s investment case with a growing product despite an increasingly genericised market  Cost control continues to be a focus  with Orexo s gross margin rising to 85  from 65  in Q118  This helped Q119 profit after tax rise to SEK14 1m compared to SEK25 9m in Q118  when traditionally Q1 is a loss making quarter  This Q1 result was despite R D investment in the pipeline and SEK49m in IP litigation costs  Orexo s cash balance increased to SEK647 4m  SEK437 5m at the end of Q118   With litigation costs now expected to have a minor role for the rest of this year  the use of Orexo s growing cash balance in M A and in licensing transactions will play an important role in diversifying the company s future  The impact of the four generic Suboxone entrants on Zubsolv has been thankfully minor  but the changing market share dynamics will need to be closely watched  Ex US Zubsolv partnerships in 2019 should be expected 
Litigation costs to decline in an appeal process
The earlier decision taken by the US District Court regarding patent  996 is unchanged  The court s recent decision held that Actavis  NYSE AGN  does not infringe patent  996 for its generic versions of Subutex and Suboxone  and we did not include any award for damages in our model  We have increased our FY19 total operational cost estimate mainly driven by a one off SG A expense to SEK538m  which remains close to Orexo s c SEK500m guidance  Irrespective of declining IP legal costs for the remainder of FY19  Orexo s  330 and  996 patents remain in force  ensuring US Zubsolv exclusivity until 2032 
Valuation  A number of moving parts
Our valuation takes into account a number of changes in the quarter and moves from SEK3 42bn or SEK97 7 per share to SEK3 52bn or SEK98 62 per share  Foreign exchange rates carried forward largely cancelled out the increased FY19e administrative expenses  while the reduction in FY19e CoGS from SEK115m to SEK112m and our introduction of a flat total market between Q4 and Q1 for future years resulted in the c 1  increase in our valuation

earnings came in at  3 79 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 55 and came ahead of the guidance of  3 40 and  3 60  Earnings rose 1 3  year over year helped by a lower share count Revenues came in at  3 60 billion  which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 53 billion as well as the guidance of  3 4 billion to  3 55 billion  Revenues fell 2  from the year ago period primarily due to loss of exclusivity on some brands and divestitures of some others in 2018  On a constant currency basis  sales were flat Moreover  sales of Restasis also declined in the quarter ahead of anticipated generic competition  Also  declines in textured breast implants in certain international markets hurt sales  However  key products like Botox  cosmetic and therapeutics   Juv derm

Specialized Therapeutics  net revenues declined 2 3  to  1 54 billion  Strong sales growth of its facial aesthetics products  Botox and Juv derm and Botox Therapeutic was offset by decline in sales of Restasis and divestiture of Medical Dermatology business in September 2018 In Facial Aesthetics  Botox  cosmetic  raked in sales of  229 5 million  up 16 7  year over year helped by strong advertising

104995,326510,AGN,Pfizer Consumer Unit s Sales Fall Ahead of Divestiture Call,news," Bloomberg     Sales fell for a third straight quarter at the consumer products business that  Pfizer  Inc   NYSE PFE  may offload  a slump that could pressure the price that the drug giant could get for the division  
The drugmaker plans to decide next year what to do with the consumer business  which sells brands including Advil  ChapStick  Centrum  The decision could impact a bigger  later deal that investors have been speculating about since Pfizer s failed attempts to buy Allergan  NYSE AGN  Plc and AstraZeneca PLC  LON AZN  
While third quarter adjusted earnings of 67 cents beat the 65 cents average of analysts  estimates  Pfizer s quarterly results have been overshadowed by speculation about its larger strategic plans 
 We see nothing remarkable about the quarter either way and believe the market will be most focused on management M A commentary   said Jeffrey Holford  an analyst with Jefferies  He has a hold rating on the shares 
At the consumer unit  third quarter sales dropped to  829 million from  846 million in the previous three months 
Drugs Performance
Its pharmaceutical business    which makes up more than 90 percent of the company s sales    is doing better  Sales from its innovative health segment  which includes the company s newest drugs  rose 11 percent from a year prior  The New York based drugmaker raised its 2017 adjusted earnings forecast to  2 58 to  2 62 a share 
Holford mentioned Bristol Myers Squibb Co  as the target on investors  minds  Bristol Myers has been at the center of takeover speculation as it awaits data from a highly anticipated lung cancer trial  and analysts have mentioned Pfizer as a potential suitor  Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has said the drugmaker needs clarity about U S  tax reform in order to figure out which potential targets are worth buying 
Pfizer shares were up 0 3 percent to  35 25 at 8 11 a m  in New York 
The company s biggest challenge may be its own size  and finding ways to replace past blockbusters that are losing patent protection  like the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra  Pfizer has made a number of large deals  such as the  14 billion purchase of Medivation in 2016  to add new assets  though none as large as the failed attempts for AstraZeneca or Allergan 
There are several potential buyers who could value the consumer unit at around  13 billion to  17 billion  according to Rosie Edwards  an analyst with Berenberg  Companies like  Reckitt Benckiser  Group Plc  LON RB   Nestle SA  SIX NESN   GlaxoSmithKline Plc  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and Sanofi  PA SASY  have been mentioned by analysts as possible suitors 
Pfizer plans to start the auction for the sale of its consumer business in November  Reuters reported last week  GlaxoSmithKline CEO Emma Walmsley told reporters last week that she plans to take a look at the consumer business  Reckitt Benckiser has also expressed interest  according to Reuters

104996,326511,AGN,Pfizer  PFE  To Report Q1 Earnings  Will It Beat Estimates ,opinion,"We expect Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE   to beat estimates when it reports first quarter 2019 results on Apr 30  before market open  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1 59  
The pharma giant has a strong record of earnings surprises  The company s earnings surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters  leading to an average positive surprise of 4 07  Pfizer Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Pfizer s shares have declined 9 7  this year so far compared with a decline of 3 7  for the  

 
Factors at Play
Higher sales of Pfizer s key brands  Ibrance  Chantix and Xeljanz and alliance revenues from Xtandi and Eliquis in the Innovative Health  IH  segmentshould make up for lower sales in the Essential Health  EH  segment in the first quarter of 2019 
However  in the last two reported quarters  rising competition in the CDK inhibitor category and increased rebates hurt U S  sales of Ibrance  We expect the competitive pressure to continue to hurt sales in the first quarter  For Xeljanz  contributions from the drug s recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis in the United States should support higher sales through 2019 
Xtandi was approved for non metastatic prostate cancer patient population in the United States and EU in 2018  which may add to alliance revenues from the drug in the first quarter 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Ibrance  worldwide   Xeljanz and Chantix is  1 1 billion   510 million and  263 million  respectively 
Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales are expected to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition in key European markets  Prevnar 13 vaccine revenues declined in the United States in the fourth quarter  It remains to be seen if sales improve in the first quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Enbrel and Prevnar is  379 million and  1 36 billion  respectively 
In oncology  Pfizer gained FDA approval for four innovative medicines   Daurismo  Lorbrena  Vizimpro and Talzenna   in the last four months of 2018  These drugs may boost its oncology sales in the first quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total oncology sales is  1 86 billion 
EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products  primarily Pristiq and Viagra in the United States and Lyrica in Europe and lower revenues from sterile injectables portfolio due to continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the United States  Also  lower sales of legacy Established Products in developed markets driven by industry wide pricing challenges hurt EH segment sales 
We do not expect any improvement in this segment s sales in the first quarter  However  in the EH business  biosimilars and emerging markets should continue to do well 
In 2018  Pfizer made significant progress with its biosimilar portfolio  In the United States  a biosimilar of Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Neupogen was launched in late September 2018 while a biosimilar version of Epogen was approved in May and launched in November 2018  These should add to the company s biosimilar sales in the to be reported quarter 
Importantly  beginning the first quarter of 2019  Pfizer will report under three new business units   Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group  previous IH unit except Consumer Healthcare   Upjohn  previous EH unit  and Consumer Healthcare 
We remind investors that Pfizer s Consumer Healthcare unit will merge with Glaxo s unit to form a new joint venture  JV   Pfizer will own a stake of 32  in the JV  Pfizer had been exploring strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare unit since October 2017  The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2019 
What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for a likely positive surprise 
Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP is  0 65   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 77 cents per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our 
Zacks Rank  Pfizer has a Zacks Rank  3  The combination of Pfizer s Zacks Rank  3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release 
Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other large drug stocks that have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around 
Allergan plc    NYSE AGN   has an Earnings ESP of  1 05  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is slated to release results on May 7  You can see  
AbbVie  Inc    NYSE ABBV   has an Earnings ESP of  0 76  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is slated to release results on Apr 25

104998,326513,AGN,Allergan  AGN  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q1 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Allergan  NYSE AGN  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This Botox maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 55 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 1  
Revenues are expected to be  3 53 billion  down 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 22  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Allergan 
For Allergan  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 73  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Allergan will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Allergan would post earnings of  4 15 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 29  delivering a surprise of  3 37  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Allergan appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allergan-agn-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q1-release-200413057,200413057
104999,326514,AGN,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Allergan  AGN ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Allergan  NYSE AGN   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Generic Drugs industry 
This Botox maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 4 68  
For the most recent quarter  Allergan was expected to post earnings of  4 15 per share  but it reported  4 29 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3 37   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  4 01 per share  while it actually produced  4 25 per share  a surprise of 5 99  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Allergan  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Allergan currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 74   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on May 7  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

million The Europe segment recorded revenues of  1 26 billion  down 12   down 5  in constant currency terms  year over year due to divestiture of the women s health business and lower Copaxone

is closing plants  cutting down its generics portfolio  divesting non core assets  eliminating low value R D project  and is reducing global workforce to revive growth  Teva is on track to meet its goal to save  3 billion by the end of 2019 from these initiatives with  2 5 billion already achieved since initiation of the restructuring plan in 2018  Its newest drugs  Austedo and Ajovy could

105030,326545,AGN,Pfizer weighs  15 billion sale of consumer healthcare business,news,"By Manas Mishra and Ben Hirschler  Reuters    Pfizer  NYSE PFE  said on Tuesday it was considering the sale or spin off of its consumer healthcare business  shaking up the industry and potentially putting a headache pill to lip balm operation worth some  15 billion up for grabs  The move comes as Germany s Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA is also looking to divest its non prescription products  including brands such as Seven Seas vitamins  which could be worth around  4 5 billion  As aging populations and health conscious consumers drive demand for self medication  the fragmented consumer health sector has proved a fertile ground for deal making in recent years  Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs  they are typically very long lasting brands with loyal customers  Pfizer s consumer healthcare business  whose brands include painkiller Advil and lip balm Chapstick  had revenue of about  3 4 billion in 2016  Industry experts said it could fetch some four times sales  implying a potential value of just under  14 billion  although two healthcare sector bankers said Pfizer was aiming for at least  15 billion  People familiar with the matter said Swiss food giant Nestle could be among those interested  along with existing manufacturers of over the counter  OTC  treatments and private equity firms  Pfizer  whose shares were little changed on Tuesday  said it would decide on the future of its consumer unit during 2018  Reuters first reported last November that a divestment of the business was under consideration   Established consumer health companies that may be interested in the Pfizer assets include Reckitt Benckiser  Procter   Gamble  GlaxoSmithKline  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and Abbott  They could be joined by Nestle  which is exploring the boundaries between food and healthcare  Nestle s new CEO Mark Schneider told investors last month it would keep identifying new opportunities and that 10 percent of group sales could be ripe for portfolio adjustment   A second person familiar with the matter said Pfizer expected a  broadening  of buyer interest to include Nestle  Bayer  DE BAYGN  and Sanofi  PA SASY  may be less likely to bid  despite their consumer health presence  given they are busy absorbing Monsanto  NYSE MON  and Boehringer Ingelheim s consumer business respectively  In explaining the thinking behind the review  Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said consumer healthcare was connected but not integral to its core prescription drug business   Although there is a strong connection between consumer healthcare and elements of our core biopharmaceutical businesses  it is also distinct enough from our core business that there is potential for its value to be more fully realized outside the company   he said  Options to be considered include a full or partial separation through a spin off  sale or other transaction  Pfizer may also ultimately decide to keep the business  The Pfizer business includes two of the 10 top selling consumer healthcare brands globally in Advil and the multivitamin line Centrum  It also has 10 brands that each exceeded  100 million in 2016 sales   IRRELEVANT  TO POTENTIAL BRISTOL BID  A Pfizer exit from the consumer health business would be one of its biggest corporate moves since abandoning a  160 billion deal to buy Allergan  NYSE AGN  last year  It also tried and failed to buy AstraZeneca in 2014  Since then there has been persistent speculation that Pfizer is scouting for another major deal  with a bid for cancer specialist Bristol Myers Squibb widely tipped as an option  However  the first source said the consumer healthcare review and the amount of cash it would raise was  irrelevant  to a possible takeover of Bristol Myers  which has a market value of  105 billion  Pfizer has hired Centerview Partners  Guggenheim Securities and Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  as financial advisers for the review

105034,326549,AGN,Will Allergan  AGN  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Allergan  NYSE AGN   This company  which is in the Zacks Medical   Generic Drugs industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this Botox maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 4 68   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Allergan was expected to post earnings of  4 15 per share  but it reported  4 29 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3 37   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  4 01 per share  while it actually produced  4 25 per share  a surprise of 5 99  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Allergan  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Allergan has an Earnings ESP of  0 41  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-allergan-agn-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200403185,200403185
105035,326550,AGN,Genfit IPO Starts Well  Long Term Uncertain,opinion,"Biotech firm Genfit  NASDAQ GNFT  ran the NASDAQ bell on Wednesday  and the company had a solid debut as it went public  The NASDAQ reported that Genfit closed Tuesday s trading to  22 17  a raise of over 9  from its initial price of  20 32  At that  20 32 price  Genfit raised  135 million and would achieve a market not reaching but approximating  1 billion 
But despite this moderately successful debut  the fundamental question which Genfit or any biotech IPO faces is whether it has the funds to keep operational  and there are concerning figures on that front  If investors are interested in Genfit  they will likely be better off waiting for either further trials to progress or the lock up period to end 
Fighting Liver Disease
Genfit is a French company founded in 1999 that boasts in its SEC report of developing  innovative drug candidates  in combatting liver disease  Genfit s current most advanced product is called elafibranor  Genfit is primarily testing to see if elfibranor can combat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   with other applications being earlier in the pipeline 
NASH is a liver disease which affects millions of people  can lead to life threatening conditions over time   and for which there are currently no approved therapies   NASH is a growing concern in the developed world  as it is caused by excessive fat build up in the liver and is conflated with obesity and diabetes 
The NASH market is thus expected to explode over the next several years  Genfit states that the global market for the treatment of NASH is projected to reach  20 billion by 2025  and Pharmaceutical Technology reports similar figures with an expected CAGR of 63  
Given the potential rewards  other companies such as Allergan  NYSE AGN  and Intercept Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ICPT  are also developing potential treatments  Intercept last month  announced positive results  from its pivotal Phase 3 testing and intends to file for approval in the United States and Europe in the second half of 2019  By contrast  Genfit is still in Phase 3 testing for elafibranor  and will announce results by the end of the year 
But while Genfit is a step behind  this is not a major concern  NASH is a complicated disease  and it is highly unlikely that any single drug will be able to treat it by itself  Given how large the market is expected to grow  there is room for multiple NASH treatments to develop over the next several years 
Genfit will still be in a position to succeed if the test succeeds  but that is a gigantic  if   Genfit has other projects in development to treat fibrosis and auto immune diseases  but these will take years to further develop and test  Furthermore  investors should be concerned about the fact that Genfit does not have a partner or larger corporation willing to subsidize and support its research efforts 
Genfit s Problematic Finances
Like most biotech IPOs  Genfit has little revenue to its name and is losing money  Genfit earned  7 494 million in 2018  but practically all of that comes from a French tax credit designed to encourage scientific research  Even with that subsidy  Genfit reported a net loss of  79 5 million in 2018   2 55 per share  and  55 7 million in 2017   1 79 per share  
Revenue and net losses are not particularly important figures for a late stage biotech company  but Genfit s other numbers are also concerning  As of December 31  2018  Genfit reported having  207 2 million in cash against  208 4 million in total liabilities  Much of Genfit s liabilities will come due during the next 3 to 5 years  with a convertible loan of  180 million due in less than 4 years  Genfit has also reported a negative cash flow loss of about  60 million in both 2017 and 2018 
These factors mean that Genfit will stay operational for at least the next 12 months  at which point we will know whether its Phase 3 elafibranor trial is a success  But Genfit s long term financial picture is much shakier  Maybe it will not matter that much if Genfit can market a drug with such major potential  but the risk is higher 
Until The End Of The Year
The big question surrounding Genfit will not be answered until the end of the year  when we will learn the results of its current Phase 3 test  If the test succeeds  Genfit will be closer to selling a product which would be immensely valuable and profitable given the growing NASH market  But if it fails  Genfit s backup plans are nowhere near enough to justify its current value 
Consequently  there is little reason to jump onto this IPO now  especially given Genfit s shaky financial numbers and its massive long term liabilities  Investors will be better off waiting until the end of the year for further information  especially since the stock will likely fall in value once the lock up period expires  Genfit s stock will likely utterly collapse or explode in December  with not much room in between ",2019-04-02,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/genfit-ipo-starts-well-but-longterm-success-uncertain-200403234,200403234

105064,326579,AGN,U S  court strikes down Obama era rule on tax inversions,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    A federal court in Texas on Friday ruled that the Obama administration acted unlawfully last year when its Treasury Department cracked down on U S  companies that try to reduce their U S  taxes by rebasing abroad  in a process known as inversion 
The U S  Chamber of Commerce and the Texas Association of Business had filed a lawsuit in Texas federal court that said a regulation from the Treasury Department in April 2016 exceeded what the law allows the department to do 
    They argued the Internal Revenue Service rule used was  arbitrary and capricious  because it was instated without notice and opportunity for comment in violation of standards required for rulemaking 
     The U S  District Court for Western Texas in Austin agreed  saying the IRS rule was a substantive or legislative regulation that required a notice and comment period before it was instated 
The U S  Treasury  the U S  Chamber of Commerce and Texas Association of Business could not be immediately reached for comment 
    The lawsuit was the first to challenge a rule on inversion  The deals are legal  but have drawn criticism from some politicians who say U S  companies that do them are avoiding their tax obligations  A wave of inversions largely ended after Treasury moved against the deals 
    The IRS rule had been aimed at transactions involving non U S  companies  such as Ireland based drugmaker Allergan Plc  NYSE AGN N  that have grown through a series of acquisitions 
    It had helped scuttle what had been a planned  160 billion combination of Allergan and U S  drugmaker  Pfizer  Inc  NYSE PFE N  in what would have been the largest inversion ever 
    Dozens of U S  companies have done inversions since 1983  when the first such deal was completed  Treasury has periodically moved to curb the flow of deals because inversions erode the U S  corporate income tax base 
    Treasury unveiled a package of rules in 2016 meant to further discourage the deals  which typically involve a U S  multinational buying a smaller company in a foreign country with lower corporate taxes and then rebasing there  if only on paper 
    Inverting U S  companies usually leave their core U S  operations at home  transferring only their legal tax domicile to the home country of the acquired company  Recent popular destinations for the deals are Ireland  Britain and Canada ",2017-09-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-court-strikes-down-obamaera-rule-on-tax-inversions-534874,534874

105071,326586,AGN,Undervalued Growth And Dividend Growth In Health Technology  Part 11 ,opinion,"Introduction
Although many Health Technology Sector companies have significantly outperformed the market on a long term basis  they have significantly underperformed the market since the beginning of 2015  With only a few minor exceptions  this is true for most companies  especially the pharmaceutical companies  operating in this sector 
On the other hand  there are several examples where operating performance has been exemplary even though stock price performance has been dismal  In my long history analyzing stocks  I have concluded that the combination of strong operating performance coupled with low valuations usually represents great opportunity  The old adage  buy when there s blood in the street  or Warren Buffett s recent recommendation  be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy  both apply  This particular scenario applies most aptly to the biotechnology subsector within this broader sector 
Finally  the Health Technology Sector once again provides real life examples and evidence that it is clearly a market of stocks and not a stock market  Consequently  from my point of view  the evidence continues to support the notion that it is more important to pay attention to your individual holdings than it does to the general market at large  As I am now more than halfway through the 20 sectors reported on by FactSet this message becomes crystal clear

In part 1 found here I covered the Consumer Services Sector  In part 2 found here I covered the Communication Sector  In part 3 found here I covered the Consumer Durables Sector and its many diverse subsectors  In part 4 found here I covered Consumer Nondurables  In part 5 found here I covered companies in the Consumer Services Sector  In part 6 found here I covered the Distribution Services Sector  In part 7 found here I covered the Electronic Technology Sector  In part 8 found here I covered the Energy Minerals Sector  In part 9 found here I covered the Finance Sector  In part 10 found here I covered the Health Services Sector 
In this part 11 I will be covering the Health Technology Sector 
In each article in this series  I will be providing a listing of screened research candidates from each of the following industry sectors  the sector I m covering in this article is marked in green 

Sector 11  Health Technology
Pharmaceuticals  Major

Biotechnology
Medical Specialties
A Simple Valuation and Quality Screening Process
With this series of articles  I will be presenting a screening of companies that have become attractively valued primarily as a result of the bearish market activities experienced in 2018 from each of the above sectors  I will be applying a rather simple valuation and quality oriented screen across each of the sectors  First  I have screened for investment grade S P credit ratings of BBB  or above  Next  I have screened for low valuations based on P E ratios between 2 and 17  Finally  I have screened for long term debt to capital no greater than 70  
By keeping my screen simple  and at the same time rather broad  I will be able to identify attractively valued research candidates that I might have overlooked through a more rigorous screening process  In other words  I m looking for fresh ideas that I might have previously been overlooking  Furthermore  I want to be clear that I do not consider every candidate that I have discovered as suitable for every investor  However  I do consider them all to be attractively valued  Additionally  I also believe that every investor will be able to find companies to research that meet their own goals  objectives and risk tolerances as this series unfolds
Portfolio Review  Health Technology Sector  10 Research Candidates

FAST Graphs Screenshots of the 10 Research Candidates
The following screenshots provide a quick look at each of the 10 candidates screened out of over 19 000 possibilities  However  there are only 1256 companies categorized as Health Technology  and these 10 were the only ones I was comfortable presenting in this article  The company descriptions are provided courtesy of the Wall Street Journal  In the FAST Graphs analyze out loud video that follows the screenshots  I will provide additional details and thoughts on the possible attractiveness as well as the potential negatives of each of these research candidates

Summary and Conclusions
The Health Technology Sector   perhaps more than most others   provides something for everyone  If your investment objective is growth and total return  the sector offers attractive research candidates  If your investment objective is safe  above average and growing dividend yield  there are attractive opportunities for you as well  In short  this sector holds interesting pure growth opportunities and above average yielding dividend growth opportunities as well 
The real challenge is to evaluate whether  or not  politics represent a true threat or whether demographics provide undeniable long term opportunity  These contra indicators   politics versus demographics   make this sector interesting indeed

105074,326589,AGN,Aerie  AERI  Improves 22  YTD  Is Momentum Likely To Sustain ,opinion,"Shares of Aerie Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AERI   have rallied 22 4  in the year so far  outperforming 15 3  growth registered by the  

The FDA recently approved Aerie s second drug  Rocklatan  a once daily  quadruple action fixed dose combination of Rhopressa and Xalatan  latanoprost   to reduce elevated intraocular pressure  IOP  in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension  The company s new drug application  NDA  for Rocklatan 0 02  0 005  was submitted to the FDA in May 2018  The company plans to launch the drug in the United States in the second quarter of 2019  The approval further boosted Aerie s portfolio 
Rhopressa  Aerie s first drug  is already approved for lowering elevated IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension  The drug was approved in 2017 and the initial uptake has been encouraging  As of February 2019  Rhopressa s market access increased to approximately 90  of commercial lives  including 55  in preferred brand Tier 2 and 35  in Tier 3 
Aerie expects Medicare Part D Tier 2 equivalent coverage to increase to more than 70  within the next few weeks  In October 2018  the European Medicines Agency  EMA  accepted for review the Marketing Authorisation Application  MAA  for Rhokiinsa   An opinion on approval is expected by the second half of 2019 
Glaucoma is one of the largest segments in the global ophthalmic market  and hence we expect Aerie to maintain momentum in the coming months 
The company is making efforts to further develop its portfolio  Earlier in the month  Aerie initiated patient dosing in its phase II study  designed in accordance with the requirements of Japan s PMDA  Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency  to support potential regulatory submission of netarsudil ophthalmic solution  known as Rhropressa  in Japan 
The company also initiated patient dosing in a phase II clinical trial on AR 1105  its experimental dexamethasone intravitreal implant  in patients with macular edema caused by retinal vein occlusion  RVO  
As the glaucoma market holds potential  Aerie faces stiff competition from established branded and generic pharmaceutical companies  including Novartis   NYSE NVS   for Simbrinza and Travtan  Allergan   NYSE AGN   for Lumigan  and other smaller biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  Bausch Health Companies    NYSE BHC   Vyzulta is also approved for the treatment of patients suffering from open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension

105075,326590,AGN,Axsome s Depression Drug Gets Breakthrough Therapy Status,opinion,"Axsome Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ AXSM   announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to AXS 05 for the treatment of major depressive disorder  MDD   The candidate is a novel  oral  investigational NMDA receptor antagonist with multimodal activity 
The Breakthrough Therapy designation is granted to speed up the development and review of drugs that target serious or life threatening conditions 
Shares of the company have soared 521 7  in the past year against the  s decline of 13 7  

 
The designation was supported by positive results from the phase II ASCEND study  in which 80 patients with confirmed moderate to severe MDD were treated with AXS 05 or GlaxoSmithKline s   NYSE GSK   active comparator  Wellbutrin  bupropion   The study showed that treatment with AXS 05 resulted in substantial  rapid and statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms as compared to bupropion  
MDD affects about 6 7  of adults in the United States and is a chronic  biologically based disorder that can result in suicide  
The depression market is quite large and has many players  including biggies like Allergan   NYSE AGN   with products like Vraylar and Viibryd  and Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  with Cymbalta and Zyprexa 
In March 2019  the FDA approved Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   nasal spray  Spravato  esketamine  for treatment resistant depression  TRD  in adults  but with a boxed warning  The nasal spray has been approved for use in conjunction with an oral antidepressant in patients with MDD who have not benefited from multiple standard treatments Axsome Therapeutics  Inc  Price

105076,326591,AGN,NASH Scorecard So Far This Year  A Look At The Hits   Misses,opinion,The recent failure of Conatus Pharmaceuticals    NASDAQ CNAT   phase IIb ENCORE NF study in patients with biopsy confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  and liver fibrosis once again puts the spotlight on this promising but challenging space Earlier  biotech bigwig Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   had suffered a setback with the failure of a late stage study on pipeline candidate  selonsertib  in patients with compensated cirrhosis  F4  due to NASH  STELLAR 4  a phase III  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study  n 877   evaluated the safety and efficacy of selonsertib  which is an investigational  once daily  oral inhibitor of apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1  ASK1   in patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH  However  the study did not meet the pre specified 48 week primary endpoint of a   1 stage histologic improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH  The failure of the STELLAR 4 study is disappointing  given the significant market potential of NASH and increasing competition Notwithstanding the failures  the market for NASH holds potential and is expected to be targeted by most large pharma biotech companies in 2019  It is poised to witness rapid growth unlike other lucrative yet saturated markets like cancer More on NASHA chronic liver disease  NASH is caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver or steatosis  Per records  it has affected up to 15 million people in the United States and could cause inflammation  hepatocellular injury  progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis  The ailment is anticipated to be the leading reason behind liver transplantation by 2020  Currently  NASH is the primary reason for liver transplants in people under 50 in the United States  Such patients also suffer from obesity and type II diabetes  With no treatments currently approved to address this disease  the market opportunity is substantially huge and many companies are investing a major chunk of their R D budget on the same Pharma Players That Have a Lead in NASHThe recent failures underscore the complexity of the treatments being developed  The winner so far in the NASH race seems to be Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ ICPT    The company recently announced positive top line results from its pivotal phase III REGENERATE study of obeticholic acid  OCA  on patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH   The company stated that the primary endpoint of the study   fibrosis improvement without worsening of NASH at 18 months   was achieved with the 25 mg daily dose of OCA Also  a numerically greater proportion of patients in both OCA treatment arms  taking doses of 10 mg and 25 mg  met the primary endpoint of NASH resolution with no deterioration of liver fibrosis compared to placebo  The study was required to attain one of the two primary goals  per FDA  which it did  Intercept plans to file for an approval for OCA as a NASH treatment both in the United States and in Europe during the second half of 2019 France based  Genfit s lead candidate elafibranor  which is in late stage studies  also holds promise  A phase III study  RESOLVE IT is evaluating the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 120 mg versus placebo in patients with NASH and fibrosis  In December 2018  the Data Safety Monitoring Board  DSMB  recommended the continuation of RESOLVE IT without any modifications  based on the pre planned review of safety data  including adverse events and laboratory data  The company expects to report top line data by the end of 2019  Earlier in the month  the company announced protocol clearance by the FDA for a phase II study evaluating elafibranor in children and adolescents with non alcoholic steatohepatitisAllergan plc   NYSE AGN   too has an interesting candidate in its pipeline  cenicriviroc  for the treatment of NASH  The 2016 Tobira Acquisition added the candidate to its pipeline  The candidate is being evaluated in a phase III study  AURORA  Results from the study are not expected before 2020 Viking Therapeutics   NASDAQ VKTX   is another company  which has a promising NASH candidate  VK2809  in its pipeline Other EntrantsGiven the fact that it is a lucrative market  quite a few companies have inked deals to enter this space  Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   entered into a clinical development agreement with Pfizer  NYSE PFE   The agreement includes a clinical trial to evaluate the combination of tropifexor  LJN452  and one or more Pfizer compounds for the treatment of NASH  Pharma giant Merck   NYSE MRK   exercised its option to license NGM313  an investigational monoclonal antibody agonist of the   Klotho FGFR1c receptor complex that is currently being evaluated for the treatment of NASH and type 2 diabetes Bottom LineGiven the huge market potential  we expect a lot of activity in this space going forward  Approval of any of the candidates will attract more players and investment to this corner of the healthcare space Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017

105077,326592,AGN,Spero Gets Fast Track Designation For SPR994  Shares Improve,opinion,"Shares of Spero Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ SPRO   increased about 6  after the company announced that the FDA granted Fast Track designation to SPR994  the company s lead product candidate designed to be the first oral carbapenem antibiotic  for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections  cUTI  and acute pyelonephritis  
Shares of the company have decreased 9 8  in the past year compared with the  s decline of 4 7

105103,326618,AGN,Is Allergan  AGN  A Worthy Pick ForValue Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Allergan plc   NYSE AGN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Allergan has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Allergan s current PE level puts it much below its midpoint of 17 2 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares pretty favorably with the Medical Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is much undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Allergan has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 8 9  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Allergan has a P S ratio of about 3 1  This is slightly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  AGN is lower than the mid point of 5 5 of the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Allergan currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Allergan a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio for Allergan is 3 9  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 4 6x  Clearly  AGN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Allergan might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has Growth and Momentum Scores of B  This gives AGN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two upward revisions in the past sixty days compared to six downward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen ten upward and six downward revisions in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 5 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Allergan plc Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAllergan is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 41  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and industry rank to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the stocks discussed above

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 37   A quarter ago  it was expected that this Botox maker would post earnings of  4 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 25  delivering a surprise of 5 99  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Allergan  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Generic Drugs industry  posted revenues of  4 08 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 99   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 33 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters

Allergan shares have added about 18 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 5 5  
What s Next for Allergan 
While Allergan has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Allergan was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Consensus Estimate of  4 15  However  earnings fell 11 7  year over year mainly due to lower revenues Revenues came in at  4 08 billion  which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 98 billion  Revenues fell 5 7  from the year ago period primarily due to loss of exclusivity of some brands  However  core business grew 8 3  during the quarter Key products like Botox  Juv derm collection of

1 81 billion  Decline in sales of Restasis and loss of sales due to divestiture of Medical Dermatology business were partially offset by strong sales growth of its facial aesthetics products  Botox

Medicine net revenues were down 8 4  year over year to  1 4 billion in the reported quarter hurt by lower sales of Namenda XR and Estrace  which were partially offset by strong growth of Vraylar  Linzess and Lo Loestrin Linzess  which was co commercialized with Ironwood Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ IRWD    sales rose 5 3  to  205 2 million  Lo Loestrin sales grew 13 7  to  143 8 million while

sales guidance for 2019  Allergan expects sales to be in the range of  15 0  15 3 billion  The guidance range is lower than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  15 4 billion  The company estimates its adjusted earnings to be equal or more than  16 36 per share Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 13 13 5  in 2019  Adjusted R D expenses are expected to be approximately  1 6    1 7

revenues to be in the range of  3 4 billion to  3 55 billion and earnings per share between  3 40 and  3 60  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings per share is pegged at  3 61 billion and  3 66  respectively Our TakeAlthough Allergan beat estimates for both earnings and sales  the metrics declined from the year ago period  The top and the bottom lines were hurt by loss of sales of several drugs including Restasis due to loss of exclusivity  Namenda XR and Estrace also lost significant sales  However  Botox continues to drive the top line along with Juv derm and Linzess among others Meanwhile  the company s sales outlook was far from encouraging  Moreover  the company expects lower sales to severely impact margins in the first quarter  However  it can be presumed that declining sales trend will stabilize in the later part of 2019 due to low base year effect Shares fell 3 7  in pre market trading presumably on lower sales expectation for 2019  Allergan s share price

Teva is facing significant challenges in the form of accelerated generic competition for Copaxone  new competition for branded products  pricing erosion in the U S  generics business and a massive debt load stemming from its 2016 acquisition of Allergan s generics business  The company expects business to be weaker and sales of its branded drugs  Copaxone and ProAir to be lower However  Teva has a new organizational structure in place  is closing plants  cutting down its generics portfolio  divesting non core assets  eliminating low value R D projects  and is reducing global workforce to revive growth  Teva is on track to meet its goal to save  3 billion by the end of 2019 from these initiatives with  2 2 billion already achieved in 2018 Its financial position seems more encouraging

and gastrointestinal  GI  pipeline development  While the other called Cyclerion will focus on developing the Soluble Guanylate Cyclase pipeline for treating serious and orphan diseases  The division of the entities is also being anticipated to be tax free Last month  Ironwood s board announced the appointment of chief executive officers  CEO  for the two new companies that will emerge from the planned separation of the erstwhile Ironwood Pharma  For the new Ironwood  the company s board has picked Mark Mellon as its CEO  Meanwhile  Peter Hecht  the current CEO of Ironwood Pharma is set to

as a non opioid  pain relieving agent for IBS patients Last July  Ironwood and Allergan initiated a phase IIIb program to evaluate a 290 mcg dose of Linzess for multiple abdominal symptoms in addition to pain including bloating and discomfort in adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome along with constipation  IBS C   Top line data from the study is expected by mid 2019 The companies anticipate to initiate a phase II analysis during the second quarter of 2019 for evaluating MD 7246  delayed release formulation of Linzess  to treat all subtypes of IBS including IBS mixed and IBS with diarrhea Linzess is marketed by Allergan for IBS C in Europe and Canada under the brand name Constella Last month  Ironwood and Allergan announced that both have settled all pending patent litigations with Mylan Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ MYL   related to Linzess  Mylan has filed an abbreviated new drug application  ANDA  seeking an approval to market a generic version of Linzess  However  Mylan is yet to receive an FDA nod for any generic version of Linzess Last August  a label expansion of Linzess in the chronic constipation was approved in Japan  In China  Hong Kong and Macau  Ironwood has a marketing agreement with AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN   for Linzess  Last month  Linzess was granted a marketing approval by Chinese regulatory authorities to treat adults with IBS C  Ironwood plans to launch the drug in China along with AstraZeneca in the second half of 2019 The company is also developing an interesting candidate called IW 3718  It is currently enrolling patients in two identical

five differentiated sGC stimulator programs  The same will also be developed by Cyclerion Our TakeLinzess  prospects look encouraging owing to strong demand trends and the drug s expansion to new patient population and geographies Meanwhile  the new Ironwood entity has high potential as it is expected to turn out to be a profitable venture after the split and its focus on gastrointestinal

105204,326719,AGN,Why Allergan  AGN  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Allergan  NYSE AGN   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Generic Drugs industry 
This Botox maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 6 50  
For the most recent quarter  Allergan was expected to post earnings of  4 01 per share  but it reported  4 25 per share instead  representing a surprise of 5 99   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  4 13 per share  while it actually produced  4 42 per share  a surprise of 7 02  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Allergan lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Allergan has an Earnings ESP of  1 28  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  4  Sell   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 29  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-allergan-agn-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200372966,200372966

Healthcare stocks are trading higher today  extending an impressive run up the charts in recent months  At last check  the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLV  is up 0 4  at  91 46    a chip shot away from its Jan  29 record high of  91 79  Options traders are responding in kind  with calls crossing the tape at four times what s typically seen at this point in the day 
By the numbers  14 400 XLV calls have been exchanged so far  with almost 71  of this volume centered at the September 93 strike  It looks like one trader in particular bought to open 9 159 contracts at 58 cents apiece  creating an initial cash outlay of  531 222  number of contracts   premium paid   100 shares per contract  
This is also the most the call buyer stands to lose if XLV settles below  93 at the close on Friday  Sept  21  when the front month options expire  Profit  meanwhile  will accumulate on a move north of breakeven at  93 58  strike plus premium paid     roughly 2 4  above the fund s current perch 
Additional upside would just mirror the exchange traded fund s longer term trajectory  with XLV up 16  since dipping below the round  80 in early April  Plus  in early July  the shares took out recent resistance in the  86 region  and are now trading above support at their rising 10 day moving average 

One XLV component getting in on today s healthcare rally is Allergan  NYSE AGN   with the shares up 2 8  to trade at  190 83  The stock has added almost 33  since its mid May lows near  143  but is running out of steam in the  190 neighborhood  which contained AGN s late January surge

105231,326746,AGN,How Teva Stopped Falling And What s To Come,opinion,"Teva Pharma Industries  NYSE TEVA  is finally roaring back  and it could still have a way to go before finding a new plateau  It may not regain its old highs for years  but the bloodletting appears to be over  A combination of new FDA approvals for key generics  a successful restructuring program so far  and renewed confidence from Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  have catapulted shares from lows at  10 85 to now trade over  25 for gains of 133  since bottoming 
Why could there still be room to run before shares start leveling off  We have to look at why the stock cratered so hard in the first place  The selling I believe was not set off by any one specific development  but mostly had to do with bad timing as a confluence of bearish news and developments overlapped one another causing a wave of selling  with the final plunge aided by margin calls and capitulation 
As Teva began to fall in 2015 2016  the chief concern was patent expiration and subsequent generic competition against Copaxone  its flagship multiple sclerosis drug  which in 2016 accounted for 20  of the generic giant s revenue  In 2016  patents that would have protected Copaxone from competition into 2030 were invalidated  increasing investor anxiety and accelerating the stock s fall 
At the same time that these patents were being invalidated  Teva s acquisition of Allergan s  NYSE AGN  generics unit for  40 5 billion was closing  miring Teva in enormous debt  just around the same time that generics pricing in the United States was taking a dive  The acquisition began to look like a giant generic mistake and Teva began to take up a persona non grata status in portfolios  Then  in 2017  the final nail in the coffin of Copaxone patent protection was delivered  That s when the stock finally bottomed 
The situation Teva is now in is the inverse of what happened in 2015 2016  Any isolated piece of bad news would have damaged the stock  but that it all happened in succession is what really cratered the shares  Now  good news is piling on in succession as Teva rockets back up 
First  new CEO K re Schultz stepped in  whose biggest job was arguably to stand up to the political pressure against Teva s restructuring plan  which involved taking Israel s crown jewel corporation and axing factories and thousands of workers  As a non Israeli  Schultz had a better shot at standing firm than a native Israeli  and did just that and pushed the plan through 
Now that its expected blockbuster migraine drug fremanezumab is on the verge of reaching market with a PDUFA date next month  the FDA having just approved a generic version of the Epipen  in great demand in the U S  considering recent pricing controversies  and Warren Buffett upping his stake  broadcasting confidence to Wall Street  it looks like the precipitous decline is finally over 
Another factor that may be affecting sentiment positively is the Trump Administration s health care plans  which include among other things directives to the FDA for quicker approvals of generic drugs in order to get healthcare costs downs  This  on net  should help Teva in the face of falling generics prices  for which the price declines may be over now with inflation picking back up generally 
What about debt  Teva still has a lot to pay back  but the debt situation is far from critical  60  of Teva s now  28 4 billion in debt is not due until 2023 or later  98  of that debt load is fixed rate  meaning Teva is not exposed to a rising rate environment 
As for Copaxone  sales will continue to decline  but fremanezumab revenues will slowly but surely be taking its place 
Teva may have trouble growing organically over the next few years until it pays off much of the debt holding it down  but in order for the stock price to recover it doesn t really have to grow that quickly  It just has to show that the worst is over  that it is improving its balance sheet and that it has stopped hemorrhaging  This doesn t mean it will catapult to old highs  but even getting back to its 200 week moving average would mean a 60  gain from here 
While Teva may not be a growth stock for quite a while yet  it can easily be a capital growth stock in the medium term

105232,326747,AGN,Is A Beat In Store For Editas  EDIT  This Earnings Season ,opinion,We expect Editas Medicine  Inc    NASDAQ EDIT   to beat estimates when it reports third quarter 2018 results early next month However  the company s earnings history has been dismal so far  having missed expectations in three quarters and surpassed in one with an average miss of 4 28   Last reported quarter  Editas came up with a negative surprise of 18 84  Shares of Editas have lost 19 6  so far this year  narrower than the  decrease of 19 8  Let s see  how things are shaping up for this quarter to be reported Factors to ConsiderEditas Medicine is a development stage genome editing biotech  which makes medicines to treat serious diseases using its proprietary genome editing platform based on CRISPR technology  Its lead pipeline candidate is EDIT 101 that uses CRISPR gene editing to treat Leber congenital amaurosis type 10  LCA10    a rare genetic illness that causes blindness  An Investigational New Drug  IND  application to begin clinical studies for EDIT 101 was expected to be filed in October 2018  However  the company has made no such announcement yet  An update is expected on third quarter conference call Pre clinical data on EDIT 101 presented in May this year showed that it was well tolerated in a study of non human primates  NHPs  when administered through a subretinal injection  Productive editing was achieved in NHPs regardless of pre existing or induced immunity to either AAV or Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 Editas is also pursuing the development of CRISPR candidates for eye diseases other than LCA10 including Usher Syndrome type 2A  USH2A  and the recurrent ocular Herpes Simplex Virus type 1  HSV 1   Data from pre clinical studies on these diseases has been positive  Editas also has CRISPR drugs in the pipeline to treat cancer  muscular dystrophy  alpha   1 antitrypsin deficiency and cystic fibrosis Editas has a strategic alliance and an option agreement with Allergan   NYSE AGN    under which the latter reserves its rights to license up to five of Editas  genome editing ocular programs  In July  Allergan exercised its option to develop and commercialize EDIT 101 globally  While Editas exercised its right to a profit sharing arrangement with Allergan under which  it will co develop and equally share the profits and losses from EDIT 101 in the United States  Also  Editas has the right to choose for co developing and co marketing another eye disease program in the United States  Moreover  the company has a collaboration and licensing deal with Juno Therapeutics  now part of Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   to use gene editing approaches including CRISPR Cas9 for developing engineered T cell medicines to treat cancer We expect management to provide more updates and detailed information on its pre clinical studies during the upcoming conference call Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model clearly indicates that Editas is likely to beat estimates this to be reported quarter because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for a probable positive surpriseEarnings ESP  Editas has an Earnings ESP of  12 90   representing the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate  loss of 63 cents per share  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  loss of 72 cents   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Editas currently has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  Therefore  this combination of a positive ESP with a top Zacks Rank makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat Conversely  we caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Editas Medicine  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other biotech stocks worth considering as per our model  these too have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting season CRISPR Therapeutics AG   NASDAQ CRSP   is expected to release third quarter results on Nov 14  The company has an Earnings ESP of  3 53  and a Zacks Rank of 1  You can see  Spero Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ SPRO   has an Earnings ESP of  18 43  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is expected to report third quarter results on Dec 13 3 Medical Stocks to Buy NowThe greatest discovery in this century of biology is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization

segments based on three regions   North America  United States and Canada   Europe and International Markets North America segment sales were  2 27 billion  down 26  year over year due to pricing

company said it is seeing signs of stabilization in U S  generic drug pricing  The company also said that the rate of sales erosion in the North American Generic business slowed significantly in the

International Markets segment  sales declined 18  year over year to  726 million  However  in constant currency terms  sales declined 12  in this segment due to lower sales in Japan and Russia  the

wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents and loss of 18 cents in the year ago period Total revenues in the quarter decreased 24 3  from the year ago period to  65 7 million mainly due to Linzess net sales adjustments and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  92 28 million Shares of the company fell 6 7  on Nov 7  following the earnings release  Moreover  a look at the company s share price movement shows that the stock has underperformed the  so far this year  Ironwood s shares have lost 20 5  during this period  while the industry decreased 2 7  Quarter in DetailAs reported by partner Allergan plc   NYSE AGN    Ironwood s key marketed product   Linzess  linaclotide    generated U S  net sales of  204 8 million  up 7 3  year over year Please note that Ironwood and Allergan have an equal share in brand collaboration profits or losses for Linzess  Ironwood s share of net profits from sales of Linzess in the United States  included in collaborative revenues  was  52 3 million in the third quarter  down approximately 29  year over year The significant decline in sales was due to a  59 3 million negative adjustment related to Linzess sales over the last three fiscal years  2015  2016    2017   which was shared equally by Allergan and Ironwood  The negative adjustment  as calculated by Allergan  is the cumulative difference between previous gross to net estimates and actual subsequent payments made by Allergan  The difference was mainly associated with previous estimation of governmental and contractual rebates  Going forward  such adjustments will be done more frequently to avoid adjustment of a significant magnitude Sales of linaclotide active pharmaceutical ingredient added  10 9 million to revenues  including  9 5 million of sales to the company s Japanese partner  Astellas Pharma  The company also earned  1 9 million from linaclotide royalties  co promotion and other revenues According to data provided by IMS Health  Linzess prescriptions filled during the quarter were more than 830 000  up approximately 6  from the year ago period while volume of prescribed Linzess capsules increased about 12  in that period Zurampic and Duzallo  approved for uncontrolled gout  generated sales of  1 2 million in the quarter During the reported quarter  selling and administrative  SG A  expenses decreased 10 6  to  55 2 million  Research and development  R D  expenses were  46 8 million  up 26 2  from the year ago periodRestructuring UpdatesThe company remains on track to complete its separation into two publicly trading entities in first half 2019  In May  the company had announced its intention to split itself into two entities to achieve increased operational performance and strategic flexibility  One entity  which will continue with the current name  will focus on the commercial drugs and gastrointestinal   GI   pipeline development  The other entity will focus on the development of the Soluble Guanylate Cyclase pipeline for the treatment of serious and orphan diseases In August  Ironwood sent a notice of termination to AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN   for a license agreement related to lesinurad franchise which includes Zurampic and Duzallo  With this termination  Ironwood losses its rights to develop lesinurad based products in the United States  The company expects to save approximately  75 million to  100 million in operating expenses for the full year 2019 2018 Guidance ReiteratedIronwood maintained its guidance for 2018 operating expenses  Selling  general and administrative expense is expected to be in the range of  230 million to  250 million while R D expense is expected in the range of  160 million to  180 million Pipeline UpdatesLinzess is approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation  IBS C  and chronic idiopathic constipation   CIC    Ironwood and Allergan are looking to broaden Linzess  label into additional symptoms and develop the drug as a non opioid  pain relieving agent in IBS patients In July  Ironwood and Allergan initiated a phase IIIb to evaluate a dose of 290 mcg of Linzess in multiple abdominal symptoms in addition to pain  including bloating and discomfort  in adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation  IBS C   Top line data from the study is expected by mid 2019 The companies anticipate to initiate a phase II study in the first quarter of 2019 to evaluate MD 7246  delayed release formulation of Linzess  for treating all subtypes of IBS  including IBS mixed and IBS with diarrhea In August  a label expansion of Linzess in the chronic constipation was approved in Japan  In China  Hong Kong and Macau  Ironwood has a marketing agreement with AstraZeneca for Linzess  The regulatory filing in China for IBS C is under review  The company expects the review to be completed by the end of 2018 The company is also developing three candidates   IW 3718  praliciguat and olinciguat  Ironwood is currently enrolling patients in a phase III study evaluating IW 3718 for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease and in a phase II study evaluating olinciguat in sickle cell disease  Data announced  along with the earnings release  from a phase II study evaluating olinciguat in achalasia showed expected pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects  However  Ironwood is keen on developing the candidate in sickle cell disease due to significant opportunity and has decided not to develop olinciguat further for achalasia as of now Two phase II studies to evaluate praliciguat in diabetic nephropathy and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction  HFpEF  are currently enrolling patients  Top line data from both the studies are expected in the second half of 2019  In September  the FDA granted Fast Track designation to Praliciguat as a treatment for HFpEF However  the company has announced its intention to out license praliciguat to a global partner before progressing to phase III stage Our TakeThe company s performance this year has been dismal as its missed estimates for both earnings and sales in the first three quarters of the year  However  Linzess  prospects are encouraging due to strong demand trends and expansion of the drug in new patient population and geographic regions Meanwhile the prospect of the new Ironwood entity is high as it will turn profitable after the split and  its focus on encouraging gastrointestinal portfolio of commercial product and pipeline  However  the restructuring will unfavorably impact cash flow However  with a strong partner in Allergan and its  161 4 million in cash resources as of September end the company is likely to be able to meet its pipeline milestones and absorb the

105237,326752,AGN,Is Allergan  AGN  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Allergan plc   NYSE AGN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Allergan has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 8x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Allergan s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 8 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Allergan has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 9 6  which is tad higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important  it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well  One can easily do that with the PEG ratio  ratio of the P E to the expected future earnings growth rate   The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P E ratio Allergan s PEG ratio stands at just 1 2  compared with the Zacks Medical  Genetics industry average of 1 3  This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Allergan currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Allergan a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Allergan might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B  This gives AGN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to eight lower  while the full year estimate has seen sixteen up and no down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 0 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 1 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Allergan plc Price and Consensus
    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAllergan is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 26  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence However  with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana      Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ",2018-11-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-allergan-agn-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200360631,200360631

The company  which had 597 employees as of Feb  20  said the job cuts are expected to result in cost savings of more than  21 million annually 
Acorda said the cost reductions would help the company focus on its two late stage studies for Parkinson s disease 
A federal judge in Delaware on Friday struck down key patents held by Acorda related to Ampyra  opening the doors for generic versions of the drug by companies including  Mylan Inc   O MYL  and Roxane Laboratories Inc 
Those companies had sought approval from the U S  Food and Drug Administration to sell a generic version of Ampyra  Acorda responded by suing them  seeking a court declaration that its patents on the drugs were valid 
A total of ten companies have sought to sell generic versions of Ampyra 
Acorda reached settlement agreements with seven of the generic companies  including Allergan plc  N AGN  and Par Pharmaceuticals

105270,326785,AGN,NASH  The next untapped pharma market gives investors many options,news,"By Bill Berkrot  Reuters    Large drugmakers with piles of cash are on the hunt for promising medicines being developed by small companies to treat NASH  a progressive fatty liver disease poised to become the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020   The eventual market for the complex disease  formally known as Non alcoholic Steatohepatitis  is forecast to be  20 billion to  35 billion as populations with fatty diets increasingly fall victim to a condition with no approved treatments   Graphic  The growing threat of NASH drives deals    With intense competition and pricing pressure eroding sales of medicines for diabetes  rheumatoid arthritis and other lucrative disease categories  and an already crowded field for developmental cancer drugs  big pharma sees NASH as an enormous new market for future profit that will accelerate a wave of deal making  For a graphic  click   We are actively looking on the outside for opportunities    to complement our internal program   Morris Birnbaum  chief scientific officer for internal medicine for  Pfizer   N PFE   told Reuters   Pfizer currently has three early stage drugs in the clinic aiming to block or reverse fat accumulation in the liver   We believe that even though we re a bit behind  we still might come out with the best in class molecules   Birnbaum said  Bristol Myers Squibb  N BMY  also confirmed it is looking for additional assets to enhance its internally developed NASH drugs  It presented promising data for its lead NASH candidate at the big European liver meeting in Amsterdam that ended on Sunday    It s early days  but keep your seatbelts fastened   said Dr  Scott Friedman  dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt  Sinai Hospital in New York and one of the world s leading liver disease experts   Estimates for the prevalence of NASH in nations with fatty diets range from 5 to 20 percent of the population with up to 15 million potentially affected in the United States alone   Driven by the obesity and diabetes epidemics  the disease guarantees an enormous pool of patients for decades  making it a prime target for deals for promising therapies for NASH and its consequences   advanced fibrosis and liver destroying cirrhosis   The very early stages of many of the drugs  and the complicated nature of the disease itself  pose risks for drug developers and their investors alike   But the upside potential is still enticing to Raghuram Selvaraju  managing director and senior healthcare analyst at Rodman and Renshaw  He calls NASH one of the hottest spaces in the healthcare sector    We anticipate that there will be more transactions  more licensing deals from big pharma involving emerging biotechnology companies   he said  GILEAD A PIONEER  Just a few years ago  Gilead Sciences  O GILD  was the lone large drugmaker talking about NASH  It was undeterred after its most advanced anti fibrosis candidate failed  striking deals with two small companies to acquire additional NASH programs   Liver disease experts were impressed last year by Phase II data from a Gilead developed drug that demonstrated fibrosis regression after just six months   Allergan  N AGN  became a top NASH contender with its acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics and a deal with private Akarna Therapeutics on the same day last year   Other big drugmakers with licensing deals or options on future deals in the space include  Novartis   S NOVN   Merck   Co  N MRK   Bristol Myers and Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ    While many of the drugs in development are two to five years from reaching the market if they get that far  betting on the feverish deal activity gives investors a chance to profit near term  Many small companies developing drugs with a wide variety of approaches across the disease spectrum do not have partners  They include Intercept Pharmaceuticals  O ICPT   Galectin Therapeutics  O GALT   Genfit  PA GNFT  and Galmed Pharmaceuticals  O GLMD   all with a chance to be among the first to market  as well as Enanta Pharmaceuticals  O ENTA    Durect Corp   O DRRX  and little known U K  tradedTiziana Life Sciences  L TILST  with assets much earlier in development   Galectin  which expects key data in December  has commenced preliminary partnership discussions  its chief operating officer told Reuters  Len Yaffe  who runs the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund and has long followed the liver disease space  said investors with tolerance for risk could do well to buy shares in several small cap and micro cap companies with promising NASH drugs in early development  He said if any one has stellar data  or lands a deal  the payoff could be considerable   When Allergan announced the  1 7 billion deal for Tobira  for example  that company s shares jumped from under  5 to over  30  Yaffe  who had singled out Tobira to investors prior to its acquisition  said the Durect drug  looks incredibly promising as it relates to inflammation and fibrosis    Enanta has the advantage of cash flow from its hepatitis C partnership with AbbVie  N ABBV  to fund its NASH program    You want to bet on companies that can survive even if they don t get a partnership this year or next year   Selvaraju said  Enanta Chief Executive Jay Luly said companies in earlier stages of development may have an advantage over the first wave of experimental treatments as regulators  thinking on clinical trial goals and what makes an approvable product in such a new market evolves    When we get there  the development pathway could be not only more clearly defined  but more simplified   Luly said   MANY SHOTS ON GOAL  Drugmakers are taking a wide range of approaches to treat the complex disease  given multiple health issues among NASH patients that contribute to the liver damage  such as heart disease and diabetes   There are drugs targeting inflammation to prevent or reduce fibrotic scarring  Some address lipid regulation to reduce liver fat  while others attempt to directly halt or reverse fibrosis  And some companies are testing diabetes treatments to assess their ability to also improve NASH   The big sea change from two years ago   apart from an increased number of players   is a fairly rapid acceptance of the fact that we re going to be seeking combination therapies since it s a disease that involves multiple pathways   said Mt  Sinai s Friedman    In the end  whatever the mechanism is  it needs to yield decreased fibrosis   he said  noting that progressing fibrosis is what ultimately causes serious health consequences   The knowledge that multiple drugs will be needed for therapeutic combinations to treat NASH  and that most experimental drugs fail  are big drivers for deal activity  Drugmakers are looking to improve chances of success by amassing numerous experimental drugs for their NASH programs   Some experts said drugs that target late stage fibrosis and cirrhosis  where the risk of cancer and liver failure is highest  are likely to gain earliest acceptance from insurers   That fits the strategy of tiny Conatus Pharmaceuticals  O CNAT   whose shares more than doubled when it signed a  50 million collaboration deal with Novartis  Conatus is targeting end stage disease with the goal of preventing transplants   But given the millions of potential patients and expense of treating advanced disease  there should be incentive for insurers to embrace medicines that target earlier stage NASH as well   
 There s still a major role for drugs that work on the front end   said Dr  Arun Sanyal  a leading liver disease expert whose Virginia Commonwealth University lab discovered the compound being developed by Durect   One size will not fit all  ",2017-04-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nash:-the-next-untapped-pharma-market-gives-investors-many-options-476670,476670

105274,326789,AGN,Mylan  MYL   With Neulasta Approval  Focus Moves To Advair And Restasis ,opinion,"Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   With Neulasta Biosimilar Approval  Focus Moves to Advair and Restasis
June 12  2018
Over the last year  Mylan has faced a difficult generic environment  but has managed to offset the pressure with the launch of its generic Copaxone and a strong ex US business that has helped stabilize the business 
The key topics around Mylan are 
  Mylan s recently received approval of Fulphila  their Neulasta biosimilar  Analysts expect the drug to contribute to management s guidance and importantly  demonstrates the company s ability to bring complex generics and biosimilars to the market
  Investor focus now shifts to two upcoming  and sizable  opportunities  gAdvair on June 27  and gRestasis on July 31 
Neulasta Biosimilar Approval Demonstrates Ability to Bring Complex Generics to Market
Context  Neulasta is a branded drug that boosts white blood cells to help reduce infection rates from strong chemotherapy  The branded drug is owned by Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  and generated about  4 billion in US sales over the last twelve months 

The drug is delivered through one of two methods  through a prefilled syringe  or through Onpro  an on body injector  also owned by Amgen  pictured below  
If administered by a prefilled syringe  the patient will need to travel to a cancer or oncology center to have the drug administered  Amgen estimates that 90  of patients live 150 miles or greater away from the hospital  meaning it s a significant chunk of time out of a patient s day  As a result  Onpro makes up roughly 60  of the franchise revenue  and the patients on Onpro are considered to be fairly sticky 
What happened  Mylan recently received approval for their Neulasta biosimilar  marketed as Fulphila  This was seen as a positive result  and sent the stock up 5  the next day  Of note  some concerns had arisen recently among investors after the company received a form 483  a list of observations during a factory inspection   Of note  the company received a CRL  complete response letter  last year  largely focused on qualitative observations at the facility  However  this was clearly not an issue for the company  Fulphila is the first biosimilar to Neulasta and therefore should enjoy some lead time and revenue benefits as the only generic available to patients 

Competition  Coherus BioSciences  NASDAQ CHRS  is seen as the only other manufacturer that has a chance of receiving FDA approval on their Neulasta biosimilar this year  The company received a CRL on their Neulasta biosimilar in June 2017  and recently refiled their application in May 2018  Coherus has an action date on November 3rd  and many investors expect Coherus to receive approval 
Beyond Coherus  Amneal Pharmaceuticals  NYSE AMRX  Adello are expecting a filing date at some point this year  and Sandoz Apotex are also expected to file some time in 2019  Given the difficulty in getting approval  Mylan  and potentially Coherus  could be the only competitors available on the market for a couple of years 
Financial impact  How much share will Fulphila take from Neulasta  Onpro becomes a significant consideration as it protects some of Amgen s Neulasta revenue  Mylan did note this January that they will be exploring the development of an Onpro like device  However  it will likely be some time until that comes out  In the meantime  Onpro provides some protection for Amgen against Fulphila given the convenience of its delivery  As noted previously  the Onpro saves patients the time of having to travel to a cancer center to have the shot administered  However  on the flip side  biosimilars are likely to get more favorable reimbursement  This can be a major factor as Neulasta shots cost over  6 000 on average  and patients will likely be willing to drive a further distance when the savings are of that magnitude 
In total  analysts are forecasting anywhere between  30 to  150 million in Fulphila revenue and  0 04    0 08 in EPS this year  taking into account a number of factors 
  5 10  market share  Drug availability for half the year  Onpro stickiness  Coherus potential launch near the end of the year  25 40  discount on pricing
Beyond 2018  many analysts expect revenue to grow to over  300 million in revenue in 2019  contributing EPS of  0 10 or more 
Focus Now Shifts to Advair and Restasis
With the approval of the Neulasta biosimilar  investors are now focused on the next two catalysts in 2018  Advair and Restasis  Management gave guidance for 2018 that implies a step up in sales and earnings  and the approval of these drugs would go a long way in derisking sales and earnings targets  Additionally  investors will be looking for any updates on Herceptin  which is expected to be a 2019 event 
Advair  Advair has an upcoming action date on June 27  Recall that numerous manufacturers have struggled to receive approval on an Advair generic  Mylan received a CRL in March of last year  Sandoz received a CRL in February this year  and Hikma Vectura  VEC  received a CRL in March 
On the positive side  competitor CRLs means that approval is not likely for them until late 2019 2020  If Mylan is able to get approval  they will likely enjoy a single generic market for a year or longer  On the negative side  the Advair opportunity has notably shrunk over the last year  GlaxoSmithKline  NYSE GSK   the owner of Advair  recently noted in April that payer negotiations had put pressure on pricing  and they now expect Advair sales to decline by 30  in 2018  This would put the opportunity at roughly  1 5 billion in branded sales   a significant decline from the  2 8 billion opportunity that Mylan had originally targeted in 2015  and the  2 2 billion sales generated in 2017 
Overall  analysts believe the drug could contribute  0 12    0 15 in EPS if the drug receives approval by mid 2018 
Restasis  Restasis has an action date on July 31st  Mylan has noted that they do not have any significant outstanding scientific issues  increasing the likelihood that they receive approval  Outside of Mylan  the competitive landscape is a bit more uncertain  as both TEVA and Akorn are pursuing the opportunity  but have not yet settled with Allergan  NYSE AGN   Analysts believe Restasis approval could contribute  0 05    0 10 in EPS this year  with potential for upside depending on the competitive landscape 
Herceptin  Investors generally see Herceptin as a 2019 event  as several companies have had issues with receiving approval for the biosimilar  Amgen and Pfizer  NYSE PFE  have both received CRLs this year   TEVA Celltrion still believe that they could get approval before the end of the year ",2018-06-13,The Non-Consensus,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mylan-with-neulasta-approval-focus-moves-to-advair-and-restasis-200324397,200324397

105277,326792,AGN,Top Research Reports For UnitedHealth  Walmart   AT T ,opinion,"Tuesday  June 19  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including UnitedHealth  UNH   Walmart  NYSE WMT  and AT T  T   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
UnitedHealth s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Insurance industry year to date  up  15 6  vs   13 3    The Zacks analyst thinks the company s robust Government business and continued strong performance at Optum are driving long term growth  Its international business and strong capital position driving business investment are the other positives  
The company has been witnessing an increase in membership over the past many years  It again lifted its 2018 earnings guidance  buoying optimism among investors in the stock  The company has witnessed its 2018 estimate increase by 1 2  to  12 62 over the past 90 days  
However  membership loss in its fee based commercial as well as Brazilian businesses will contract the overall membership growth for UnitedHealth Group  Additionally  higher medical care ratio raises concern 
 You can   
Shares of Walmart have lost  16  in the last six months  underperforming the Zacks Supermarkets industry s  14 5  decline in the same time period  The Zacks analyst thinks Walmart is poised to gain from its strong e commerce initiatives  particularly expansion of online grocery delivery  This  along with efforts to drive brick and mortar sales should help the company maintain its sturdy U S  comps trend  
Walmart is also undertaking efforts to improve the performance of its International unit  by shifting focus from underperforming regions to profitable countries like India and China  To this end  the company s recent investment in Flipkart is however expected to dent the bottom line in the near term  
Further  investments related to the e commerce initiatives and a compelling pricing strategy have been hurting Walmart s gross margin  Nonetheless  the Flipkart deal bodes well for the long term  which along with focus on buyouts  alliances and improved delivery services should help Walmart stand firm against Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  
 You can   
AT T s shares have decreased  11 4  in the last three months  underperforming the Zacks Wireless National industry s fall of  4 3   AT T is gearing up to launch the first standards based mobile 5G services to consumers in multiple U S  markets by the end of 2018  
The Zacks analyst thinks the company is likely to benefit from its long pending merger with Time Warner  Given the scale of both AT T and Times Warner  the merger is likely to reshape the industry dynamics  creating a media behemoth  The deal will allow the power packed combination of AT T s data and Time Warner s content  
However  AT T s profitability has been hurt with spectrum crunch in a saturated wireless market  In addition  the company s wireline division is struggling with persistent losses in access lines due to competitive pressure from voice over Internet protocol service providers and aggressive triple play offerings by cable firms  These are weighing on AT T s revenues and margins

105279,326794,AGN,Allergan  Crucial Period Ahead For Company As Activist Pressure Mounts,opinion,"With Activist Pressure Mounting  Allergan  NYSE AGN  Will Need Positive Results from Upcoming Catalysts
Allergan is sitting at a crucial period in the company s history  The stock has declined by over 45  since its peak in 2015  and activist shareholders have begun to get more involved with public calls for board changes and a strategic plan 

Going forward  the company will see a number of important readouts and events that could determine the fate of the company  An important set of readouts will come from competitors for Botox Aesthetics  The readouts of these drugs and any earlier than expected entrance will put pressure on Botox Aesthetics s sales  which represented 9  of total sales  Additionally  the company will see several crucial readouts for a number of drugs in the pipeline over the coming months that will either make their future look more bright or more bleak  If the latter scenario plays out  activist calls for drastic changes will become louder 
Botox and Other Core Drugs Will Face Competition Soon
Botox Aesthetics will soon see branded competition enter the market  The first competitor that could potentially come to market is Evolus with DWP 450  In mid May  the company received a CRL related to its manufacturing processes  Evolus now has a new Spring 2019 target  but some investors believe that the drug could come to market as soon as October this year if all goes to plan 
Another competitor that investors are closely watching is Revance s RT002  Revance s Phase 3 trials showed a 6 month duration  which will likely prove to be a strong differentiating factor to Botox  which has a 3 4 month duration   Revance notes that they are on track to file by 1H19  with a potential launch in 2020 
Finally  Hugel is already on the market in Korea  and is expected to have a phase 3 readout in August  The company hopes to launch the drug in late 2019 
With a slew of competitors nearing a launch  there is headline risk that could put pressure on the stock as these drugs get closer to their launch  Investors are also debating the impact these launches could have on Botox growth  and whether consensus estimates are properly accounting for the impact of competitors in the market  Management believes that Botox Aesthetic can grow in the high single digits despite the competition  Currently  consensus estimates have growth for Botox Aesthetics slowing from 11  in 2018 to 8  in 2019 and 7  in 2020 

Beyond Botox Aesthetics  investors are also watching Botox Migraine and Restasis  Botox Migraine will face volatility as the CGRPs enter the market  with Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  s Aimovig already launched and Eli Lilly Teva entering in 2H18   Restasis will face a number of generics from Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   Akorn Inc  NASDAQ AKRX   and Teva Pharma Industries Ltd ADR  NYSE TEVA   and management is planning on increased competition in 2H18  Any delays to competition could provide upside  while earlier launches or signs of traction would provide downside 
Several Upcoming Catalysts Could Determine Viability of Pipeline
The first set of crucial catalysts is expected to come from Allergan s ubrogepant  Recall that there are currently three competitor anti CGRPs  all injectables  that are about to enter the market for migraines  Allergan has two oral anti CGRPs in the pipeline  ubrogepant and atogepant  each with the potential to reach one billion in sales  Ubrogepant is a short acting drug targeting acute treatment  while atogepant is longer acting and targeting prophylaxis treatment 
Ubrogepant will have two readouts in 2H18 that will examine Ubrogepant s safety and efficacy  Efficacy has already been shown with two prior pivotal trials  with efficacy in line with other acute migraine treatments   and is therefore less of a concern  Safety however is more of a concern as one of the single dose trials showed signs of liver toxicity  Allergan is looking at a potential submission in 2019 and a launch in 2020  Patient readouts are expected in Sep Oct 2018  while the healthy volunteer trial is more broadly expected in 2H18 
The readouts could determine the likelihood of a 2020 launch for ubrogepant  Atogepant already received positive news earlier in June with a positive Phase 2b 3 readout that showed strong efficacy and safety results  The two drugs are increasingly looking more viable and could provide more upside and perceived value to Allergan s pipeline 
Another catalyst is expected to come from Allergan s abicipar  Abicipar is a drug for age related macular degeneration  AMD   Investors have largely written off abicipar after management noted that the first generation of the drug would have material inflammation  This would represent a large flaw given that competitor drugs from Regeneron s Eylea and Roche s Lucentis have much cleaner records  In fact  the inflammation signal  as well as the strong efficacy results for Eylea and Lucentis  were factors that led investors to believe that current management was making a mistake in pushing the trial forward 
However  while investors do not expect results to be strong  if Allergan is able to show lower inflammation signals  and strong efficacy  the stock could move higher given that consensus expectations are so low for abicipar  The market for AMD is estimated at  6  billion  and existing treatments are unpleasant intraocular injections  leaving room for a competitor with a longer duration  Readouts are expected within the next 1 2 months 
Allergan s third catalyst is Rapastinel  an IV injection for acute treatment of major treatment resistant depression  Rapastinel has shown the potential to have improved safety within the ketamine class  as Phase 2 results have shown no euphoria effects  The drug is in pivotal trials and management expects to have readouts in early 2019  Additionally  the drug has the potential to expand into suicidal ideation  which is a huge market and has potential for  2  billion in sales

Note  Red highlights are my own
Other pipeline drugs of interest among investors include Esmya  which has an upcoming PDUFA date in August  and bimatoprost SR  which just saw a positive phase 3 readout in June  
Beyond these drugs  Allergan will have several other upcoming events that could provide more clarity on the company s strategy and the current state of its pipeline  which is the subject of heavy debate among investors  The company will have an Aesthetics analyst meeting in mid September and a R D day in 4Q18 ",2018-07-16,The Non-Consensus,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allergan-crucial-period-ahead-for-company-as-activist-pressure-mounts-200331004,200331004
105280,326795,AGN,Allergan  Inflammation Is The Reason Investors Did Not React Well To Abicipar Resu,opinion,"Abicipar Results Appeared Positive But Stock Did Not React Well
On July 19th  Allergan  NYSE AGN  announced  seemingly  positive top line results from its two phase 3 trials for abicipar  Recall that abicipar is for patients with neovascular  wet  age related macular degeneration  AMD   Wet AMD is a condition in which abnormal blood vessels grow underneath the retina and macula  causing the retina and macula to bulge or lift  The bulging leads to significant vision distortion 
As I wrote recently  the abicipar readout was one of the key catalysts for the company over the next 6 9 months  Despite the seemingly positive results  the stock has actually moved down slightly over the last several days of trading  Why 

Investors are Worried about Ocular Inflammation
As I noted in that article  investors were worried about a prior inflammation signal in one of the phase 2 trials  and needed to see a lower inflammation signal to turn more positive on the drug  Ocular inflammation showed a 15  incident rate in both trials  which was actually higher than many investors anticipated 

Source  Allergan abicipar presentation
The drug will likely receive approval despite the inflammation  but the investor concern is focused primarily on commercialization  Recall that one of the key points of differentiation from competitor drugs Eylea and Lucentis is that abicipar could be the only drug approved for 12 week dosing  vs  4 weeks for Lucentis and 4 8 weeks for Eylea   This is a key point of differentiation given that the treatment is delivered via nasty ocular injections  But to many physicians  signs of inflammation would represent a significant risk to the patient  and would not outweigh the longer duration  This is especially true given that both Eylea and Lucentis show little to no inflammation  today  
As a result  attention now shifts to its phase 2 MAPLE study  which is examining a new reformulation that may reduce the inflammation rate  Management believes that they ve identified and removed the contaminating proteins that were leading to the inflammation  Some investors have voiced concerns that the study may require further clinical trials to receive approval  even with a reduce inflammation signal  The study has no comparator arm and consists of only 100 patients in an open label trial  all of which could potentially present issues with the FDA  The MAPLE study will have a readout in 1H19  and will be included in the company s BLA filing 
Note that on a conference call after the announcement  Allergan management stated that Lucentis had actually followed a somewhat similar path in reducing inflammation rates  According to Allergan  Lucentis saw higher inflammation rates during its phase 2 trial   30    slightly lower inflammation rates during its phase 3 trial   13    and then improved on its formulation and inflammation rate over time after launch  If true  these comments should lend credence to Allergan s approach and increase the odds of positive results from the MAPLE study  Regeneron responded by stating that Eylea s trials never saw inflammation rates as high as abicipar s  We will get a more definitive answer in 1H19 
Upcoming Competition Could Present Another Headwind
Even if the drug is approved and the reformulation is successful at reducing inflammation  there are still other competitive concerns on the horizon 
The first and most urgent concern is that Eylea  the market leader in wet AMD  has an upcoming PDUFA date of August 11 for a 12 week dosing schedule  With market leading traction  low rates of inflammation  and a potential 1 year advantage on abicipar  the drug could make it significantly harder for abicipar to take share within the market 
The second set of competition could come indirectly from biosimilars  Lucentis s US patent will expire in 2020  and several competitors are already in phase 3 trials  Competition here could come to market by 2020 in the US  and in Europe by 2022 
Abicipar Revenue Opportunity A Key Question  Will Need to Show Lower Inflammation Rates to be Competitive
As I detailed in my prior overview  Allergan is more broadly facing several headwinds in key franchises  including Botox and Restasis  With activist shareholder pressure mounting  the company has a number of catalysts that could determine whether the shareholders push harder for more drastic changes or stay the course with the current strategy 
Abicipar is one such catalyst  Abicipar s inflammation rates in the most recent readout did little to quell investor concerns  and focus will now shift to its MAPLE study readout  which should determine whether the company can achieve larger commercial success or not  This readout is expected in 1H19 
Note that even if the drug is able to show lower inflammation  there are still a number of other investor concerns  including whether they would need to have an additional phase 3 trial for approval  and upcoming competition  with Eylea s Aug  11 PDUFA date the most important date to watch  
However  given that the market for wet AMD is significant at  6 billion and growing  abicipar could still potentially turn into a  1  billion drug for Allergan if they are able to show safety levels in line with current drugs  Current estimates from analysts for abicipar range from  100 million to  500 million due to this key issue  but could turn higher on a positive readout from the MAPLE study ",2018-07-23,The Non-Consensus,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allergan-inflammation-is-the-reason-investors-did-not-react-well-to-abicipar-resu-200332379,200332379

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is AGN due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Allergan Beats on Q1 Earnings   SalesAllergan s first quarter 2018 earnings came in at  3 74 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 36 as well as the guided range of  3 20  3 40  Earnings rose 11 6  year over year driven by higher revenues and lower operating costs Revenues came in at  3 67 billion  which marginally exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 59 billion as well as the guided range of  3 5 billion and  3 6 billion  Revenues rose 2 8  from the year ago period  On an organic basis  excluding the impact of M A and foreign exchange  sales grew 6  in the quarter Key products like Botox  Juv derm collection of fillers  Linzess and Lo Loestrin continued to do well in the quarter  However  lower sales of Namenda XR  Estrace  Minastrin and Asacol due to generic competition hurt first quarter sales by  200 million First quarter revenues also benefited from the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell  January 2017  and CoolSculpting body contouring system from Zeltiq  April 2017  acquisitions Segment DiscussionAllergan reports revenues under three segments   U S  General Medicine  U S  Specialized Therapeutics and International U S  Specialized Therapeutics  net revenues increased 6 5  to  1 58 billion driven by continued strong performance of its facial

5  to  122 8 million  However  sales of Botox  cosmetic  and Juv derm were hurt by unfavorable timing of promotional offers and year end physician rebate program in the quarter  However  Allergan is optimistic that their sales trends will normalize over the remainder of the year  On the call  Allergan said that sales for Botox  cosmetic  and Juv derm are expected to increase at double digit rates in 2018 In Eye Care  while Ozurdex sales rose 13 3  to  25 5 million  Restasis  sales decreased 17 2  to  255 8 million hurt by unfavorable trade buying patterns and lower selling price  Botox Therapeutic revenues were  358 5 million  up 16 1  driven by demand growth  In Plastic Surgery  breast implants sales increased 11 8   which contributed to the upside  In Medical Dermatology  Aczone sales plunged 60 6  in the reported quarter to  16 million due to generic pressure on the branded acne category and higher discounts to maintain formulary coverage and a generic launch of Aczone 5  LifeCell s Alloderm added  99 5 million while Zeltiq s CoolSculpting business added  87 1 million to sales in the quarter U S  General Medicine net revenues were down 9 1  year over year to  1 22

Gastrointestinal inched up 0 3  to  388 7 million Lower sales of Namenda XR  Estrace  Minastrin and Asacol due to generic competition hurt sales in this segment  which were partially offset by strong growth from Vraylar  Linzess and Lo Loestrin Linzess  sales rose 7 9  to  159 3 million  driven by strong demand  Lo Loestrin sales rose 14 8  to  114 6 million driven by higher average selling prices and increased demand Among the newer products  Namzaric  a once daily  fixed dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept  recorded sales of  33 4 million  less than  36 8 million in the previous quarter  Viberzi recorded sales of  35 9 million  also less than  42 9 million in the previous quarter  Vraylar sales were  84 4 million in the first quarter  lower than  87 7 in the previous quarter due to first quarter seasonality and unfavorable payer dynamics  However  Vraylar volume grew 11  on a sequential basis supported by demand growth Namenda XR sales slumped 66 8  to  40 5 million in the reported quarter due to generic competition following loss of exclusivity in February Estrace cream sales declined 91 3  to  6 4 million in the quarter Asacol Delzicol sales declined 33 7  to  38 2 million due to loss of exclusivity In the Women s Health segment  Minastrin 24 revenues plummeted 87 3  to  5 2 million in the quarter due to loss of exclusivity last March The International segment recorded net revenues of  864 million  up 17 2   up 9   excluding foreign exchange  from the year ago period  driven by growth in Medical Aesthetics  Botox  therapeutic  and Eye Care Profits RiseAdjusted gross margin declined 110 basis points  bps  in the quarter to 86 2  hurt by unfavorable product mix due to loss of exclusivity of higher margin products Adjusted operating income increased 8 7  to  1 76 billion in the first quarter  Adjusted operating margin rose 260 bps in the quarter to 47 9  due to lower operating costs Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses decreased 5 2  to  1 05 billion in the first quarter owing to a substantial reduction in selling and marketing spending from the successful execution of the restructuring program Research and development  R D  expenses also declined 9 7  to  355 8 million due to pipeline re prioritization Other DetailsIn the first quarter  Allergan paid down  3 6 billion in net debt and completed its  2 billion share repurchase program announced in September 2017 2018 OutlookAllergan raised its earnings and sales guidance range for 2018  A better than expected first quarter performance  lower share count and a delay in generic Restasis entry led to the increase in the guidance  A generic version of Restasis is now expected to be launched between May and July versus April to July expected previously  adding  80 million per month to the top line projections Allergan lifted its sales guidance to an approximate range of  15 15  15 35 billion compared with the earlier forecast of  15 0  15

expected to be approximately  1 5 billion while SG A spend is expected to be approximately  4 25 billion Operating margins in 2018 are expected to be in line with 2017 levels Share count in 2018 is expected to be approximately 345 million shares versus the prior guidance of 350 million shares attributable to the earlier completion of the buyback Strategic OptionsOn the call  Allergan said it is conducting a strategic review of its business due to the disconnect between its business performance and stock value  Management discussed several strategic options including incremental aggressive share buyback  divesting certain assets to concentrate more on key therapeutic areas  splitting the company and making smaller bolt on acquisitions  Regarding M A activity  Allergan said that though a large merger is unlikely  it may make product pipeline acquisitions that could strengthen its key areas of therapeutic focus  Allergan s CEO Brent Saunders also said that splitting the company is not quite likely to be the outcome of the strategic review as it could prove complicated and costlySecond Quarter 2018 OutlookIn second quarter 2018  revenues are anticipated between  3 85 billion and  4 0 billion while earnings per share are likely to be between  4 and  4 20 
On the call  Allergan clarified that first quarter earnings benefited from favorable timing of operating expenses  which will reverse in the remaining quarters of the year  This suggests that operating costs could be higher in the second quarter How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates  There have been 16 revisions higher for the current quarter compared to three lower  Last month  the consensus estimate has shifted by 5 3  due to these changes

105351,326866,AGN,What To Watch When Teva Reports Q1 2018 Earnings On Thursday,opinion,"Reports Thursday  May 3  before the open
Revenue Expectation   16 89B  EPS   2 31

When Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA  reports earnings for its first quarter on May 4  don t expect fireworks  Kare Schultz  the CEO who took the helm of the generic and specialty medicine manufacturer this past November  has been very upfront about the company s dismal growth prospects in the near term  His strategy  to dampen investor expectations while he works on a massive belt tightening campaign  has so far played out in his favor 

Teva shares have gained more than 50  so far during his still new tenure  attracting interest from the world s most successful value investor  Warren Buffett  whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa  initiated a new position worth about  365 million in Teva  to become its tenth largest shareholder  But that initial euphoria may evaporate quickly if Schultz fails to show the market that his restructuring plan  which involves cutting about 25  of the company s workforce  is moving ahead as originally planned 
Slippery Downward Slope  Complex Problems
Teva s shares have been on a slippery slope during the past three years as the company s  41 billion acquisition of Allergan s  NYSE AGN  generics unit failed to improve sales  The deal went sour at a time when the company lost its monopoly on Copaxone  the multiple sclerosis injection that at one point generated half of Teva s profits 
In February  Teva said it won t be able to charge as much as expected for new medicines amid escalating pressure on prices in the U S  Sales this year may decline as much as 18  to  18 3 billion  about  1 billion less than analysts had estimated 
Another key detail to look for in Teva s earnings call is how well Schultz s efforts to manage this drug maker s precarious debt load are succeeding  Teva has more than  17 billion of debt due over the next five years  In a recent  4 5 billion 10 year bond sale  the company was successful in extending its maturities  However  it had to offer interest rates that junk borrowers pay 
It s clear there s no quick fix for Teva s complex problems  especially when the U S  pharmaceutical industry is going through drastic changes  ranging from accelerated Food and Drug Administration  FDA  approval of competing medicines to government regulation that limits drug prices 
Bottom Line
Any positive surprise on the earning front should be enough to produce a powerful rally in Teva s stock  now that investors have almost written off any hope for recovery in 2018  That scenario  however  puts more pressure on Schultz to deliver quickly ",2018-05-03,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-to-watch-when-teva-reports-q1-2018-earnings-on-thursday-200312121,200312121

105353,326868,AGN,Pharma Stock Roundup  Mixed Q1 For MRK  PFE  FDA Nod For Kymriah s 2nd Indication,opinion,"First quarter results of pharma bigwigs like Pfizer   NYSE PFE    Merck   NYSE MRK   and Allergan   NYSE AGN   stole the limelight this week  Other than that  Novartis   NYSE NVS   gained FDA approval for the second indication of its CAR T therapy  Kymriah  While AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   submitted a regulatory application in the EU for its psoriasis candidate  risankizumab  Merck s PD L1 inhibitor  Keytruda gained FDA s Priority Review status for yet another label expansion application 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories
Mixed Q1 Results for Merck   Pfizer  Both the pharma giants beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales  While Pfizer re affirmed its previously issued guidance for 2018  Merck raised its outlook for both earnings and sales  Both the companies witnessed a relatively weaker top line performance in the quarter 
For Merck  strong sales of Keytruda  Gardasil and Bridion were partially offset by lower sales of other key therapies   RotaTeq  Zepatier and Zostavax  Meanwhile  loss of market exclusivity for several drugs also hurt the top line 
While for Pfizer  the top line was hurt by decline in sales of key drugs like Lyrica  Prevnar 13 Prevenar 13  and Enbrel  loss of exclusivity for some products like Viagra and Pristiq and continued supply shortages in legacy Hospira products 
Allergan beat estimates for both earnings and revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and raised its 2018 guidance for both earnings and sales 
Novartis  Kymriah Gets FDA Approval for Second Indication  Novartis  supplemental Biologics License Application  sBLA  looking to get its CAR T therapy Kymriah approved for the second indication was granted approval by the FDA  With the latest approval  Kymriah suspension has been approved for intravenous infusion for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy including diffuse large B cell lymphoma  DLBCL   high grade B cell lymphoma and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma 
Kymriah was the first CAR T therapy to obtain FDA approval in August 2017 for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B cell precursor ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse 
Separately  Novartis announced that the FDA has given a complete response letter to its BLA for its proposed biosimilar version of Roche s cancer drug  Rituxan 
Merck s Keytruda in News  Merck s supplemental Biologics License Application  sBLA  looking to get overall survival data from the phase III KEYNOTE 189 study included on the label of the PD L1 inhibitor  Keytruda was granted priority review by the FDA  The FDA will give its decision on Sep 23  2018 
The study evaluated Keytruda  in combination with Lilly s Alimta  pemetrexed  and platinum chemotherapy  cisplatin or carboplatin  for the first line treatment of patients with metastatic non squamous NSCLC regardless of PD L1 expression  The combination treatment improved overall survival regardless of PD L1 expression including in patients whose tumors tested negative for PD L1 
Notably  in May 2017  this combination therapy was granted an accelerated approval by the FDA for the aforementioned indication  The approval was based on tumor response rate and PFS data from the KEYNOTE 021 study  Hence  the positive readouts from the KEYNOTE 189 confirmatory study will help the company gain continued approval for the combo therapy  which should support uptake and sales 
Merck also announced interim data from another pivotal lung cancer study on Keytruda  which met a pre specified secondary endpoint of overall response rate  ORR  in an early cohort of participants  The phase 3 KEYNOTE 407 study evaluated Keytruda in combination with carboplatin paclitaxel or nab paclitaxel for the first line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC 
AbbVie Submits Application for Psoriasis Candidate in EU  AbbVie submitted a marketing application to the European regulatory authorities for investigational interleukin 23  IL 23  inhibitor  risankizumab for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis  The Marketing Authorization Application  MAA  is supported by data from four pivotal phase III studies  Data from these studies have shown that more than half of the patients receiving risankizumab achieved complete skin clearance at one year 
Meanwhile  AbbVie also announced commencement of a self tender offer for up to  7 5 billion of its common stock at a price not less than  99 00 per share and not more than  114 00 per share 
United Therapeutics to Acquire SteadyMed  United Therapeutics Corporation   NASDAQ UTHR   announced a definitive merger agreement with SteadyMed Ltd  per which United Therapeutics will acquire the latter for  216 million including contingent payments  With the deal  United Therapeutics will add SteadyMed s drug device pipeline product  Trevyent for pulmonary arterial hypertension  PAH  patients to its portfolio  The product could have posed competition to United Therapeutics  RemoSynch implantable pump  which is under review in the United States 
Trevyent is a single use  pre filled pump that has been developed by SteadyMed to deliver a two day supply of treprostinil subcutaneously using SteadyMed s PatchPump technology to treat PAH  Though SteadyMed received a refuse to file letter from the FDA for want of further information  SteadyMed intends to resubmit its NDA by the end of 2018 
Allergan s Ubrogepant Succeeds in 2nd Phase III Study  Allergan announced that the second of two pivotal phase III studies evaluating its oral anti CGRP acute migraine treatment ubrogepant met its co primary endpoints  The phase III data showed ubrogepant displaying strong efficacy and a clean side effect profile 
The ACHIEVE II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of orally administered ubrogepant  25 mg and 50 mg  for treating a single migraine attack of moderate to severe headache intensity 
The study data demonstrated that a  significant greater percentage of patients  treated with ubrogepant  at both the doses  were free from pain at two hours after the initial dose as compared to those treated with placebo  Also  a statistically significant greater percentage of ubrogepant patients taking the 50 mg dose experienced absence of the  most bothersome migraine associated symptom     either photophobia  phonophobia or nausea    at two hours after the initial dose compared to those treated with placebo  However  the 25 mg dose failed to demonstrate statistical significance in this endpoint 
J J Seeks Label Expansion of PAH Drug  J J s   NYSE JNJ   Actelion submitted a supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  to the FDA seeking approval for a label expansion of its PAH drug  Opsumit  macitentan  to include treatment of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension  CTEPH

which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents per share  However  earnings per share declined 11 3  year over year Revenues came in at  5 1 billion  which also beat the consensus estimate of  4 8 billion  However  sales declined 10  year over year  down 15  excluding impact of currency  Sales were hurt by increased pricing erosion in the U S  generics market and rapid erosion in sales of Teva s key multiple sclerosis injection  Copaxone and divesture of some non core assets  Segment DiscussionAs announced in November last year  Teva no longer reports two separate global groups for its two businesses   generics and specialty medicines  Instead  it reports under new segments based on three regions   North America  Europe and Growth Markets North America segment sales were  2 5 billion  down 22  year over year due to pricing erosion in U S  generics market  lower sales of Copaxone and divestiture of some non core assets in the Women s Health business  In the United States  revenues declined 23  to  2 4 billion Lead branded product  Copaxone  posted sales of  476 million in North America  down 40  year over year due to generic competition for the 20 mg as well as the 40 mg formulation Glatopa  a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg  is being marketed by Momenta and Sandoz   Novartis    NYSE NVS   generic arm   since 2015 while Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October 2017  In the same month  in a major blow to Teva  Mylan launched  at risk  its generic version of the 40 mg thrice weekly formulation  much earlier than expected With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation  there has been rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone  Moreover  a second generic version of the 40 mg formulation  Glatopa  was launched by Sandoz in February this year  much earlier than its scheduled launch in April On the call  Teva said that despite Mylan s introduction of a 40 mg generic  Copaxone still commands around 85  of volumes in the 40 mg market  However  Teva had to decrease the price of Copaxone by increasing rebates in connection with the generic competition   The lower pricing helped it maintain its volume share  However  Teva expects tougher competition as the year progresses  which could exert some further pressure on pricing Sales of other branded products Bendeka  Treanda  ProAir and Qvar increased in the quarter The newest product in Teva s branded portfolio  Austedo  recorded sales of  30 million in North America Austedo  SD

products revenues declined 23  to  1 1 billion in the quarter due to lower volumes and price erosion  Significant competitive and pricing pressure is hurting the U S  generics industry  The

distributor of generic pharmaceuticals  in October 2016 The Europe segment recorded revenues of  1 44 billion  up 8  year over year  However  in constant currency terms  sales declined 6  due to loss of revenues from the closure of a distribution business in Hungary and divestiture of the women s health business Generic products  including OTC products  revenues in Europe rose 2  on a constant currency basis to  997 million due to new product launches and volume growth in OTC  partially offset by price decline  Copaxone sales declined 13  on a constant currency basis to  153 million due to price reductions following the entry of generics In the Growth Markets  sales rose 4   However  in constant currency terms  sales were flat in this segment as higher sales in Israel  Japan and Russia were partially offset by the effect of the deconsolidation of subsidiaries in Venezuela and loss of revenues from the sale of the women s health business in these countries  While Generic products  including OTC  revenues declined 3  in constant currency terms to  488 million  Copaxone sales declined 24  to  16 million The Other segment  API manufacturing business and certain contract manufacturing services  recorded revenues of  342 million  down 8  year over year due to lower API sales to third parties Profits DeclineAdjusted gross margin contracted 460 basis points  bps  to 52 3

in the U S  generics business  lower than expected contribution from generic launches and a massive debt load of more than  30 billion   Mylan s earlier than expected launch of the first generic version of the 40 mg strength of Copaxone was a major setback for Teva Teva divested some non core assets last year  mainly in the Women s Health business  to cut its significant debt load  The company also has a new organizational structure in place  is closing plants  cutting down its generics portfolio  eliminating low value R D projects  and aims to cut its global workforce by more than 25  over the next two years as part of a restructuring plan it revealed in December last year  Teva is progressing well on these re structuring activities and still expects to save almost  3 billion

105369,326884,AGN,Hedge funds slow to adjust champagne tastes to beer budgets,news,"By Lawrence Delevingne NEW YORK  Reuters    Hedge funds have struggled of late to keep up their reputation as the sports cars of the investment world  often overtaken in the race for returns by the public buses of portfolios  index funds  But the proverbial Ferraris of investing   paid big to beat the market or protect from its gyrations   have so far shown little sign of curtailing their lavish spending on compensation  offices and employee perks  Hedge fund operators still work out of trophy offices in Manhattan s Plaza district  Greenwich  Connecticut or London s Mayfair  They are keeping the free lunch and snacks  ski and beach junkets  and even in house yoga  And they continue to lavish portfolio managers with multi million dollar pay  all in the face of poor performance and declining fees   These guys aren t living in reality   said Brad Balter  chief executive of Boston based hedge fund investor Balter Capital Management  A critic of the industry s extravagant ways and a longtime proponent of lower cost mutual fund like hedge funds  or liquid alternatives  Balter said many high spending hedge funds will eventually have to change their ways and become more like their more humble mutual fund cousins in terms of compensation  perks and other costs   But there are few signs of dramatic change   PAY RAISE  Many hedge funds have underperformed the equities market this year  with stock pickers burned by losing bets on Valeant Pharmaceuticals  TO VRX   Allergan  N AGN  and  Home Depot   N HD   among others  while macroeconomic managers have struggled to trade their way through global political and economic uncertainty   But the average portfolio manager at a firm running more than  4 billion with middling performance   up about 1 percent year to date   is expected to make an average of  2 23 million this year  That is up from  2 21 million in 2015 and down from  2 42 million in 2014  according to 2017 Glocap Hedge Fund Compensation Report   Top executives stand to make far more  The average wealth gain for the highest earning 25 hedge fund managers in 2015 was  517 6 million  according to a ranking by industry publication Alpha  Five firm founders   Ken Griffin  James Simons  Ray Dalio  David Tepper and Israel Englander   made at least  1 billion  By comparison  the average mutual fund portfolio manager  regardless of size or performance  is expected to make  634 000 in 2016  according to Glocap  up from  630 000 in 2015    Even if performance is down  managers still understand the need to pay big for top talent to avoid losing the very people who will help them generate returns   said Peter Friedman  chief executive of Integra Advisors  a recruitment firm that focuses on quantitative investing  FEE CUTS  There are some small signs of a reckoning  Poor recent performance of late and predictions by McKinsey   Co and others of tepid returns for years to come   because of low interest rates  slow economic growth and more   have caused a small but high profile group of clients to revolt   Investors have pulled some  51 billion out of the approximately  3 trillion hedge fund industry over the first three quarters of 2016  according to data tracker HFR  on pace for the biggest drop since the financial crisis of 2008 and its immediate aftermath   For those staying put  clients are demanding steep reductions to the classic fee model of 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of investment gains  A handful of major firms have acquiesced  including Brevan Howard Asset Management  Caxton Associates and Och Ziff Capital Management Group  N OZM    Many new managers are launching their firms with fees closer to 1 5 percent of assets and 15 percent of gains  including so called  hurdles  that prevent charging for performance before beating a benchmark   FREE STUFF Even so  there is little evidence so far of substantial changes to spending habits  according to recent conversations with more than two dozen industry participants    Citadel  PDT Partners and Bridgewater all still provide copious free food for employees  Citadel has produced modest gains in its main funds this year while Bridgewater is down slightly in its flagship hedge fund  Performance for PDT was unavailable  Decadent parties remain a perennial favorite  Balyasny Asset Management flew employees and their guests for a weekend at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel last November for its annual business conference and holiday party event dubbed  BAM Bash   The 2014 version of the same party in New York City featured pop star Taio Cruz and acrobatic performers  BAM funds have produced modest gains this year   Renaissance Technologies still flies staff and their families for an all expenses paid vacation weekend  This autumn the destination was a resort in Florida  And Two Sigma rented out the Intrepid Sea  Air   Space Museum in New York for its 2015 holiday party  the venue in 2014 was the nearby American Museum of Natural History  Hedge fund offices continue to dazzle  even if returns do not  Och Ziff Capital Management  which has suffered investor withdrawals due to a foreign bribery scandal and mediocre performance  works in the  200 per square foot Solow Building in Manhattan  one of the city s most expensive office towers   Two Sigma s lower Manhattan office features spaces for playing games  recording music and working out   including fitness boot camps  meditation and same day gym laundry service  D E  Shaw   Co s sleek midtown Manhattan headquarters feature nap pods  a gym  game room and back up childcare   D E  Shaw  Two Sigma and Renaissance use computer driven investment models  which means they compete for talent not just with other hedge funds but also top technology companies known for extensive employee perks  such as Alphabet Inc s Google  O GOOGL  and  Facebook Inc   O FB   Like many so called quants  all three firms have produced strong returns of late    While costs are certainly being scrutinized  the fact that the environment is becoming more favorable to delivering performance means that talent has to be retained   said Jack Inglis  chief executive of hedge fund lobbying group Alternative Investment Management Association  For that reason  he said  it makes no sense to yank perks or other relatively modest budget items  SOME CRACKS To be sure  some firms are making cuts  Highland Capital Management slashed its conference budget in half  even though its public Global Allocation Fund is up more than 20 percent this year  It also recently traded its Solow Building outpost for less pricey space in the Times Square  NYSE SQ  Tower in New York  Brevan Howard  which has performed poorly this year  told employees to use their personal phones for company business and tightened its rules on travel  Several hedge fund marketers  who drum up new customers for funds  said they planned to engage in conference freeloading  hanging around the venue of an event without entering  and meeting with clients after hours  thereby avoiding the price of a ticket  which can cost between  5 000 and  15 000 per person  Pershing Square  whose public fund is down 18 3 percent this year through mid November  is soon moving into new offices that are 40 percent less expensive  There is one flourish in the planned Hell s Kitchen  Midtown Manhattan space  a tennis court on the roof   Other hedge funds are postponing real estate decisions this year  according to Ben Friedland  an executive vice president at CBRE  pointing to a more than 50 percent yearly decline in new leases signed by financial services firms  and a relatively high proportion of them renewing short term contracts   Many firms are choosing to punt   said Friedland  Robert Olman  founder of recruitment firm Alpha Search Advisory Partners  said firms are becoming more cost conscious given that performances fees are not yielding much    Twenty percent is not adding up to a lot these days   Olman said   So they are watching every dollar   SOUL SEARCHING In some sign of change  a few large and relatively successful firms have announced restructuring efforts  Ray Dalio s Bridgewater  the world s largest hedge fund manager with 1 700 employees and more than  150 billion under management  said in September it was planning  significant changes to people  processes and technologies   to address a surge in staff numbers that led to its non investment divisions becoming  bloated  inefficient  and bureaucratic    Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones laid off roughly five dozen employees in August  or about 15 percent of his Tudor Investment Corp workforce  Pershing Square cut 10 percent of its staff in June when founder and head Bill Ackman laid off eight lower level employees  And Daniel Och s Och Ziff has seen its headcount decline by about 17 percent this year  a combination of layoffs and departures  Others have closed foreign offices  including TPG Axon Capital and Hutchin Hill Capital  or shut down altogether  including Perry Capital and Nevsky Capital   Lisa Baird  a hedge fund specialist at Heidrick   Struggles  said the executive search firm is now getting more inquiries related to restructuring  The discussions with clients include the issue of whether pay for some roles is too high  given lower salaries for similar roles outside of the hedge fund industry   There has definitely been a premium paid by hedge funds for many roles   Baird said   That is coming into question with the squeeze on fees   For now though  most thoughts of big changes have not translated into action   Anthony Keizner  a partner at recruitment firm Odyssey Search Partners  said many fund managers know changes could be necessary  but it is hard to be among the first the make a big shift given the potential for loss of talent

In an interview with Time magazine the president elect offered his thoughts on the drug prices 
 I m going to bring down drug prices  I don t like what s happened with drug prices  
The comments sent drugmaker shares reeling  with the Nasdaq biotech index was down about 3 7  on Wednesday morning

105375,326890,AGN,U S  states sue Mylan  Teva  others for fixing drug prices,news,By Diane Bartz and Sarah N  Lynch WASHINGTON  Reuters    Two years after high generic drug prices became a public controversy  legal cases are starting to land  Twenty states filed a lawsuit Thursday against Mylan NV  O MYL   Teva Pharmaceuticals  TA TEVA  and four other generic drug makers  saying they conspired over steak dinners and  girls nights out  on pricing of two common generic drugs  according to a copy of the complaint  The civil lawsuit  led by antitrust investigators in Connecticut  comes one day after the U S  Department of Justice filed criminal charges against two generic drug industry executives  alleging that they colluded to fix prices and split up market share   nL4N1E94KE  Taken together  the cases are part of a broader generic drug pricing probe that remains under way at the state and federal level  as well as in the U S  Congress  In 2014  media reports of sharply rising drug prices led to Congressional hearings    We believe that this is the tip of the iceberg   Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen told Reuters in an interview   Price fixing in the generic industry is widespread and pervasive  and it involves many other drugs and a number of other companies   Both of the Justice Department defendants are expected to plead guilty  It is typical for the department to file one lawsuit about an ongoing issue and use evidence from those defendants to build subsequent cases against others  Several companies have publicly disclosed receiving subpoenas from the Justice Department related to generic drug pricing issues  Among them  Mylan  Allergan  N AGN   which later sold its generic business to Teva  Lannett Co  N LCI   Impax Laboratories   Par Pharmaceuticals  which is owned by Endo Pharmaceuticals  O ENDO   Sun Pharmaceutical Industries  Taro Pharmaceuticals Ltd and Mayne Pharma Group  AX MYX   FROM  20 TO  1 849 IN SEVEN MONTHS The drugs involved in Thursday s lawsuit include the delayed release version of a common antibiotic  doxycycline hyclate  and glyburide  an older drug used to treat diabetes  Doxycycline  for example  rose from  20 for 500 tablets to  1 849 between October 2013 and May 2014  according to Senator Amy Klobuchar  a Minnesota Democrat who had been pressing for action on high drug prices  The lawsuit  filed in the U S  District Court for the District of Connecticut  names Heritage Pharmaceuticals Inc as a  ring leader  of the price manipulation  and also lists Mayne Pharma  AX MYX    Aurobindo Pharma   NS ARBN  and Citron Pharma LLC as participants  The two executives charged in Wednesday s Justice Deparment filing were from Heritage  According to the complaint  Heritage  Teva  Aurobindo and Citron conspired to raise prices on glyburide  Heritage  Mylan and Mayne conspired to allocate and divide the market for doxycycline  Heritage  part of India s Emcure Pharmaceuticals  referred back to its Wednesday comment  which blamed the former executives for the price fixing  and said they had been terminated   Mylan denied the charge   To date  we know of no evidence that Mylan participated in price fixing   spokeswoman Nina Devlin said by email  Teva spokeswoman Denise Bradley said the company has  not found evidence that would give rise to any civil or criminal liability   The other three companies had no immediate comment  The lawsuit alleges that drug companies either set prices or allocated markets to prop up prices  Employees knew the conduct was illegal and either deleted emails or made efforts to avoid communicating in writing  the lawsuit alleges  The attorneys general asked the court to order the companies to disgorge ill gotten gains  which were not defined  pay attorneys  fees and stop collusion   The states  complaint names but does not individually charge former Heritage CEO Jeffrey Glazer and former Heritage Vice President of Commercial Operations Jason Malek  the two men charged a day earlier by the Justice Department  The states  suit puts Glazer and Malek at the center of the alleged schemes   nL4N1E94KE  The names of the other individuals referenced in the states  lawsuit and the content of their text messages and other communications are redacted  Some of the alleged collusion occurred at industry conferences and dinners  the complaint said  Female sales representatives gathered for a  Girls Night Out  where they discussed sensitive information  the complaint says   In one case  it says that Mylan agreed to  walk away  from one large national wholesaler and one large pharmacy to allow Heritage to win business   Malek  it says  was in charge of communicating with Teva  and he was able to reach a deal to raise prices on glyburide  the suit alleges  Connecticut s Jepsen said Assistant Attorney General Joseph Nielsen was prompted to investigate by a 2014 article about rising generic drug prices  In September of this year  he said  Connecticut began pitching other states to join the lawsuit   To date  the other states that have joined include Delaware  Florida  Hawaii  Idaho  Iowa  Kansas  Kentucky  Louisiana  Maine  Maryland

 Culpability for the worst drug epidemic in American history is shifting to other parts of the opioid industrial complex  the pharmaceutical companies and distributors   explains according to Jayen Madia  who helps manage the  15 billion investment portfolio of AXIS Capital  AXS   a Bermuda based insurance and reinsurance company  As Head of Risk Assets  Jayen Madia oversees a diverse set of assets  including private credit  private equity  and real estate  globally

Allergan s Stock Price And Performance
As of March 2018  Allergan s share price was  159 48 USD  Allergan s stock prices have fallen dramatically since its all time high in 2015  shares are down by 50  since that period of time due to fears over the competitive landscape surrounding Botox  Allergan s leading treatment  and the upcoming patent exclusivity expiration of its dry eye drug Restasis  However  the company s shares are estimated to grow over 35  in 2018  While Botox is being threatened by competitors  Barron s indicates that research from Cowen Inc  shows that Botox has a 70  market share       and sales are growing at roughly double digit rates despite the emergence of discount priced competition  
Another area of growth for Allergan is its CoolSculpting technology acquired in connection with its 2017 acquisition of Zeltiq Aesthetics Inc   CoolSculpting is a non surgical  clinically proven treatment that selectively reduces unwanted fat using a patented cooling technology   explains Dr  Edward Fruitman  the Medical Director and founder of Trifecta Med Spa in New York City  recognized by Allergan as one of the top providers in the United States   CoolSculpting recently received FDA clearance for improved appearance of lax tissue in conjunction with submental fat  or double chin  treatments  This will be another strong catalyst for growth

Pfizer has attempted to sell its consumer healthcare business  which includes products like Advil and Chapstick  The company began shopping around the idea in late 2017 in the hopes to earn  20 billion  however  no one s biting  GlaxoSmithKline was considered a frontrunner to purchase the consumer health line  but dropped out of the bidding in late March 2018  Speculation rests on Nestle  Proctor   Gamble  or Abbott Labs acquiring Pfizer s consumer health line  Analysts say that Pfizer is holding tight to the  20 billion price for the consumer health line  if they aren t able to achieve that price  there is additional speculation that Pfizer could spin off their consumer health business into a separate entity called Zoetis  according to Pfizer CFO Frank D Amelio

105383,326898,AGN,Why Is Allergan  AGN  Stock Falling Today ,opinion,"Allergan   NYSE AGN   shares have fallen 5 8  on the day  while Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG   is up 3 4  so far  These fluctuations come in light of a  50 billion dollar acquisition deal for Shire that is now taking a competitive turn 
Shire is a pharmaceutical company responsible for the manufacturing of ADHD medications such as Adderall  On Thursday Takeda Pharmaceutical Co    OTC TKPYY    a Japanese company  saw its  60 billion cash and stock buyout offer rejected by Shire  The offer was priced at  66 16 a share  a 50  premium to Shire s stock price from late March 
In conjunction with the third rejected offer from Takeda  Allergan  a company famous for making Botox  has announced it would consider producing an offer for the drug maker  Following the announcement  Allergen shares immediately began to drop  most likely due to investor concern that the company will overpay to overtake Shire 
In contrast  Shire share prices began to take off today  This comes as a result of increased investor confidence  facilitated by the mega pharmaceutical fight for the company  and the hopes of a high buyout as a result 
Takeda  in order to bounce back from this rejection  needs to find a means of acquiring a much greater capacity of wealth if it wishes to purchase Shire  which currently holds a higher market valuation  and compete with Allergan 
Riding this wave of media spotlight has helped raise share prices 7 9  at peak trading on the day  and unlike Allergan and Takeda  Shire s earnings outlook in the short term is seemingly positive  regardless of this deal 
Currently Shire holds a  B  grade for Growth  and a  B  grade for Value based in our Style Scores system 
Shire s P E of 10 7  P B of 1 4  and P S of 3 3 all come in at discounts to their respective industry averages and help show why the stock leaves investors with a strong value option  And if this buyout goes well  this could only be more of a discounted purchase  assuming the investor gets in now 
The company s growth prospects look strong as well  A debt equity ratio of 0 5 shows that Shire is financially sound  and a cash flow of  22 71 per share compared to the   0 51 industry average helps show investors the financial stability of the company in an unstable industry 
This being said  Shire is expected to witness EPS growth of a modest 8 35  on an annualized basis over the next three to five years  Analyst estimate revisions point to a negative trend as well  Although all current quarter EPS estimates  3  in the past 60 days have been positive  current year EPS estimates within the same time range  6  are at a 100  agreement to the downside  This is why the pharmaceutical company currently holds a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

    Let s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter Factors at PlayThe first quarter usually generates the lowest product sales for Amgen Amgen s newer products like Prolia  Kyprolis  Xgeva and Blincyto are likely to perform well backed by higher demand  This will make up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel  Aranesp  Epogen  Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure In 2017 and early 2018  Amgen gained FDA approval to include overall survival data in the labels for Kyprolis and Blincyto  which may reflect in first quarter sales of these drugs  In January  Xgeva gained FDA approval for the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with multiple myeloma  The label extension can boost sales of the drug Neulasta demand is being hurt by competition from PD 1s and other new cancer therapiesNeupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the United States  mainly from Zarxio  Sandoz s biosimilar version of NeupogenWe expect Neulasta and Neupogen first quarter sales to be hurt by competitive dynamics  Neulasta and Epogen are expected to start facing biosimilar competition in the United States this year  Also  Sensipar sales are likely to decline sharply the soon to be reported quarter as the drug lost patent exclusivity in March 2018 Enbrel sales are expected to be hurt by increased pricing and competitive pressure  Enbrel is one of the main drivers of Amgen s revenues On the fourth quarter conference call  Amgen said that sales of Enbrel in the first quarter are expected to be the lowest in 2018  representing approximately 20  of full year sales  Also Repatha sales in the first quarter are expected to be relatively flat sequentially hurt by insurance verifications and patient out of pocket costs  Also investors will be keen to know if sales of Repatha have improved with the inclusion of FOURIER outcomes data on its label Amgen and partner Allergan s   NYSE AGN   biosimilar version of Roche s cancer drug Avastin  Mvasi was approved in EU in January  which should boost first quarter sales of the drug Investor focus on the call will be on management s comments on the preparations for the potential launch of migraine candidate  Aimovig  The FDA is expected to give its decision on Aimovig biologics license application  BLA  in mid May Meanwhile  higher investments to support product launches is likely to result in higher SG A costs in the to be reported quarter Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate   3 34 per share  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate   3 23 per share  is  3 34   This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Zacks Rank  Amgen has a Zacks Rank  3  The combination of Amgen s Zacks Rank  3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5   on the other hand  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Other Stocks to ConsiderBiotech stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN    scheduled to release results on Apr 26  has an Earnings ESP of  2 09  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Celgene Corporation   NASDAQ CELG   has an Earnings ESP of  0 63  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is scheduled to release results on May 4 Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ",2018-04-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amgen-amgn-to-report-q1-earnings-is-a-beat-in-the-cards-200307477,200307477

105405,326920,AGN,Pharmaceutical Industry Outlook   March 2018,opinion,"The year 2017 was rewarding for pharma and biotech stocks  with the sector witnessing some positive developments that led to a much awaited recovery 
The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 11 8   while the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was up 18 7  in 2017  This is in sharp contrast to 2016  which was tough for pharma and biotech stocks following criticisms about rising drug prices 
A key reason for the sector s improved performance was the willingness of investors to look beyond the drug pricing controversy and focus on fundamentals instead  Although the drug pricing controversy will remain a headline risk  investors seem more comfortable with the issue 
Moreover  a significantly higher number of FDA approvals in 2017 restored investor confidence in the sector  The approval of the first gene cell therapy last year was a major breakthrough 
Though the sector was off to a strong start in 2018  it has been struggling recently with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index and Nasdaq Biotechnology Index down 1 8  and 2 8  year to date  respectively  probably on broader market correction  Also  the mention of high drug prices by President Trump in his State of the Union address dampened investor sentiment  However  the sector is largely expected to rebound as the year progresses 
New product sales ramp up with rising demand  successful innovation and product line expansion  strong clinical study results  more frequent FDA approvals  continued strong performance from key products  growing demand for drugs especially for rare to treat diseases  an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the sector on track in 2018  A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that push up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits 
Hopes of more mergers and acquisitions  M As  have also gone up with the tax reform in place and big players on the lookout for companies with innovative pipelines technology  There has already been quite a bit of M A buzz this year about potential deals  Sanofi  PA SASY   SNY  and Celgene  CELG  have already announced two deals each 
However  headwinds include drug pricing scrutiny  pricing pressure  increasing competition  the growing presence of biosimilars  generic competition  a slowdown in the growth of legacy products  concerns regarding Amazon s interest in entering the healthcare arena and major pipeline setbacks 
We are discussing some factors in details here 
Mergers and Acquisitions  M As  on the Rise
The year started off with expectations that M A activity would pick up  The new tax law  which cuts corporate tax rate from 35  to 21  and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one time tax rate of 10   is expected to spur merger activity this year 
This was held true with biotech pharma M A activity already starting to gather steam  Sanofi  earlier this year  announced deals to buy Belgian biotech company  Ablynx and haemophilia focused biotech  Bioverativ  BIVV   Celgene also announced deals to buy Juno Therapeutics  Inc   JUNO   which focuses on the development of CAR T therapies and Impact Biomedicines  which will add a late stage JAK2 kinase inhibitor  to Celgene s pipeline 
Merck  MRK  recently announced that it has proposed to buy Australian oncolytic immunotherapies maker Viralytics Ltd  to strengthen its presence in the fast growing immuno oncology market 
In fact  most big pharma CEOs believe the tax cuts will place American companies on a level playing field as they can compete better with their foreign counterparts  which operate in better tax environments 
Meanwhile  in licensing deals continue to be popular with several big companies tying up with smaller and mid sized players with promising mid to late stage pipeline candidates or interesting technology  These deals make sense for both sides    the larger companies are able to boost their pipelines with promising candidates while the smaller ones gain access to a non dilutive source of funds that allows them to continue investing in those pipelines 
Some companies that often find themselves on the acquisition radar include Exelixis  Incyte  BioMarin and TESARO  among others 
Divesting Non Core Business Segments and Restructuring
Another trend being witnessed is the divestment of non core business segments  Companies like UCB  Novartis  NVS   Teva  TEVA   Sanofi  Valeant  Glaxo  GSK  and AstraZeneca  AZN  have all been a part of this trend  Pfizer  PFE   which has already divested several of its business segments  is currently looking at strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business  Teva divested many non core assets last year  mainly in the women s health portfolio  to support repayment of debt 
The monetization of non core assets allows these companies to focus on their key areas of expertise and utilize the sale proceeds for returning value to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends  Smaller companies have also been monetizing assets to raise money for pipeline development 
Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large companies look to cut costs and streamline operations  Most of these companies are re evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs with an unfavorable risk benefit profile 
New Products Should Pick Up Pace
Highly awaited new products launched over the last couple of years should contribute significantly to revenues  Key new products include Ibrance  cancer   Cosentyx  psoriasis   Repatha and Praluent  PCSK9 inhibitors   Cotellic  advanced melanoma   Lartruvo  soft tissue carcinoma   Exondys 51  Duchenne muscular dystrophy   Tecentriq  urothelial cancer  and Taltz  moderate to severe plaque psoriasis   among others  The FDA also expanded the label of cancer drugs like Lynparza  Opdivo  Kyprolis  Imbruvica and Xalkori 
Competitive Threat from Biosimilars on the Rise
While biosimilars have been available in the EU for quite a while  there was no regulatory pathway for biosimilars in the United States for several years  With the FDA approving the first biosimilar in the United States  Zarxio  a biosimilar version of Amgen s blockbuster drug  Neupogen   the floodgates have opened 
Seven biosimilar applications have been approved by the FDA to date in the United States  These include  other than Zarxio  Sandoz s Erelzi  biosimilar version of Amgen  AMGN  Pfizer s Enbrel   Amgen s Amjevita  biosimilar to AbbVie s Humira  and Mvasi  biosimilar of Roche s Avastin   Pfizer and Celltrion s Inflectra and Ixifi  both are biosimilars of Merck J J s Remicade  
And then there is Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim s Basaglar  which while technically not approved as a biosimilar  is a  follow on  insulin glargine product approved through an abbreviated approval pathway  Also  last December  Sanofi gained FDA approval for Admelog  insulin lispro injection   technically a follow on biologic version of Lilly s  LLY  Humalog Admelog wasthe first follow on Humalog product to be approved by the FDA 
Biosimilars should cut healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to the much needed biologic treatments  According to information provided by Express Scripts  about  250 billion could be saved in the next decade  2014 2024  if biosimilars for 11 products including Neupogen  Avastin  Epogen  Humira  Neulasta  Remicade and Rituxan are approved  According to the company  Neupogen and Remicade biosimilars alone represent potential savings of more than  22 billion 
Apart from Amgen  Novartis and Pfizer  companies like Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   Merck and Allergan  NYSE AGN  are targeting the highly lucrative biosimilars market  Pfizer  PFE  is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  You can see  
How did the Sector Perform in Q4 
AbbVie  Allergan  Novartis  Bristol Myers  AstraZeneca  Glaxo  Lilly and Pfizer all beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter  While AbbVie and Lilly raised their previously issued earnings expectations for 2018  Pfizer provided an upbeat outlook for the year  Allergan expects lower revenues and earnings in this year than 2017 as it faces generic competition to Restasis 
J J and Merck issued mixed results as they beat estimates for earnings while missed the same for sales 
Sanofi s fourth quarter 2017 results were below expectations as it missed expectations for both earnings and sales  However  Sanofi expects to return to growth in 2018 
Overall  the sector performed quite well in the fourth quarter and looks optimistic for further growth in 2018 
Importantly  at their conference calls  most companies discussed plans to invest in capital expenditures  products pipeline and in licensing or acquisition deals on expectation of an improved cash position following the tax reform

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is AGN due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts Allergan Beats Q4 Earnings   SalesAllergan s fourth quarter 2017 earnings came in at  4 86 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 74 by 2 3   Earnings rose 24 6  year over year driven by higher revenues and lower R D costs and lower share count  which offset the impact of lower gross margins and higher SG A spend Revenues came in at  4 33 billion  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 28 billion by 1 2   Revenues rose 12  from the year ago period Key products like Botox and Juv derm collection of fillers and new products like Vraylar  Viberzi and Namzaric did well in the quarter  However  sales erosion of Namenda XR and Aczone and loss of exclusivity  mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin  hurt the top line Fourth quarter revenues also benefited from the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell  January 2017  and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ  April 2017  acquisitionsSegment DiscussionAllergan reports revenues under three segments   U S  General Medicine  U S  Specialized Therapeutics and International U S  Specialized Therapeutics  net revenues increased 19 8  to  1 88 billion driven by continued strong performance of its facial aesthetics products  Botox and Juv derm Collection of fillers Botox  cosmetic  raked in sales of  228 4

26 4 million while Restasis  sales rose 1 8  to  400 3 million  In Plastic Surgery  breast implants sales increased 21 5  to  69 million  which contributed to the upside  In Medical Dermatology  Aczone sales declined 37 9  in the quarter to  38 million due to generic pressure on the branded acne category and higher discounts for formulary coverage LifeCell s Alloderm added  97 9 million while ZELTIQ s CoolSculpting business added  94 4 million to sales in the fourth quarter U S  General Medicine net revenues were flat at  1 5 billion in the reported quarter with sales declining in the Diversified Brands and Women s Health franchises  Anti Infectives sales rose 14 8  to  66 6 million  Gastrointestinal rose 2  to  453 2 million and Central Nervous System sales rose 2 9  to  349 million Established products like Linzess and Lo Loestrin as well as new products like Namzaric  Viberzi and Vraylar did well in the quarter  Linzess  sales rose 12 2  in the quarter to  194 8 million  driven by strong demand  Lo Loestrin sales rose 17 7  to  126 5 million backed by strong demand trends and higher selling prices Among the newer products  Namzaric  a once daily  fixed dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept  recorded sales of  36 8 million  almost flat with  37 million in the previous quarter  Viberzi recorded sales of  42 9 million  higher than  40 9 million in the previous quarter  Vraylar sales were  87 7 million in the fourth quarter  higher than  80 2 in the previous quarter driven by demand growth Namenda XR sales declined 30 7  year over year to  97 8 million in the quarter due to lower demand and generic pressure Asacol Delzicol sales declined 32  to  42 8 million due to a reduction in demand for Ascaol HD  following the launch of an authorized generic in August 2016 as well as lower demand for Delzicol In the Women s Health segment  Minastrin 24 revenues declined 93 2  to  5 3 million in the quarter due to loss of exclusivity in March last year The International segment recorded net revenues of  915 9 million  up 16 8  from the year ago period  driven by growth in Facial Aesthetics  Botox  therapeutic   Eye Care and the addition of CoolSculpting Profits RiseAdjusted operating income increased 16 4  to  2 17 billion in the fourth quarter  Adjusted operating margin rose 190 basis points in the quarter to 50 3  quarter due to improved operating leverage and lower R D costs Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses rose 6 2  to  1 13 billion in the quarter  primarily due to costs related to acquisitions  R D expenses declined 4 7  to  405 7 million due to cost control and reprioritization of R D programs 2017 ResultsFull year 2017 sales of  15 94 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  15 89 billion  Revenues were within the guidance of 15 875 billion to  16 025 billion  Sales rose 9 4  year over year Adjusted earnings for 2017 were  16 35 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  16 27 per share and were within the guided range of  16 15  16 45  Earnings rose 21  year over year 2018 OutlookIn 2018  Allergan expects lower revenues and earnings than 2018 as it faces generic competition to Restasis Allergan maintained its previously issued total sales guidance in the range of approximately  15 0 billion    15 3 billion assuming the generic Restasis is launched between April and July of 2018 Meanwhile  the company said that it expects adjusted earnings in the range of  15 25    16 00 per share in 2018  In January  Allergan had said that it expected earnings of at least  15 25 per share in 2018 Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 14  in 2018 Adjusted gross margin guidance is expected in the range of 85 5  and 86  which is lower than 2017 levels  Gross margins are expected to be hurt by loss of exclusivity of high margin products   Restasis  Estrace and Delzicol  and unfavorable product mix Adjusted R D expenses are expected to be approximately  1 5 billion while SG A spend is expected to be approximately  4 25 billion Operating margins in 2018 are expected to be in line to slightly below 2017 levels On the call  the company said that it does not expect any significant M A activities in 2018  Allergan expects to reevaluate its M A strategy in the second half of the year once it gets through the LOEs First Quarter 2018 OutlookIn the first quarter 2018  revenues are expected to be between  3 5 billion and  3 6 billion while earnings per share are expected to be between  3 20 and  3 40  These numbers represent the lowest revenue and earnings quarter for the year In the fourth quarter of 2017  the favorable timing of physician rebating program benefited sales of Allergan s facial aesthetics products  This benefit will be missing in the first quarter of 2018  As such  the company expects first quarter revenue growth rate to be somewhat lower than the annual 2018 growth rate  Also  generic competition for Estrace and Namenda XR will hurt sales sharply in the first quarter

105411,326926,AGN,Pharma Stocks Weighed Down By Competition  Generic Pressure,opinion,"While the drug pricing issue is no longer a major headwind for pharma and biotech stocks  it will nevertheless remain a headline risk until the Trump administration comes out with a policy for controlling drug prices  The sector  previously a Wall Street favorite  was hit hard by political rhetoric and increasing media and public focus on the high prices of drugs  With the drug pricing controversy gaining steam since September 2015  companies like Valeant saw their share prices plunge 
According to the April 2017 Kaiser Health Tracking poll  six in 10 Americans believe that affordability of prescription drugs should be the top priority for the President and Congress  The focus should be on ensuring the affordability of high cost drugs to people who need them and taking steps to lower prescription drug prices 
Some of the options favored by the public for drug price control include getting drug companies to reduce prices of medication for people on Medicare  making it easier for generics to enter the market  and requiring drug companies to provide information on how drug prices are set 
Although pharma and biotech sectors rebounded in 2017 and started 2018 on an optimistic note  drug companies may find it a bit difficult to justify their high prices by citing the years and funds that go into bringing treatments to market and the need to invest in R D to develop additional treatments 
Biosimilars a Key Headwind
Another challenge being faced by the sector is the recent entry of biosimilar competition in the United States  While a relatively new area  the market for biosimilars is huge and highly lucrative  with several blockbuster biologics slated to lose patent protection by 2020  Biosimilars are expected to reduce healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments 
According to research released by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics last year  increasing acceptance of biosimilars across different therapeutic areas plus an active pipeline of 56 candidates are expected to lead to total savings of about  110 billion to health systems across Europe and the United States through 2020  The report further says that by 2020  biosimilars will start competing with biologics that have annual sales of  50 billion 
Biosimilars are also gaining acceptance across formularies  Although there is still low visibility on how well biosimilars will perform or how much of the market they will be able to capture  the focus on making expensive drugs more affordable and formulary coverage for biosimilars could very well make it challenging for innovator companies to hold on to market share for their blockbuster drugs 
Generics Pose a Threat
Quite a few of the big players in the drug industry are looking at loss of patent protection for major blockbuster drugs  Pfizer s  PFE  Pristiq and Viagra  Merck s  MRK  Vytorin  Sanofi s  SNY  Renagel  Lilly s Strattera  Axiron and Effient are some key drugs  which started to face generic competition in the United States in 2017  The launch of a generic version of Teva s 40 mg formulation of blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug  Copaxone in October last year significantly hit the company s sales and profits  Some other key drugs expected to face generic biosimilar competition in 2018 include Glaxo s  GSK  Advair  Amgen s  AMGN  Neulasta  Epogen and Sensipar  Lilly s  LLY  Cialis  Allergan s  AGN  Namenda XR and Restasis  among others 
With generics and biosimilars breathing down their necks  many of these companies are looking toward new products to pick up pace and make up for lost sales  However  relatively newer products like Amgen s Repatha and Sanofi Regeneron s Praluent have yet to ramp up significantly  With efforts on to control drug prices  the FDA is focusing on speeding up the generic drug approval process  especially for third  fourth or fifth generics  which is leading to rapid erosion of branded drug sales 
Slowdown in Sales of Mature Products
Several companies like Amgen are facing a slowdown in sales of mature products while new product sales have yet to pick up significantly  Many of these companies are also facing loss of patent protection  which means generics or biosimilars  as the case may be  could enter the market soon and lead to price erosion 
Pricing Pressure to Hit Sales
While concerns regarding the drug pricing issue may have taken a backseat for the time being  pharma and biotech companies remain wary of increasing scrutiny of drug prices  Moreover  with increasing competition in the market and the entry of innovative treatments  pricing pressure is expected to hit sales 
Regulatory Setbacks
Although the FDA surpassed 2016 s tally of new drug approvals in 2017  a few companies failed to gain approval for their drugs last year and were issued complete response letters  CRLs  by the agency  A CRL is issued by the FDA to inform the company that its application will not be approved in its present form  There could be several reasons for the same including insufficient data to support approval as well as manufacturing issues 
Some of the companies that are facing a delay in getting their drugs approved include Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   biosimilar version of Amgen s Neulasta   Lilly  Olumiant for rheumatoid arthritis   Amgen and UCB  Evenity for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis  
UCB SA  UCBJF  is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  You can see  
Stocks to Avoid
As concerns regarding pricing pressure  slowdown in legacy product sales and biosimilar competition continue to keep the sector volatile  it would be prudent to stay away from stocks that have not been able to win analysts  confidence and carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Lockheed Martin  LMT   Allergan  NYSE AGN  and Barclays  LON BARC   BCS   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Lockheed Martin s shares have gained  24 3  over the last year  underperforming the Zacks Aerospace Defense sector  which has gained  47 3  over the same period  However  Lockheed Martin  being the largest defense contractor in the world  experiences strong demand for high end military equipment in both domestic as well as overseas markets  
The Sikorsky takeover has proved to be beneficial for the company  in terms of substantial contract wins for production of newly designed choppers as well as maintenance of the existing one  In fact  strong order growth has been a primary growth driver for this company  Lockheed Martin continues to be a strong cash generator  helping it to take important cash deployment decisions  
However  the F 35 program  despite being a prime defense project for the U S  government  has been facing criticism for being overly expensive for past few years  The company also faces intense competition for its broad portfolio of products and services in both domestic and international markets 
 You can   
Shares of Allergan have lost  3 2  year to date  marginally underperforming the Zacks Generic Drugs industry  which has declined  3 0  over the same period  Allergan boasts dominant growth franchises across several therapeutic areas  
Key products like Botox and Linzess and new products such as Viberzi  Namzaric and Vraylar support sales  Allergan also boasts a strong branded pipeline with meaningful data readouts expected in 2018  Biosimilars also represent significant opportunity  
However  while the Zacks analyst remains optimistic about the company s growth prospects  Allergan faces potential loss of exclusivity for many products in 2018 including Namenda XR and Restasis  Also  competition for key growth drivers  Restasis and Linzess  is an investor concern  Nonetheless  in late 2017  Allergan announced cost cutting initiatives to protect it from potential revenue declines 
 You can   
Barclays s shares have outperformed the Zacks Foreign Banks industry over the last six months  with BCS shares up  17 7  vs   5 1  gain for the industry  The company has surpassed expectations for earnings in only one of the trailing four quarters  The bank s fourth quarter 2017 results reflected a slight improvement in revenues and lower expenses  
However  the Zacks analyst thinks restructuring and business simplifying efforts have ended successfully and will likely continue to result in decrease in expenses  Also  driven by these efforts  the company intends to enhance capital deployment activities as profitability improves going forward  
The bank has been facing pressure on revenues owing to weak capital market performance  low interest rates and uncertainty related to Brexit  Further  litigation matters remain a near term concern

105435,326950,AGN,Allergan  AGN  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Allergan plc   NYSE AGN   will report fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings on Feb 6  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2 22  
Allergan s share price has declined 21 4  in the past year while the witnessed a decline of 22 9  

Allergan s earnings performance has been strong  with the company beating expectations in each of the past four quarters  The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 1 95  Allergan PLC  Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Allergan s established products like Botox  Linzess  Lo Loestrin and Restasis and new products like Vraylar and Namzaric should support sales in the fourth quarter  In fact  label expansions for Botox  FDA approval for forehead line treatment  and Vraylar  FDA approval for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia  are likely to boost sales of these drugs in the fourth quarter  However  we believe sales erosion from Namenda XR due to lower demand and loss of exclusivity  mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin  will again hurt the top line  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Botox  Linzess and Namenda XR are pegged at  837 million   206 million and  103 million  respectively 
In third quarter  some new products like Viberzi and Kybella performed below expectations  It remains to be seen if sales of these products rise this time around
The addition of Alloderm from LifeCell  January 2017  and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ  April 2017  is expected to support the top line in the quarter 
Higher promotional expenses for key products  increased costs to support an advancing pipeline and the acquisition of lower margin LifeCell and ZELTIQ can put pressure on Allergan s margins 
Investor focus will be on management s comments on the impact of new competition for key growth drivers  Restasis and Linzess  We remind investors that on the third quarter call  Allergan said that it will refrain from any M A activities for the next few months until its gets a better handle on the Restasis situation  Allergan is facing potential loss of exclusivity for Restasis  its second best selling product  In October 2017  a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering Restasis  potentially opening doors for early generic competition  Though Restasis patents are scheduled to expire in August 2024  a generic version may be launched in the second quarter of 2018 
Also  the company said that a split of the company is not in the cards at the moment  An update on these strategies is expected on the fourth quarter call 
We expect management to also comment on the cost saving and restructuring program it announced earlier this year  In the regulatory filing  Allergan said it is laying off over 1 000 employees to protect it from potential revenue declines  Allergan also said that it plans to eliminate an additional 400 open positions  While the company estimates to incur costs of approximately  125 million  the job cuts and other cost savings measures are expected to save operating costs between  300 and  400 this year  Also  the majority of the costs  primarily due to severance  will be reflected in the fourth quarter results 
Also  investors expect management to comment on the weaker than expected sales outlook for 2018  which Allergan announced in early January

105437,326952,AGN,Teva Completes Sale Of Women s Health Segment For  703M,opinion,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd    NYSE TEVA   announced that it has completed the divestment of its global women s health business to privately held private equity firm  CVC Capital Partners  The deal was closed for  703 million in cash

Teva s shares rose 3 8  on Feb 1  following the news  However  shares of the company have declined 38 5  in the past year  underperforming the  s decline of 24 9   Teva s decline can be attributed to industry pressure  generic competition for its blockbuster drug  Copaxone  and a massive debt load

105442,326957,AGN,Allergan pays top dollar for  stepping stones  from neurology to dermatology,news,"By Carl O Donnell  Reuters    Allergan Plc  N AGN  CEO Brent Saunders calls them  stepping stones    small  bolt on acquisitions  as opposed to the mega deals common in the drug industry  And they re expected to boost dealmaking in sectors ranging from neurology to skin care  Allergan s agreement on Tuesday to acquire liver drug developer Tobira Therapeutics Inc  O TBRA  for  1 7 billion may seem trivial compared to the proposed  160 billion deal Allergan crafted last year to sell itself to  Pfizer  Inc  N PFE   But that deal was torpedoed in April by the U S  Treasury s latest curbs on tax inversions  Now the company  domiciled in Ireland  is taking a new tack  preparing to spend a war chest of more than  20 billion on stepping stone deals   The small deals are aimed at filling gaps in its core therapeutic areas  which range from the central nervous system and gastrointestinal diseases  to dermatology and eye care  Allergan has added four other small companies to its portfolio this year  three of which sold for less than  100 million upfront  plus performance payments  Two  ForSight Vision and Retrosense Therapeutics  treat eye disorders  The others  Topokine Therapeutics and  Vitae Pharmaceuticals Inc    O VTAE   focus on dermatology   Allergan agreed to acquire Vitae last week for  639 million  The fact that Allergan is paying top dollar for some of these companies   including a nearly 600 percent premium for Tobira  excluding performance payments   has investors and dealmakers speculating about the company s next stepping stone  Logical acquisition targets for Allergan would include Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc  O ACAD   a maker of treatments for Parkinson s disease  Intra Cellular Therapies Inc  O ITCI   a developer of psychiatric medications  Neurocrine Biosciences Inc  O NBIX   which focuses on neurology and women s health  and  Dermira  Inc  O DERM   a dermatology company  according to investment bankers and industry investors   In an interview with Reuters  Saunders declined to comment on any specific companies that Allergan may want to acquire next  But he said that stepping stones will play a key role in helping the company continue to meet its ambitious annual revenue growth target of 10 percent for years to come    I needed to do big deals to get where we are  but the strategic vision was always to get to a point where we could use stepping stones   Saunders said   Allergan has relied heavily on M A because it views inventing its own drugs in house as too risky  Saunders  46  has attempted or executed mergers and acquisitions totaling more than  300 billion in the last three years   Allergan now has the money to embark on a major acquisition spree thanks to the sale of its generic drug portfolio to Teva Pharmaceutical  NYSE TEVA  Industries Ltd  TA TEVA   Allergan received  33 4 billion in cash and  5 1 billion in Teva stock last month as a result of that deal   While Allergan has pledged to spend some of those dollars on share buybacks  it will still have cash reserves of more than  20 billion it can spend on deals   Allergan wants to build out its central nervous system franchise  which is one of the largest in the industry and treats diseases including Alzheimer s  depression  migraines and schizophrenia  Saunders said   He added that he would like to branch out into other types of neurological treatments  including multiple sclerosis  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Parkinson s disease   One of Allergan s successful endeavors in the central nervous system space  its Namenda Alzheimer s franchise  took a hit over the past year after one of its key drugs  Namenda IR  lost patent protection  Namenda IR generated more than  500 million in 2015   Allergan is hoping that a ramp up of its newly commercialized anti psychotic drug  Vraylar  can help offset that decline  BOTOX AS A GATEWAY DRUG Saunders said he also is optimistic about opportunities in dermatology and eye care  adding that he would be open to a medium sized deal to build out its opthalmic products   In dermatology  Allergan has the world s biggest franchise by sales  largely due to its flagship drug  Botox  for wrinkle smoothing  Last year  in a stepping stone acquisition  Allergan bought a publicly traded dermatology company called Kythera for  2 1 billion  and it has been ramping up sales of its key drug  Kybella  which treats double chins   There s definitely potential for more deals like that in dermatology   said Randall Stanicky  an analyst at RBC Capital Markets   Botox is a gateway product into the entire world of aesthetics   In the interview  Saunders left open the possibility of a transformative acquisition or merger for Allergan  which has a market capitalization of  95 billion  He said a company with a cutting edge treatment that reversed Alzheimer s was an example of the type of big deal Allergan would consider making   Biogen Inc  N BIIB  and Eli Lilly and Co  N LLY  both have late stage drugs that promise to reverse the effects of the degenerative neurological disease  Biogen and Eli Lilly have market capitalizations of  65 billion and  86 billion  respectively

105470,326985,AGN,Allergan To Cut Jobs Amid Loss Of Exclusivity For Key Drugs,opinion,"Allergan plc   NYSE AGN    in a regulatory filing  announced that it is laying off over 1 000 employees as part of a cost saving and restructuring program to protect it from potential revenue declines 
Allergan said the job cuts will impact employees in commercial functions that revolve around products and categories already facing or will face loss of exclusivity  Allergan also said that it plans to eliminate an additional 400 open positions 
While the company estimates to incur costs of approximately  125 million  the job cuts and other cost savings measures are expected to save operating costs between  300 and  400 this year  Also  the majority of the costs  primarily due to severance  will be recorded in the fourth quarter 
Allergan currently employs more than 18 000 people 
The job cuts come at a time when Allergan is facing potential loss of exclusivity for several of its key products in 2018 including Alzheimer s treatment  Namenda XR and blockbuster dry eye drug  Restasis  which is expected to hurt sales 
Allergan is adopting different ways of protecting Restasis  its second best selling drug  from generic competition  Restasis recorded sales of  1 06 billion in the first nine months of 2017 
Allergan came under fire for entering into an agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe under which the latter obtained the rights to six patents covering Restasis and Allergan was granted exclusive licenses to Restasis products  Lawmakers questioned the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect Restasis from generic competition  The deal with the Tribe has raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drug makers from making cheaper versions of expensive drugs 
However  in October 2017  a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering Restasis  potentially opening doors for early generic competition  Though Restasis patents are scheduled to expire in August 2024  a generic version may be launched as early as mid 2018 
Also  this year  Allergan faces loss of patent exclusivity for Estrace vaginal cream and ulcerative colitis drug Delzicol  Last week  Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   launched the first generic version for Estrace cream 
Also  new competition for key growth drivers  Restasis and Linzess  is an investor concern  Shire s   NASDAQ SHPG   dry eye disease drug Xiidra  launched last year  is posing strong competition for Restasis  Meanwhile  Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc  s   NASDAQ SGYP   Trulance  plecanatide  was launched last yearfor chronic idiopathic constipation  which could pose competition to Allergan s Linzess 
In the past year  Allergan s shares have declined 22 9  compared with the  s decline of 26 8  

 
The job cuts are aimed to save some dollars at a time when Allergan is facing competitive and generic pressure related to some of its highest revenue generating products

105483,326998,AGN,Business groups sue over new U S  limit on tax driven foreign buyouts,news,"By David Ingram and David Morgan
NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    Two business groups sued the Obama administration on Thursday over a crackdown on U S  companies that try to reduce their U S  taxes by rebasing abroad in a process known as inversion 
The U S  Chamber of Commerce and the Texas Association of Business filed a lawsuit in Texas federal court that said a regulation from the U S  Treasury Department in April exceeded what the law allows the department to do 
The lawsuit was the first to challenge a rule on inversion  The deals are legal  but have drawn criticism from some politicians who say U S  companies that do them are avoiding their tax obligations  A wave of inversions largely ended after Treasury moved against the deals 
The rule targeted by the lawsuit is aimed at transactions involving non U S  companies  such as Ireland based drugmaker Allergan Plc  N AGN  that have grown through a series of acquisitions 
It helped scuttle what had been a planned  160 billion combination of Allergan and U S  drugmaker  Pfizer  Inc  N PFE  in what would have been the largest inversion ever 
 Treasury and the IRS ignored the clear limits of a statute  and simply rewrote the law unilaterally  This is not the way government is supposed to work in America   Tom Donohue  head of the chamber  a business lobbying group  said in a statement 
A Treasury spokeswoman said in a statement that its action was based on strong policy interests and clear legal authority  It said the department would continue to defend the regulations to slow the erosion of the U S  corporate tax base 
UPHILL BATTLE
Lawyers with expertise in tax law have said such a lawsuit would face an uphill battle against Treasury  which has a strong record in court  The 1867 Anti Injunction Act says that  in general  no legal challenge can be brought against a tax until it is assessed  So the administration of President Barack Obama could argue that the law bars a lawsuit for now 
 I would be quite surprised if this case survived the obvious defense by the Justice Department that this is an attempt to short circuit the regular course of tax collections   said Edward Kleinbard  a law professor at the University of Southern California 
The chamber and the Texas Association of Business argue  though  that the Treasury and the tax collecting Internal Revenue Service must still follow a different law  the Administrative Procedure Act  APA   That law spells out the process agencies must follow before they impose regulations 
According to the lawsuit  the Treasury rule violated the APA because Treasury lacked authority to act  its rule was arbitrary and capricious  and it did not permit public notice and comment 
Allergan and Pfizer are not parties to the lawsuit  but the lawsuits cites their failed merger as an example of the harm done by the rule 
Representatives of the companies declined to comment on the litigation 
Pfizer is a member of the chamber and the Texas Association of Business  Allergan is a member of the chamber and the Greater Waco Chamber of Commerce  which in turn is a member of the Texas group  the lawsuit said 
The two drug companies  would actively explore merger opportunities  if the rule were set aside  the lawsuit said 
DOZENS OF DEALS
Dozens of U S  companies have done inversions since 1983  when the first such deal was completed  Treasury has periodically moved to curb the flow of deals because inversions erode the U S  corporate income tax base 
Treasury unveiled a package of rules in April meant to further discourage the deals  which typically involve a U S  multinational buying a smaller company in a foreign country with lower corporate taxes and then rebasing there  if only on paper 
Inverting U S  companies usually leave their core U S  operations at home  transferring only their legal tax domicile to the home country of the acquired company  Recent popular destinations for the deals are Ireland  Britain and Canada 
Fast food chain Burger King inverted to Canada last year  medical technology group  Medtronic   N MDT  to Ireland in 2014  drug maker  Mylan Inc   O MYL  to The Netherlands that same year 
The lawsuit challenges a specific rule that imposed a three year limit on foreign companies such as Allergan bulking up on U S  assets to avoid ownership thresholds for a later inversion 
In April  Treasury defended its regulation in a statement that said it was  not consistent with the purposes  of federal law to permit a foreign company to bulk up so quickly and then enter into another inversion 
Texas federal courts have been a friendly venue for groups suing the Obama administration  A judge there blocked the president s proposed overhaul of immigration 
More litigation is expected in the months ahead as Treasury moves to finalize another anti inversions rule targeting  earnings stripping   a tax avoiding practice in which a foreign parent lends money to a U S  unit  which sends U S  profits back as partially U S  tax deductible interest 

Republicans  and at times Obama  have pushed for a comprehensive tax code overhaul that would fully address inversions  but Washington for decades has lacked the political will to tackle such a complex project ",2016-08-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/business-groups-sue-over-new-u.s.-limit-on-tax-driven-foreign-buyouts-418554,418554
105484,326999,AGN,Pfizer boosts cancer drug roster with  14 billion Medivation deal,news,"By Ransdell Pierson and Ankur Banerjee  Reuters     Pfizer  Inc  N PFE   beating out numerous other bidders  said it agreed to buy U S  cancer drug company  Medivation  Inc  O MDVN  for  14 billion in cash  adding its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi to the company s growing oncology roster  Medivation shares jumped nearly 20 percent to close at  80 42  just shy of the offer price of  81 50 per share  Shares of Pfizer  the largest U S  drugmaker  were down 0 4 percent at  34 84   The offer is a 55 percent premium to Sanofi SA s  PA SASY  initial bid to buy Medivation for  52 50 per share in April  which pushed the San Francisco based company to put itself up for sale  It represents a 118 percent increase since Reuters reported on March 30 that Medivation had hired JP Morgan to handle interest from companies in a potential acquisition   The planned purchase of Medivation  with its  2 2 billion a year Xtandi  is the latest in a number of deals by large drugmakers willing to pay top dollar for cancer drugs that are more effective than standard  older treatments  Perhaps the most notable example is AbbVie Inc s  N ABBV   21 billion purchase last year of Pharmacyclics  The deal gave AbbVie shared ownership with Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ  in the blockbuster leukemia drug Imbruvica  Analysts predicted the deal would not raise antitrust concerns because Pfizer does not currently sell a prostate cancer drug aside from generics   Pfizer said its earnings would increase immediately after buying Medivation  The deal comes four months after Pfizer and Ireland based Allergan Plc  N AGN  scrapped their  160 billion merger  Pfizer has since bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc in a  5 2 billion deal to add an eczema gel to its portfolio  The Medivation deal illustrates a shift in Pfizer s M A strategy from lowering taxes   the rationale behind the failed Allergan tax inversion deal   to strengthening its lineup of branded drugs  especially lucrative cancer treatments  Pfizer  in a conference call with analysts  said it still plans to decide by year end whether to split into separate companies selling either low growth generics or patent protected brand medicines    The Medivation deal increases the likelihood of a split   said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris  But  he said  Pfizer would likely first try to buy other drugmakers or their best assets in order to further strengthen its branded drug portfolio  A year ago  Pfizer paid  15 billion for Hospira  which sells generic hospital products and is developing biosimilars meant to compete with big selling injectable biotech drugs  That deal was seen by Wall Street as a way of bolstering its generic drugs ahead of potentially divesting the business   Pfizer s biggest growth driver is a new breast cancer drug called Ibrance  The company is also trying to catch up with Merck   Co  N MRK  and Bristol Myers Squibb Co  N BMY  in developing immuno oncology drugs that work by taking the brakes off the immune system to fight cancers  Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told analysts the Medivation deal was mainly driven by the desire to obtain Xtandi  although he expressed high hopes for talazoparib and pidilizumab  experimental Medivation drugs for breast cancer and lymphoma  respectively  Xtandi generated U S  net sales of  330 3 million in the second quarter  Japanese drugmaker Astellas Pharma Inc  T 4503  owns the rights to sell Xtandi outside the United States  where it generated sales of  240 million in the period  Read said Xtandi  which was approved four years ago to treat men who had failed to benefit from prostate cancer treatments  could capture far greater sales if it is eventually approved for earlier use and is prescribed by urologists   The product is just at the beginning of its growth cycle   Read predicted  Some analysts  including BMO s Alex Arfaei  said Pfizer appeared to be overpaying for Medivation  But Piper Jaffray analyst Richard Purkiss said the price is not excessive given Xtandi s potential for earlier treatment in coming years  Reuters had reported that Pfizer  Merck   Celgene Corp   O CELG  and  Gilead Sciences Inc   O GILD  had submitted expressions of interest to buy Medivation    Given the already very high price being discussed  the difficult public relationship between Medivation and Sanofi     we see a higher bid as very unlikely  but not impossible   RBC Capital Partners wrote in a client note ahead of the announcement   Sanofi said while it recognized the potential strategic benefits of a combination with Medivation  it was a  disciplined acquirer and remained committed to acting in the best interests of Sanofi shareholders    Pfizer said the deal was approved by boards of both companies and should be completed in the third or fourth quarter  Shares of other cancer drug companies  including  Incyte Corp   O INCY  and Seattle Genetics  O SGEN   also rose on Monday  as investors speculated about more dealmaking in the sector   Pfizer s financial advisers were Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners  with Ropes   Gray LLP providing legal counsel

The full approval was based on data from the phase III EORTC 26101study in which Avastin based treatment increased the time to disease progression or death compared to chemotherapy alone  The study  however  did not meet the primary endpoint as there was no significant increase in overall survival with Avastin based treatment 
However  it showed that patients were able to completely stop intake of corticosteroids while on treatment in the Avastin arm compared to the control arm  The evidence from the study  which showed that Avastin treatment delayed disease progression and reduced the need for corticosteroids  led to the conversion of the provisional approval to a full one 
Apart from the recent approval  the drug is already approved in the United States  for various indications that include  first  or second line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer  advanced nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC   metastatic kidney cancer and advanced cervical cancer and recurrent ovarian cancer 
So far this year  shares of the company have increased 8 4  compared with the  s gain of 15  

However  the drug has been facing competition and has been witnessing declining sales  In September 2017  Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   and its partner Allergan   NYSE AGN   announced that the FDA approved their biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer  colorectal cancer  glioblastoma  renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer  The biosimilar to be marketed by the trade name Mvasi is the first cancer biosimilar approved in the United States  It is also the first biosimilar for Avastin in the same country

Shares of Allergan have declined 18 2  this year so far  comparing favorably with the  s decrease of 28 1   Although Repros  shares plunged 49 7  so far this year  the same jumped more than 40  following the news on Dec 12 

 
Pursuant to the agreement  Allergan will execute the acquisition through its subsidiary for a cash tender offer of  0 67 per share of Repros  common stock  The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  Repros anticipates completion of the buyout during the first quarter of 2018 
Notably  the agreement will add two late stage candidates  Proellex and enclomiphene  to Allergan s pipeline  Repros plans to initiate a phase III study on Proellex for treatment of uterine fibroid  On one hand  the company currently evaluates Proellex  a selective progesterone modulator  SPRM   in a phase IIb study for uterine fibroids by vaginal delivery  On the other  enclomiphene is under evaluation for treating low testosterone levels in overweight men  Notably  the company had submitted regulatory applications to the European Medicines Agency  EMA  in September 2016  subsequently accepted by the regulatory body 
On a positive note  addition of these candidates would boost Allergan s pipeline and that bodes well for the company s long term growth 
We remind investors that acquisitions form an integral part of Allergan s expansion strategy as the company completed four major takeovers  Arrow  Specifar  Actavis Group and Warner Chilcott  apart from the Forest and Allergan Inc  deals in the past few years  This year so far  Allergan has burgeoned its medical aesthetics business into regenerative medicine and body sculpting through the accretive acquisitions of LifeCell and ZELTIQ  respectively

105520,327035,AGN,Independence of compliance reviews is questioned in drug firm settlements,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Some major U S  drug companies have hired their own auditors to perform compliance reviews mandated in government settlements over alleged civil violations  such as paying kickbacks or off label drug promotion  according to federal records reviewed by Reuters 
Third party compliance reviews are playing an increasingly large role in helping the government ensure companies fulfill their obligations in federal settlements 
But unlike the Justice Department or the Securities and Exchange Commission  the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general does not prohibit companies from hiring firms with whom they have existing business ties 
Some lawmakers and legal experts say that practice creates conflicts of interest and could impair outside reviewers  independence 
 If the goal of this whole thing is to have an energetic and independent reviewer ferreting out mistakes and potential fraud within the company  do not put them under the financial thumb of the people who have millions of dollars at stake in keeping the audit work   said Kevin Outterson  a professor of health and corporate law at Boston University 
Several large drug makers   including Novartis  GlaxoSmithKline  Merck  NYSE MRK   Sanofi  PA SASY  and  Allergan Inc   NYSE AGN pa     have relied on their existing or previous auditors  PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  or Ernst   Young  EY   to also serve as compliance reviewers  according to corporate filings and a list of reviewers 
The health agency s inspector general provided the list of reviewers hired by drug companies in response to a Reuters Freedom of Information Act request 
The inspector general typically settles civil claims through the use of a  corporate integrity agreement  mandating various reforms 
These five year deals often require the hiring of an independent compliance consultant known as an  independent review organization   which is tasked with reviewing internal policies and data  such as payments to doctors 
In exchange  the inspector general s office agrees not to exclude a company from participating in Medicaid and Medicare 
Susan Gillin  an attorney in the inspector general s office  said she agreed that  theoretically  a potential conflict of interest exists  
But she said her agency has not observed any problems with weak oversight by auditors serving in dual roles  Such arrangements are allowed  she said  as long as the firm is not involved in corporate management or advising on policies it will also review 
 We have very few repeat parties to corporate integrity agreements   she said 
While some companies have had multiple settlements over the years  they typically cover different alleged violations  or conduct committed by companies that  between settlements  became part of a different firm through an acquisition  Gillin said 
Spokespeople for Novartis  Merck  GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi all said they disclosed their business relationships to the inspector general  which reviewed them  A spokesman for Allergan Plc  said the arrangement predated the company s acquisition by  Actavis   NYSE AGN  in March 2015 
Executives at PwC and Ernst   Young told Reuters they believe their dual work auditing and conducting compliance reviews are not in conflict and that they comply with all applicable regulations 
The compliance reviewers  are independent in fact and in appearance   said EY Vice Chair Ron Hauben 
Nancy Beacham  a partner at PwC  said the firm adheres to federal standards for all public company auditing engagements 
 We abide by the rules of what we can and cannot do   she said 
BIG CONTRACTS AT STAKE
Some legal experts who see a conflict in the dual role say it can be exacerbated by the fact that accounting firms are generally paid more for their audit work than for these sorts of compliance reviews 
For example  prior to Allergan Inc s acquisition by Actavis in March 2015  the company disclosed that in fiscal year 2012  it paid Ernst   Young more than  5 million in audit fees  compared with more than  440 000 it paid the firm for compliance work performed under the corporate integrity agreement 
 Work with a major company is an important contract  and an established contractor isn t going to be independent   said Brandon Garrett  a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law 
Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley  an Iowa Republican  said such arrangements could weaken enforcement 
 If the firms enforcing the agreements aren t independent   he told Reuters in a statement  that  defeats the purpose of the agreements  
While some companies hire their auditors as reviewers  the majority of the more than two dozen public companies reviewed by Reuters that have or had corporate integrity agreements   such as  Pfizer   NYSE PFE   CVS Caremark and Eli Lilly   do not hire their own auditors and instead opt for consulting or law firms 
HISTORY OF VIOLATIONS
Pricewaterhouse s current dual clients for audits and compliance reviews include Novartis and Merck  according to the list provided by the health agency s inspector general 
GlaxoSmithKline previously engaged its auditor  PwC  for a compliance review which ended in 2012 
EY currently performs dual work for Sanofi and it previously did dual work for Allergan Inc  prior to its acquisition 
GlaxoSmithKine  Novartis and Merck have all been involved in multiple settlements with the U S  government since 1991 to resolve a range of criminal and civil claims  according to a recent report by the nonprofit watchdog Public Citizen 
GlaxoSmithKline has paid nearly  8 billion in federal fines between 1991 and 2015   the most of any drugmaker  according to the Public Citizen report 
A GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman said the company has greatly improved its compliance by taking steps such as eliminating payments to doctors who speak on the company s behalf and ending sales incentives based on prescription volumes 
Novartis  in 2010  settled civil charges of paying kickbacks to doctors who spoke at corporate events  and signed a corporate integrity agreement 
The company now faces another civil lawsuit filed by federal and state prosecutors  which alleges that kickbacks to doctors continued for nearly a year after it signed its 2010 corporate integrity agreement with the health agency s inspector general 
Novartis has sought to dismiss the case  saying it makes  sweeping  allegations of a  decade long  nationwide fraudulent scheme based on just fifteen doctors  ",2016-06-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/independence-of-compliance-reviews-is-questioned-in-drug-firm-settlements-406067,406067

105547,327062,AGN,Allergan s Vraylar Gets FDA Nod For Maintenance Therapy,opinion,"Allergan plc   NYSE AGN   announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  for label expansion of its schizophrenia capsule  Vraylar  cariprazine   for maintenance treatment 
Notably  Vraylar is already approved in the United States for acute treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder  It is also approved in Europe for the given indication 
Shares of Allergan have declined 16 9  this year so far  comparing favorably with the  s decrease of 31 5  

The FDA approval was based on new data from a 72 week study in the prevention of relapse in adult patients with schizophrenia  Data from the study demonstrated that long term treatment with Vraylar delayed time to relapse compared with placebo over the course of up to 72 Weeks 
Significantly  Vraylar has performed above expectations in 2016  recording sales of  94 3 million in the year  The drug is likely to be a key driver of Allergan s top line growth in 2017 
Per the company s press release  approximately 2 4 million people are affected by schizophrenia in the United States  Also  the disease relapses in 60 70  patients within a year if no maintenance treatment is taken  Hence  Vraylar s label expansion as a maintenance therapy will cater to the hugely unmet need of patients  requiring a long term treatment option for the disease 
Other players in the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia treatment market are AstraZeneca plc s   NYSE AZN   Seroquel XR  Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   Risperdal Consta and Alkermes plc s   NASDAQ ALKS   Aristada Allergan PLC  Price

Using contingent value rights in the case of Medivation may be more challenging for Sanofi  given its lackluster track record in cancer drugs  However  Sanofi has no plans to use contingent value rights in any new offer  according to the sources ",2016-05-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-pfizer-approaches-medivation-about-potential-takeover---sources-399651,399651

which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 05 per share by 4 8  and declined 24  year over year Revenues of  5 61 billion were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Sales increased 1  year over year  up 4  excluding impact of currency   mainly due to the inclusion of an extra month of revenues from Actavis acquisition compared with the third quarter of last year Teva acquired Allergan s   NYSE AGN   generics segment  Actavis Generics and also its U S  generic distribution business  Anda  Inc  last year Excluding the benefit from the Actavis generics acquisition  the core sales performance was below expectations  Sales in the quarter were hurt by increased pricing erosion and volume declines in the U S  Generics unit  ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela and loss of exclusivity in the Specialty segment in the quarter Segment DiscussionFrom the fourth quarter of 2016  Teva revised its segment structure following the Actavis acquisition  The Generics segment now includes revenues from the OTC business as well as the API business Generic Medicines segment revenues were  3 billion  down 8  year over year Revenues from the U S  generics business declined 9  to  1 2 billion due to significant competitive and pricing pressure in the generics industry  The ongoing consolidation of customers in the generics industry has led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume  The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs  Moreover  accelerated FDA approvals of additional generic versions of competing off patent medicines and increased competition for Concerta authorized generic  also hurt sales European generic revenues were  985 million  up 6   1  in local currency  from the year ago period  This was due to the inclusion of three months revenues from the generic business of Actavis versus two month in the year ago quarter Rest of the world  ROW  generic revenues declined 18  to  843 million in the quarter  On a local currency basis  sales rose 5  mainly due to the inclusion of revenues from Actavis API revenues declined 10  to  171 million  OTC revenues were down 22  to  306 million  up 15  in local currency terms  Specialty Medicines revenues were  2 03 billion  down 1  from the year ago period due to lower sales of its central nervous system  CNS  products  Among Teva s various therapeutic areas  CNS sales declined 12  to  1 15 billion due to lower sales of multiple sclerosis drug  Copaxone  Teva s lead branded product Sales of respiratory products rose 30  to  351 million  oncology product sales rose 12  to  302 million  and women s health business recorded a 9  increase in revenues to  119 million  Other specialty revenues rose 18  to  116 million Worldwide revenues of Copaxone declined 7  to  987 million mainly due to lower sales in the United States  Sales declined 8  in the United States to  802 million due to lower volumes of the 20 mg formulation and negative net pricing effects despite the 7 9  price increase taken in January Glatopa  a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg  is being marketed by Momenta and Sandoz  Novartis    NYSE NVS   generic arm  since 2015 while Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   launched its version of the 20 mg formulation last month  In a major blow to Teva  last month  Mylan also launched its generic version of the 40 mg thrice weekly  3TW   three times a week  formulation   much earlier than expected  The 40 mg formulation of Copaxone accounted for more than 85  of total Copaxone scrips in the United States at the end of the reported quarter Ex U S  sales of Copaxone declined 1  to  185 million Among other products  Azilect sales declined 64  to  36 million as a generic version of the drug was launched in the United States this year  ProAir rose 31  to  155 million  combined Treanda and Bendeka revenues declined 21  to  181 million and QVAR declined 1  to  95 million The Other segment  distribution and other activities  recorded revenues of  569 million  up 122 2  year over year  The segment mainly gained from the inclusion of distribution revenues from Anda Profits DeclineAdjusted gross margin contracted 800 basis points  bps  to 53  in the quarter due to the addition of the low margin Anda distribution business and low margins in both the Generic Medicines and Specialty Medicines segments  Research   development expenses declined 6 2  from the year ago period to  381 million  Selling and marketing  S M  expenditure declined 9 4  from the year ago level to  805 million  Adjusted operating margin

of  22 2    22 3 billion compared with  22 8    23 2 billion expected previously  The company expects earnings in the band of  3 77  3 88 per share in 2017  significantly lower than  4 30  4 50 per share expected previouslyIncreased price erosion and volume declines in the U S Generics market  lower than expected contribution from new generic launches in the United States and the accelerated erosion in Copaxone sales following the earlier than expected launch of the 40 mg generic resulted in the guidance cut With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation  Teva estimates a negative impact of at least 30 cents per share on fourth quarter earnings  higher than Teva s previous assumption of 25 cents Meanwhile many other filers  including Momenta are also looking to get approval for their generic versions of the 40 mg formulation  which if approved  will erode sales further Teva now expects new product launches to contribute  400 million to revenues compared with  500 million expected previously Our TakeAmid already lowered expectations  Teva s disappointing third quarter results and the slash in outlook led to a sharp decline in share price Shares declined almost 20  on Thursday  hitting a 52 week low of  10 85  In fact  shares have slumped 69  so far this year compared with the  s decline of 31 4  Teva s branded drug pipeline is progressing decently and it has also divested some non core assets  mainly in the Women s Health business  including Paragard and Plan B One Step contraceptives  to cut its significant debt load  However  it might not be enough to revive the company s fortunes during this challenging period  particularly as it faces erosion of its largest product  Copaxone It will be

105584,327099,AGN,A Flash Resolution To Bearish Divergence,opinion,"AT40   48 1  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   54 9  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   11 3  a new all time low  Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish
Commentary It was by the slimmest of margins  but the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   finally ended a week with a loss  After 8 straight weeks of gains  the index closed the last week with a 0 2  loss as Friday slipped by 0 1  

The S P 500  SPY  survived a dip on Thursday  but slipped again on Friday  The uptrending 20 day moving average  DMA  is just barely holding as support 
For a hot minute  the dip on Thursday looked like the resolution of the bearish divergence which revealed the narrowing of the latest rally  The day looked very similar to a resolution from two weeks prior  but this time around the buyers were even more successful at erasing the losses with a same day reversal  Unlike the dip from two weeks ago  the next day did not deliver buying follow through  Interestingly  the trading placed the volatility index  the VIX  right back to where it was two weeks ago with a gain of 7 5  on the day and 24  for the week 

The volatility index  the VIX  came alive this week and actually fought off the automatic volatility faders 
The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM  became the highlight of the narrowing rally  IWM has declined almost steadily since its last closing all time high 5 weeks ago  Critically  IWM spent the last three days struggling to hold onto its 50DMA support 

The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  IWM  is cooling off from a sharp rally off the August low  The 50DMA line of support has so far halted the slide 
Financials also contributed to the resolution of bearish divergence by buckling this past week off a 10 year high  Like IWM  the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  has its 50DMA creating a critical support line  I am watching closely for a buy the dip opportunity to load up on a new tranche of call options 

The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  sold off sharply from its 10 year high  Will its 50DMA hold as support 
AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  closed the week at 48 1  and a 2 month low  Its steady 5 week decline from overbought conditions closely matches the decline in IWM  AT200  T2107   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  also peaked in early October but has declined much less sharply  AT200 declined from 60 8  to 54 9   This gentle slope helps explain why the major indices have yet to produce a major dip during the narrowing of the rally  While I was looking for the rally to start broadening last week  I am now thinking the current trends will continue absent a catalyst to produce significant buying interest 
STOCK CHART REVIEWS
Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  CAT inspired industrials two weeks ago with a major post earnings gap up to a new all time high  Buyers have yet to follow through on the excitement  On Thursday  CAT gapped down to a post earnings low  I added to an existing call option as one of my few dip buys in anticipation of a downside resolution of the previous bearish divergence  CAT rallied off uptrending 20DMA support on Friday 
Caterpillar  CAT  fell from its primary uptrend through its upper Bollinger Band  BB  channel  The post earnings gap up is starting to look like a blow off top  but the stock has a chance for repair at its uptrending 20DMA support 
Blue Apron Holdings Inc  NYSE APRN I took a small chance on APRN  It completely failed  This company really should never have gone public  Bankruptcy anyone  The chart says it all 
Blue Apron  APRN  looks like it cooked itself  The post IPO slide resumed after a disastrous earnings report 
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc  NYSE AMC I was hopeful for AMC  This now looks like a 2018 recovery story  The stock ended the week at a new all time low 

AMC Entertainment Holding  AMC  hit a new all time low  A positive catalyst now looks some time away 
Impinj Inc  NASDAQ PI  This is a bottom fishing play that is working out very well so far  Earnings were extremely disappointing for the second report in a row  I think the steepness of the sell offs are the release of overly inflated expectations  Using   I bought PI after it closed at a post earnings high  My optimistic upside target is around  30 where the downtrending 20DMA is headed 

Impinj  PI  is a stock breaking down  Can the current post earnings recovery mark the beginnings of a sustainable bottom 
DexCom Inc  NASDAQ DXCM  DXCM also triggered a bottom fishing buy  but it quickly started sliding again after that  The lows held and a post earnings gap up seem to confirm a bottom in the making  I wrote about the DXCM play in    

A bottoming seems underway for DexCom  DXCM  as earnings help to propel the stock to a fresh post Abbott news high 
Teva Pharma Industries Ltd ADR  NYSE TEVA  The pain is unending for TEVA  I dove back into this one WITHOUT the confirmation that comes with the bottom fishing rules because I thought I had fundamental reasons for taking the risk  The chart below speaks volumes  TEVA is likely also helping to drag stakeholder Allergan  NYSE AGN  lower and lower 

Teva Pharmaceuticals  TEVA  continues a mighty struggle  The stock nows sits at a 17  year low 
Tableau Software  NYSE DATA  DATA is one strange stock  Ever since a massive post earnings collapse in February  2016  subsequent earnings have produced big moves  Sometimes the stock sold off post earnings only to turn right around and rally to new heights  Ahead of its latest earnings  DATA sat at a near double for the year  This optimism was apparently misplaced for the latest report as the stock gapped down below 50DMA support post earnings for a 10  loss  It now trades right around where it did right after the previous earnings report  I tried a pre earnings play that failed and reached for a play on a bottom after buyers started showing up  A new post earnings low would be very bearish for the stock 

Tableau Software  DATA  closed below 50DMa support for the first time since April 
El Pollo Loco Holdings Inc  NASDAQ LOCO  LOCO joined the carnage infecting so many casual dining plays  If not for the widespread malaise  I would have held onto my shares as part of my second swing through the chicken trade  Buyers are already creeping back into the stock  so I am watching closely for a post earnings closing high to buy 

El Pollo Loco Holdings  LOCO  suffered a second poor earnings report in a row  The stock now trades back at the all time lows hit two years ago Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc  NASDAQ RRGB  RRGB is a poster child for the carnage in casual dining  The stock collapsed 29  toward its low for the year on what was an awful earnings report  The company completely reset expectations by guiding down Q4 EPS to  0 45  0 60 vs   1 00 analyst  consensus   The only thing going for RRGB now is the 45 2  short position  The longer the stock fails to make fresh post earnings lows  the more likely nervous bears will start covering  and presumably take profits   I LOVE the turkey burgers and  now bottomless  sweet potato fries  I wish I could love the stock similarly 

Red Robin Gourmet Burgers  RRGB  suffered a devastating and very bearish double breakdown through 50 and 200DMA supports 
Zynga Inc  NASDAQ ZNGA  Two months ago  I pointed out the breakout for Zynga  ZNGA   I held onto my shares and braced myself for earnings  I felt like a genius as the stock soared to a new 3 1 2 year high  Unfortunately  the sellers stepped in soon thereafter and took profits back down to the current consolidation range  I now sit and wait for the next positive catalyst 

Zynga  ZNGA  is on a very extended  two stage  consolidation  The three major moving averages support future upside 
United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X  The recovery in U S  Steel continued with a big gap up from earnings after market October 31  The move kept intact the steady uptrend in the 50DMA  The move also  stranded  a bunch of sellers who panicked ahead of earnings and created a 50DMA breakdown  This island  also known as an abandoned baby bottom  serves as a very clear line in the sand for a higher bottom in U S  Steel  With the 50 and 200DMAs converging as well  X maintains a bullish look 

U S  Steel  X  survived another earnings report by returning to a bullish position above its 50 and 200DMAs

105585,327100,AGN,Deja vu for Paulson as Allergan loss hurts U S  hedge funds,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss and Lawrence Delevingne BOSTON NEW YORK  Reuters    For hedge fund titan John Paulson  history may be repeating itself   The billionaire investor lost an estimated  258 million on Tuesday when the share price of drug company Allergan Plc  N AGN  tumbled nearly 15 percent on speculation new tax rules would scuttle its merger with  Pfizer  Inc   N PFE   Research firm Symmetric io calculated the hypothetical loss based on publicly disclosed stock holdings as of Dec  31  2015  That estimated decline comes after Paulson lost money  in late 2014 when his Advantage fund dropped 13 6 percent in October of that year after U S  pharmaceutical company  AbbVie Inc   N ABBV  backed out of a planned deal with Irish drug maker  Shire  Plc  L SHP  after new tax rules made the deal less lucrative for the companies  Merger arbitrage specialists such as the  18 billion Paulson   Co bet on the outcome of mergers  Paulson s bet that the Allergan deal would go ahead has been rattled by the new tax rules  which were unveiled on Monday  Reuters reported on Tuesday that Pfizer was leaning toward abandoning its  160 billion agreement to buy Botox maker Allergan  Paulson  who made his reputation on bets against the U S  housing market and said recently in a video interview how critical it was to stay the course in investing  did not comment  The Paulson Partners fund  which bets on corporate events such as mergers  is down 7 7 percent in 2016 through February  according to a person familiar with the returns  The Paulson Advantage Plus Fund lost 11 24 percent in the first two months of the year  More recent figures were not available   Paulson is not the only fund that got burned  Symmetric io estimated that hedge funds in total lost  3 billion on Allergan on Tuesday  Research from Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  shows that 80 hedge funds counted Allergan as one of their top 10 holdings at the end of the fourth quarter  making the company one of the most popular stocks in the hedge fund industry  The pain appears to have been particularly acute for four large hedge fund firms  Viking Global Investors  Paulson   Co  Third Point and Pentwater Capital Management each lost more than  200 million on Tuesday  the Symmetric io data show  according to year end holding disclosures   It is possible that positions have since changed  The firms mentioned either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment  Less than a year ago  Daniel Loeb s Third Point invested with Allergan and praised the company s management team  including Chief Executive Brent Saunders  In a July 2015 letter to clients  Loeb was particularly happy to hear Saunders talk about the opportunity for a transformational transaction  That was after Allergan had already merged with  Actavis  but before the Pfizer deal was announced late last year  The risk of the deal being scuttled also hurt players who had made smaller bets on Allergan

105586,327101,AGN,Obama s inversion curbs kill Pfizer s  160 billion Allergan deal,news,"By Caroline Humer and Ransdell Pierson NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  drug maker  Pfizer  Inc  NYSE PFE  agreed on Tuesday to terminate its  160 billion agreement to acquire Botox maker Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  Plc  in a major victory to U S  President Barack Obama s drive to stop tax dodging corporate mergers  The decision to end the biggest tax  inversion  ever attempted  which would have seen Pfizer slash its tax bill by redomiciling to Ireland where Allergan is registered  came a day after the U S  Treasury unveiled new rules to curb inversions  While these new rules did not name Pfizer and Allergan  one of their provisions targeted a specific feature of their merger  Allergan s previous history as a major acquirer of other companies  The subsequent demise of the deal allows Obama to claim a big win during his last year in office  Earlier on Tuesday  Obama called global tax avoidance a  huge problem  and urged Congress to take action to stop U S  companies from tax avoiding corporate  inversions   which lower companies tax bills by redomiciling overseas   While the Treasury Department s actions will make it more difficult    to exploit this particular corporate inversions loophole  only Congress can close it for good   Obama said  Pfizer and Allergan will announce the termination of their deal on Wednesday  a source familiar with the matter said  asking not to be identified ahead of any official statement  Pfizer and Allergan declined to comment  Pfizer was concerned that any tweaks to salvage the inversion might have provoked new rules by the U S  Treasury  and so was leaning earlier on Tuesday to end the deal  a source had earlier told Reuters  Pfizer will have to pay Allergan up to  400 million for its expenses as a result of terminating the deal  according to their merger agreement  Pfizer shares had ended trading in New York on Tuesday up 2 percent on hopes the company would walk away or renegotiate the deal in its favor  Allergan shares closed down 14 8 percent to their lowest level since October 2014   Several U S  presidential candidates  including Republican Donald Trump and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders  have seized on the issue in their campaigns   We have so many companies leaving  it is disgraceful   Trump told reporters as he greeted voters in Waukesha  Wisconsin on Tuesday  Clinton and Sanders both expressed support for Treasury s plan   Besides Pfizer Allergan  other pending inversion deals that have not yet closed include the proposed  16 5 billion merger of  Johnson Controls  Inc  NYSE JCI  with Ireland based Tyco International Plc  Waste Connections Inc s  2 67 billion deal with Canada s Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd  and IHS Inc s  13 billion acquisition of London based Markit Ltd  In all these cases  the shares of the target companies fell only slightly  Johnson Controls and Tyco said they would respond after conducting a review of the new rules   Waste Connections and Progressive Waste Solutions said they expected the rules would impact less than 3 percent of the combined adjusted free cash flow in their first year after the deal   IHS and Markit said they believed the rules would not affect their adjusted effective tax rate guidance of a low to mid twenties percentage range  THREE YEAR RULE Under previous rules which still apply  Allergan shareholders needed to own at least 40 percent of the combined company for the two companies to enjoy the full tax benefits of an inversion  and more than 20 percent to have any inversion benefit at all  But a new  three year look back rule  issued by the Treasury on Monday made this much harder for Allergan  and appeared to take aim directly at it because of how the company was put together   The new rule does not allow stock accumulated through a foreign company s U S  deals in the last three years to count towards the book value needed to meet the inversion threshold  This weighed on Allergan heavily because of its significant deals in this timeframe  These include the  66 billion merger of Allergan and  Actavis   NYSE AGN  Plc  the  25 billion purchase of Forest Laboratories and the  5 billion takeover of Warner Chilcott    The serial acquisition portion of the regulations will cause Pfizer to be treated as an  expatriated entity   under the terms of its existing deal with Allergan    Robert Willens  a corporate tax and accounting analyst  wrote in a note  SHEDDING GENERICS In a second change to the rules  the Treasury also said it would seek to limit a practice known as earnings stripping that is often undertaken following  but not limited to  an inversion  The new Treasury rules would restrict related party debt for U S  subsidiaries in dealings that do not finance new investment in the United States   Without Allergan s new  fast growing medicines  Pfizer may need to look for other companies with attractive products  such as U S  drugmakers Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  Inc  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ REGN  and  AbbVie Inc   NYSE ABBV   said Raghuram Selvaraju  managing director of brokerage H C  Wainwright  Pfizer had planned to make a decision by 2016 whether to split off its hundreds of generic medicines  but delayed the decision until 2019 after announcing its merger with Allergan  Morningstar analyst Damien Conover had said the decision could be moved to late 2017 or 2018 if the deal with Allergan collapsed   Pfizer  which announced the deal in November  had said its tax rate would drop to about 17 or 18 percent after the deal  from around 25 percent  That would have represented more than  1 billion in annual cost savings   The deal s collapse is also a blow to the investment banks involved  Guggenheim Partners LLC   Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   Centerview Partners Holdings LLC and Moelis   Co stood to share  94 million in fees advising Pfizer had the deal closed  while Allergan would have paid its advisors  JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  and  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS    142 million in total  according to the latest estimates by Freeman   Co LLC  Bankers may now get paid only 10 percent of these amounts  according to Freeman  This is not the first time a tightening of the U S  inversion rules have caused a merger to unravel  U S  pharmaceutical company AbbVie abandoned its  55 billion takeover of Ireland domiciled peer  Shire  Plc  LON SHP  after the Obama administration cracked down on inversions in 2014  AbbVie had to pay Shire a  1 6 billion break up fee

105611,327126,AGN,Will Allergan Reward Shareholders ,opinion,"Allergan  NYSE AGN  has been a painful ride for investors  Starting last year when the proposed merger with Pfizer  NYSE PFE  fell through  Allergan has fallen  As of this writing  shares are trading at  186 and nearing their 52 week low 
But the interesting thing about Allergan is that it has a lot going for it and most analysts agree  In this post  I will show you all of the great things going on with this company and what might be some of the things holding the stock back 
Things Going Right For Allergan
Looking first at earnings  the company reported earnings per share of  4 02 which beast estimates by  0 10  Revenues came in at  4 billion  also beating estimates  this time by  70 million  This was an increase of 9  
And this growth isn t expected to slow  Analysts expect earnings growth of 13  over the next 5 years 
What is fueling this growth  First are the drugs Botox and Juvederm  Both are seeing increases in sales and these 2 treatments only account for around 10  market share in their respective segments  In other words  there is a lot of room for future growth 
In addition to these  Allergan has 6 drugs in its pipeline that are getting rave reviews and if they pass through clinical trials  are expected to be revenue machines 
Here are the 6 drugs 

Ubrogepant  treatment for migraines
Atogepant  treatment for migraines
Rapastinel  treatment for depression
ESMYA  treatment for uterine fibroids
Relamorelin  treatment for diabetic gastroparesis
Ceniciviroc  treatment for HIV infection
Abicipar  treatment for macular degeneration

Next up is international sales growth  During its recent earnings report  international sales are up over 16   with China leading the way with growth of 61   Most analysts agree that this speed of international growth should continue 
Finally  Allergan has decided to institute a share buyback program of  2 billion and has raised revenue guidance for the remainder of 2017  Add to this some analysts have a price target of  275 per share  which leaves a lot of room for price appreciation 
The Case Against Allergan
With such a great outlook  what are some things that could potentially be holding the stock price back  There are a few things  and here they are in no particular order 
Debt  the company has over  30 billion of debt on the books  I m not sure why this would be a major factor now as most investors ignored it when merger talks were happening with Pfizer  But since that deal fell through  the focus has been on the large amount of debt  Maybe is it because Allergan seems to have no interest in paying it off quickly 
Slowing sales  some of the drugs the company has on the market are seeing declines in sales  These are outweighed by the great performance of other drugs it is selling  And since drugs in the pipeline are not a guaranteed revenue stream until they actually come to market  investors can t assume the declining sales will be further hidden by newer  hot selling drugs 
So Should You Invest In Allergan 
Personally  I don t understand why investors are beating this stock down so much  The company has a great outlook and the negatives that are potentially weighing it down are not the biggest of concerns  At these levels  I would be investing in this stock 
If analysts are right and the stock hits its target of  275  you are making a ton of money  And even if it doesn t hit that target  there is still tremendous upside potential for this stock

105614,327129,AGN,Is Aerie  AERI  Poised For A Beat This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AERI   is expected report third quarter 2017 results on Nov 1  Last quarter  the company reported a narrowed than expected loss 
In fact  Aerie s performance over the last four quarters has been decent  The company reported a narrower than expected loss in three of the trailing four quarters while posting wider than expected loss in the remaining one  with an average positive surprise of 0 64  

 
Aerie s share price has increased 40 8  year to date as against the  s 5 6  decline  Earlier in the month  Aerie s stock price surged on positive news for its lead drug  Rhopressa 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model indicates Aerie to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen which is the case here 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 61   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 61 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 62 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Aerie has a Zacks Rank  3  which is favorable  The combination of a Zacks Rank  3 and a positive ESP indicates a likely positive surprise  Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision 
Factors at Play
With no approved product in its portfolio  Aerie depends heavily on its late stage candidates   Rhopressa and Roclatan  Hence  we expect investor focus on pipeline updates 
Aerie s lead candidate  Rhopressa  a once daily formulation for lowering intraocular pressure  IOP  is being evaluated in patients suffering from open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension  On Oct 13  the Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted in favor of Rhopressa s approval  The members of the committee unanimously agreed that the trials support the efficacy of netarsudil ophthalmic solution for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension 
In addition  majority of the members agreed that the Rhopressa s efficacy outweigh safety risks 
The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date of Feb 28  2018  We note that the FDA is not bound by the Advisory Committee s guidance  but takes its advice into consideration when reviewing drugs 
Apart from Rhopressa  Aerie is also evaluating Roclatan  Aerie initiated a phase III study   Mercury 3 in Europe for its other pipeline candidate Roclatan 0 02  0 005   Roclatan is a once daily  quadruple action fixed dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Xalatan  is being evaluated to lower IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension  The company plans to submit its NDA for the same in the first half of 2018 
The trial is a non inferiority trial comparing Roclatan to prescribed fixed dose combination of Ganfort  a combination of the bimatoprost along with timolol   marketed by Allergan plc   NYSE AGN   in Europe 
We expect investors to focus on further pipeline updates on the call  Cash burn for the year is projected at  110 million  up from  100 million due to further pipeline development Aerie Pharmaceuticals  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

105617,327132,AGN,New U S  inversion rules threaten Pfizer Allergan deal,news,By Lindsay Dunsmuir and Carl O Donnell WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters    The U S  Treasury Department took new steps on Monday to curb tax avoiding corporate  inversions   with the pending  160 billion merger of  Pfizer  Inc  NYSE PFE  and Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  Plc seen as a potential casualty  The changes  less than a year before President Barack Obama ends his term  follow sharp political criticism of Pfizer s and Allergan s merger  which would be the largest inversion deal ever  While the rules did not single out this deal  one of the provisions takes aim directly at it  Shares of Dublin based Allergan fell 22 percent in after market trading  while shares of New York based Pfizer rose 3 percent  The companies said they were reviewing the Treasury Department s notice   Prior to completing any review  we won t speculate on any potential impact   the companies said in a joint statement  The federal government has grappled with a wave of inversions in recent years as U S  companies have sought to slash their tax bills by redomiciling overseas  though their core operations and management usually remain in the United States even as they claim a new tax home  Several U S  presidential candidates  including Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton  have seized on the issue in their campaigns  Obama  a Democrat  has called repeatedly for action by the Republican controlled U S  Congress on inversions  but lawmakers have done little  He repeated his appeal to Congress on Monday and said he welcomed the Treasury s action  The Treasury said in a statement it will impose a three year limit on foreign companies bulking up on U S  assets to avoid ownership limits for a later inversion deal   In simple words  Allergan s key deals in the prior 36 months won t be counted  as far as meeting the inversion threshold is concerned  when doing the ownership math for the Pfizer Allergan deal   Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note   These deals include the  66 billion merger of Allergan Plc and  Actavis   NYSE AGN  Plc  the  25 billion purchase of Forest Laboratories and the  5 billion takeover of Warner Chilcott   The real issue is not so much what Allergan may prove or disprove  or whether Treasury overstepped its authority  The real question is whether Pfizer reads today s regulations as reason enough to not continue to pursue the deal   Raffat wrote  Under the agreement between Pfizer and Allergan  either party may terminate the deal if an adverse change in U S  law would cause the combined company to be treated as a U S  domestic corporation for federal income tax purposes  The terminating party would have to pay the other company up to  400 million for its expenses  according to the merger agreement  LEW SAYS LEGISLATION STILL NEEDED Treasury also said it is proposing rules to tackle a practice known as earnings stripping that is often undertaken following an inversion  Earnings stripping covers a range of financial dealings that shrink the taxable U S  profits of multinationals  A common strategy is to load up the U S  unit of a redomiciled foreign company with debt and then shift U S  profits to the new lower tax foreign jurisdiction through interest payments  The new Treasury rules would restrict related party debt for U S  subsidiaries in dealings that do not finance new investment in the United States  As part of these proposed regulations  the Internal Revenue Service would also be able to divide debt instruments into part debt and part equity  Treasury said  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the new actions would  further rein in  inversions  while he repeated his call that only legislation in Congress could prevent such deals  But at least one business group  the Organization for International Investment  which advocates for foreign based companies  condemned the new rules   Treasury s action would increase the cost of investing and expanding across the United States for all foreign companies and put at risk more than 12 million American workers that are supported by foreign direct investment in the United States   Nancy McLemon  the group s chief executive  said in a statement  Such tax avoidance schemes have long been a thorn in Treasury s side  The proposed deal between Pfizer and Allergan  which would create the world s largest drugmaker  prompted renewed scrutiny  Pfizer plans to redomicile in Ireland  where Allergan is based  and the companies expect to complete their merger in the second half of this year  Last November  following the announcement of the Allergan Pfizer deal  Treasury clamped down on inversions by limiting a U S  acquirer s ability to set up a new foreign parent in a third country and to  stuff  assets into a foreign parent to meet post inversion ownership limits  On Treasury s latest steps  Senator Charles Schumer of New York  who has been a co sponsor of legislation to curb inversions  said in a statement   These regulations will make potential inverters and foreign acquirers think twice before making the leap  and those bad actors should be on notice that we intend to clamp down even further    This story has been refiled to correct syntax in headline  It was earlier refiled to add dropped word  Pfizer  in paragraph 3

105637,327152,AGN,Non Alcoholic Steatohepatitis 2017 Progress Update,opinion,"Big time investors of late have been investing a substantial portion of their R D sources for the treatment of Non Alcoholic Steatohepatitis  NASH   The market for NASH is poised to witness rapid growth unlike other lucrative but saturated markets like cancer 
A chronic liver disease  NASH is caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver which in turn is known as steatosis  NASH is known to affect up to 15 million people in the United Stated and could lead inflammation  hepatocellular injury  progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis  It is expected to be the leading cause for liver transplantation by 2020  Notably  it is currently the leading cause of liver transplants for people under 50 in the United States 
NASH patients are also known to be affected by obesity and type II diabetes  The disease is prevalent in European countries along with developing countries  The market for this disease is projected around  20  35 billion  With no treatments currently approved for this disease  the market opportunity is significant 
Let us take a look at the companies whose candidates are being evaluated at present for the treatment of NASH 
Intercept Pharmaceuticials  Inc    NASDAQ ICPT   is presently evaluating lead drug Ocaliva  The drug is already approved in the United States for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis  PBC  with an inadequate response to or intolerant to the standard of care  UDCA  The company currently has an ongoing phase III trial  REGENERATE  in non cirrhotic NASH patients with liver fibrosis and top line data from interim analysis is expected in the first half of 2019 
The company also completed a phase II trial  CONTROL  to evaluate the lipid metabolic effects of Ocaliva and cholesterol management effects of concomitant statin administration in NASH patients  The company also plans to initiate a phase III trial in NASH patients with cirrhosis in the second half of 2017  Given the success of the phase II trial  we expect Intercept to be one of the first companies to obtain an approval for NASH 
Biotech bigwig Gilead Sciences Inc    NASDAQ GILD   also has quite a few programs for patients diagnosed with NASH along with advanced fibrosis  These include selonsertib  ASK 1 inhibitor  phase III   GS 9674  FXR agonist  phase II  and GS 0976  ACC inhibitor  phase II   The company plans to initiate combination studies with three agents in 2017 
Given the increasing competition in once lucrative hepatitis C market  Gilead is looking to diversify its portfolio and foray into emerging fields of CAR T therapy and NASH  The company earlier acquired Phenex s farnesoid X receptor program comprising small molecule FXR agonists for the treatment of liver diseases including NASH 
Another major player in the biotech space  Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   has a mid stage candidate in the NASH space  BMS 986036  an investigational pegylated analogue of human fibroblast growth factor 21  FGF21   a key regulator of metabolism  in patients with biopsy confirmed NASH  F1 F3  achieved its primary endpoint of significant reduction in liver fat versus placebo in April  The company was entitled the rights to research  develop and commercialize BMS 986036 from Ambrx  Inc 
Swiss major Novartis Inc    NYSE NVS   entered into a clinical trial agreement with Allergan plc   NYSE AGN   to conduct a phase IIb study in April  involving the combination of a Novartis FXR agonist and Allergan s cenicriviroc for the treatment of NASH  The company has a collaboration and license agreement with Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ CNAT   for the global development and commercialization of emricasan for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis caused by NASH Medical   Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR   Return 
Bottom Line 
Given the potential in the market  there are many other big pharma and biotech companies having pipeline candidates for the treatment of NASH  We expect a lot of activity in the space going forward  A potential approval of any drug for NASH will attract more players

105638,327153,AGN,Pharma Industry Outlook   October 2017,opinion,"Pharma Sector Makes a Strong Recovery in 2017
As we head toward the end of 2017  the pharma and biotech sectors have bounced back nicely with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gaining 14 8   while the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is up 26 9   This is in sharp contrast to 2016  which was a tough year for pharma and biotech stocks with the sector facing a lot of criticism for rising drug prices 
While drug pricing was a key reason for the sector s underperformance last year  it was not the only challenge for the sector  2016 was also disappointing from an R D perspective with a fewer number of drugs managing to gain FDA approval  There were some high profile pipeline failures as well  Other factors like mixed results  slower than expected new product launches and increasing competition also weighed on the sector 
However  the sector has rebounded nicely this year  New product sales ramping up  R D success and innovation  strong results  a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from key products are some of the factors that could contribute to a sustained recovery in the sector  Tax reforms and cash repatriation should also work in its favor 
Moreover  investors now seem more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are focusing more on the fundamentals of the sector  Although the drug pricing issue will remain a headwind  expectations are that steps taken by the Trump administration to drive down drug prices will not be as draconian as previously expected 
Deregulation and increased competition seem to be some of the ways that will be used to control drug prices  FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said that the agency is working on a plan to lower healthcare costs by speeding up the development of next generation treatments  especially for rare diseases or targeted cancer therapies 
Valuation Suggests Upside Potential
Going by the price to earnings multiple  which is often used to value drug stocks  the pharmaceutical industry looks pretty attractive at this point  The industry is currently trading at 15 6x forward 12 month consensus EPS estimate  below the S P 500 P E multiple of 18 2  leaving room for upside  Moreover  when compared to the industry s own performance over the last five years  it can be seen that the current multiple is below the industry high of 18 1  Keeping these numbers in mind  the current level seems to represent an attractive entry point 
So what are the factors that could drive the sector  First and foremost  this is an industry that will continue to witness demand for its products given an aging population and the increasing prevalence of a wide variety of diseases  Strong pipelines  innovative treatments  impressive results  and increased health care spending should support growth  Trump s pro business stand is also expected to benefit the sector 
A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits 
But as we said earlier  drug pricing will remain a headline risk  Other challenges for the sector include the growing presence of biosimilars  generic competition  a slowdown in the growth of legacy products and high profile pipeline setbacks 
What About Mergers and Acquisitions  M As  
The year started off with expectations that M A activity would pick up  but this did not happen  Although several small deals were announced  big ticket M A activity was more or less limited  Johnson   Johnson s  30 billion acquisition of Actelion and Gilead s  GILD   11 9 billion acquisition of Kite were the major M A news this year  while a few bolt on deals were announced by other companies 
The sector will receive an additional boost if more M A deals are announced  though companies are likely to adopt a  wait and see  stance as they await more clarity on the drug pricing situation and tax reforms  Another major deterrent could be high valuations with companies remaining wary of bidding wars leading to over priced deals 
Meanwhile  in licensing deals continue to be popular with several big companies tying up with smaller and mid sized players with promising mid to late stage pipeline candidates or interesting technology  These deals make sense for both sides    the larger companies are able to boost their pipelines with promising candidates while the smaller ones gain access to a non dilutive source of funds that allows them to continue investing in those pipelines 
Some companies that often find themselves on the acquisition radar include names like Exelixis  Incyte and TESARO  among others 
Divesting Non Core Business Segments and Restructuring
Another trend being witnessed is the divestment of non core business segments  Companies like UCB  Novartis  Teva  TEVA   Sanofi  PA SASY   Valeant  Glaxo and AstraZeneca have all been a part of this trend  Pfizer  NYSE PFE   PFE   which has already divested several of its business segments  is currently looking at strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business  The monetization of non core assets allows these companies to focus on their key areas of expertise and to utilize the sale proceeds for returning value to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends  Smaller companies have also been monetizing assets to raise money for pipeline development 
Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large companies look to cut costs and streamline operations  Most of these companies are re evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs with an unfavorable risk benefit profile 
New Products Should Pick Up Pace
Highly awaited new products launched over the last couple of years should contribute significantly to revenues  Key new products include Ibrance  cancer   Cosentyx  psoriasis   PCSK9 inhibitors   Repatha and Praluent  Cotellic  advanced melanoma   Lartruvo  soft tissue carcinoma   Exondys 51  Duchenne muscular dystrophy   Tecentriq  urothelial cancer  and Taltz  moderate to severe plaque psoriasis   among others  The FDA also expanded the label of cancer drugs like Kyprolis  Imbruvica and Xalkori 
Competitive Threat from Biosimilars on the Rise
With the FDA approving the first biosimilar in the United States  Zarxio  a biosimilar version of Amgen s blockbuster drug  Neupogen   the floodgates have opened  While biosimilars have been available in the EU for quite a while  there was no regulatory pathway for biosimilars in the United States  The second biosimilar to gain approval in the United States was Pfizer and Celltrion s Inflectra  infliximab dyyb  with the reference product being Remicade 
This was followed by the FDA approval of biotech giant Amgen s  AMGN  Amjevita  adalimumab atto   Amjevita is approved for use in all eligible indications of the reference product  AbbVie s Humira  adalimumab   which is used for a wide range of inflammatory diseases 
And then there is Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim s Basaglar  which while technically not approved as a biosimilar  is a  follow on  insulin glargine product approved through an abbreviated approval pathway  Basaglar was found to be sufficiently similar to Sanofi s Lantus to scientifically justify reliance  and to establish its safety and efficacy for the approved uses 
Biosimilars should cut healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments  According to information provided by Express Scripts  about  250 billion could be saved in the next decade  2014   2024  if biosimilars for 11 products including Neupogen  Avastin  Epogen  Humira  Neulasta  Remicade and Rituxan are approved  According to the company  Neupogen and Remicade biosimilars alone represent potential savings of more than  22 billion 
Apart from Amgen  Novartis and Pfizer  companies like Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  and Allergan  NYSE AGN  are targeting the highly lucrative biosimilars market  While all these companies are Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  you can see  
What to Expect from the Sector in Q3 Earnings Season 
A look at consensus earnings expectations for the Medical sector from the Zacks  report for the third quarter earnings season shows that earnings will grow 0 8  from the year ago period on revenue growth of 4 7   This compares to Q2 earnings growth of 7  and revenue growth of 4 4   The Medical sector is one of the few Zacks sectors that have consistently recorded growth over the last few quarters 
While new products should start contributing significantly and increased pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should increase confidence in the sector  challenges remain in the form of currency headwinds  additional competition  pricing pressure  slowdown in growth of mature products and loss of exclusivity for certain key drugs 
Zacks Industry Rank
Within the Zacks Industry classification  pharma and biotech are broadly grouped into the Medical sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  and further sub divided into four industries at the expanded level  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals  Biomedical and Genetics  Drugs and Generic Drugs 
We put our 265 industries into two groups  the top half  i e  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  
Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 
Currently  the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals sector is at the bottom 38  while the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics as well as the Zacks Drug sectors are at the bottom 40   The Zacks Generic Drugs sector  which is facing intense pricing competition  is at the bottom 27   Overall  factors like pricing pressure and slowdown in sales of legacy products are weighing on these stocks

105640,327155,AGN,Allergan  AGN  Loses Restasis Patent Lawsuit  Shares Fall,opinion,"Allergan plc   NYSE AGN   announced that a Texas federal district court invalidated four of the six patents covering Restasis  Allergan s second bestselling drug  This potentially opens the doors for early generic competition  Shares of the company fell almost 3 5  in response on Monday 
The company is disappointed with the court s ruling and is planning to appeal against it  However  if this ruling is upheld even after the appeal  it will negatively impact Restasis sales  The invalidated patents   111   048   930 and  191   which are listed in the Orange Book were set to expire in Aug 27  2024 
Restasis is approved for the treatment of chronic dry eye 
Allegan s shares have outperformed the  so far this year  While the company s stock fell 5 6   the industry was down 23 5  in that period 

In 2015  Allergan had filed patent infringement lawsuits against a group of generic drug manufacturers which include Teva Pharma   NYSE TEVA   and Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   among others  The companies are seeking approval for generic versions of Restasis in the United States  Meanwhile  last week  Allergan settled with InnoPharma  granting the latter the right to market generic Restasis beginning Feb 24  2024 
Moreover  in a bid to dismiss inter partes review for Restasis  Allergan signed an agreement last month with Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe  to gain sovereign immunity  However  court litigation is out of the purview of sovereign immunity  This unconventional move by the company has been questioned by many lawmakers and was criticized by generic manufacturers  Such deals to gain sovereign immunity will make the launch of generics a lengthy and complex legal process  curbing competition 
Restasis generated  676 4 million in sales worldwide in the first the six months of 2017  The FDA s approval to Shire PLC s   NASDAQ SHPG   Xiidra last year has already increased competition for the drug  Any earlier than expected generic entry following the invalidation of these patents will further increase competition Allergan PLC  Price and Consensus

105643,327158,AGN,Pfizer  Allergan say combined drug pipeline  underappreciated ,news,"By Ransdell Pierson NEW YORK  Reuters    The research chiefs of betrothed drugmakers  Pfizer  Inc  N PFE  and Allergan  N AGN  say the proposed combination of their experimental drugs deserves more credit  including potential blockbuster treatments for schizophrenia and depression  Pfizer agreed in November to buy Botox maker Allergan for  160 billion in a transaction meant to slash Pfizer s tax rate and achieve other cost savings  The tax inversion deal would shift Pfizer s headquarters to Dublin and is slated to close in the second half of 2016  Industry regulators and U S  lawmakers have criticized the deal for its reliance on financial engineering  But more recently  company executives have said medical benefits of bringing together their drugs in development have been  underappreciated  and some healthcare analysts are making the case that combining the two research programs will yield sales and earnings ahead of Wall Street expectations   There has been a lot of attention on financial aspects of the deal  but there has been an underestimation of the Allergan pipeline   Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten told Reuters in a recent interview  Dolsten told Reuters that Allergan s depression treatment rapastinel  which has shown promise of treating symptoms within hours rather than weeks required for standard treatments  could be  transformational  if it succeeds in late stage trials  Further studies of Vraylar  a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder approved in September  could show it has  unique  ability to treat negative symptoms of schizophrenia  such as social withdrawal and slowed movement  Dolsten said   Relamorelin  potentially the first new treatment in decades for delayed emptying of food from the stomach  is another big opportunity  he said  Allergan has predicted peak annual sales of up to  2 billion for rapastinel and up to  1 billion each for Vraylar  relamorelin  an experimental treatment for uterine fibroids called Esmya and Allergan s recently approved Viberzi treatment for irritable bowel syndrome   It expects potential annual sales of up to  2 billion each for experimental treatments for migraine headaches and for a leading cause of blindness called macular degeneration   The forecasts have largely fallen on deaf ears  said  Credit Suisse   VX CSGN  analyst Vamil Divan    Right now there are almost no expectations for Allergan s pipeline   Divan said   Even if they get just a few billion dollars out of these products  that would be more than people give them credit for   Pfizer expects a modest lift to its earnings in 2018 from the planned purchase of Allergan  a boost of 10 percent in 2019 and a high teens percentage boost in 2020  Divan said he expects Allergan s pipeline to add a few extra percentage points of sales and earnings growth in all three of those time periods   We have 70 products in mid  to late stage trials  but I think our pipeline is under recognized   David Nicholson  research head for Allergan s branded products  said in an interview  He attributed the lack of visibility to the rapid series of acquisitions and deals that created the present day Allergan  folding in the portfolios of large drugmakers such as Forest Laboratories and  Actavis     It takes time for people to realize these are all part of one company s pipeline   said Nicholson  Nomura analyst Shibani Malhotra said less than 20 percent of Allergan sales are from outside the United States  and that Botox and other Allergan products could eventually get a surprisingly strong boost from 70 new international markets that Pfizer will open up  including Japan   The biggest advantage for Allergan would be in leveraging Pfizer s global sales forces   Malhotra said  Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read is slated to lead the combined company  with Allergan s younger Chief Executive Brent Saunders serving as president and chief operating officer  Nicholson  in a presentation on Tuesday with Read  Saunders and Dolsten at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco  said Allergan s pipeline deserves far more credit  as does Pfizer s array of immuno oncology drugs

105645,327160,AGN,Johnson Controls to buy Ireland based Tyco for  16 5 billion,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Bernie Woodall  Reuters     Johnson Controls  Inc  N JCI   a U S  maker of car batteries and heating and ventilation equipment  agreed to acquire Ireland based peer Tyco International Plc  N TYC  in a  16 5 billion deal that will lower its tax bill  the companies said on Monday   By moving its headquarters to Cork  Ireland  Johnson Controls would become the latest major U S  company to carry out a so called tax inversion after drug giant  Pfizer  Inc  N PFE  structured such a deal with Irish peer Allergan Plc  N AGN  last November  While the tax benefits are not as profound as is the case of Pfizer s deal with Allergan  the news was enough to stir controversy among politicians in a U S  presidential election year   I have a detailed and targeted plan to immediately put a stop to inversions and invest in the U S   block deals like Johnson Controls and Tyco  and place an  exit tax  on corporations that leave the country to lower their tax bill   Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said in a statement  Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders  Clinton s opponent for the Democratic Presidential nomination  also criticized the deal  calling it a disaster for American taxpayers  Others saw it as an opportunity to also highlight what they argue are the weaknesses of the U S  tax system   Absent comprehensive tax reform that includes shifting to a territorial tax system with base erosion protections  Congress ought to examine viable bipartisan solutions that will effectively target and combat inversions and not tip the balance to tax driven foreign acquisitions of U S  firms   said U S  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch  a prominent Republican  The merger will combine Johnson Controls  commercial buildings business with Tyco s fire security offerings  accelerating Johnson Controls  transformation following its decision to spin off its automotive parts unit   Milwaukee based Johnson Controls has a market value  22 5 billion  while Cork  Ireland based Tyco  which specializes in fire protection systems is valued at  14 2 billion  The deal will create savings of at least  500 million in the first three years  the companies said  They expect to save an additional  150 million a year through tax synergies   The move would be consistent with Johnson Control s strategy of transforming from an auto supplier into a multi industry leader   UBS analyst Colin Langan said in a client note  Johnson Controls  shares ended trading in New York on Monday down 3 9 percent at  34 21  while Tyco s shares ended up 11 6 percent at  34 15  Tyco was ahead of many big U S  industrial companies in seeking tax relief by moving its legal residence offshore  The company moved its headquarters to Bermuda from Exeter  New Hampshire in 2007  then to Switzerland in 2009  and to Cork in 2014  Tyco said in 2014 that its move to Cork was tax neutral and that it occurred because of Swiss laws capping executive pay and tighter immigration rules  TREASURY THRESHOLD Johnson Controls  shareholders will own about 56 percent of the combined company  with Tyco shareholders owning the remainder  thanks in part to a cash consideration of about  3 9 billion that Johnson Controls shareholders will receive  Keeping Johnson Controls  shareholders ownership of the combined company below 60 percent was important for the company because the latest U S  Treasury rules  in a bid to limit inversions  placed some restrictions on deals that cross this threshold   The cash consideration is supplied by Tyco very much with the tax inversion in mind  This way you can engage unrestricted in strategies that free up your undistributed foreign earnings   said Robert Willens  a corporate tax and accounting consultant  The new company  Johnson Controls Plc  will be initially headed by Johnson Controls Chief Executive Alex Molinaroli and will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange  After 18 months  Tyco s George Oliver will become CEO and Molinaroli will become executive chair for one year  after which Oliver will become chairman and CEO  Johnson Controls has been preparing to spin off its automotive seating and interiors business and said on Monday the spinoff was on track for early first fiscal quarter of 2017  Shares of Johnson Controls have lost more than a quarter of their value since the start of 2015  while Tyco s shares have fallen over 30 percent  Tyco was broken up into three companies after turnaround expert Edward Breen took the helm from former CEO Dennis Kozlowski  who was convicted in 2005 of grand larceny  securities fraud and other charges  Under Breen  Tyco spun off its electronics and healthcare businesses in 2007  He expanded Tyco s security business with the  1 9 billion acquisition of Broadview Security in 2010  In 2012  Tyco was again broken up into three pieces   one selling valves and controls for the energy market that merged with  Pentair  Inc  N PNR   while its commercial fire and security businesses combined into  New Tyco  and traded under Tyco s symbol  The third piece consisted of the ADT North American residential security business  now  ADT Corp   N ADT   Breen is CEO of U S  chemical giant DuPont  N DD   which last month agreed to combine with Dow Chemical  N DD  in a  120 billion merger  Tax savings were seen as a primary driver of that deal

105677,327192,AGN,Teva Shares Plummet After Mylan s Copaxone Generic Gets FDA Approval,opinion,"Shares of Teva Pharmaceuticals   NYSE TEVA   opened more than 13  lower on Wednesday  plunging close to their 52 week low in the process  The struggling Israeli pharma firm  which has faced significant pressure to reduce its debt load  is sliding once again this time because of a brand new competitor 
Indeed  the big news rocking the pharmaceutical world today is that Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   another major drugmaker wrapped up in its own chaos over the past year or so has received FDA approval to sell a generic version of Teva s multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone 
Mylan said that it wants to quickly introduce a slew of new generics to the market in an effort to curb rising drug costs  Today s approval will certainly help the company s top line  but it will also be the first step in this new plan which should contribute to Mylan s ongoing efforts to regain public trust after being embroiled in its EpiPen price hike scandal 
Shares of Mylan opened about 15  higher and touched a nearly two month high of  38 14  Teva  on the other hand  plummeted to  16 33 per share and is now down more than 54  on the year 
Mylan had missed out on approval of a Copaxone generic twice this year  and company management was recently forced to lower its earnings forecast due to a delay in launching key drugs  In a note this morning  Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  analysts said the new generic should add 13 cents per share to Mylan s quarterly earnings  so long as the FDA grants the company a 180 day exclusivity period 
For Teva  this new competition could have serious consequences  as Copaxone generated more than  1 billion in sales in the second quarter alone 
 The ongoing challenges to its generics business and that with FDA approval of Mylan s generic of Copaxone  earnings cash flow are likely to affected   Jefferies analyst David Steinberg wrote in a note    Although Copaxone  has been a strong contributor to cash flow over the last two decades  growing generic competition to this franchise has been an overhang on TEVA shares in recent years  
Fresh generic competition from Mylan only adds to Teva s growing list of problems  Over the past few months  the Israeli firm has been desperately scrambling to ramp up assets in an effort to preserve its credit rating and cut its mounting debt 
After completing its deal to buy Allergan s   NYSE AGN   generics division last year  Teva s debt pile swelled to a whopping  35 billion  In August  on the same day that the company reported lackluster Q2 earnings  slashed its full year outlook  and cut its dividend by 75   Teva CEO Yitzhak Peterburg said that asset sales will likely generate at least  2 billion  well above that  1 billion level that was previously forecasted 
For now  Teva remains a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   However  the company will need to improve performance in its own generics unit and pare down its debt quickly if it wants to lift share prices anytime soon

105678,327193,AGN,Pharma Stock Roundup  Mylan Up  Teva Down On Copaxone News  Lawmakers Question Allergan Deal ,opinion,"This week  companies like Allergan   NYSE AGN    Teva   NYSE TEVA   and Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   were in the limelight  While Mylan and Teva were in the news related to the FDA approval of Mylan s generic versions of Teva s top selling branded drug  Copaxone  Allergan is under fire for its agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe for Restasis Recap of the Week s Most Important StoriesAllergan s Restasis Deal under Fire  Allergan s deal with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe  announced early in September  has come under fire with lawmakers questioning the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect its blockbuster eye drug  Restasis  from generic competition  Under the terms of the deal  Allergan transferred six patents related to Restasis to the Tribe while being granted exclusive licenses to the patents  In return  Allergan will pay  13 75 million upon execution of the agreement as well as annual royalties of  15 million Restasis is Allergan s second best selling drug bringing in sales of almost  1 5 billion in 2016  While one of the original patents on the drug s active ingredient was set to expire in 2014  Allergan filed additional patents extending protection to 2024 Lawmakers pointed out that the sovereign status of Native American tribes would make any patent challenges lengthy and complex as tribes may be immune from the legal claims made by generic drug makers to challenge patents  In fact  the Tribe is filing to dismiss the ongoing inter partes review   IPR   of the Restasis patents based on their sovereign immunity from IPR challenges The deal has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper copy cat versions of expensive drugs Allergan has been asked by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to provide certain documents and information about the deal by Oct 17  2017 Mylan s Gain  Teva s Loss  In a major development  Mylan gained FDA approval for its generic version of Teva s top selling branded drug  Copaxone  for multiple sclerosis  Mylan gained approval for the 40 mg  thrice weekly  dosage as well as the once daily 20 mg formulation  With Mylan being among the first applicants to challenge the 40 mg patent  the company could  therefore  enjoy 180 days of exclusivity though a formal communication from the FDA regarding the same is yet to come  Mylan has launched both products  According to QuintilesIMS  brand sales for the 20 mg and 40 mg doses were approximately  700 million and  3 64 billion  respectively  for the 12 months ending Jul 31  2017  Mylan also gained approval for the 40 mg dose in the EU While the FDA approval of generic Copaxone is a big boost for Mylan  it is a major blow for Teva which is currently facing a whole lot of challenges  Teva issued a statement saying that the launch of the 40 mg formulation before the final resolution of pending patent infringement lawsuits with Mylan will be treated as an  at risk  launch which means Mylan would have to pay significant damages if the court upholds the patents protecting the drug The entry of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation  Sandoz and Momenta have been on the market for quite a while with Glatopa  a generic version of the 20 mg dose  is expected to cut Teva s 4Q earnings by at least 25 cents per share  Additional details should be

105684,327199,AGN,Pfizer to buy Allergan in  160 billion deal,news,"By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot NEW YORK  Reuters     Pfizer  Inc  N PFE  on Monday said it would buy Botox maker Allergan  N AGN pa  Plc in a deal worth  160 billion to slash its U S  tax bill  rekindling a fierce political debate over the financial maneuver  The acquisition  which would shift Pfizer s headquarters to Ireland  would be the biggest ever tax inversion  The news prompted Democratic presidential front runner Hillary Clinton to promise to propose measures to prevent the increasingly popular and controversial practice aimed at helping U S  companies lower their taxes by re incorporating overseas   Shares of Allergan and Pfizer fell more than 2 percent as investors learned the merger  which would create the world s largest drugmaker  would bring lower cost savings than they had hoped  It also would delay a decision by Pfizer on whether it would sell off its division consisting of products facing generic competition   U S  President Barack Obama has called inversions unpatriotic and has tried to crack down on the practice   Senator Bernie Sanders  another Democratic candidate for president  called on the Obama administration to stop the deal  which  would allow another major American corporation to hide its profits overseas    Congress also must pass real tax reform that demands that profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes   Sanders said   To avoid potential restrictions  the transaction was structured as smaller  Dublin based Allergan buying Pfizer  although the combined company will be known as Pfizer Plc and continue to be led by Chief Executive Officer Ian Read  The U S  Treasury  concerned about losing billions in tax revenue  has been taking steps to limit the benefits of tax inversion deals  but it admitted last week that it would take legislation from Congress to stop such moves  The Allergan acquisition will delay New York based Pfizer s decision on whether to sell off its lower margin unit by two years  until late 2018  the company said  The deal enhances offerings from both Pfizer s faster growing branded products business  with additions like Botox  and its older established products unit  Still  investors had been hoping Pfizer would sell off the lower margin business in 2017  a move now put off by the time required to integrate Allergan    The only thing I d really say I m disappointed about is Pfizer s postponing their break up   said Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas  He called the delay decision  pretty conservative and a little late    Others were disappointed by other aspects of the deal  including the projected cost savings  and a lack of details on potentially increased share buybacks   Synergies of  2 billion plus in the third year are less than the  4 billion we had estimated in year 1   said Cowen and Co analyst Steve Scala  On a conference call with analysts  Pfizer said the merger would give it enhanced access to its tens of billions of dollars parked overseas and allow for more share buybacks  dividend payments and business development  The combined company would have annual sales of about  64 billion  It was not immediately clear how many jobs would be lost as a result of the deal  which is expected to close in the second half of 2016  TAX SAVINGS Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will become president and chief operating officer of the combined company  with oversight of all commercial businesses   Read  who has long sought to slash Pfizer s U S  tax rate  said the deal would help put the company on  on a more competitive footing  with overseas based rivals   The company had estimated it would pay about 25 percent in corporate taxes this year  compared with about 15 percent for Allergan  Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D Amelio said he expected a combined tax rate of 17 percent to 18 percent by 2017  The deal comes some 18 months after the failure of Read s initial attempt at an inversion  a  118 billion bid to acquire Britain based AstraZeneca Plc that ran into stiff opposition from that company s management and UK politicians  Saunders said the combination would provide access to about 70 additional worldwide markets for Allergan products  such as Botox wrinkle treatment  Alzheimer s drug Namenda and dry eye medication Restasis  For 166 year old Pfizer  Allergan would be the fourth huge acquisition over the last 15 years   one for each of the last 4 CEOs   following purchases of Warner Lambert  Pharmacia and Wyeth  This also caps a record year for healthcare mergers and acquisitions  taking their cumulative value in 2015 to more than  600 billion    They include prior big deals involving Saunders  such as the  70 5 billion acquisition of Allergan by  Actavis   N AGN   which then took the Allergan name  and an agreement to sell that company s huge portfolio of generic drugs to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  N TEVA  for  40 5 billion  Allergan and Pfizer estimated their merger would increase earnings per share by 10 percent  excluding special items  in 2019 and add by a high teens percentage rate in 2020   The deal values Allergan shares at  363 63 each  about 16 percent more than their closing price of  312 46 on Friday  Pfizer shareholders would control of 56 percent of the combined company  The record breaking deal includes  8 billion in debt  Pfizer said  Allergan shareholders would receive 11 3 shares in the combined entity for each of their shares  Pfizer stockholders can get cash or one share of the combined company for each of their shares  but the aggregate amount of cash must range from  6 billion to  12 billion  Plans call for four current directors of Allergan  including Saunders and Executive Chairman Paul Bisaro  to join Pfizer s 11 member board  the companies said  Reports that the companies were in talks emerged a month ago  Pfizer was advised by Guggenheim Securities  Goldman Sachs

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock s next earnings release  or is it due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers 
Allergan Beats Q2 Earnings   Sales TopAllergan s second quarter 2017 earnings came in at  4 02 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 95 by 1 8   Earnings rose 20  year over year driven by higher revenues  lower share count and interest expense  which offset lower gross margins and higher tax rates Revenues came in at  4 01 billion  up 8 8  from the year ago period  and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 95 billion by 1 4  While key products like Botox and new products like Vraylar  Namzaric and Viberzi did well in the quarter  sales were once again hurt by sales erosion from Namenda XR and loss of exclusivity  mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin  Also  lower sales of Restasis and Aczone hurt the top line Second quarter revenues  however  gained from the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell  Jan 2017  and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ  Apr 2017  acquisitions Segment DiscussionAllergan reports revenues under three segments   U S  General Medicine  U S  Specialized Therapeutics and International U S  Specialized Therapeutics  net revenues increased 15 2  to  1 72 billion driven by strong growth in Botox and the addition of LifeCell s Alloderm and ZELTIQ s CoolSculpting businesses  Botox  cosmetic  raked in sales of  210 3 million  up 10 7    Botox Therapeutic revenues were  346 9 million  up 17 2   In addition  Juv derm Collection of fillers rose 7 3  and Ozurdex sales increased 15 8   which contributed to the upside  Alloderm added  84 6 million while CoolSculpting added  78 9 million to sales in the second quarter Importantly  Restasis sales declined 9 4  to  336 4 million in the quarter due to unfavorable trade buying patterns  The company expects stable Restasis revenues this year U S  General Medicine net revenue declined 1 5  to  1 43 billion in the reported quarter with sales declining in the Diversified Brands  Women s Health  and the Gastrointestinal franchises  Anti Infectives sales rose 7 4  to  67 8 million while Central Nervous System sales rose 9 2  to  346 6 million Established products like Linzess and Lo Loestrin as well as new products like Viberzi  Namzaric and Vraylar did well in the quarter  Linzess  sales rose 11 5  in the quarter to  167 8 million  driven by strong demand and continued OTC conversion   Lo Loestrin sales rose 11 9  to  113 0 million backed by strong prescription growth However  lower Namenda XR sales hurt the performance of the CNS franchise  Namenda XR sales declined 28 7  to  118 7 million in the quarter due to lower demand  lower pricing and shift of promotional efforts to Namzaric  The company does not expect a generic version of Namenda XR to be launched until first quarter of 2018  delayed from the prior expectation of fourth quarter of 2017  Also  Allergan does not expect any generic version of Estrace Cream to be launched this year Namzaric  a once daily  fixed dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept  recorded sales of  33 4 million compared with  23 6 million in the previous quarter  Continued conversion from Namenda XR and higher demand following an expanded label with new dosages pulled up sales of Namzaric Asacol Delzicol sales declined 61 9  to  45 6 million due to a generic competition for Ascaol HD  following the launch of an authorized generic in Aug 2016 as well as lower demand for Delzicol In the Women s Health segment  Minastrin 24 revenues declined 86 3  to  11 4 million in the quarter due to loss of exclusivity in Mar 2017 The International segment recorded net revenue of  858 8 million  up 16 2   excluding currency impact  from the year ago period  driven by growth in Facial Aesthetics  Botox Therapeutic and the addition of LifeCell and CoolSculpting Profits DeclineAdjusted operating income increased 16  to  1 9 billion in the second quarter  Adjusted operating margins  however  declined 330 basis points in the quarter to 47 1  quarter due to higher operating expenses and the addition of lower margin LifeCell and ZELTIQ acquisitions Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses rose 17 1  to  1 22 billion in the quarter  primarily due to higher foreign exchange transactional losses  costs related to acquisitions and promotional expenses for key products  R D expenses increased 14 2  to  393 9 million to support an advancing pipeline 2017 OutlookThe company raised its previously issued earnings and sales guidance for 2017 following a strong first half performance and solid outlook for the rest of the year Allergan expects total revenue in the range of  15 85 billion to  16 05 billion compared with  15 8 billion to  16 0 billion previously  Currency headwinds are now not expected to hurt revenues versus a negative impact of approximately  100 million

expected to be at similar levels to the second quarter Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of  16 05  16 45 compared with  15 85  16 35 previously  Adjusted earnings guidance continues to reflect strong double digit growth in the range of 17  to 22  Adjusted gross margin is expected between 86 5  and 87  slightly more than 86  and 87  expected previously due to higher than expected gross margins in the first half  Second half gross margins are expected to be lower than the first half R D expenses are expected to be approximately  1 6 billion  maintained   SG A spend is expected between  4 5 billion to  4 6 billion compared with  4 45 billion and  4 55 billion previously  Meanwhile  SG A and R D expenses are expected to be higher in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter  Higher promotional activities given the timing of new launches and continued strong promotion for key brands is expected to lead to higher sales and marketing costs in the third quarter

105709,327224,AGN,Biosimilar 2017 Progress Report  Stocks In Focus,opinion,"The biosimilar space remains in the spotlight as a number of regulatory decisions are pending  While generic drugs are follow on versions of chemically synthesized molecules  biosimilars contain a version of the active substance of an already approved original biological drug 
Development of biosimilars is technically challenging than the development of generic drugs as the former requires clinical studies in patients and are engineered to match the reference drug in quality  safety and efficacy  Due to the complex nature of the product  the development and the regulatory pathway of biosimilars differ significantly from that of generics 
A biosimilar is usually less expensive than the branded drug  Thus the market for the same remains highly lucrative  With the acceleration in approvals of biosimilars  the market has thus attracted a lot of players which is witnessing rapid growth  Here are a few latest developments from this space 
Leading the biosimilar space is Novartis AG s   NYSE NVS   generic arm Sandoz  which is a strong player in the biosimilar market with five marketed biosimilars  Omnitrope  a human growth hormone  Binocrit  an erythropoiesis stimulating agent used to treat anemia  and filgrastim for neutropenia under the brand names Zarzio outside the United States and Zarxio in the United States   
The company plans to launch five major oncology and immunology biosimilars between 2017 and 2020  This includes a biosimilar version of Rituxan  rituximab   which was approved by the European Commission in June 2017  marketed as Rixathon  
Recently  the FDA accepted its Biologics License Application  BLA  for a proposed biosimilar version of Rituxan  In August 2016  Sandoz s Erelzi  a biosimilar version of Amgen  Inc  s   NASDAQ AMGN   blockbuster drug Enbrel gained approval in the United States for five indications  Erelzi was also approved by the European Commission in 2017 
In May 2017  the European Medicines Agency also accepted the company s Marketing Authorization Applications for biosimilar versions of Humira  adalimumab  and Remicade  infliximab  for review  Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   
You can see  
Generic leader Mylan NV   NASDAQ MYL   is also exploring the world of biosimilars  a market that has the potential to grow to  20 billion in 2020  The FDA recently notified Mylan and partner Biocon that the target action date for a biosimilar version of Herceptin  trastuzumab  has been extended to Dec 3  2017 
A decision from the FDA was expected by Sep 3 but the FDA extended the review period due to review of some of the clarificatory information submitted to the agency as part of the application review process  We note that the Biocon partnership includes six biosimilar programs such as biosimilar versions of Herceptin  Neulasta  Humira  Avastin  Enbrel and Neupogen and three insulin analogs  Lantus  Humalog and NovoLog  
Mylan has a collaboration agreement with Momenta Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ MNTA   to develop  manufacture and commercialize up to six of Momenta s current biosimilar candidates  including Momenta s biosimilar candidate  Orencia  abatacept   Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Meanwhile  Amgen and Allergan plc    NYSE AGN   have also submitted a BLA to the FDA for ABP 980  a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin in Jul 2017  We note that both the companies are collaborating on four oncology biosimilars  including ABP 980 which is the second to be submitted for FDA approval 
Both companies have also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for the candidate earlier in 2017  We note that Amgen has a total of 10 biosimilars in its pipeline  one of which has been approved by the FDA  
In March 2017  the European Commission granted marketing authorization to Amgevita  a biosimilar version of Humira in all available indications  The companies have an important event lined up as the FDA is expected to give a decision on the approval of ABP 215  a biosimilar version of Avastin shortly  Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Last month  biotech major Biogen  Inc    NASDAQ BIIB   announced that the European Commission granted a marketing authorization for Imraldi  a biosimilar version of Humira  This is the third anti TNF biosimilar from Biogen to receive a marketing authorization in the European Union following the approval of Benepali  a biosimilar of Enbrel and Flixabi  infliximab   a biosimilar version of Remicade  Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
In July 2017  Merck   Co   Inc    NYSE MRK   launched Reneflexis  a biosimilar version of Remicade in the United States which was approved by the FDA in April  The FDA also granted tentative approval for Lusduna Nexvue  the biosimilar version of Lantus  basal insulin in a pre filled dosing device  Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Medical Sector 5YR   Return

105711,327226,AGN,Should Value Investors Consider Allergan Plc  AGN  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Allergan plc   NYSE AGN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Allergan has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 3  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Allergan s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 18 3  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Allergan has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 8  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Allergan s stock in the near term too P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Allergan s P CF ratio of 3 9 is significantly lower than the industry average of 14 8  which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Allergan currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AGN a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Allergan is just 1 1  a level that is considerably lower than the industry average of 1 8  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  AGN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Allergan might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A  This gives JWN a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days and six lower  while the full year estimate has seen eleven upward and one downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped about 0 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Allergan PLC  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAllergan is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 6  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick 4 Promising Stock Picks to Keep an Eye On With news stories about computer hacking and identity theft becoming increasingly commonplace  the cybersecurity industry looks like a

105714,327229,AGN,Allergan CEO Saunders warms up to drug discovery ,news,"By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot NEW YORK  Reuters    Brenton Saunders  the whiz kid pharmaceutical executive with a reputation for being wary of the costs of early stage drug development  says he s open to new ideas from outside and is now warming up to investing in drug discovery if it makes sense for his company  That could ease concern that if Allergan  N AGN pa  Inc s  N AGN   friendly  talks with  Pfizer  Inc  N PFE  end in a merger  the combined company may not remain one of the world s largest inventors of new medicines   I practice a very open minded management structure and learn new things all the time that change my opinion   Saunders  45  said in a phone interview with Reuters from an Allergan discovery lab   For instance  when  Actavis  and Allergan merged  we didn t have any discovery capabilities  but we assessed Allergan s discovery capabilities in ophthalmology and aesthetic medicine and recognize they added a lot of value  Not only have we kept them  we ve invested in them   While sources close to the ongoing negotiations stress that no decision on Saunders  role has been taken yet  the possibility of Pfizer being led or influenced by an executive who has not overseen the full development  from discovery to approval  of a single drug raises concerns among many industry insiders  Pfizer refused to comment on Saunders  role in any potential deal with Allergan  Pfizer board member Dennis Ausiello  chief of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston  said in

2022 and plans to have 10 new immuno oncology drugs in clinical testing by next year  Saunders has said that drug discovery is too inherently risky and costly  and called the idea that big pharma players need to do it a  fallacy   He prefers to license or acquire medicines that have already been shepherded through the riskiest stages of their development by other companies  That s in contrast to Ian Read  Pfizer s 62 year old CEO  When Read took over Pfizer in 2010  he declared reigniting a moribund research engine that had produced no important new medicines in a decade as one of his most important tasks  Since then  Read can claim credit for the regulatory approval of 10 new medicines  including breast cancer drug Ibrance  which analysts forecast will eventually generate  5 billion a year  and Trumenba  a meningitis vaccine  both products of Pfizer labs  Some Pfizer insiders don t see Saunders as a good match for the 166 year old company  whose expected revenue of  48 billion this year is about three times as much as Allergan s   Saunders is not going to come to Pfizer and get religion on the need for drug discovery  I would doubt that would happen   John Lamattina  who served as Pfizer s research chief between 2003 and 2007  said in an interview  Saunders declined to discuss any future role he might assume  He said he believed he would in fact be able to fit in with a company that has discovery culture   I believe as an executive of any company  it s your job to invest in things you do better than your competition and reassess things you don t do better   he said in the interview  TOP NOTCH EXPERTISE In his meteoric career  Saunders has lead Bausch   Lomb  Forest Laboratories and Actavis  which took the Allergan name after acquiring the Botox maker this year  all in the past five years  While his faith in drug discovery credentials may be questioned  he is highly regarded among his peers as a CEO with top notch operational expertise  A protege of industry veteran Fred Hassan  who fixed Pharmacia and sold it to Pfizer  Saunders is credited with helping turn around struggling Schering Plough and then leading its integration with Merck   Co  N MRK   When Actavis acquired Forest  Actavis CEO Paul Bisaro replaced himself with Saunders  who had previously sold Bausch   Lomb to Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX  International Inc  TO VRX   In a recent interview  Bisaro called Saunders the best young CEO in the industry   It just didn t make any sense to let him get away   said Bisaro  who remained as executive chairman  To be sure  Saunders has also shown a determination to move away from commoditized offerings  Last July  just four month after Actavis acquired Allergan  Saunders agreed to sell Allergan s generic drugs portfolio to Teva Pharmaceutical  N TEVA  Industries Ltd  TA TEVA  for  40 5 billion  Despite their different backgrounds  Read may see Saunders  skill set as complementary to his  some industry experts said  Raghuram Selvaraju  healthcare analyst with Rodman   Renshaw  said he believes Read would even be willing to cede his title to Saunders and become executive chairman   Ian s main concern is to get lower taxes for Pfizer through an inversion  He would rather be able to say he pulled this tax inversion off  and now I m going to let Brent crack the whip and wield the axe   Selvaraju said  referring to the many job cuts that typically follow large mergers  Saunders said he has known Read for many years  from the time they both sat on the board of PhRMA  the largest U S  trade group for the pharmaceutical industry  He declined to comment further on his relationship with him in light of the ongoing deal talks

Pocan said another reason for re introducing his legislation now was to remind the Treasury that it also could do more to curb tax avoidance schemes   That is what we are kind of waiting for  And we thought putting this out there might help remind them that we re still watching   he said ",2015-11-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/democrat-targets-corporate-tax-avoidance-deals-in-u.s.-congress-370472,370472

To be recognized as a foreign entity under U S  law  one key hurdle is to ensure that the original U S  shareholders own less than 60 percent of the combined company  One way to do that is through  skinny down  share buybacks or other distributions that shrink the size of the U S  company going into the inversion  Treasury likely could tighten that rule  perhaps by extending the time limit on covered transactions  without accompanying legislation from Congress  experts said   I think that s where they ll focus their attention   Willens said ",2015-11-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pfizer-allergan-deal-refocuses-market-on-u.s.-tax-inversion-rules-371262,371262
105718,327233,AGN,How Pfizer has shifted U S  profits overseas for years,news,By Tom Bergin and Kevin Drawbaugh RINGASKIDDY  Ireland  Reuters    Drugmaker Pfizer s  N PFE  plans to take over Allergan  N AGN  have faced a political backlash in the United States over fears a deal would lead to the company shifting its headquarters and taxable profits to Ireland  However a Reuters examination of corporate filings in Europe  patent databases and other information shows the company has for over a decade been shifting profits generated by American scientists and patients overseas   to a subsidiary based in the rolling hills of County Cork    Pfizer  and Allergan are in talks to create the world s biggest drug company by market value and analysts expect a deal would likely involve Pfizer  inverting   or reversing into the smaller  Irish registered Allergan  Ireland s tax rate is 12 5 percent  a fraction of the 35 to 40 percent levied in the United States   President Barack Obama has described inversions as unpatriotic and last year changed some tax rules to make inverting less attractive  Allergan investors fear the U S  treasury department may scupper a deal with additional measures   Yet any such actions would already be too late to stop New York based Pfizer from reporting in Ireland profits tied to its U S  activities  Pfizer has used transactions between companies within its group to allow an Irish subsidiary based in Ringaskiddy   Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals   to buy the rights to patents developed in the United States and then use them to make drugs which are sold back to U S  affiliates   Even though the Irish and other overseas units pay  3 2 billion a year in royalties to use such patent rights  the higher prices at which Pfizer in the United States imports manufactured drugs from affiliates means almost all the profits from these drugs are reported overseas  Drugs which were discovered in the United States  manufactured in Ringaskiddy and sold back to the United States include anti cholesterol treatment Lipitor   the best selling prescription drug of all time   and epilepsy drug Lyrica  which generated revenue of over  5 billion last year for Pfizer  Pfizer s actions are entirely lawful and all companies seek to manage their tax bills down  The drugmaker said the prices it used for its inter subsidiary transactions were fair and that its business structure was motivated primarily by a desire for operational efficiency rather than tax minimization    Pfizer fully complies with all applicable accounting and tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate and pays all taxes due   spokeswoman Joan Campion said   Jerry Buttimer  a member of the Irish parliament in whose constituency Ringaskiddy lies  said there was nothing wrong or unusual in companies seeking to reduce their tax bills   All companies will do what is in the best interest of its operations and shareholders   he said   But Ed Kleinbard  Professor of law at the University of Southern California said the company s arrangements reflected  aggressive tax planning  and it seemed  from the outside  to be almost as capable in tax planning as pharmacology    This is a company that is investing heavily in tax research  as well as pharmaceutical research   he joked   IRISH PROFITS Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals is at the center of the drug company s tax minimizing structure   It is registered at a two story 1970s era office block on the road into Ringaskiddy  a hamlet with two pubs and several factories operated by major drug manufacturers  a reflection of Irish government policy over the decades to create jobs in the area   Pfizer licenses the rights to drugs developed in the United States and in other countries like Britain  to Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals  according to accounts filed by the Dutch and Belgian parents of Pfizer s Irish units   A manufacturing facility on the 200 acre Ringaskiddy site  which is bordered by green fields on one side and Cork Harbour on the other  produces active ingredients for drugs  based on formulas discovered by overseas affiliates   It currently makes the active ingredients for Lipitor  anti impotence drug Viagra  anti lung cancer drug Xalkori and Ibrance  which fights breast cancer  Pfizer also operates other factories across Ireland  and smaller operations in Singapore and Puerto Rico   The compounds pass through a series of Irish companies which  like Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals  have unlimited status meaning they do not have to publish accounts  a requirement of similar sized limited companies in Ireland   Reuters pieced together the Irish subsidiary s activities over the past 11 years from notes in the accounts of affiliates such as UK registered Pfizer Ltd  Belgian registered Pfizer Research and Development Company NV and CP Pharmaceuticals International CV  the tax exempt Dutch partnership through which Pfizer owns its overseas activities  including the Irish operations   It also examined patent and public health databases and spoke to three company executives  Pfizer does have manufacturing plants in the United States but filings for its overseas units show non U S  companies supply over 80 percent of U S  sales   Those sales generate margins of around 40 percent for Pfizer s overseas arm   earning it over  17 billion in 2013  However  Pfizer has reported losses on its U S  business in each of the past five years   Pfizer said it follows the  arm s length  tax principle when conducting inter company sales and purchases  This says companies should transact with affiliates at the same prices unconnected companies would   However  academics say it is very hard to judge whether inter company sales of unique products like patented chemicals  for which there is no independent open market  are conducted at prices that independent companies would agree to use    The current arm s length rules are always difficult to enforce because of the lack of a comparable price  in the drugs industry    said Edmund Outslay  tax accounting professor  Eli Broad College of Business at Michigan State University   U S  COSTS  Many of Pfizer s group costs like research  debt and top management are mostly borne in the United States  despite non U S  operations accounting for over 60 percent of global sales and 50 percent of hard assets like plants and property   For example  Pfizer has  30 40 billion in long term debt but only  12 million of it is borne by the overseas arm  filings for CP Pharmaceuticals International show   The company said the practice of borrowing in the United States reflected lender preferences rather than any attempt to shift profits  It added that it was natural for a U S  company to bear a big share of its overhead costs in the United States   But academics and campaigners are skeptical   Pfizer maximizes the deductions it takes in the U S  and maximizes the income it shifts to low tax jurisdictions   Outslay said   Pfizer denies its allocation of costs is an intentional ploy to cut taxes   While it manages to report most of the profits generated by U S  activity overseas  if it wants to take the overseas profits home  to pay dividends or fund buybacks  it has to pay the difference between the tax paid on the money   around 12 5 percent   and the U S  tax rate   Of  16 billion of U S  income taxes Pfizer has paid since 2009  almost all reflects payments in relation to such remitting of profits from overseas subsidiaries  a Reuters analysis of group filings shows  Even including this tax on remitted earnings  the amount of cash Pfizer pays in overall income taxes as a share of its profits is lower than rivals like Britain s GlaxoSmithKline  L GSK   Denmark s  Novo Nordisk   CO NOVOb  and Paris based Sanofi  PA SASY    To avoid having to pay the tax due when cash is repatriated  Pfizer keeps most of its foreign earnings overseas and  indeed  much of it stays in Ireland   In the capital  an office building near the mouth of the Liffey in Ringsend houses Pfizer s Dublin Treasury Centre  which the company says is responsible for treasury operations outside the United States and for helping manage Pfizer s offshore pile of cash on which no U S  tax has been paid  According to a presentation given by one of its staff last year  this unit overseas a cash mountain approaching  50 billion   But if Pfizer does complete an inversion  the practice of stockpiling foreign profits in Dublin may no longer be necessary  That s because as an Irish headquartered group it would be free to use its cash for dividends without incurring additional U S  tax

 All of us at Teva understand the frustration and disappointment our shareholders are feeling 
In our U S  Generics business  we experienced accelerated price erosion and decreased volume  mainly due to customer consolidation  greater competition as a result of an increase in generic drug approval by the FDA  and some new product launches that were either delayed this quarter or got subjected to more competition  
 we expect to have no contribution from our businesses in Venezuela to earnings in the last two quarters of 2017  

To fix the issues 

  we are focusing on streamlining our businesses to meaningfully reduce our cost base We recently concluded a full review of our specialty R D pipeline with the assistance of an experienced outside adviser in order to rationalize and focus our pipeline assets and maximize return on investment  We are also in the final stages of engaging world class consulting firm to support our U S  Generics business  We like the full potential of these assets in light of the evolving environment 
 our board has authorized a reduction in our cash dividend by 75  to  0 085  This reduction represents approximately  260 million of cash per quarter  

Investors clearly had no patience for any of this news  After three full days of non stop selling and a devastating downgrade from Morgan Stanley going from equal to under weight  TEVA has lost a stomach churning 40 5  since its earnings 

The on going weakness in Teva Pharmaceuticals  TEVA  accelerated into a 40 5  post earnings loss 
The U S  generics business is part of Teva s troubles  A massive  40 5B deal Teva closed with Allergan  NYSE AGN  exactly two years ago sits right in the middle of those troubles  At the time  TEVA traded at an all time high and its ultimate peak 
TEVA is down a stomach churning 74 2  from that point  I note the irony because AGN still trades around the same price it had at the time of the deal s announcement  Moreover  AGN came out of the deal with a 10  ownership in TEVA  Allergan s stock is down slightly in sympathy with TEVA s woes 

Allergan  AGN  is caught up in the TEVA mix with its 10  stake  The stock is facing down a critical test of support at its 50 day moving average  DMA  
In a timely appearance  Allergan CEO and Chairman Brent Saunders appeared  to talk about the business and its recent earnings report  At the beginning of the discussion  Saunders made it clear that selling AGN because of its TEVA stake made no sense  AGN holds 10  of TEVA worth  a couple of billion dollars  while AGN has  several billion dollars in cash  
AGN promised the market from the start of its deal with TEVA that the TEVA holding was not a long term investment  The lock up on the shares expired just a few days ago  but AGN plans to sell its stake in a  responsible way  over the next several quarters  My ears perked up when Saunders claimed that selling TEVA at current prices  doesn t make much sense   That was all I need to hear to sense a potential trading opportunity 
Firstly  after three days of heavy selling  TEVA is due for a large relief bounce  a lot of weak hands likely shook themselves out in this relentless selling  A relief bounce should also be due to the extent investors panicked out the stock to get ahead of AGN s sales  Now we know the AGN overhang is at higher prices  As with most of these rebound trades  I am initially targeting a return to the lower Bollinger Band   BB  which is now around  22 25 
It is possible that generics competitor Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  is also an opportunity  Mylan completes the irony of TEVA s current troubles as TEVA made a last hour switch from pursuing MYL to AGN two years ago  Fast forward to today  and MYL sold off in sympathy with TEVA s woes  Morgan Stanley added a downgrade to MYL for good measure 
While   I still have my eye on  to CEO Heather M  Bresch if she can drive earnings per share to  6 00 by March  2018  MYL is right on the edge with guidance of  5 15 to  5 55 for fiscal year  FY  2017  Second quarter earnings before the market opens on Wednesday  August 9th will have to be good just to fight back the recent selling 
The announcement will have to be downright fantastic to suggest the company might still hit the  6 00 EPS target  MYL must explain that the depths of TEVA s woes are company specific  In other words  MYL could experience a post earnings surge  With MYL Jan 2018  35 call options costing a mere  1 70 or so  I find the risk reward very attractive to start accumulating ahead of earnings  If MYL manages to disappoint post earnings anyway  I will be looking to accumulate shares for holding into March  2018 
Mylan  MYL  has suffered mightily thanks to Teva Pharmaceuticals and Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Can the company redeem itself with this week s earnings news 
Be careful out there

105747,327262,AGN,Teva Plunges To 10 Year Low  Credit Rating In Jeopardy,opinion,"Shares of Teva Pharmaceuticals   NYSE TEVA    a favorite for investors chasing large dividend yields  fell more than 4 4  and hit a 10 year intraday low on Wednesday  Just says after the company reported sluggish Q2 earnings  investors are continuing to ditch the stock amid reports that Teva is desperately trying to sell off assets 
According to sources cited by   Teva is looking to ramp up asset sales in an effort to preserve its credit rating and cut its mounting debt  The report claims that Medis  an Iceland based generic drug manufacturer  is one of the Teva units on the table 
Bloomberg also claimed that Teva is considering the sale of its respiratory treatment assets  although the publication s anonymous sources said that a decision to sell has not been finalized and considerations are still at an early stage 
 Teva is looking at every opportunity to focus our business and streamline operations processes and structure   the company said in a statement   Beyond this update  Teva is not in a position to comment on market speculation  
Teva is under increasing pressure to reduce its debt load  which has swelled to a whopping  35 billion following its acquisition of Allergan s   NYSE AGN   generics division  Any new asset sales would come in addition to the pending offloading of Teva s women s health and European cancer and pain treatment units 
Just last week  on the same day that the company  lackluster Q2 earnings  slashed its full year outlook  and cut its dividend by 75   Teva CEO Yitzhak Peterburg said that asset sales will likely generate at least  2 billion  well above that  1 billion level that was previously forecasted 
Also last week  Moody s said that Teva s debt reduction has been slower than expected and lowered its credit rating  Moody s hasn t been the only analyst firm to question Teva recently  as Morgan Stanley s David Risinger also chimed in this week 
 We believe that Teva s disappointing generic business performance will take more time to improve given a combination of the generic industry s intensifying secular challenges and Teva s own difficulty in executing on its pipeline   Risinger said in a note 
Risinger downgraded Teva to  underweight  and cut its price target to  16  which would represent a further 8 5  slide from Wednesday s close

105750,327265,AGN,Teva Stock Is Getting Destroyed  Is Now The Time To Buy  ,opinion,"Teva Pharma Industries Ltd ADR  NYSE TEVA  has been a darling for investors in the generic drug sector  Even as recently as last year  investors were eager to see the growth of the company and along with it  the stock price  But then second quarter earnings were reported and Teva stock price hit the fan as they say 
Teva stock price has since cratered 45  since earnings were released and there is no sign of the price coming back  So should investors  particularly value investors take a look at Teva 
In this post  we will look at Teva stock and see whether or not there is a value play here or if you are better served putting your investing dollars elsewhere 
Teva Stock Drops After Earnings
Just looking at the raw numbers  the earnings Teva reported don t appear to be terrible  Revenue came in at  5 69 billion  missing by  40 million  But this was an increase of 13   Earnings per share also missed estimates by  0 05  coming in at  1 02 
But a closer look shows the full picture  Net income was down 20   Cash flow was down 23   Then executives pulled the plug  They slashed earnings estimates for the full year and  
So what exactly happened 
The Issues With Teva Stock
There are a handful of issues at play here when it comes to Teva stock  First  management is partly to blame  When Teva bought Actavis Generics from Allergan  NYSE AGN   they touted the added revenue and the cost savings that would come  Unfortunately  they drank too much of their own potion and really had no chance of meeting expectations 
But the issues don t end there  Here are other issues Teva is facing 
Consolidation  many of Teva s customers are consolidating  which is lowering the revenue the company plans to earn in the future 
Competition  there is more competition for generic drugs  This is leading to cost cutting and lowering potential revenue 
Decline in specialty drugs  many of Teva s specialty drugs have experienced a year over year sales decline and there is no sign of sales picking up any time soon 
Slower to market  a handful of the drugs in the pipeline are being delayed which is putting added pressure on the company and Teva stock price 
Increase in debt  the debt burden of Teva has now eclipsed  35 billion  which puts pressure on earnings
Search for CEO  the company is still searching for a permanent CEO  so the company is in a sense meandering along until a new leader takes over 
And then there is the issue with Allergen  When Teva bought Acatvis Generics  part of the deal was in stock  So Allergen became the largest shareholder of Teva stock  At the time of the deal  there was a restriction on when Allergen could sell their shares 
That holding period has now passed  And with Teva stock price down 50  from when Allergen bought it  only one wonders if they want to cut ties now with the troubled generic drug maker 
Is There A Value Play 
The question is  is there any reason for a value investor to invest in Teva  At this point  I can t think of one  The reason being is that there is nothing in the immediate horizon that will cause the stock price to jump 
If anything  the stock price will trade in a small range for some time  Over the long term however  Teva does have some things going for it  They have 5 new drugs on the horizon that can add to the bottom line 
But in the meantime  the company needs to find a permanent CEO and start to work on reducing its debt load  They have started some cost saving initiatives by   but this will only put a dent in the issues with Teva 
I would hold off on investing in Teva for a few months and re evaluate how things are progressing  Keys will be earnings for the third quarter and full year to see if the company is making headway on increasing earnings and revenues 
If it can quickly turn things around  Allergen will likely continue to hold on to its shares hoping to earn some losses back  which would take away the downward pressure and fears that they will sell everything and drive the stock price lower

105755,327270,AGN,Valeant shares plunge on short seller scrutiny of pharmacy ties,news,"By Caroline Humer
NEW YORK  Reuters    Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  TO VRX   N VRX  plunged as much as 30 percent after an influential short seller accused the company of fraud  saying it used its relationship with specialty pharmacies to inflate revenue 
The report by Citron Research  a short selling firm run by Andrew Left  said Wednesday that Valeant s previously undisclosed relationship is a sign of a cover up  Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little was not immediately available for comment 
The Citron Research report hit shares hard shortly after 10 a m  EDT in New York trading  The shares were last trading down  41 62 at  105 12  representing a major loss for billionaire Bill Ackman  who holds a 5 7 percent stake in Valeant 
Shares of some key competitors  including Allergan Inc  N AGN   Endo International Plc  O ENDP  and  Mallinckrodt  Plc  N MNK  also fell sharply 
Citron alleged that Valeant was using specialty pharmacies   include Philidor and R O Pharmacy Inc   to create  phantom sales  of its products or pushing more product through distribution channels than sales would warrant  and to avoid scrutiny from auditors 
 Citron believes the whole thing is a fraud to create invoices to deceive the auditors and book revenue   the note said 
Valeant has been under fire for several weeks over its practice of raising drug prices sharply once it acquires new medications  Last week  it disclosed that it was under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York and Massachusetts 
The government requested information on pricing and on programs that help patients cover their out of pocket expenses for Valeant s drugs  Those drugs are often distributed by specialty pharmacies 
On Monday  during a conference call with investors  Valeant defended its pricing and declined to comment on the federal investigations  saying it was cooperating with authorities 
But the company disclosed new information about its dealing with two pharmacies  which distribute specialty drugs to patients  including that it had purchased an option to acquire Philidor and was already consolidating its results 
Len Yaffe  an investor at StocDoc Partners  who is short on Valeant  said that he is not yet sure of what to make of Citron s claims  He said the notion that Valeant would need to resort to phantom sales to juice revenues heightens existing widespread concerns about the company s ability to produce growth in an increasingly hostile pricing environment 
Valeant s stock took a significant hit in late September in response to criticism from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton about rising drug prices and media reports of its particularly steep price increases 
Independent Canadian equity research firm Veritas said it saw significant unquantifiable risks overhanging Valeant 
Analyst Dimitry Khmelnitsky sees Valeant at risk of losing its  secret sauce  that made it a darling of many investors due to the pullback in its share price  Valeant has traditionally used its highly valued shares to pursue accretive acquisitions and tack on debt 

The selloff on Wednesday knocked off  15 billion in market capitalization from Valeant  which was valued as high as  90 billion in early August  It has since lost more than half of its value ",2015-10-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/valeant-shares-plunge-on-short-seller-scrutiny-of-pharmacy-ties-367296,367296

Allergan said about 3 percent of its U S  sales of branded drugs are distributed through specialty pharmacies  most of which are specialty products that require careful handling  Endo said it uses specialty pharmacies mainly for branded products that need to be administered by doctors  and that drugs distributed through this channel represent about 3 percent of the company s projected total revenue for 2015  It said any specialty pharmacies that it works with are fully independent of the company ",2015-10-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/specialty-pharmacies-in-spotlight-as-valeant-ties-questioned-367418,367418

Consensus Estimate of  3 95 billion by 1  While key products like Botox and new products like Vraylar  Namzaric and Viberzi did well in the quarter  sales were once again hurt by sales erosion from Namenda XR and loss of exclusivity  mainly from Asacol HD and Minastrin  Also  lower sales of key dry eye disease drug  Restasis hurt the top line Second quarter revenues  however  gained from the addition of Alloderm from LifeCell  Jan 2017  and CoolSculpting body contouring system from ZELTIQ  Apr 2017  acquisitions Adjusted operating income increased 16  to  1 9 billion in the quarter Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses rose 17 1  to  1 22 billion in the quarter  primarily due to higher promotional spend to support new product launches  R D expenses increased 14 2

Specialized Therapeutics  net revenues increased 15 2  to  1 72 billion driven by strong growth in Botox and the addition of LifeCell s Alloderm and ZELTIQ s CoolSculpting businesses  Botox  cosmetic

contributed to the upside  Alloderm added  84 6 million while CoolSculpting added  78 9 million to sales in the second quarter Importantly  Restasis sales declined 9 4  to  336 4 million in the quarter due to unfavorable trade buying patterns  We remind investors that Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG   launched its dry eye disease drug  Xiidra last year  There have been investor concerns about Xiidra posing strong competition for Restasis  The company expects stable Restasis revenues this year U S  General Medicine net revenue declined 1 5  to  1 43 billion in the reported quarter with sales declining in the Diversified Brands  Women s Health  and the Gastrointestinal franchises  Anti Infectives sales rose 7 4  to  67 8 million while Central Nervous System sales rose 9 2  to  346 6 million Established products like Linzess and Lo Loestrin as well as new products like Viberzi  Namzaric and Vraylar did well in the quarter  Linzess  sales rose 11 5  in the quarter to  167 8 million  driven by strong demand and continued OTC conversion However  lower Namenda XR sales hurt the performance of the CNS franchise  Namenda XR sales declined 28 7  to  118 7 million in the quarter due to lower demand  lower pricing and shift of promotional efforts to Namzaric  The company does not expect a generic version of Namenda XR to be launched until first quarter of 2018  delayed from the prior expectation of fourth quarter of 2017  Also  Allergan does not expect any generic version of Estrace Cream to be launched this year Namzaric  a once daily  fixed dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept  recorded sales of  33 4 million compared with  23 6 million in the previous quarter Asacol Delzicol sales declined 61 9  to  45 6 million due to a reduction in demand for Ascaol HD  following the launch of an authorized generic in Aug 2016 as well as lower demand for Delzicol In the Women s Health segment  Minastrin 24 revenues declined 86 3  to  11 4 million in the quarter due to loss of exclusivity in Mar 2017 The International segment recorded net revenue of  858 8 million  up 16 2  from the year ago period  driven by growth in Facial Aesthetics  Botox Therapeutic and the addition of LifeCell and CoolSculpting 2017 Outlook UpThe company raised its previously issued earnings and sales guidance for 2017 Allergan expects total revenue in the range of  15 85 billion to  16 05

Pharmaceutical Industries Limited   NYSE TEVA   in Aug and Oct 2016  respectively in order to focus on its branded segment Allergan also boasts a strong branded pipeline with nine product launches planned for 2017  Allergan is extending its R D pipeline to adjacent categories like NASH  Parkinson s disease  and gene therapy with many promising phase II III programs in development We are also

including equity compensation expenses   which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 06 per share by 6 6   The year ago adjusted earnings were  1 22 per share Revenues of  5 69 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 85 billion by 2 8   Sales  however  increased 13  year over year  up 17  excluding impact of currency   mainly due to the inclusion of revenues from Allergan plc s   NYSE AGN   generics segment  Actavis Generics  including AndaTeva acquired Actavis Generics in Aug 2016 and also Allegan s U S  generic distribution business Anda  Inc  in Oct 2016 Excluding the benefit from the Actavis generics acquisition  the core sales performance was below expectations  Sales in the quarter were hurt by increased pricing erosion in the U S  Generics unit  ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela and loss of exclusivity in the Specialty segment in the quarter Segment DiscussionBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2016  Teva revised its segment structure following the Actavis acquisition  The Generics segment now includes revenues from the OTC business as well as the API business Generic Medicines segment revenues rose 20  to  3 08 billion  mainly attributable to the inclusion of revenues from the Actavis generics business Revenues from the U S  generics business rose 45  to  1 3 billion due to the inclusion of revenues from the generic business of Actavis European generic revenues were  957 million  up 24   28  in local currency  from the year ago period  This was due to the inclusion of revenues from the generic business of Actavis Rest of the world  ROW  generic revenues declined 7  to  831 million in the quarter  On a local currency basis  sales rose 13  mainly due to the inclusion of revenues from Actavis API revenues declined 1  to  204 million  OTC revenues rose 6  to  283 million  up 40  in local currency terms  Excluding the benefit from the Actavis generics acquisition  the core sales performance of the segment was poor due to accelerated U S  generic drug price erosion and decreased volumes  Meanwhile  delays in the launch of some new generic drugs and increased competition for some others also hurt sales in the segment The U S  generics industry is facing significant competitive and pricing pressure  An increase in FDA generic drug approvals and ongoing customer consolidation is resulting in additional competitive pressure in the generics industry The drug price erosion is expected to accelerate in the second half of this year  Teva said that the price erosion in the U S  generics business is expected to be in the high single digits range in 2017 Specialty Medicines revenues declined 9  from the year ago period to  2 1 billion due to lower sales of its central nervous system  CNS  and oncology products  Among Teva s various therapeutic areas  CNS sales declined 18  to  1 16 billion due to lower sales of multiple sclerosis drug  Copaxone  Teva s lead branded product Sales of respiratory products rose 3  to  322 million  oncology product sales declined 16  to  280 million  and women s health business recorded a 2  decline in revenues to  115 million  Other specialty revenues rose 107  to  190 million Worldwide revenues of Copaxone declined 10  to  1 billion  Sales in the U S  declined 12  to  843 million due to lower volumes of the 20 mg formulation  which is facing generic competition and negative net pricing effects despite the 7 9  price increase taken in January  In Jun 2015  Novartis AG s   NYSE NVS   generic arm  Sandoz launched Glatopa  a once daily generic version of 20 mg formulation of Copaxone Ex U S  sales of Copaxone declined 3  to  180 million The 40 mg thrice weekly  3TW   three times a week  formulation of Copaxone accounted for more than 85  of total Copaxone scrips in the U S  at the end of the reported quarter  We note that Teva is facing patent challenges for the 40 mg formulation Companies like Mylan N V    NASDAQ MYL   and Momenta Pharmaceuticals are looking to get approval for their generic versions of the 40 mg thrice weekly formulation of Copaxone  In late January  Teva suffered a major setback with the U S  District Court for the District of Delaware invalidating four of the five Orange Book patents protecting Copaxone 40 mg  Teva intends to appeal against the decision  However  generic versions of the 40 mg formulation have not been launched yet  The FDA approval of Momenta s generic version of Copaxone has been delayed owing to manufacturing issues Teva does not expect any generic competition for Copaxone 40 mg this year  However  the company said that in case  a generic version was launched for a full quarter this year  it will hurt earnings by 20   25 cents Among other products  Azilect sales declined 69  to  34 million as a generic version of the drug was launched in the U S  ProAir declined 9  to  123 million  combined Treanda and Bendeka revenues declined 21  to  163 million and QVAR declined 8  to  107 million The Other segment  distribution and other activities  recorded revenues of  543 million  up 158 6   The segment mainly gained from the inclusion of distribution revenues from Anda Profits DeclineAdjusted gross margin contracted 570 basis points  bps  to 56 8  in the quarter due to the addition of the low margin Anda distribution business and low margins in the Generic Medicines segment  Gross margin rose in the Specialty segment  Research   development expenses increased 21 6  from the year ago period to  450 million  Selling and marketing  S M  expenditure was up 1  from the year ago level to  906 million  Adjusted operating margin  excluding equity compensation expense  declined 330 bps in the quarter to 28 1  2017 Outlook SlashedTeva slashed its previously issued 2017 sales and earnings guidance  Increased price erosion in the U S Generics market  delays in generic launches in the U S and greater instability in the Venezuela market led to the cut in guidance The revenue guidance was cut to a range of  22 8  23 2 billion from  23 8  24 5 billion  Earnings are expected in the band of  4 30    4 50  much lower than  4 90  5 30 per share expected previously Teva expects continued sales erosion for Copaxone in 2017 due to increased competition Management said that the Venezuelan business is not expected to contribute anything to earnings in the last two quarters of 2017 Dividend CutTeva announced a 75  cut in dividend for the second quarter to 8 5 cents per share from 34 cents per share paid in the first quarter Our TakeTeva s second quarter earnings and sales were dismal as the U S  generics industry continues to face significant competitive and pricing pressure  The Israel based generic drug maker also slashed its 2017 earnings and sales outlook to reflect the challenging environment in the U S  Generics business and Venezuela devaluation  The U S  generic industry pressure is expected to persist and management expects lower revenue and profits in U S  Generics in 2018 and potentially 2019 The major cut in dividend   to help pay down debt and invest in business   was a big disappointment  Also  the company did not provide any update on a new chief executive officer  CEO  saying  this is a process we are not going to rush    Teva s CEO  Erez Vigodman  had stepped down in February this year  Teva s Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh  also retired in June Shares declined 24  on Thursday  hitting a 52 week low of  23 33 per share  In fact  shares have slumped 34 5  so far this year compared with the  sdecline of 1 9  Teva carries a Zacks

105792,327307,AGN,Teva to buy Allergan generic business for  40 5 billion  drops Mylan bid,news,"By Tova Cohen and Steven Scheer
TEL AVIV  Reuters    Israel s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  ARCA TEVA  will pay  40 5 billion in cash and stock for Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  s generic drugs business  solidifying Teva s position as the world s No  1 maker of generics while freeing Allergan to focus on branded drugs  paying down debt and potential  transformational  acquisitions 
The deal  the largest in Israel s corporate history  allows Teva stronger economies of scale  crucial in the low margin generic drugs business  Teva  which dropped its hostile pursuit of Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   will likely have to sell off some drugs to allay antitrust concerns 
 Allergan s business is more high end  than Mylan   It s a more interesting business     a profitable business and it s well managed   said Gilad Alper  an analyst at brokerage Excellence Nessuah 
Allergan  known for its Botox anti wrinkle treatment  became the third largest generic drugmaker in the United States after combining with  Actavis   NYSE AGN  in March  It is seen as a better fit than Mylan because it will improve Teva s distribution channels and access to profitable injectable drugs 
Pressure has been growing on Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman to find new revenue sources to combat generic competition for its branded multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone  Copaxone accounts for about half of Teva s profit 
Allergan CEO Brent Saunders  who led Actavis  purchase of Forest Laboratories and then Allergan  said the company will use the  36 billion in net proceeds from the generics sale to help fund further large acquisitions 
 We can accelerate our timing on transformational M A   Saunders said during a conference call  He cited aesthetics  eye care  central nervous system disorders and gastrointestinal therapies as areas for potential future deals  Wall Street analysts speculated that possible targets include Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  Inc   Amgen Inc   NASDAQ AMGN  and  AbbVie Inc   NYSE ABBV  
The healthcare sector has seen an unprecedented wave of deals since early 2014  from large drugmakers buying up smaller rivals  to consolidation among makers of generic medicines and tie ups between insurers 
Global healthcare M A reached  398 5 billion as of July 23  up 80 percent on a year ago  according to Thomson Reuters data 
HIGHLY COMPETITIVE
Teva shares  which had been weighed down by the Mylan uncertainty  rose 13 percent in New York trading on Monday  Allergan shares gained 7 2 percent and Mylan shares slid 14 4 percent 
Mylan had used a poison pill style defense to fight a  40 billion takeover by Teva  arguing that a deal was  without sound industrial logic or cultural fit  and would face regulatory hurdles  The company said on Monday it would continue efforts to buy Perrigo  whose shares were up 3 8 percent 
Teva may need to sell a large number of assets to satisfy antitrust authorities about the Allergan transaction  according to two antitrust attorneys who handle pharmaceutical deals 
 But if you look at the total size of the deal  that s going to be a tiny fraction   one of the lawyers said 
It may also be harder to find buyers for those drugs given the consolidation already seen in the generics sector  they said  The U S  Federal Trade Commission requires buyers for proposed divestitures before it will approve a deal 
Teva said it has identified asset sales needed for the deal to pass muster with U S  and UK antitrust regulators  and that the number was less than what had been anticipated in a combination with Mylan 
CULTURAL FIT
Teva said it had approached Allergan a year ago but did not generate interest  It then went after Mylan  which repeatedly rebuffed its offers  and only turned its attention back to Allergan earlier this month  In June 2014  Vigodman hired Sigurdur Olafsson  former head of Actavis s generic drug business  to fill a similar role at Teva 
 My sense always was that Mylan was Teva s Plan B   said Benny Landa  an industrialist who led an investor bid last year to shake up Teva s board  calling the deal  brilliant  
Teva will pay  33 75 billion in cash and  6 75 billion in shares  representing a 10 percent stake in the Israel based company  Teva said  It expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2016 
Vigodman said the combined company will have proforma revenue of  26 billion and earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization of  9 5 billion in 2016 
 This acquisition reinforces our strategy  accelerates growth and diversifies revenues both by product and geographically  supporting our new business model   he said 
Teva  which will gain a portfolio of more than 1 000 products  forecast a double digit boost to adjusted earnings per share in 2016 and a more than 20 percent benefit in years two and three after closing the deal 
It expects cost synergies and tax savings of  1 4 billion annually by the third anniversary from efficiencies in operations  manufacturing  and sales and marketing 
It also expects the acquisition to generate free cash flow of  6 5 billion in 2016 and increased free cash flow in subsequent years  This means Teva will be able to pursue acquisitions to expand its portfolio in both specialty pharmaceuticals and generics

Better Days Ahead for the Pharma Sector 

	We are halfway through 2017 and the pharma and biotech sector has bounced back nicely with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gaining 12 9  while the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up 17 2   This is in sharp contrast to 2016 which was a tough year for pharma and biotech stocks  with the sector facing a lot of criticism for rising drug prices  While shares rallied post election in November on hopes that drug pricing would not be a key focus area under a Trump presidency  it turned out to be short lived following the President s views regarding drug pricing 

	Drug pricing was not the only headwind last year  2016 was also disappointing from an R D perspective with a fewer number of drugs managing to gain FDA approval  There were some high profile pipeline failures as well  Other factors that weighed on the sector include mixed results  slower than expected new product launches and increasing competition 

	However  the sector has fared better this year  New product sales ramp up  R D success and innovation  strong results  a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products are some of the factors that could contribute to a sustained recovery in the sector  Tax reforms and cash repatriation would support a recovery as well 

	Importantly  investors now seem to be more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario and are willing to look at the fundamentals of the sector  Although the drug pricing issue will remain a headwind this year as well  expectations are that steps taken by the Trump administration to drive down drug prices will not be as draconian as previously expected 

	Deregulation and increased competition seem to be some of the ways that will be used to control drug prices  FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb recently said that the agency is working on a plan to lower healthcare costs by speeding up the development of next generation treatments  especially for rare diseases or targeted cancer therapies 

Valuation Suggests Upside Potential

	Going by the current price to earnings multiple  which is often used to value drug stocks  the pharmaceutical industry looks pretty attractive at this point  The industry is currently trading at a P E multiple of 15 8  below the S P 500 P E multiple of 18 3  leaving room for upside  Moreover  when compared to the industry s own performance over the last year  it can be seen that the current multiple is below the industry high of 17  Keeping these numbers in mind  the current level seems to represent an attractive entry point 

	So what are the factors that could drive the sector  First and foremost  this is an industry that will continue to witness demand for its products given an aging population and the increasing prevalence of a wide variety of diseases  Strong pipelines  innovative treatments  impressive results  and increased health care spending should support growth  Trump s pro business stand is also expected to benefit the sector  Major companies should gain from Trump s proposed tax plan and proposal to repatriate corporate profits held offshore at a one time tax rate 

	A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also work in favor of the sector 

	On the other hand  drug pricing will remain a headline risk  The growing presence of biosimilars  a slowdown in growth of legacy products and high profile pipeline setbacks are also challenges for the sector 

M As to Pick Pace in 2017 

	While there were not too many acquisitions in 2016  expectations are that M A activities will pick up this year  But this year too  there has been limited M A activity with Johnson   Johnson s  NYSE        30 billion acquisition of Actelion being the major M A news this year while a few bolt on deals were announced by other companies  However  expectations are high that M As will increase as the year progresses    potential tax reform and cash repatriation are expected to lead to a boost in this area 

	Several pharma companies are focusing on in licensing mid to late stage pipeline candidates that look promising  instead of developing a product from scratch  which involves a lot of funds and time  Small biotech companies are open to such deals  with most of them finding it challenging to raise cash  thereby making it difficult to survive and continue with the development of promising pipeline candidates  Therefore  it makes sense to seek deals with pharma companies sitting on huge piles of cash  Companies like Exelixis  Incyte  NASDAQ        and TESARO have often been considered attractive acquisition targets by industry watchers 

Streamlining Operations

	Another trend being witnessed is the divestment of non core business segments  Companies like Pfizer  NYSE         UCB  Novartis  NYSE         Sanofi  PA SASY   Valeant  Glaxo and AstraZeneca  NYSE        have all been a part of this trend  The monetization of non core assets allows these companies to focus on their areas of expertise  Smaller companies have also been monetizing assets to utilize the money for pipeline development 

	Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large pharma companies look to cut costs and streamline operations  Most of these companies are re evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs with an unfavorable risk benefit profile 

New Products Should Pick Pace

	Highly awaited new products that gained approval over the last couple of years should contribute significantly to revenues  Key new products include Ibrance  cancer   Cosentyx  psoriasis   PCSK9 inhibitors    Repatha and Praluent  Cotellic  advanced melanoma   Lartruvo  soft tissue carcinoma   Exondys 51  Duchenne muscular dystrophy   Tecentriq  urothelial cancer   and Taltz  moderate to severe plaque psoriasis   among others  The FDA also expanded the label of cancer drugs like Kyprolis  Imbruvica and Xalkori 

Biosimilars A Competitive Threat

	With the FDA approving the first biosimilar in the U S   Zarxio  a biosimilar version of Amgen s blockbuster drug  Neupogen   the floodgates have opened  While biosimilars have been available in the EU for quite a while  there was no regulatory pathway for biosimilars in the U S  The second biosimilar to gain approval in the U S  was Pfizer and Celltrion s Inflectra  infliximab dyyb  with the reference product being Remicade 

	This was followed by the FDA approval of biotech giant Amgen s Amjevita  adalimumab atto   Amjevita is approved for use in all eligible indications of the reference product  AbbVie s Humira  adalimumab   which is used for a wide range of inflammatory diseases 

	And then there is Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim s Basaglar  which while technically not approved as a biosimilar  is a  follow on  insulin glargine product approved through an abbreviated approval pathway    Basaglar was found to be sufficiently similar to Sanofi s Lantus to scientifically justify reliance  and to establish its safety and efficacy for the approved uses 

	Biosimilars should cut healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments  According to information provided by Express Scripts  about  250 billion could be saved in the next decade  2014   2024  if biosimilars for 11 products including Neupogen  Avastin  Epogen  Humira  Neulasta  Remicade and Rituxan are approved  According to the company  Neupogen biosimilars alone represent potential savings of about  5 7 billion 

	Apart from Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Novartis and Pfizer  companies like Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  and Allergan  NYSE AGN  are targeting the highly lucrative biosimilars market  While all these companies are Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  you can see   

What to Expect from the Sector in Q2 Earnings Season 

	A look at consensus earnings expectations for the Medical sector from the Zacks  report for the second quarter earnings season shows earnings will decline 1  from the year ago period while revenues will grow 3 7   This compares to Q1 earnings growth of 5 5  and revenue growth of 5 7  

	While new products should start contributing significantly and increased pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should increase confidence in the sector  challenges remain in the form of currency headwinds  additional competition  slowdown in growth of mature products and loss of exclusivity for certain key drugs 

Zacks Industry Rank

	Within the Zacks Industry classification  pharma and biotech are broadly grouped into the Medical sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  and further sub divided into four industries at the expanded level  large cap pharma  med biomed gene  med drugs and med generic drugs 

	We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry 

	As a point of reference  the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank  88 and lower is  Positive   between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and  177 and higher is  Negative  

	The Zacks Industry Rank for Large Cap Pharmaceuticals is  43   196 for Medical Generic Drugs   163 for Medical Biomedical and Genetics and  171 for Medical Drugs  Analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different medical segments  it is obvious that the outlook is Positive for Large Cap Pharmaceuticals  Neutral for Medical Drugs and Medical Biomedical and Genetics and Negative for Medical Generic Drugs

105833,327348,AGN,As Christie eyes White House  New Jersey wants jobs,news,By Hilary Russ NEW YORK  Reuters    New Jersey Governor Chris Christie s second in command gave her pitch to a small crowd at a Philadelphia biotechnology convention in June with her signature move  giving out her cell phone number    Please consider picking up the phone   Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno said  a plea for attendees from companies large and small to give the state a chance  Her phone rang immediately   Ahh   she groaned  recognizing the caller s area code   Now  no one from New Jersey  I want the guys that aren t already here in New Jersey    The crowd laughed  but Guadagno s frequently used gambit is part of the state s bid to catch up to other parts of the country   When the 2007 2008 recession hit  other states identified the Eastern Seaboard state as a soft target for poaching jobs  with companies ripe for the plucking because of high taxes and labor costs  With Christie announcing his U S  presidential election bid on Tuesday  New Jersey s economic woes could hinder his ability to get voters on board with his proposals nationally  Christie s political action committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment The state s unemployment rate of 6 5 percent exceeds the national average by a full percentage point  and more people are moving out of New Jersey than any other  Its credit rating has been downgraded nine times since Christie took office   Officials  economists and consultants hired to advise on where to locate corporate real estate or a company say there is no simple explanation for New Jersey s sluggish economy  but add that other states have done more to attract business    The recession forced a lot of companies to look at the cost of doing business  Everybody looks at New Jersey and says   Wow  there are lots of companies there  we d like to come pick them off    said Christopher Lloyd  a Richmond  Virginia based site selection specialist for McGuireWoods Consulting  In an interview  Guadagno defended the administration  noting the decline in the state s unemployment rate from 9 8 percent the month that she and Christie took office in January 2010 to the current 6 5 percent   Still  on the night back in June that Guadagno pitched to investors in Philadelphia  she was scheduled to attend a dinner with a number of handpicked companies  so that we can start  one at a time if we have to  to debunk the myth that New Jersey s a hard to do business in state   THE MEDICINE CHEST New Jersey has also been hit with losses in its key pharmaceutical industry as more companies elected to move into urban environments  rather than suburban locales that attracted young families to the state in the 1980s  Swiss drugmaker Roche had its U S  base in Nutley for more than 80 years before a 2009 merger with Genentech that moved the combined headquarters to San Francisco  It shuttered the Nutley campus in 2012  costing New Jersey about 1 000 jobs   Roche planned a clinical research center on the U S  East Coast with 240 people  but picked a Manhattan site created by Alexandria Real Estate Equities  which creates urban campuses for pharmaceutical  technology and biotech companies  The New York site gives young people the lifestyle not available in suburbia  It also put Roche in close contact with other companies  hospitals and universities for quicker collaborations for drug development   They  New Jersey  were the leaders in this country  but they didn t recognize the fundamental change in the industry  the expiration of patents of big pharma and the nature of collaborations and innovations   Joel Marcus  Alexandria s founder  chief executive and chairman  told Reuters   Between 2008 and 2013  New Jersey  long considered the  medicine chest of the world   saw pharmaceutical jobs decline by 17 percent  according to state data  Nationally  the industry also shrank  though not as much  Last Friday  Bristol Myers Squibb announced that it would open a new research site at Alexandria s center in Cambridge  Massachusetts  pulling with it employees from Connecticut and some from New Jersey   State chief economist James Wooster said in an April report that New Jersey s economic recovery was  sluggish by any standard   as the manufacturing  financial services and information sectors have continued to lose jobs since the recession   In 2014  Atlantic City hemorrhaged jobs as a result of several casino closures  In January  Mercedes Benz said it would move its U S  headquarters to Atlanta  taking 1 000 jobs  Overall job growth is expected to lag the nation through at least 2022  according to state data  It hasn t all been bad news  Some companies  including Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  and Destination Maternity Corp have been lured into New Jersey  Others decided to stay and expand  including  Actavis  Inc  NYSE AGN   AILC UL   Sandoz Inc and Burlington Coat Factory  Since February 2010  New Jersey s recessionary low point  186 000 private jobs have been created  To respond to the changes in biotech and pharmaceuticals  the administration restructured some of its best colleges  including Christie s merger of most of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey into Rutgers University  to make it easier to do clinical trials  In 2013  the state streamlined its tax incentive program  which had been overly complex and outdated  The program requires companies to certify they have made capital investments and created or preserved jobs before receiving incentives  Since then  New Jersey has approved  2 2 billion in subsidies but so far only given out  603 500   Those will start ramping up over the course of the next couple years  and I think that we re going to have great growth   said Michele Brown  CEO of Choose New Jersey  a private nonprofit touting the state s attributes  one of several officials with Guadagno at the Philadelphia biotech convention  Guadagno is counting on these incentives to boost employment  Christie will have to hope voters hear a similar message   If I can get a seat at your table  if I can sit down and tell you what the tax credits are  what the incentives are  how this partnership you re looking at right here works very hard to make sure you get an answer  you may not always get the answer that you want  but you get an answer in a timely fashion  then companies are at least going to look at us   she said

105849,327364,AGN,Aerie s Ophthalmic Candidate Positive In Registration Trial ,opinion,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AERI   announced positive primary efficacy results of the 90 day phase III registration trial   Mercury 2   for its pipeline candidate Roclatan 

We note that Aerie has outperformed the Zacks classified industry in the last 12 months  The stock has rallied 144 9  during this period  compared with the industry s 12 5  gain 
We note that Aerie is evaluating Roclatan  a once daily  quadruple action fixed dose combination of its lead candidate Rhopressa and Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Xalatan 
The results of the trial were consistent with the Mercury 1 trial which was a phase III registration trial that reported top line efficacy findings in Sep 2016 
The data from the trial showed that Mercury 2 achieved its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating statistical superiority over each of its components   Rhopressa  netarsudil ophthalmic solution  0 02   and Xalatan  all of which were dosed once daily in the evening 
The data also showed that the IOP lowering effect of Roclatan was 1 to 3 mmHg  millimeters of mercury  greater than monotherapy with either Xalatan or Rhopressa throughout the duration of the study 
The study evaluated patients with maximum baseline intraocular pressures  IOPs  ranging from above 20 to below 36 mmHg 
As a result  the company now expects to submit its NDA for Roclatan in the first half of 2018 
Moreover  the data from the trial showed relatively low discontinuation rates for the 90 day Mercury 2 trial of 9 8  and 10 6  for Roclatan and Rhopressa respectively 
The company also expects to commence a trial  Mercury 3  in mid 2017  in Europe to support filings there  The trial will be a non inferiority trial comparing Roclatan to prescribed fixed dose combination of Ganfort  a combination of the bimatoprost along with timolol   marketed by Allergan   NYSE AGN   in Europe 
Last week  Aerie announced that it has received notification from the FDA about the completion of the initial 60 day review of the NDA for Rhopressa  The FDA determined that the application is sufficiently complete and can undergo a substantive review  Concurrently  the Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  goal date for the completion of the FDA s review has been set on Feb 28  2018 
A potential approval and successful commercialization will boost the company s growth prospects in the global ophthalmic market significantly

105852,327367,AGN,5 Reasons Why You Should Invest In AstraZeneca  AZN  In 2017,opinion,"London based pharma giant  AstraZeneca plc   NYSE AZN   has a strong product portfolio and is one of the key players in the global cardiovascular market AstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Here we discuss five key factors that indicate that the time is ripe to invest in the stock Rising Estimates   Share Price  AstraZeneca s earnings estimates for 2017 went up 2 8  while that for 2018 moved up 4 4  in the past 60 days  Its earnings performance has also been pretty impressive  with the company reporting positive surprises consistently  The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 142 6  Shares of AstraZeneca have risen 26 7  this year so far  while the Zacks classified industry increased 11 4   This comes after a decline of almost 20  in 2016 New Drugs Going Strong  AstraZeneca s newly launched drugs are contributing to its top line  thereby easing the impact of genericization on legacy products  New drugs like Lynparza  ovarian cancer   Farxiga Forxiga  type II diabetes  Movantik Moventig  opioid induced constipation  and Tagrisso  lung cancer  are off to an encouraging start  AstraZeneca is looking for further label expansions for these drugs Trends of better diagnosis  improved access and favorable patient dynamics should bode well for the company s established products across its portfolios  Meanwhile  the company is working on driving sales of Brilinta  cardiovascular  sales  which has been doing well  Brilinta enjoys a leading position in the U S  branded oral anti platelet market Deep Pipeline and Strategic Deals  AstraZeneca is also working on bolstering its pipeline and is looking at suitable acquisitions  In addition to acquisitions  the company is pursuing co development deals with companies like Nektar Therapeutics   NASDAQ NKTR    Eli Lilly   Company   NYSE LLY    Ionis  Allergan plc   NYSE AGN    Merck  NYSE MRK  and Valeant to boost its pipeline This year  the company expects to launch four new products   Imfinzi durvalumab  multiple cancers  approved in the U S  for urothelial carcinoma   Qtern  saxagliptin Forxiga fixed combination  approved in the U S   EU    Bevespi  already launched  and benralizumab  asthma  under review in the U S  AstraZeneca has a promising and diversified late stage pipeline that includes immuno oncology candidates  Immuno oncology is a therapeutic area  which is presently attracting a lot of interest and represents huge commercial potential  The company s target is to launch at least six new oncology medicines by 2020 with three already launched since 2014 An interesting candidate in the company s immuno oncology pipeline is Imfinzi  durvalumab   It is being evaluated for multiple cancers  either alone or in combination with other regimens   including phase III trials in first line urothelial cancer  non small cell lung cancer  small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma among othersOther promising candidates in late stage development or under regulatory review include ZS 9  hyperkalemia   roxadustat  anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease  and AZD3293  Alzheimer s disease  News Rich Year So Far  This year so far has been news rich for AstraZeneca  In May  it received positive CHMP opinion for plaque psoriasis candidate  brodalumab  gained the first approval for Imfinzi  durvalumab  for urothelial carcinoma and announced positive lung cancer data from late stage studies  In April  its EGFR inhibitor Tagrisso s conditional approval was converted to full approval in both the U S  and EU In March  it announced positive Lynpraza data from a phase III study evaluating the drug as a maintenance monotherapy in patients with germline BRCA mutated  gBRCA   platinum sensitive  relapsed ovarian cancer  Later  in the same month  the regulatory application for label expansion for the maintenance indication was also granted priority review by the FDA  In February  AstraZeneca gained FDA approval for Qtern  diabetes  and also presented positive breast cancer data on Lynpraza The company expects a lot of activity on the regulatory and pipeline front through the rest of the year including U S  regulatory decisions for benralizumab and pivotal data for systemic lupus erythematosus candidate anifrolumab and for durvalumab from lung cancer studies If the decisions data are positive  the share price uptick should continue Aggressive Cost Cutting Initiatives  AstraZeneca intends to drive operational efficiency and reduce the impact of genericization on its key products by trimming its cost structure  In 2016  SG A cost declined 9  thanks to efficiency savings in sales and marketing operations as well as a reduction in general administration areas  These actions included a major reduction in the sales and head office structure in U S  marketing  By the end of 2018  these restructuring initiatives are expected to generate net annualized benefits of about  1 1 billion  Streamlining operations  along with its focus on R D  will benefit the company in the long run ConclusionMany key drugs in AstraZeneca s portfolio are facing generic competition in the U S  Its diabetes franchise also facing stiff competition  Nonetheless  we believe that its new drugs  cost cutting initiatives  rapid pipeline progress  and accretive deals acquisitions will keep the stock afloat this year Astrazeneca  LON AZN  PLC Price and Consensus

105854,327369,AGN,AstraZeneca not only game in town for deal hungry Pfizer,news,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Sophie Sassard LONDON  Reuters    Pfizer  N PFE  appears unlikely to make a fresh bid for AstraZeneca  L AZN  in 12 days time  when an enforced cooling off period ends  and the U S  drugmaker is now weighing other less risky targets 
People with direct knowledge of the situation said Pfizer has been reviewing different takeover scenarios with a U S  investment bank ahead of Nov  26  when it is allowed to renew its pursuit of AstraZeneca under UK takeover rules 
This includes a close analysis of the benefits of a tax saving deal to buy Dublin based generic drugmaker Actavis  N ACT   which has a market value of around  64 billion against AstraZeneca s  94 billion 
 I am pretty sure that no one at AstraZeneca is ready to agree a friendly deal   said a banker who met with the British company recently and has insights into Pfizer s strategy 
 The hurdles are now getting bigger and bigger  A deal would take longer and would be more expensive  In that context  Actavis is becoming more attractive  although it would not be a great story   he added  explaining Actavis would not offer the same synergies and opportunities in oncology as AstraZeneca 
Pfizer s Chief Executive Ian Read told analysts in October that the company remained interested in lowering its tax bill  despite a U S  clampdown on companies using so called inversion deals to move their tax base overseas 
 We still believe that on a case by case basis there is meaningful value to be had from inversions   Read said 
AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot  however  said last week that the risks of inversion deals had increased markedly since the U S  rules changes  as evidenced by the collapse of AbbVie s  N ABBV   55 billion plan to buy Shire  L SHP  
Many investors agree with that reading 
 I would not put it  the chance of a new Pfizer bid for AstraZeneca  at more than a 20 30 percent probability   said Norbert Janisch  portfolio manager at Raiffeisen Capital Management in Vienna  which is a shareholder in AstraZeneca 
DEAL HUNGRY
AstraZeneca has been buoyed recently by progress with new drugs but its shares  which are trading 25 percent above the level before news of Pfizer s interest emerged in April  still contain a takeover premium 
The political difficulties of staging what would be the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British company also remain considerable  with a general election in May 2015 that the opposition Labour party  which opposed Pfizer s earlier bid  could well win 
It all means Pfizer would  once again  have to try for a friendly deal  and analysts doubt AstraZeneca s board would come to the table for less than 60 pounds a share  against 47 pounds at present 
Pfizer s problem is that the tax advantages of buying AstraZeneca are now considerably less than in May  when its 55 pounds a share offer was rejected 
The U S  group s need for a deal remains  however  given its vulnerability to cheaper generics and its relatively weak line up of experimental medicines  which is spurring Read and his lieutenants to look at other options 
 The truth is that Pfizer has never stopped looking at targets in Europe after the AstraZeneca debacle   said one banker familiar with Pfizer s strategy 

AstraZeneca  meanwhile  plans to set out its stall at a Nov  18 investor day  This will include an update on experimental drugs in the hot research area of cancer immunotherapy  which involves boosting the immune system to fight tumours

Ackman  who had been fighting alongside Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc for control of Allergan  had called for the Allergan meeting to vote out board members and force the company to the table to consider their joint offer  The meeting is scheduled for Dec  18

105859,327374,AGN,Japanese shares lose steam  Asian shares slip,news,"By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO  Reuters    Japanese shares gave up early gains on Wednesday as investors booked profits after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe delayed a tax hike and said he would call a snap election to seek a fresh mandate for his economic policies 
Asian shares slipped to a three week low as resource shares were hit by fall in oil and other commodity prices and as Chinese shares lost momentum as investors continued to take profits after Monday s launch of the landmark Hong Kong Shanghai trading link 
Japan s Nikkei  N225  erased earlier gains to stand flat by midday  showing little reaction after the Bank of Japan maintained its policy as expected after a surprise easing last month 
 Considering the current economic conditions  postponing the consumption tax would be positive for stocks   Ryota Sakagami  chief strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities  said in report 
Abe s tax hike delay by 18 months is expected to help the world s third biggest economy  which unexpectedly slipped back into a recession in the June September quarter after an earlier sales tax increase clobbered consumption 
 But the ruling party bloc is likely to reduce their seats  Their victory is unlikely to create hopes for big changes  So we do not anticipate the type of boom in Japanese stocks we saw after election in 2005 and 2012   Sakagami added 
Few expect Abe s Liberal Democratic Party and its smaller ally to lose their majority  but financial markets and analysts are now contemplating the possibility that the ruling bloc might fare less well than initially anticipated 
Investors are now looking to what BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda would say about the country s slide into recession and Abe s decision to delay the tax hike   something Kuroda has said is not advisable  Kuroda will hold a news conference at 0630 GMT  1 30 a m  EST  
The BOJ stunned markets last month by expanding its monetary easing program to preempt a slowdown in inflation 
The Japanese yen hit a seven year low  weighed by the BOJ s extremely loose policy and weak economic data 
The dollar rose as high as 117 31 yen  high last seen in 2007  and last stood at 117 27 yen USD JPY  The euro also hit a six year high of 146 81 yen  EUR JPY  
The euro held firm against the dollar at  1 2530  after German analyst and investor sentiment rose unexpectedly in November for the first time in almost a year 
The ZEW index surpassed even the most bullish forecast  raising hopes of an improvement in Europe s biggest economy after it dodged recession in the third quarter 
The upbeat data also helped European shares to close at a seven week high while Wall Street shares inched up as the healthcare sector benefited from the takeover of Allergan Inc  N AGN  by Actavis  N ACT  
The Australian dollar tumbled as the price of iron ore   IO62 CNI SI   Australia s top export earner  slipped to its lowest in five years at  72 10 a metric ton  1 1023 tons  
Later in the day  the U S  Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last policy meeting  which markets will watch for any clues on when the Fed will start raising rates 
U S  debt yields dipped on Tuesday as benign wholesale inflation figures cemented the view that the Fed can afford to wait for an extended period before raising rates 
The 10 year U S  10 year yield stood at 2 320 percent  US10YT RR  in early Asia  after having dipped about 2 5 basis points on Tuesday 
One major reason inflation is subdued in the United States   and elsewhere   is because of falling oil prices over the last five months  partly on oversupply concerns as U S  shale oil production has increased 
Oil prices were depressed near four year lows after two straight days of falls so far this week as traders looked to whether the OPEC will agree on an output cut at its Nov  27 meeting

Now  Valeant  needs to show that this is a sound business and that their fundamentals are strong   said Alex Arfaei  an analyst at BMO Capital   If you go from one hostile deal to another  you are creating the impression that you re desperate  Valeant certainly has some strong signs of growth and is anything but desperate      Additional reporting by Jessica Toonkel in New York  Editing by Michele Gershberg and John Pickering ",2014-12-09,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-valeant-to-drop-deal-making-in-near-term-to-cut-debt,-boost-stock-319520",319520
105863,327378,AGN,Exclusive  Express Scripts presses for more drug savings with coverage list ,news,"By Deena Beasley  LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Express Scripts  O ESRX   the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U S  employers  is taking an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies after winning discounts on medications with a strategy introduced last year   On Monday  Express Scripts said it lined up a cheaper price for AbbVie Inc s  N ABBV  newly approved hepatitis C treatment and  in most cases  will no longer cover Gilead Sciences Inc s  O GILD   rival treatments after trying for nearly a year to win a deeper discount   The move threatens to undermine profits at Gilead  and was viewed by Wall Street as a sign that other major biotechnology players  including Amgen Inc  O AMGN  and Biogen Inc  O BIIB   will face steeper U S  pricing pressure from insurers  Other drugmakers without potentially transformative new products  such as Shire Plc  L SHP   Novo Nordisk  VX NOVN  and Theravance Inc  O THRX   may also be particularly vulnerable  analysts said  Neither Shire  Novo Nordisk nor Theravance responded to requests for comment   Express Scripts will further expand the number of medicines it won t cover for 2016  including treatments for common illnesses such as diabetes  pulmonary hypertension and arthritis  said Chief Medical Officer Dr Steve Miller  in an interview earlier this month  In some cases  Express Scripts could drop coverage for newer specialty medicines in the biotechnology field  he said  The timing on specific drugs will depend on when new competing drugs with similar clinical benefits are approved for the U S  market   Express Scripts first began excluding drugs from its largest national reimbursement list for 2014  with 44 medications  and increased that number to 66 for 2015   The prospect of having their drugs dropped from Express Scripts  biggest  formulary  list of covered medicines has prompted some leading pharmaceutical makers to discount their prices  Miller said   Express Scripts is acting on behalf of clients who need to rein in healthcare costs  and estimates that the move has so far saved such employers more than  1 billion in annual spending  Miller said   Employers  are by necessity asking us to take a more aggressive stance because the affordability of their benefits is really at risk   Miller said   We are going to be opportunistic  in looking for savings in the future   Gilead shares dropped more than 14 percent in Monday trading to  92 90  Shares in Amgen  Biogen and Celgene CELG O fell more than 2 percent   CVS HEALTH  The second largest U S  pharmacy benefits manager  CVS Health Corp  N CVS   has said it will exclude 95 prescription products from its reimbursement list next year  up from 72 in 2014  It expects the practice will save its plan sponsors over  3 5 billion between 2012 and 2015   The drugs most under scrutiny include more expensive   me too  products  in categories where several drugmakers compete for similar patients  Both Novo Nordisk and Sanofi SA  PA SASY  are developing slightly longer lasting insulins   Amgen  AbbVie and Johnson   Johnson  N JNJ   respectively sell Enbrel  Humira and Remicade   all rheumatoid arthritis drugs that work in a similar way  Companies like Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries  N TEVA  and Actavis  N ACT  want to switch patients to more expensive versions of their multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer s drugs  respectively  before the arrival of cheap generic competitors   The effect is already being felt by such Big Pharma players as AstraZeneca Plc  L AZN  and Sanofi  Both companies warned recently that the need to offer U S  price discounts on some of their biggest brand name medicines will hurt 2015 sales   Insurers are pushing back against prices in other categories  including blood thinners and even HIV drugs and multiple sclerosis treatments  where there are multiple options for doctors and patients  observers said    The extent of this becoming a broader problem is tied to whether we get great new drugs for things like asthma   high cholesterol   Alzheimer s and cancer   said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal   If there is a limited pool of money and a bunch of new drugs  the pressure on older drugs will increase       DIMINISHING RETURNS  In recent years  the introduction of far cheaper generic versions of medicines like Pfizer Inc s  N PFE  Lipitor to reduce cholesterol and Merck   Co s  N MRK  asthma drug Singulair helped insurers save on reimbursement costs  But that wave of patent expiries has slowed considerably   In the meantime  a new crop of novel  and in some cases  highly effective treatments for cancer and hepatitis C are costing them tens of billions of dollars more to reimburse   The influx of generics  allowed the system to actually see drug price deflation   said Asher Anolic  manager of Fidelity s Select Pharmaceuticals Portfolio   At the same time  others are launching innovative new drugs     Based on those dynamics I get more concerned  Where is the give in the system  It s on the legacy products    Anolic said his Fidelity fund focuses on drugmakers with highly differentiated portfolios of treatments  Its top holdings as of Sept 30 included Actavis  AbbVie  Novartis AG  VX NOVN  and Bristol Myers Squibb Co  N BMY     When you look at the industry as a whole  we will probably see less profitability   said Nils Behnke  a partner at consulting firm Bain   Co   Mid sized companies with a broader portfolio of little products   me too  products   they will have a hard time    Murray Aitken  vice president at healthcare information company IMS Health  N IMS   estimates that 2014 spending on new and innovative brand name drugs will total about  20 billion compared with about  3 billion in 2012   Industry executives say newer health plans  whether purchased by individual consumers or offered through an employer  will further accelerate efforts to limit drug prices because they require patients to pay a higher share of prescription costs   Pharmacy benefits companies like Express Scripts say they will cover an excluded medicine if that specific treatment is deemed medically necessary for a patient  Some groups have expressed concern that patient care might be compromised   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America  a leading drug industry trade group  said such practices hurt patients by limiting access to a range of appropriate medicines and potentially discriminating against certain conditions   But insurers say that the high price of new drugs set by manufacturers has already deterred some patients from following doctor s orders   
 Plan sponsors  because of the rapid rise in cost  are many times having to ask the consumer to pay more  for their medicines  said Express Scripts  Miller   If you can t afford your healthcare  you don t take it      Reporting by Deena Beasley  Editing by Michele Gershberg and John Pickering ",2014-12-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-express-scripts-presses-for-more-drug-savings-with-coverage-list-321293,321293

looking to get approval for their generic versions of the 40 mg thrice weekly formulation of Copaxone  In late January  Teva suffered a major setback with the U S  District Court for the District of Delaware invalidating four of the five Orange Book patents protecting Copaxone 40 mg  Teva intends to appeal against the decision  However  generic versions of the 40 mg formulation have not been

quarter earnings and sales were soft and it reiterated its 2017 guidance Once again  sales and profits in the first quarter were driven by inorganic growth related mostly to the Actavis acquisition and the joint venture with Takeda in Japan  The core business fails to witness any real growth as the U S  generics industry continues to face significant competitive and pricing pressure Encouragingly  Teva said it expects to realize cost savings of approximately  1 5 billion by the end of 2017  an increase of  200 million from previous expectations  It paid down debt worth  1 2 billion during the quarter from  35 8 billion at year end 2016 to  34 6 billion at the end of the first quarter Meanwhile  the company also said it will sell certain non core assets  including the

Allergan delivered a  beat and raise  quarter  Read more    Setback for Roche as Tecentriq Fails in Pivotal Study  Swiss pharma giant  Roche  was hit by results from a pivotal study  IMvigor211  on its immuno oncology drug  Tecentriq  a PD L1 inhibitor  Tecentriq failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival  OS  in the study conducted in second line bladder cancer patients  Tecentriq had gained accelerated FDA approval for this indication based on duration of response and tumor response rate and IMvigor211 was being conducted to serve as a confirmatory study to support full approval  With results falling short  the drug s conditional approval for this indication could be at stake though Tecentriq also gained accelerated approval for the first line patient population Meanwhile  other checkpoint inhibitors that gained accelerated approval for this indication based on duration of response will also feel the heat until confirmatory data is out  In this regard  we note that Merck s   NYSE MRK   anti PD 1 therapy  Keytruda  met the primary endpoint of OS in a phase III study    the data has been submitted for FDA review with a response from the agency expected

We note that Aerie has outperformed the Zacks classified  industry in the last 12 months  In fact  the stock rallied 191 4  during this period  compared with the industry s 17 2  gain 
The acceptance indicates that the FDA has not identified any potential review issues  The FDA is currently planning to hold an advisory committee 
We note that Rhopressa is Aerie s lead candidate  Rhopressa is a once daily formulation for intraocular pressure  IOP  in patients suffering from open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension  Aerie filed a NDA for the drug in the U S  in Sep 2016  However  in Oct 2016  the company withdrew the NDA due to the failure of a third party manufacturing facility not ready for pre approval inspection  The company resubmitted its NDA in Feb 2017 
Hence  a potential approval and successful commercialization will boost the company s growth prospects in the global ophthalmic market significantly 
Currently  Rhopressa is being evaluated in two phase III registration studies   the Rocket 4 study  six month data expected in the second quarter of 2017   designed to gain adequate safety data for regulatory filings in EU and the Rocket 3 study  a 12 month  safety only study for regulatory filings in Canada  Aerie expects to submit regulatory application for Rhopressa in the EU in the second half of 2017 
Apart from Rhopressa  Aerie is evaluating Roclatan  a once daily  quadruple action fixed dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Xalatan  The company expects top line 90 day efficacy and safety data from the second phase III clinical trial  Mercury 2  for Roclatan 0 02  0 005   in the second quarter of 2017  Data from Mercury 1 is expected in the third quarter of 2017  If Mercury 1 and Mercury 2 are successful  the NDA for Roclatan is expected to be filed in late 2017 or early 2018 
The company also expects to commence a trial  Mercury 3  in mid 2017  in Europe to support filings there  The trial will be a non inferiority trial comparing Roclatan to prescribed fixed dose combination of Ganfort  a combination of the bimatoprost along with timolol   marketed by Allergan   NYSE AGN   in Europe

EDIT Technical Analysis

Editas Medicine Chart
EDIT opened trading yesterday at  20 02 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  19 29  EDIT closed trading yesterday at  20 01 and crashed down after market to  18 88  equivalent to a 6  decrease from the closing price 
Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time EDIT traded below these levels we have to go back to May 11th when it traded at  18 51  It s higher priced than the usual penny stocks that I trade but there could still be plenty of opportunity for a trade here 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down EDIT had already been in an overall downward trend dating back to February 21st when it traded at  27 27  EDIT has a float of 20 59 million shares and traded below the normal daily trading volume on Monday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see EDIT open trading on Tuesday below  19 25 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My  would be  0 20 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

105896,327411,AGN,Forest Labs Buys Furiex Pharma For  1 46B,news,"By     Reuters    Forest Laboratories Inc  NYSE FRX  said it would buy Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc  FURX O  for up to  1 46 billion including milestone payments to access Furiex s promising treatment for irritable bowel syndrome 
This is the latest in a series of healthcare deals and offers that have been structured to either gain scale or build up expertise in specific disease areas 
Forest  which itself is being acquired by Actavis Inc  NYSE ACT   said it expected Furiex s eluxadoline to be  very complementary  to its own bowel drug Linzess 
Eluxadoline  which is being developed for treating symptoms of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome  significantly alleviated symptoms of the disease in two large late stage trials in February 
Furiex is on track to submit a marketing application for eluxadoline by the end of the third quarter of 2014 
Forest will pay about  95 per share in cash to Furiex shareholders and up to  30 per share in a contingent value right  that would be dependent on the drug achieving certain designations given by the U S  Food and Drug Administration following the drug s approval 
Furiex s shares were up 28 percent at  102 50 in premarket trading 
Forest said it expected the Furiex deal to close in the second or third quarter of 2014 and said it would not affect the timing of the Forest Actavis acquisition

105897,327412,AGN,AstraZeneca buys Almirall lung drugs for up to  2 1 billion,news,"By Ben Hirschler LONDON  Reuters    AstraZeneca  L AZN  took a major step to build up its respiratory medicine business on Wednesday by striking a deal worth up to  2 1 billion for the rights to Spanish group Almirall s  MC ALM  lung drugs 
The British drugmaker  which resisted a  118 billion takeover attempt by Pfizer  N PFE  in May  said it would pay an initial  875 million and up to  1 22 billion more if the drugs meet development and sales targets 
The tie up boosts a key therapeutic area for AstraZeneca  whose Chief Executive Pascal Soriot is determined to show his company has a strong independent future 
Soriot also struck a clinical trial collaboration with Japan s Kyowa Hakko Kirin  T 4151  for a study that will evaluate a combination of the two companies  drugs in cancer   another important field for AstraZeneca 
For Almirall  the deal with AstraZeneca is a notable win  giving it extra resources to increase its focus on dermatology  The company is a local success story whose shares have strongly outperformed the Spanish market in the past three years 
AstraZeneca will have the right to develop and commercialise Almirall s existing lung drugs   including its recently launched treatment Eklira or aclidinium   as well as its pipeline of experimental therapies 
Almirall Sofotec  an Almirall subsidiary focused on making devices for delivering drugs to the lungs  including the Genuair inhaler  will also transfer to AstraZeneca 
Importantly  the deal gives AstraZeneca access to revenues from a drug already on the market  in Eklira  helping its sales immediately as it struggles with a wave of patent expiries on its own blockbuster medicines 
Eklira sales are expected to reach  535 million by 2018  according to consensus forecasts collected by Thomson Reuters  although much of that will be sold via Actavis  N ACT   which has U S  rights to the drug after acquiring Almirall s marketing partner Forest Laboratories 
AstraZeneca expects the transaction  which will be paid for from existing cash reserves and using short term credit facilities  to be neutral to core earnings per share in 2015 and accretive from 2016  It is set to close by the end of 2014 and will not affect AstraZeneca s current year financial outlook 
Mick Cooper  an analyst at Edison Investment Research  said the agreement with Almirall was a  smart deal  that would help build up AstraZeneca s respiratory business  which is already doing well as its Symbicort drug wins business from GlaxoSmithKline s  L GSK  Advair 
 Its respiratory franchise has considerable momentum at the moment and this agreement fills in the gaps in the portfolio   he said 
FAMILY CONTROL
Almirall said the deal would boost its earnings immediately and shares in the Barcelona based group  which was advised by Rothschild  jumped 8 percent by 1045 GMT 
Some analysts expressed surprise at Almirall s decision  since respiratory accounts for 30 percent of its sales  ahead of dermatology  its next largest franchise with 27 percent 
But it was always going to be difficult for it to compete against industry heavyweights in the respiratory field  given the need for large clinical trials and heavy marketing spend 
Instead  Almirall will now become a specialist company  focused on dermatology  and is likely to seek small acquisitions and licensing deals to build up this remaining business  according to one person familiar with the firm s thinking 
Despite a wave of takeovers now sweeping the pharmaceuticals sector  Almirall is unlikely to become a takeover target any time soon  since it is two thirds owned by the Gallardo family  which is keen to retain control 
Analysts at Jefferies said AstraZeneca s decision to buy the entire respiratory franchise wiped out concerns about Almirall s so called LAMA LABA lung drug combination in the United States  where regulators have asked for more clinical trial data 
AstraZeneca shares were 1 percent higher  outperforming a 0 5 percent gain in the European drugs sector  
It positions AstraZeneca more strongly in a battle to develop next generation treatments for asthma and chronic lung disease caused by smoking  where it is up against big hitting rivals like GSK and Novartis  VX NOVN  
AstraZeneca already raised its bet on respiratory medicine last year by buying U S  based Pearl Therapeutics for up to  1 15 billion 
The two companies said a  significant  number of Almirall employees would transfer to AstraZeneca 
AstraZeneca will report second quarter results on Thursday  when it will seek to prove its financial resilience after its decision to reject Pfizer s takeover advances 

Pfizer on Tuesday left investors guessing whether it would renew its pursuit of its British rival  as it presented results  but said it was still considering big deals

major disappointment with the FDA issuing a CRL for their experimental RA treatment  baricitinib  The agency told the companies that it is unable to approve baricitinib  a once daily oral medication for the treatment of moderate to severe RA  in its current form  What is concerning is that the agency has asked for additional clinical data to determine the most appropriate doses as well as to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms  This means delayed approval timelines and additional costs depending on the studies that may need to be conducted  Lilly and Incyte said that they were not in agreement with the FDA and the timing for resubmission would be based on further discussions with the agency We note that baricitinib was approved in the EU under the trade name

105914,327429,AGN,Novartis Tops Q1 Earnings  Cosentyx  Entresto Boost Sales,opinion,"Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   reported first quarter 2017 core earnings of  1 13 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 10 but it was lower than the year ago figure of  1 17 Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise

   Revenues declined 1  to  11 5 billion  roughly in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate as volume growth was offset by the negative impact of generic competition 
A look at Novartis  share price movement in the last three months shows that the stock underperformed the Zacks classified  industry  Its shares gained 3 8  compared with 6 7  gain for the industry 

All growth rates mentioned below are on a year over year basis and at constant exchange rates 
The Quarter in Detail
Novartis operates under three segments  Innovative Medicines  Pharmaceuticals   Alcon  Ophthalmology unit  and Sandoz  Generics  
The Innovative Medicines division recorded sales of  7 7 billion  up 2   Generic competition and pricing pressure impacted sales at the segment  primarily due to the entry of generics for Gleevec in the U S  Nevertheless  growth products   Cosentyx  Entresto  Promacta Revolade  Jakavi  Tafinlar   Mekinist and Gilenya boosted sales 
Psoriasis Cosentyx sales surged 136  on the back of strong growth in its three approved indications while Entresto too had solid first quarter as sales benefited from continued access improvements  increased investment in the U S  as well as additional launches in Europe  Oncology franchise grew 7  driven mainly by Promacta Revolade  Jakavi  Tafinlar   Mekinist and Tasigna  
Sales at the Sandoz division were  2 4 billion  up 1  as volume growth was offset by price erosion  Biopharmaceuticals sales grew 30  to  274 million mainly driven by Zarxio and Glatopa 20mg in the U S 
Sales at the Alcon division were  1 4 billion  up 1   Vision care sales were up 4  fueled by strong performance of the daily contact lens portfolio  including continued double digit growth of Dailies Total1 globally  However  surgical sales were down due to competitive pressure in intraocular lenses  IOLs  
2017 Outlook Reiterated
Novartis expects net sales to be broadly in line with the 2016 levels after including the impact of continued genericization of Gleevec Glivec in the U S  and Europe  The impact of generic competition on sales is expected to be approximately  2 5 billion in 2017 
Pipeline Update
Novartis  pipeline progress has been encouraging  The company received FDA s approval for Kisqali  ribociclib  formerly LEE011  in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for treatment of postmenopausal women with HR  HER2  advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
The combination of Tafinlar   Mekinist received EU approval to treat patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express the BRAF V600 mutation  In addition  Votubia dispersible tablets were approved by the EC as an adjunctive treatment for patients whose refractory partial onset seizures are associated with TSC 
Meanwhile  the biosimilar versions of Amgen s   NASDAQ AMGN   Enbrel  etanercept  and Roche s   OTC RHHBY   MabThera Rituxan received positive opinions from the CHMP in EU 
On the other hand  CTL019 was granted priority review by the FDA  in pediatric and young adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia  CTL019 is an investigational CAR T cell therapy  The FDA has also granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to CTL019 for the treatment of adult patients with r r diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
Additionally  Zykadia was granted Priority Review in the U S  for use as a first line treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC with an ALK mutation and breakthrough therapy designation in this indication for patients with brain metastases 
Novartis expects to submit an application for BAF312  siponimod  for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis  RMS  in 2018 as per discussions with regulatory authorities 
On the other hand  a phase III trial on RLX030  serelaxin  did not meet its primary endpoints 
Novartis also entered into a clinical trial agreement with Allergan   NYSE AGN   to conduct a phase IIb study  involving the combination of a Novartis FXR agonist and Allergan s cenicriviroc  CVC  for the treatment of non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  
Our Take
Novartis first quarter results were encouraging as the company beat earnings estimates while sales were in line with expectations 
Earlier in 2017  Novartis announced that it is mulling strategic options for Alcon which includes retaining the business separation via capital market transactions such as a spin off or an initial public offering   Given its dismal performance  Alcon seems to be a laggard for quite some time now  The company will throw more light on its plans for Alcon toward the end of 2017 
On a positive note  growth drivers like Cosentyx and Entresto  more than offset the impact of generic erosion  mainly due to Glivec  Cosentyx hit blockbuster status in 2016  The recent approval of Kisqali in the U S  and priority review status for CTL019 also bodes well for the company s portfolio  We are also impressed by the company s efforts to strengthen its biosimilars portfolio

Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   You can see

105916,327431,AGN,Aerie  AERI  Posts Wider Than Expected Q1 Loss  Expenses Up,opinion,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AERI   posted first quarter 2017 loss of 76 cents per share  including stock based compensation   wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 74 cents but narrower than the year ago loss of 85 cents 
Being a development stage company  Aerie has not generated any revenues from product sales yet 

We note that Aerie outperformed the Zacks classified  industry in the last six months  In fact  the stock rallied 25 9  during this period  compared with a gain of 13 8  for the industry 
Quarter in Detail
In the reported quarter  research and development expenses declined 11  to  9 8 million as the company completed trials in the U S  General and administrative expenses increased 47 7  to  14 5 million  The higher operating expenses in the reported quarter were due to expansion of the employee base to support the growth of operations and commercialization preparatory activities  including commercial manufacturing costs for Rhopressa 
Pipeline Update
The company resubmitted new drug application  NDA  for lead candidate Rhopressa 0 02  on Feb 28 and expects a review period of 12 months  We note that Aerie withdrew the Rhopressa NDA filed in September as a third party manufacturing facility in Tampa  FL was not ready for pre approval inspection by the FDA  The company initiated preparations to bring a second contract manufacturer online in 2018 
The company reported encouraging six month top line safety and efficacy results from the phase III trial  ROCKET 4  on Rhopressa  The trial is being conducted to provide adequate safety data for European regulatory filings  Rocket 4 has been successfully completed for submission to the European regulatory authorities 
Apart from Rhopressa  Aerie is evaluating Roclatan  a once daily  quadruple action fixed dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Xalatan  The company expects top line 90 day efficacy and safety data from the second phase III clinical trial  Mercury 2  for Roclatan 0 02  0 005   in second quarter 2017  Data from Mercury 1 is expected in third quarter 2017  If Mercury 1 and Mercury 2 are successful  the NDA for Roclatan is expected to be filed in late 2017 or early 2018 
The company also expects to commence a trial  Mercury 3  in mid 2017  in Europe to support filings there  The trial will be a non inferiority trial comparing Roclatan to prescribed fixed dose combination of Ganfort  a combination of the bimatoprost along with timolol   marketed by Allergan   NYSE AGN   in Europe 
Our Take
The wider than expected loss in the first quarter was disappointing  Nevertheless  we are encouraged by the company s efforts in developing its pipeline candidates  With a number of upcoming data readouts lined up for the upcoming quarters  we expect investors to remain focused on further updates by the company 
Zacks Rank   Key Pick
Aerie currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A better ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Infinity Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ INFI   which currently carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
Infinity  loss estimates narrowed to  1 03 from  1 43 for 2017 over the past 60 days  The company recorded a positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters  the average being 36 64  Its share price increased 43 7  year to date

105921,327436,AGN,Ironwood  IRWD  Q1 Loss Wider Than Expected  Sales Miss,opinion,Ironwood Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ IRWD   reported first quarter 2017 adjusted loss of 33 cents per share  significantly wider than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 19 cents and the year ago loss of 8 cents  Total revenue  collaborative revenues  in the quarter amounted to  52 2 million  down 20 9  from the year ago period and also below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  72 million  In the last year quarter  the company received a milestone payment of  15 million from Astellas for the development of Linzess to treat adults with IBS C in Japan Ironwood s shares lost 1  on May 8  2017  following the earnings release  A look at the company s share price movement shows that the stock has underperformed the Zacks classified  industry this year so far  Ironwood s shares gained 2 9  during this period  while the industry registered an increase of 5 4  The Quarter in DetailAs reported by partner Allergan plc   NYSE AGN    Ironwood s key marketed product   Linzess   generated U S  net sales of  147 6 million  down 15  sequentially but up 7 7  year over Please note that Ironwood and Allergan have an equal share in brand collaboration profits or losses  Ironwood s share of the net profits from the sales of Linzess in the U S   included in collaborative revenues  was  49 5 million in the first quarter  down 21 2  sequentially According to data provided by IMS Health  Linzess prescriptions filled during the quarter crossed 700 000  up 17  from the year ago period Differences in trade buying patterns  which resulted in destocking of approximately  20 million in inventory during the first quarter  drove sales and prescription growth of Linzess During the reported quarter  selling and administrative  SG A  expenses increased 53 6  to  55 6 million  primarily due to investments for the launch of Zurampic Research and development  R D  expenses were  33 7 million  up 6  from the year ago period due to costs associated with pipeline development Other UpdatesLinzess is currently approved in the U S  for the treatment of adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation  IBS C  290 mcg  and chronic idiopathic constipation  CIC  145 mcg   Ironwood and Allergan are looking to broaden Linzess  label by expanding the targeted patient population and gaining approval for additional indications This January  the FDA approved a 72 mcg dose of Linzess for the treatment of adults with CIC  The new dose was introduced in Mar 2017  Approval for this lower dose strength would boost prescriptions in the large  heterogeneous adult CIC patient population  In Dec 2016  Ironwood announced positive top line data from a phase IIb study evaluating a colonic formulation of Linzess  Data from the study showed that the colonic formulation led to improvements in pain relief over Linzess  supporting the advancement of the colonic formulation to phase III development in 2017 Allergan has a deal with Astellas for Linzess in Japan  In China  Hong Kong and Macau  Ironwood has an agreement with AstraZeneca plc   NYSE AZN   for Linzess  The drug received

be completed in the first quarter of 2018 Zurampic  Ironwood s second commercial product for the treatment of uncontrolled gout  was launched in Oct 2016 Zurampic raked in sales of  0 3 million in the quarter  Zurampic prescriptions filled during the quarter were 900  higher than 371 prescriptions filled in the previous quarter  At the call  management said that it expects slow uptake of the drug in 2017  The company also expects sales to be nominal as it works on educating physicians and patients as well as secure payer access This year  Ironwood expects to launch Duzallo  the fixed dose combination of Zurampic and allopurinol  The new drug application for Duzallo was accepted by the FDA for review in January this year  The PDUFA date is in the second half of 2017 and the drug is expected to be launched in late 2017  If approved  Duzallo would become the first dual mechanism treatment for patients with uncontrolled gout 2017 GuidanceThe company continues to expect to use less than  100 million for operations in 2017  much higher than the 2016 levels  This is due to the full year of commercial expenses related to the launch of Zurampic and to support the launch of Duzallo and pipeline advancement The company also maintained its R D expenses and SG A expenses guidance for 2017 in the range of  145  160 million and  235  250 million  respectively Ironwood Pharmaceuticals

105937,327452,AGN,Pharma Industry Outlook   February March 2017,opinion,"There is no doubt that 2016 was a tough year for pharma and biotech stocks  with the sector facing a lot of criticism for rising drug prices  Although shares did rally post election in November on hopes that drug pricing would not be a key focus area under a Trump presidency  the rally turned out to be short lived following the President s views regarding drug pricing  Trump made it clear that he does not like what happened to drug prices and he will bring them down 
Not just drug pricing  2016 was also disappointing from an R D perspective with a fewer number drugs managing to gain FDA approval  There were some high profile pipeline failures as well  Other factors that weighed on the sector include mixed results  slower than expected new product launches and increasing competition 
The impact of these issues resulted in the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declining 19 1  in 2016 while the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index fell 9 7  
Is the Sector Set for a Rebound in 2017 
So far in 2017 the sector is showing signs of recovery with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gaining 5 1  while the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up 7 3   New product sales ramp up  R D success and innovation  strong results  FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products are some of the factors that could contribute to a sustained recovery in the sector  Tax reforms as well as cash repatriation would support a recovery as well 
Valuation Looks Slightly Stretched 
Going by the current price to earnings multiple  which is often used to value drug stocks  the pharmaceutical industry doesn t look attractive at this point  The industry is currently trading at a P E multiple of 18 69 which is close to the S P 500 P E multiple of 18 71  Moreover  when compared to the industry s own performance over the last year  it can be seen that the multiple is close to the industry high of 20 01  So investors might not be keen to pay more premium to invest in this industry 
Drug Pricing Will Remain a Concern
Drug pricing  which was a key source of concern last year  will remain a headline risk in 2017 as well  Right now  there is low visibility on how this issue will play out  While it is clear that the government intends to address the drug pricing issue  there is no clarity on what steps will be taken 
Will M As Pick Pace in 2017 
While there were not too many acquisitions in 2016  expectations are that M A activities will pick up this year  So far in 2017  there has been limited M A activity with Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ  announcing its intention to acquire Actelion for  30 billion and a few bolt on deals being announced by other companies  However  expectations are high that M As will increase as the year progresses    potential tax reform and cash repatriation are expected to lead to a boost in this area    
Several pharma companies are focusing on in licensing mid to late stage pipeline candidates that look promising  instead of developing a product from scratch  which involves a lot of funds and time  Small biotech companies are open to such deals  with most of them finding it challenging to raise cash  thereby making it difficult to survive and continue with the development of promising pipeline candidates  Therefore  it makes sense to seek deals with pharma companies sitting on huge piles of cash 
Divestment of Non Core Assets   Restructuring Activities
Another trend being witnessed is the divestment of non core business segments  Companies like Pfizer  NYSE PFE   PFE   UCB  Novartis  Sanofi  PA SASY   Valeant  Glaxo  GSK  and AstraZeneca have all been a part of this trend  The monetization of non core assets allows these companies to focus on their areas of expertise 
Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large pharma companies look to cut costs and streamline operations  Most of these companies are re evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs with an unfavorable risk benefit profile 
New Products Should Gain Traction
Highly awaited new products that gained approval over the last couple of years should contribute significantly to revenues  Key new products include Ibrance  cancer   Cosentyx  psoriasis   PCSK9 inhibitors   Repatha and Praluent  Cotellic  advanced melanoma   Lartruvo  soft tissue carcinoma   Exondys 51  Duchenne muscular dystrophy   Tecentriq  urothelial cancer   and Taltz  moderate to severe plaque psoriasis   among others  The FDA also expanded the label of cancer drugs like Kyprolis  Imbruvica and Xalkori 
Biosimilars Gaining Importance
With the FDA approving the first biosimilar in the U S   Zarxio  a biosimilar version of Amgen s  AMGN  blockbuster drug  Neupogen   the floodgates have opened  While biosimilars have been available in the EU for quite a while  there was no regulatory pathway for biosimilars in the U S  The second biosimilar to gain approval in the U S  was Pfizer and Celltrion s Inflectra  infliximab dyyb  with the reference product being Remicade 
This was followed by the FDA approval of biotech giant Amgen s Amjevita  adalimumab atto   Amjevita is approved for use in all eligible indications of the reference product  AbbVie Humira  adalimumab   which is used for a wide range of inflammatory diseases 
And then there is Lilly  LLY  and Boehringer Ingelheim s Basaglar  which while technically not approved as a biosimilar  is a  follow on  insulin glargine product approved through an abbreviated approval pathway    Basaglar was found to be sufficiently similar to Sanofi s Lantus to scientifically justify reliance  and to establish its safety and efficacy for the approved uses 
Biosimilars should cut healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments  According to information provided by Express Scripts  about  250 billion could be saved in the next decade  2014   2024  if biosimilars for 11 products including Neupogen  Avastin  Epogen  Humira  Neulasta  Remicade and Rituxan are approved  According to the company  Neupogen biosimilars alone represent potential savings of about  5 7 billion 
Apart from Novartis and Pfizer  companies like Merck  MRK   Amgen  Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  and Allergan  NYSE AGN   AGN  are targeting the highly lucrative biosimilars market  While all these companies are Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  you can see  
How Did the Sector Fare in Q4 Earnings Season 
As of Feb 17  2017  83 3  of the Medical sector had reported results with earnings growing 4 8  on revenue growth of 5 3  from the year ago period  While the earnings beat ratio was 80   the revenue beat ratio was 53 3   Medical is one of the standout sectors among the 16 Zacks sectors 
Meanwhile  a look at consensus earnings expectations from the Zacks  report shows that the Medical sector will deliver earnings growth of 5 5  and revenue growth of 5 4  in 2017 
While new products should start contributing significantly and increased pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should increase confidence in the sector  challenges remain in the form of currency headwinds  additional competition  slowdown in growth of mature products and loss of exclusivity for certain key drugs 
Zacks Industry Rank
Within the Zacks Industry classification  pharma and biotech are broadly grouped into the Medical sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  and further sub divided into four industries at the expanded level  large cap pharma  med biomed gene  med drugs and med generic drugs 
We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry 
As a point of reference  the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank  88 and lower is  Positive   between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and  177 and higher is  Negative  
The Zacks Industry Rank for Large Cap Pharmaceuticals is  169   196 for Medical Generic Drugs   156 for Medical Biomedical and Genetics and  103 for Medical Drugs  Analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different medical segments  it is obvious that the outlook is Neutral for Large Cap Pharmaceuticals  Medical Drugs and Medical Biomedical and Genetics while Negative for Medical Generic Drugs

105938,327453,AGN,Paratek Pharmaceuticals Shares Shoot Up Positive Late Stage Study,opinion,"Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ PRTK 
Paratek Pharmaceuticals  Inc   PRTK   a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company yesterday announced positive top line results from its phase 3 study of Omadacycline  Omadacycline is used to treat skin  respiratory and other infections  The drug has already received fast track status by the FDA and is hoping to secure FDA approval for the treatment by first quarter 2018 
Paratek Pharmaceuticals  Inc  CEO s Comments

 This successful study demonstrates the potential of omadacycline to treat community acquired bacterial pneumonia  a significant and serious health issue   said Michael Bigham  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Paratek   This Phase 3 study in pneumonia along with our previously announced successful Phase 3 study in skin infections satisfy the regulatory filing requirements of our special protocol assessment with the FDA  We look forward to sharing these data with the FDA and EMA  Our plan is to submit our NDA in the U S  as early as the first quarter of 2018 with an EMA submission later in 2018   

PRTK Technical Analysis

PRTK opened trading yesterday at  19 25 which was exactly the same as the previous day s trading close  Shares closed trading yesterday at  18 60 and spiked up after market to  24 70  equivalent to a 33  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time PRTK traded above these levels we have to go back to September 24th  2015 when it traded at  25 83 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike up PRTK had already been in an overall upward trend dating back to November 1st  2016 when it traded at  10 40  PRTK has a float of 18 02 million shares and traded 4 23 times the normal daily trading volume on Monday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see PRTK open trading on Friday above  22 50 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell especially if it trades below the lower   My stop loss would be  0 30 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

Overnight in Asia  however  major indices were up  the Shanghai Composite rose 0 17  to 3 115 33  while the Nikkei edged 0 03  higher  to 19 403 06  The Hang Seng was closed for Christmas 
European markets have fluctuated within a small  two percent range for the past two weeks  In early trading  the DAX is up 0 16  to 11 468 50 while the Stoxx 50 is 0 09  higher  at 3 277  The FTSE is closed until tomorrow 
US markets have been the most tightly range bound for the past two weeks  with the Dow  NASDAQ  and S P 500 all within an approximate span of     one percent  That doesn t appear to be changing today  In pre market trading  the S P is up just 0 01  while the NASDAQ is up 0 02   The Dow is 0 03  lower 
US Treasury yields moved sideways last week in narrow ranges as well  Yield for the 2 year bond note is currently at 1 218   the 10 year yield is at 2 553   and the 30 year yield is 3 132   With the yield arrow currently pointing up for all three of these Treasury Bonds  technical indicators  chart below  favor additional near term increases  The 2 year note especially is currently at levels previously seen in 2008 

Despite the recent uptick  bond yields are still at historically low levels

Much like the equity markets  currency trading has also tailed off during the holiday period  The range for USD JPY has grown smaller with each passing day  The pair is currently trading at 117 30 
Once this period of consolidation ends  the US dollar will likely resume its bullish trajectory versus the yen and move towards 118 again 

The British pound has been struggling since the Fed raised rates  Currently at  1 2276  it could fall further still when its current consolidation phase completes  The next downside target is  1 2182  upside target is  1 241 

The euro has weakened yet more since the US election  it s fallen off approximately six and a half cents  Divergent monetary policy should continue to weigh on the single currency 
Much like the yen and GBP  once FX trading picks up after the holidays  more downward movement for the EUR is likely  Many analysts expect EUR USD to reach parity  possibly as early as the beginning of next year  One analyst even makes the case for a lower low  Indeed  with most EUR USD crashes since 2008 experiencing 20  25  declines  a downside correction from the most recent high of  1 16 would land the euro squarely in the  0 85  0 95 area 

Thus far today  the dollar has made small gains against a basket of currencies  The US Dollar Index currently sits at 103 02 
Amongst the major currencies today  only the Aussie has gained against the greenback  as of this writing

Gold is up one percent this morning  to  1 145 45  However  it s been in a straight downward decline for the past seven weeks straight 
The precious metal has endured seven consecutive  bearish weeks previously the last time from June 22 August 3  2015 when prices were approximately  1 090 ounce  This current bearish downleg  however  is unique in that each week the yellow metal experienced a lower close than the week before  At this point  a move toward  1 080  1 050 is not out of the question  An upside move could see gold rise to  1 170

Last month  for the first time in eight years  OPEC actually behaved like a cartel  and promised to cut oil production by 1 2 billion bpd  Selected non OPEC nations joined the agreement several days later  The deal is slated to take effect at the beginning of the New Year and extend through the first half of 2017  If the nations that agreed to the deal can actually comply by limiting production  this arrangement could potentially keep oil prices buoyed until the US s  the peak demand period for the commodity 
On occasion markets will react to breaking news  particularly when it relates to oil  but traders appear to be unfazed by the latest out of Russia  where yesterday it was announced that a 2017 production increase should be expected  As Russian Deputy Energy Minister Kirill Molodtsov  

 Supposedly 253 5  million tons of oil are expected to be exported from Russia  this year  which is 4 8 percent more than in 2015  In 2017  we will have a little more than this

Banking stocks  regional and general  are essentially unchanged on the year as the yield curve is roughly flat since January 1  That leaves Retail  Food and Beverage  and Pharmaceutical stocks as the only industries that are trading down by more than 1  so far this year  The first two are tied to the consumer and based on the recent improvements in consumer confidence figures  these stocks will likely need a run of persistently below expectation economic data to fall much further relative to the overall market 
The underperformance in Pharmaceutical stocks has an obvious culprit  a few weeks ago  then President elect Donald Trump noted in his first news conference that the pharmaceutical industry was  getting away with murder  and that  Pharma has a lot of lobbies  a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power  And there s very little bidding on drugs   Based on this rhetoric and the potential for new regulations on the industry  one of the few that may actually face increasing regulation under the Trump administration   we believe that pharmaceuticals will continue to face major headwinds in the coming months  As a possible counterpoint  It s worth noting that Trump s Health Czar nominee  Tom Price  has previous connections to  Big Pharma  and may be more lenient than some bears fear

The new stores come equipped with innovative technology  a modern look that appeals to millennials and most importantly lower prices  a concept that once escaped the Whole Foods brand  Many of its initiatives intend to stave off competition from traditional supermarkets like Kroger  NYSE KR  and non traditional ones like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Walmart  NYSE WMT  and Costco  NASDAQ COST

Various digital initiatives such as mobile ordering along with the frequent menu updates  that often include healthier items  aim to boost comps  That said  a number of near term headwinds post a legitimate threat to financial performance  including weak currency translation  volatile consumer spending  and macroeconomic uncertainty 
Grubhub Inc  NYSE GRUB   Strong marketing efforts and ongoing initiatives to improve delivery networks helps Grubhub    gain traction in areas outside of major cities and also strengthens its competitive advantage  While the company holds an advantage in the space  the business model requires huge volumes to generate meaningful profits 
If Grubhub is unable to secure more volume on a sound pricing strategy  this will put pressure on financial performance  Meanwhile  competition continues to emerge from the most likely sources  including threats from Amazon and Uber 
Allergan  NYSE AGN   Revenue for the quarter is predicated on new product launches  international growth and progression of established products like Botox  Earnings  on the other hand  will reflect operating expense management and a lower share count  Analysts expect new products like Viberzi and Vraylar to maintain the upward trend started during the third quarter 
On the downside  a slew of Allergan s    legacy products face threats from genericization  a problem that continues to hurt sales in the pharmaceutical space  The handful of acquisitions Allergan made during the quarter should offset some of the lost sales from generic competition 
iRobot Corporation  NASDAQ IRBT   iRobot s    line of cleaning products continues to gain traction on the back of a steadily improving consumer spending environment  Analysts believe strategic marketing initiatives coupled with new product launches and international expansion will support strong results moving forward  But the company still faces several near term threats  including currency headwinds  slowing demand and macroeconomic uncertainty ",2017-02-08,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-that-report-earnings-tomorrow-200175007,200175007

Given these conditions  traders might very well react strongly to decisive market changes in either direction  if markets go markedly higher  profit taking would certainly occur  conversely  a greater than 1  drop could see traders using the opportunity to enter new positions  For now though  despite the uncertainty  there are those who advise not betting against the S P 500 just yet

105990,327505,AGN,Here s Why Teva Pharmaceutical s  TEVA  Stock Is Down Today,opinion,"Shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries   NYSE TEVA   slipped over 5 8  in morning trading Tuesday after the company announced a change in upper level management  Teva is replacing the chief executive of its global generics group  Siggi Olafsson  with Dipankar Bhattacharjee  the current chief of its European generics group 
Going Through Changes
Bhattacharjee  who has served as CEO of Teva Generics Europe since 2013  will take over immediately  while Olafsson will step down and remain active in the company until retiring at the end of the first quarter of 2017 
Teva s generic medicines business has already undergone significant changes this year  as the company purchased Allergan s   NYSE AGN   Actavis generics group back in August  Nevertheless  heading into Tuesday  shares of TEVA were down nearly 45  on the year  The company has struggled with lagging revenues  and the entire generics industry has felt the pressure of a Justice Department probe 
Recent Challenges
Teva recently reported its third quarter financial results  and although its earnings came in a penny higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  quarterly revenues missed expectations by nearly  300 million  The company also cut its outlook for the remainder of 2016  Also read    
Investors have also been weary as the Department of Justice  DoJ  looks ready to file price collusion charges against several companies engaged in the generic drugs business  The DoJ investigation has been ongoing for several years and covers more than 12 companies and about 24 drugs 
Companies that have reportedly received subpoenas include Teva  Mylan   NASDAQ MYL    Impax Laboratories   NASDAQ IPXL    and Endo International   NASDAQ ENDP    among others 
Bottom Line
It s interesting to see Teva s stock sliding today  as some investors might think a changeup at the top is exactly what the company needs right now  However  it s safe to say that most investors aren t responding positively to what is a new batch of uncertainty thrown into an already volatile situation

106022,327537,AGN,5 Reasons To Buy 5 Low P E Biotech ETFs ,opinion,"With Trump winning the U S  presidential election  the biotech and pharma sectors have regained their lost ground  Since Clinton   who has long been vocal against the price gouging issue in the pharma sector   is no more threat to the sector  pharma and biotech stocks should get a break from controversies  at least for some time 
As a result  biotech ETFs soared in the last five trading sessions  as of November 10  2016   returning in the range of 15 8 26   read    
An end to the price gouging issue is perhaps the key driver of the latest biotech rally  However  four other factors elaborated below may also have been instrumental in setting biotech and pharma stocks northbound for the days to come  read    
Cheaper Valuation 
The sector  which has long been an investors  favorite and saw an enormous run from late 2011 till summer 2015  has lost its luster from the year to date look  The risk off sentiments prevalent in the early part of 2016 hit this high beta high growth area  As a result  despite rebounding massively in recent times  the biotech ETF SPDR S P Biotech ETF  is off about 6  this year  as of November 10  2016   read  
Investors should also note that such a steep sell off brought down the once sizzling hot biotech space to a calmer valuation  XBI has a P E ratio of 16 56 times versus SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  s   AX SPY   P E of 17 73 
Same was the case for pharma ETFs which are off 7 8 18  so far this year  But SPDR S P Pharmaceuticals ETF   HN XPH   has a P E of 12 92 times  though other pharma ETFs are still richly valued  If we look at the overall medical sector  P E ratio of the S P 500 stands at  times for next year while the medical sector s is at 15 4 times  as per the Earnings Trends issued on November 9  2016 
Earnings Picture 
Now it is time to look at the earnings picture  The medical sector has logged 6 3  earnings growth in Q3 on 7 3  higher revenues  Notably  so far  revenue growth is the second highest in the 16 major sectors classified under the S P 500 index 
Lower Corporate Taxes in the Cards 
As per an article published on   corporate tax reform and cash access may facilitate biotech stocks and ETFs ahead  In his campaign  Trump indicated that he will reduce corporate tax to 15  and provide a one time repatriation holiday of 10   This lower tax rate would do wonders for big biotech companies like Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  which can see EPS rising by about 10   as per the article 
Smaller cap biotech firms would be especially benefited as they are so cash stripped that their present cash holdings can fund just 11 months of research  as per Reuters 
Wave of Mergers   Acquisitions 
This new found source of cash would help several biotech companies to indulge in merger and acquisition activities  In any case  the space was known for inorganic growth  Although Allergan Plc   NYSE AGN   announced back to back takeover deals in late September and Pfizer Inc   NYSE PFE   announced its  14 billion acquisition of cancer drugmaker Medivation in August  deals have cooled down  off 65  year over year  in the sector lately  read    
 see  renewed interest in some prime targets of takeover speculation  from cancer drug specialists like Tesaro to rare diseases firms like Sarepta Therapeutics   Moreover  the sector s valuation is subdued at present  opening door for acquisitions at cheaper prices

106025,327540,AGN,5 Stocks To Watch That Report Earnings Tomorrow,opinion,"Teva Pharmaceutical  NYSE TEVA   Teva is in a position of strength heading into its third quarter report thanks to the results of the election and a continued shift towards generics  Teva recently purchased Allergan s generics brand for  500 million and Actavis Generics  NYSE AGN  in August   both of which are expected to help support top line growth moving forward  Analysts expected revenue to grow by 24  this quarter as it strengthens its position in the generic market  Teva is also seeing traction in its branded segment which features speaclity products such as Copaxane for use in treating multiple sclerosis  Weakness in international generic markets  particularly in the EU  will put partially offset the positive initiatives of the quarter 
Agilent Technologies  NYSE A  Agilent broad portfolio of products ranging from forensics to pharmaceuticals have performed remarkably well in recent quarters  In the second quarter the company delivered better than expected performance which featured 11  growth on the bottom line and 3  on the top  The company s three core reporting segments were up between 4  to 8  and helped deliver results above its previous guidance range  Agilent s continued focus on high growth markets through product launches are considered positives for moving forward 
JD Com  NASDAQ JD   Shares are trading down 27  this year on the back of decelerating revenue growth and plummeting profitability  JD com operates in a highly concetrated Chinese ecommerce space that is currently dominated by Alibaba and its subsidiares  That said  JD is proving that it can compete in this environment as it continued to see active users and order fulfillment growth  Consistent market initiatives have been placed to ensure long term growth and increase brand awareness  Meanwhile  a strategic product mix and expanded fulfillment capabilities are helping to drive traffic trends and support the top line  JD recently launched its commercial drone delivery service during China s annual Single s Day shopping event  Additional efforts like this will help close the gap between Alibaba  NYSE BABA  and hopefully propel the stock higher 
Home Depot  NYSE HD   Low interest rates and a bounceback in the housing market have led to robust earnings in recent quarters  Not only does Home Depot benefit from an increase in new home sales  but as home prices stay high  consumers tend to invest heavily into their properties  Strong job growth has also supported this ongoing trend  allowing consumers to spend on home improvement projects  In the second quarter the home improvement retailer posted a 4 7  increase in comparable sales and 5 4  in United States stores  The company should continue to deliver encouraging results but faces a number of near term headwinds including intense competition and significant international exposure  Besides Lowe s  consumers are starting to look towards online retailers like Amazon for their home improvement needs  This shift to e commerce could have a lasting impact on Home Depot if it is not taken seriously in the immediate future 
Dick s Sporting Goods Inc  NYSE DKS   Dick s has been gaining strength in recent quarters despite a pullback from apparel brands like Nike and Under Armour  Its efforts to expand online capabilities along with strategic marketing and merchandising have helped drive traffic trends and sales  Dick s has also benefited from a consolidation in the industry following the bankruptcy of Sports Authority stores  Dick s now owns the intellectual property and much of the branding of the former retailer  Tomorrow s report is forecasted to maintain its current trajectory but will more importantly shed some light on the pivotal holiday season to be reported in early 2017 ",2016-11-14,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-that-report-earnings-tomorrow-200164605,200164605

106054,327569,AGN,5 Things To Watch When Pfizer Reports Earnings On Tuesday,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE   the global biopharmaceutical company which discovers  develops and manufactures healthcare products  will report Q3 2016 earnings on Tuesday November 1st  before the market opens 


1  Earnings and revenue
Pfizer is expected to report earnings of  0 49 per share alongside  13 03 billion in revenue  Year over year  this would represent growth of about 7 2  in revenue 

2  Breaking Up Is Hard To Do
Over the past few years  Pfizer reorganized its lines of business into two segments  Essential Health  under which most of its legacy drugs such as Lipitor and Viagra operate  and Innovative Health which focuses primarily on new drug development and is currently the fastest growing PFE segment  One of the key strategic decisions Pfizer management made during the past quarter was not to spin off the Innovative Health division into a separate company 
The decision was announced on September 26th after the company spent almost four years  evaluating its options  much to the chagrin of Wall Street analysts who thought that the combined value of two separate companies would be bigger than Pfizer s valuation is today  This is certainly a conservative approach by Pfizer  and will likely hamper Innovative Health s growth  though it will generate a more robust cash flow 

3  Legacy Drugs
Pfizer s two most lucrative drugs last quarter were Prevenar 13 and Lyrica 
Prevenar 13 is a one time vaccine for the prevention of the thirteen most common forms of pneumococcal pneumonia  On its own  Prevenar 13 brought in  1 25 billion just during the last quarter It was first introduced at the end of 2009 in Europe for infants and young children  rolled out to the US in 2010 and in 2013 was approved for use in 120 countries worldwide  At the same time it was approved for non vaccinated children and adolescents as well as adults aged 50 plus  Going forward however  sales of Prevenar 13 are expected to slow given its already extended reach  but the recent approval of the drug for adults aged 18 49 should steady sales for a while 
Lyrica  Pfizer s second biggest blockbuster drug  also brought in a total of  1 25 billion  Lyrica is an anti epileptic drug  slowing down the impulses in the brain that cause seizures  It s also used to treat neuropathic pain  fibromyalgia and certain anxiety disorders  Its revenue is stable and expected to grow in the single digits over the next two years  until the expiration of the Pfizer owned patent on the drug in December 2018 
Pfizer has eight additional major drugs which are each expected to generate a billion dollars in revenue this year  Because patents protect drugs from being copied for a total of 20 years  revenue from any blockbuster drug has a limited lifespan  Thus  for the investor  aside from current revenue generators the upcoming pipeline is as important as if not more important than existing drugs 
4  Building a Healthy Pipeline
Because patents only protect new drugs from copycat products for a total of 20 years  revenue from any blockbuster introduction has a limited lifespan  Thus  for the investor  along with current revenue generators  it s critical to be aware of what a pharmaceutical company also has in its R D pipeline 
In order to keep its top line from stagnating  Pfizer is currently working on two fronts  First  the company invests about  7 billion annually in research and development  with the aim of creating its next best seller 
Ibrance was introduced in early 2015 for treatment of ER   HER2 metastatic breast cancer  Since its initial introduction it s been expanded for use with additional patient populations  Pfizer is also currently working to receive approvals for expansion to other forms of cancer  such as pancreatic cancer  as well  Ibrance is already on pace to make almost a billion dollars this year  but if Pfizer s expansion plans succeed  new markets will open for the drug with additional revenue sources emerging 
Perhaps more significant  Pfizer continues to make strategic acquisitions as an additional way to increase or expand their drug pipelines  At the end of 2015  Pfizer attempted a  160 billion merger with Ireland based Allergan NYSE AGN  which was ultimately scrapped because of changes to US tax rules which made the deal less appealing for the US based pharmaceuticals giant  The deal s cancellation freed up funds for smaller acquisitions 
On September 27th  Pfizer acquired Medivation for  14 billion dollars  This allows Pfizer to add Xtandi  a prostate cancer drug  to its oncological lineup  The Medivation acquisition also brings another important potential drug to the PFE portfolio   Talazoparib   which blocks an enzyme that s integral to cancer cell development  A number of companies such as AstraZeneca  NYSE AZN  and AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  are also working on similar drugs  Talazoparib trials are scheduled to end during June 2017  Though there s no guarantee this new drug will become a blockbuster  chances are good that it might  But even if it doesn t  this sort of acquisition expands Pfizer s offering and its future capabilities 

5  Handsome Dividend
As a result of the drop in Pfizer s stock price over the last few months when it fell from  37 in July to trade around  32 today Pfizer s dividend is worth considering  Over the past four quarters the declared dividend has been 30 cents per quarter  or  1 2 dollars annually  for a yield of 3 75  
Though Pfizer cut its dividend back in 2009 by 50   from 32 cents per quarter to 16 cents  in order to help finance the  68 billion acquisition of Wyeth at that time  the company has been slowly but steadly growing it back  and has regularly increased its payout for the past seven years 
Pfizer s next ex dividend date is November 8th  and it is expected to grow its dividend again by two or three cents  Given expected GAAP earnings of  0 49 and non GAAP earnings of  0 62 for the company this quarter  the payout ceiling is not stretched in any way  In today s yield starved world  a safe and growing dividend from an industry that s always going to be necessary is worth a second look 
Conclusion
Pfizer s P E ratio of 28 is 20  higher than the industry average  which comes in at around 23  Solely by that measure Pfizer would be considered expensive  although its dividend would prevent it from being categorized as totally overpriced  However  when considering different measures such as the Price to Book  where Pfizer compares favorably to peers such as Merck  NYSE MRK  and Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY   with a ratio of 3 to the industry s 3 5  it s obvious there s more to Pfizer than just immediate earnings  Its Free Cash Flow  for example  is a massive  13 billion TTM  33  more than Merck  and its Price to FCF ratio of 15 is less than half the industry average 
Even with its higher P E Pfizer should still be considered a safe investment  And its prospects  especially its oncology portfolio  appear solid enough for yield starved investors to consider the stock  Its recent share price tumble provides a dual opportunity to lock in an attractive dividend yield while potentially returning value on the price itself ",2016-10-31,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-things-to-watch-when-pfizer-reports-earnings-on-tuesday-200161604,200161604

106067,327582,AGN,Buy Healthcare Stocks Now  That All Depends On The Election,opinion,"It is  regrettably  impossible to separate market strategy from the presidential campaign as we approach the Final Days  of the campaign  Of the campaign  It won t be The End of Days no matter who wins and who loses   Bear with me as we wend our way through the opinionated land mines here   
Many voters and investors have been disgusted by Donald Trump s inability to focus on the Big Issues rather than trying to sell us the blather that he is some kind of Boy Scout  And many have been disgusted  but not surprised  by the revelations now in plain view on Wikileaks of the greed and double dealing of Hillary Clinton as she claws her way to reach the presidency  It seems strange that Wall Street didn t at least get a little bit of the jitters  But  then  what am  I saying  It s Wall Street  and they ll only be chagrined if they find their funding failed to buy them the candidate with their interests uppermost in mind 
 We ve all seen  the Real Donald    regrettably  what you see is what you get   but if you are of a curious bent  you might also want to see some of what Hillary Clinton s thoughts  and her staff s  are  by viewing the actual e mails   
I sent a note recently to our clients reading in part 

    The market is steady because 76  of the volume is institutional Wall Street traders  pension funds  etc  No one  except the trial lawyers  of course  has contributed more to Hillary Clinton s campaign than Wall Street so it makes sense that they are cautiously optimistic that they ll get a win for their money 
 But what if  What if they are wrong and Donald Trump actually wins  I expect Wall Street will sell  sell  sell and I want to be ready if that happens  We re now marking time  in securities that are liquid and provide income   just in case   If Ms  Clinton wins  the rally is likely to be underwhelming since most institutional money is already in the market  If Mr  Trump wins  we want to be there to pick the newly low hanging fruit  We ll see  

If you d like to see my logic in thinking this might just happen  whether you agree or not  you are welcome to visit my new national and global affairs blog and look at the most recent entry   Election 2016   You ll find it at  
So the first Wednesday in November could prove to be a real yawner  or it could see a 500 point move  or moves  in one  or more  directions  I maintain this is no time to become overly fearful or overly excited about a particular sector or security but  rather  a time to do research and have cash ready to pounce upon any irrational over reaction 
How  specifically  might the market landscape change based upon which of the two least popular most voted for candidates becomes the next chief executive of our country 
In thinking about this  we may  thankfully  leave the realm of character and personality  and may consider instead the likely policy changes each candidate might pursue upon their election 
I have always made money buying the best gas and oil companies  along with their contractors and equipment suppliers  when they are really out of favor  I d like to be able to do so again 
But if Ms  Clinton ascends to the office  I may have to wait a while longer to buy them  as cheap may well become cheaper  She will likely advocate continuing subsidies for more solar and wind companies  The current administration s subsidization of solar and other renewable energy in the U S  has totaled just under  200 billion the past 5 years  These subsidies have done little to increase the contribution of solar power to the grid as it is still expected to comprise just 0 6 percent of electricity generation this year 
These subsidies haven t done much to generate power  they have  however  increased the money sloshing around for  pay for play  favoritism  I imagine a Clinton presidency would continue the current policy of support for massive federally funded projects  I would also want to consider that horizontal fracturing might be outlawed  and offshore and onshore drilling sharply curtailed  The Saudis would pay dearly to see such a scenario 
If Mr  Trump is elected  who knows what will happen  He has exhibited a mercurial bent since the campaigning began  and long before   But I believe he believes his own promise to put Americans back to work in real jobs again and therefore it is likely that we would see a resurgence in American gas and oil exploration and production  along with continued renewables research  in order to make America as energy independent as possible while creating those jobs  This might not please Saudi Arabia quite as much  In this case  I would look to move into the best domestic gas   oil companies immediately  buying those most currently depressed with the best prospects for success   Indeed we have already begun nibbling at Southwestern Energy  NYSE SWN  
In terms of another favored sector of mine  the banking  insurance and brokerage industries  we know that Ms  Clinton at least  says  she favors more regulation and wants to expand the long arm of Dodd Frank even more intrusively  Given the funding she has received from Wall Street  we might take her instinct for more and more regulation and contrast it with the biggest firms  desire to see less regulation  It will be interesting to see which wins out  her public platform or private promises 
Mr  Trump  on the other hand  says he would shrink the reach of Dodd Frank  but still believes that financial regulation of the biggest and baddest is necessary  For those who want to see the stock market as a Big Casino  a vote for Ms  Clinton would likely be a vote for keeping low rates for longer  For those who would rather save than spend  an increase in rates would be most welcome  Mr  Trump is likely to appoint a Fed Chair focused on normalization of rates shortly after he enters the office 
Looking at another of my favorite sectors  healthcare  Ms  Clinton is a rock solid advocate of the Affordable Care Act  Obamacare   She believes more government intervention is the solution to its current ills and has said larger subsidies supported by taxpayers are necessary to make certain that everyone is covered  regardless of lifestyle  medical history  or personal provision for care 
Managed care companies and hospitals would certainly like to see this  though Ms  Clinton s belief is that firms that do the research  clinical trials  etc   like biotech and pharmaceutical companies  are merely price gougers  These firms are unlikely to do well in a Clinton presidency 
Mr  Trump has vowed to repeal Obamacare and shift more responsibility as well as funding to the states  Without Obamacare  the number of insured enrollees may drop or rise  if the individual states do a better job of working with their own health care providers and insurers 
Under either president  I think healthcare firms have been hammered down enough over the past year  down 9 06    more than any other sector  that smart selections among the various sub sectors are likely to be profitable as long as we think as investors  not traders  months  not weeks 

Since health care has been so bloodied and battered this year  I m considering placing a preliminary toe in the water  Here are two of my favorites 
An Opportunity in Generic Drug Firms 
According to the Generic Pharmaceutical Association  generic drugs account for 88 percent of prescriptions dispensed in the U S A  The industry has been consolidating over the past few years  led by Israel based Teva  NYSE TEVA   which made a  40 5 billion acquisition of Actavis from previous parent Allergan  NYSE AGN  just two months ago 
But now these purveyors of cheaper versions of patented drugs coming off patent protection have a new problem  U S  prosecutors have just announced a comprehensive criminal investigation into suspected price collusion among some of the major generics manufacturers  The investigation began about two years ago and has now gone to a grand jury  The grand jury is being asked to decide if there is enough evidence that some senior executives agreed to raise prices on certain drugs to pursue formal charges  About two dozen generic drugs seem to be part of the inquiry  Firms receiving subpoenas include Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   Teva  Allergan  Lannett Com  NYSE LCI  and seven others 
The DoJ must believe they have good reason to pursue  this isn t just a civil case where the perpetrators  companies are fined  penalizing mostly the shareholders  This one is a criminal investigation  which means they have had to gather enough evidence to get warrants from a judge and to ensure compulsory discovery of evidence  There is  apparently  a carrot offered along with this stick   an amnesty program for those willing to cooperate with the investigation 
It s likely that the first charges could be filed as early as next month  As the biggest generics firm  Teva in particular may be on the hot seat  In May  Allergan received a DOJ subpoena requesting information about its generics business  As a result of its recent acquisition of Actavis  Allergan s potential liability has been transferred to Teva 
This bombshell created panic selling of all these firms last week  yet there is no indication looking at the history of such investigations that  a  criminal charges are actually warranted   b  that they will successfully prosecute and  c  that the fines and other punishments would be enough to warrant the nearly 10  selloff in TEVA shares 
Without trying to second guess the DoJ s motives or the strength of its case  I view the opportunity to nibble at TEVA shares anytime I can get them below  40 a share a gift  While price fixing schemes have been a top priority of the Antitrust Division  each company must still be presumed innocent until proven guilty 
Even if charges are successfully filed and some firms found guilty  I don t think the best of these generics manufacturers will go much lower than they already have  Let s take a closer look at Teva as well as a non generic  Novo Nordisk  NYSE NVO  

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
We owned Israel headquartered TEVA in our Growth   Value Portfolio years ago before the healthcare sector went into  first  a fearful reaction anticipating what the passage of Obamacare might do to these shares  then a full fledged rout as the reality of how bad those effects would be  Here s what I like anew about TEVA at these prices 
First  they are the biggest fish in this rather large and growing pond  Acquiring Actavis  and selling off some other UK and Irish holdings in order to get EU approval for the Actavis deal  may bite them in the short term if there was any price fixing before the takeover but long term  the buy solidifies TEVA s  1 position worldwide 
Second  no matter what the short term results are of the DoJ probe  let s be realistic  generic drugs  at 88  of all prescriptions filled  are part of the solution to rising healthcare costs  not part of the problem  As the biggest in the business  TEVA has the research depth  manufacturing prowess  and economies of scale to outperform the rest of the generics marketplace  Their chart below shows where TEVA sees the coming growth in the generics market   and has positioned itself to dovetail perfectly with these trends 

Next  it is important to understand that TEVA s expansive and cutting edge research laboratories allow them to be more nimble than its many competitors  more often than not they will be the  first to file  when a popular or important drug goes off patent  In the U S  alone  TEVA has more than 300 current generic filings with the FDA  the majority of which are so called  1st Wave  opportunities while an additional third are even more coveted  first to file  generics 
The FDA has made its view on first to file generics clear  indicating that it considers such applications  public health priorities  that are deemed important because they are  increasing patient access   These filings the FDA tries to provide a decision on within just 15 months  TEVA is targeting 80 new generic applications in the USA for 2017 
Part of TEVA s strength comes from the integration of their various pieces  This company is not  just  a quick and capable generics manufacturer  They also have developed their own specialty pharmaceuticals that  ironically  they must defend against their fellow generics makers as well 
In fact  TEVA currently gets almost 50  of its revenue from its Specialty Pharma business and the biggest chunk of that comes from the company s MS drug Copaxone  A number of competitors are clamoring to create their own generic version of Copaxone  Even if they were to succeed  however  it is unlikely TEVA would face generic competition until at least sometime in 2018  It will take that long  after a court decision is rendered  for competitors to get their own product FDA approved  By then I think that TEVA s other products in their Specialty Pharma pipeline  like their joint venture with Regeneron  NASDAQ REGN  for a promising osteoarthritis and chronic back pain drug  will have come to the fore 
This research and development capability allows TEVA to understand first hand the process of ethical drug development and to see their world from both sides of the fence 
Finally  TEVA sets itself apart by what they have dubbed  New Therapeutic Entities   NTEs  by which they create entirely new treatment modalities based on existing drugs  An example 
A subsidiary of Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  makes Risperidone  used to treat schizophrenia  bipolar mania  and autism  Schizophrenia affects more than 20 million people  Antipsychotics like Risperidone are generally effective for the treatment of schizophrenia  however 75  of patients are non adherent to treatment within 2 years  The economic burden of relapses and re hospitalizations in US alone is north of  62 billion 
The reason for non adherence is likely because it is too difficult to keep up with given current modalities  Current treatments require that the patient visit their doctor or clinic every two weeks  where 17 reconstitution steps are needed to prepare an injection  which must be delivered intramuscularly  TEVA s response  They are currently developing Resperidone LTI  Long Acting Injectible  which allows extended release of the drug which lasts 3 months  requires minimal reconstitution to create in the doctor s office and is delivered subcutaneously rather than via intramuscular injection 
Taking steps like this that could save up to  60 billion  just in the USA alone   which is why I continue to believe that the healthcare sector is worthy of our investment dollars 
P S  I don t have the medical knowledge to comment on each and every twist and turn in FDA filings and relative merits of various drugs or claims and challenges to or by TEVA and its competitors  But if you are particularly interested in this level of detail  Vivian Lewis  editor of  offers a subscription based daily blog featuring dozens of foreign based securities  She follows TEVA  and many others  on a far more frequent basis than anyone I know 
And Now  the Non Generic Health Care Company
Credit where credit is due  Vivian Lewis and I have both owned and recommended TEVA for many years  she continuously and I only when I felt it offered particularly compelling value  But Novo Nordisk has piqued my interest because of her devotion to and analysis of the company and its future prospects  All research that follows is solely my own responsibility  however 
Novo Nordisk is a multinational company headquartered in Bagsvaerd  Denmark  a suburb just outside Copenhagen  that employs more than 42 000 employees in 75 countries around the globe  NVO is the  1 obesity and diabetes care company on the planet  Their other areas of expertise and revenue include hemophilia  growth hormone therapy  and hormone replacement therapy  but diabetes care still comprises more than 80  of NVO s annual revenues 
The reason why Novo has sold off to its 52 week low most recently is mostly that Bernie Sanders and some others in Congress are asking for a DoJ investigation into price fixing of insulin prices by a number of insulin makers  I m not sure why the  1 company would want to collude with its lesser rivals  but then one never knows whether these bombastic diatribes have any evidence behind them or whether they are purely for political grandstanding 
Please note that there is no ongoing investigation that we know of  it is merely the threat from some members of Congress that  in light of Mr  Sanders and Ms  Clinton s portrayal of all health care sector firms as bogeymen  has sent stock prices of the entire industry down 
Certainly the reason wasn t that sales and earnings are in trouble  they were both up this quarter  The company did  however  caution that the expected revenues and earnings  in the various local currencies they do business in  to be lower in the coming quarter  More likely  Novo s shift to greater R D spending rather than resting on their laurels with current products has some analysts concerned  as analysts always are  about the next 12 weeks  They should be  Novo is taking a giant step forward that may cost them in the short term 
Managed care providers and others in the prescribing and paying chain are simply not willing to pay a penny more for drugs that barely improve efficacy  They are looking for leapfrog improvements  Novo s response has been to apply a much higher threshold for new diabetes products and to heighten its focus on related medical issues like cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease 
As part of this change  NVO is dropping any further research into their oral insulin project  which they now describe as  not commercially viable in the increasingly challenging payer environment   Instead  they have redoubled their efforts in the much more promising Oral GLP 1 diabetes treatment  We know that obesity management can be used to delay or even prevent pre diabetes and type 2 diabetes  However  it s often simply not possible for the obese to lose weight on their own through diet and exercise  Novo s GLP 1 medications  including oral semaglutide  have been shown to be effective at aiding in weight loss  This alone could be a serious contributor to Novo s new revenue stream  Not to mention that oral GLP 1 has shown very early signs of possibly being effective in treating both cardiovascular and Alzheimer s diseases 
Add to this Novo s FDA approval this year for its new long lasting insulin Tresiba  That puts Novo yet another step ahead of its nearest competitor  The company has filed for regulatory approval of faster acting insulin in the US and the EU for the treatment of type 1 and 2 diabetes as well as for Xultophy  which lowers blood sugar  Milestones like these continue to lengthen the distance between Novo and its competitors and indicate a bright future 
The risks are there  of course  but Novo seems to have understood the risks and taken steps to address them  Those risks include a stagnant pricing posture for current insulin as more biosimilars come to market  lower margins on oral insulin  the need to secure higher capability treatments  and the usual political kerfuffles every time a drug company saves the nation billions in healthcare expense and actually expects to be compensated fairly for their time and expertise 
I see Novo s risks as either known and being dealt with or  in other cases  of short term interest only  The only thing that keeps me from buying both TEVA and NVO with both hands is the chance of a landslide victory by Ms  Clinton that also gives control of both the House and Senate to those who share her beliefs  Many of these Congresspersons think a single payer government health care plan reliant upon government R D  shunting aside the contributions of for profit competitors  is best for the nation 
Even then  I think TEVA and NVO will do quite nicely beyond US borders  Still  I m holding fire for the most part  While I m happy to own either of these fine companies at their current prices  I ll be even happier if I can buy them for less  The odds of a stacked Senate and a stacked house are remote  but just in case   
The reason I prefaced my remarks about these two fine firms with a political analysis of what might result for them is because   you re darn right  politics affects our investing decisions  Let s just hope they don t muck it up too badly 
In summary  if Mr  Trump should pull off a win  I would expect everything in the U S  markets to plunge briefly as Wall Street realizes their bull has been gored  As a result I m holding off buying  hoping for an even better entry point  until Wednesday  November 9 anyway  But I do believe that some energy and many financials are the best place to be in the longer run after the election  with healthcare added if the House and Senate remain independent bodies from the executive branch  Even so  I will be a buyer of TEVA below 35 and NVO below 30 
What I will buy right now  today  are three floating rate mutual funds  Whoever gains the presidency  rates will rise  After considerable research  I conclude that Federated Floating Rate  FFRSX  T  Rowe Floating Rate  PRFRX  and Lord Abbott Floating Rate  LFRAX  are the best in the sector  with Invesco Dynamic Credit  NYSE VTA  and First Trust Senior Loan  NASDAQ FTSL  the two best ETFs  I have seen nothing to convince me that  passive investing  via ETFs performs better in down markets than active intelligent investing  so I suggest the mutual funds most highly  We are now buying all three mutual funds for ourselves and our clients who seek income

The multi center  randomized  12 week  double blind  placebo controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of erenumab in patients with episodic migraine  Data showed that patients  when treated with erenumab  70 mg   experienced a statistically significant 2 9 day reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days  in comparison to a 1 8 day reduction in the placebo arm at 12 weeks  thereby meeting the primary endpoint of the study  In addition  the safety profile of erenumab was found to be similar to placebo and consistent with previously reported studies 
Currently  additional analyses of these data are in progress and expected to be submitted at a future medical conference and for publication 
AMGEN INC Price   Earlier this year  positive data from a phase II study on erenumab for the prevention of chronic migraine were also announced  Meanwhile  the candidate is also being evaluated in a second phase III episodic migraine study  STRIVE   assessing both 70 mg and 140 mg doses for 24 weeks  The study is anticipated to be completed by the end of this year 
We note that  Amgen is developing erenumab in collaboration with Novartis AG   NYSE NVS    focused on the development and commercialization of treatments for migraine and Alzheimer s disease  For the migraine program  Amgen owns commercialization rights in the U S   Canada and Japan  while Novartis has rights in Europe and Rest of World

106128,327643,AGN,Biotech Mergers Run The Show  5 Small Cap Stocks For Q4,opinion,"Healthcare merger and acquisition activity has gathered steam over the past few years  A few big mergers in the recent past include that of Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE   and Wyeth  Pfizer and Hospira  Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   and Alcon  Sanofi   NYSE SNY   and Genzyme  Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY   and Genentech  and AstraZeneca PLC   NYSE AZN   and MedImmune  Consolidation helps large pharma companies gain more pricing power while simultaneously curbing competition 
Last November  Pfizer announced that it would acquire Allergan  NYSE AGN pa   Plc   NYSE AGN   for  160 billion  However  this deal fell apart in Apr 2016 due to the new U S  tax inversion rules 
There has been a flurry of mergers and acquisitions in the healthcare space this year too  In August  Pfizer announced the acquisition of oncology focused Medivation  Inc    NASDAQ MDVN   for approximately  14 billion  The deal is expected to close this year  This was preceded by the buyout of Anacor in Jun 2016 
Also in June  Shire plc  acquired Baxalta to brace its rare disease portfolio further  while Aegerion Pharmaceuticals  and QLT Inc   entered into a definitive merger agreement to form a new company  Novelion Therapeutics Inc 
In April  Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT   announced plans to buy St  Jude Medical Inc    NYSE STJ   in a move to bolster its share in the cardiovascular device market  In fact  the month of September probably saw higher merger acquisition activity this year  Horizon Pharma plc  announced plans to buy California based Raptor Pharmaceuticals Corp    This acquisition  slated to close in the fourth quarter  is likely to strengthen Horizon s orphan business in the U S  and expand it in Europe and key important markets 
After months of negotiations  German pharmaceutical maker  Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY   last month announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire Monsanto Company  NYSE MON   in an all cash deal worth  66 billion 
Allergan announced a string of small bolt on acquisitions last month  It announced a definitive deal to acquire Tobira Therapeutics  Inc    a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on drugs to treat non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  and other liver diseases at a massive premium of 500   Also  Allergan said it will be acquiring clinical stage biotech company  Vitae  to boost its dermatology pipeline 
Last month  Allergan also bought privately held Akarna Therapeutics to add the latter s lead product candidate AKN 083  a preclinical stage FXR agonist  being evaluated for the treatment of NASH  Allergan also added the lead gene therapy development program RST 001 of privately held  clinical stage biotechnology company RetroSense Therapeutics to its eye care pipeline last month 
In licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates have also increased significantly  Several pharma companies are focusing on in licensing  mid to late stage pipeline candidates that look promising  instead of developing a product from scratch  which involves a lot of funds and time Small biotech companies are open to such deals as most of them find it challenging to raise cash  thereby facing difficulty in surviving and continuing with the development of promising pipeline candidates  Therefore  it makes sense to seek deals with pharma companies sitting on huge piles of cash 
Merger and acquisitions  especially small bolt on acquisitions  as well as aggressive in licensing activities and collaborations are expected to increase  going forward  This in turn puts the spotlight on small cap biotech stocks 
Biotech companies with new therapies or interesting pipeline candidates can be strong takeover targets 
Here we have narrowed down the list of choices by focusing on five stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   Also  these are small cap biotech companies with a market cap of less than  1 billion  These stocks are well positioned in today s market environment and could see considerable upside riding on the aforementioned trends

106159,327674,AGN,Your Complete Guide To The Generic Drug Industry ,opinion,"On Monday  embattled drugmaker Mylan NV   NASDAQ MYL   announced that it will launch a generic version of the EpiPen at a 50  discount to the branded version as the company continues to respond to widespread criticism surrounding the pricing structure of the popular allergy medication 
Mylan s new generic EpiPen not only offers patients a more affordable treatment option  but it also adds to the company s massive generics portfolio  Regardless of the recent criticism the company has faced  Mylan s generics business is one of the largest in a very competitive global industry  also read    
With the spotlight on Mylan and the oftentimes absurd price hikes that have become commonplace in today s pharmaceutical industry  some attention has to be given to generic drug manufacturers that attempt to offer medications at lower costs to the consumer  also read    
With that said  sometimes it feels like the generic drug industry exists in the shadows  with new options sprouting out from seemingly nowhere and making a major impact on the overall pharmaceuticals market  Today we ll take a look at how generics are developed and how they affect the drug industry today 
Same Standards 
Generic drugs are defined by the   FDA  as being equivalent to the brand name product in dosage  strength  route of administration  quality  performance  and intended use  Generics are required to have the same active ingredients as their branded counterparts  although they do not need to contain the same inactive ingredients 
A potential generic drug manufacturer is required to prove that its drug is bioequivalent to the brand name drug  A wide range of bioequivalence data is collected and reviewed by the FDA during the approval process  For instance  after a patient takes the generic drug  they will be tested to see whether the same levels of the drug are found in their bloodstream 
The FDA also regulates the manufacturing and distribution of generic drugs  All related quality standards must be met in this regard  and many generic drugs are actually made in the same manufacturing plants as the brand name versions to help meet this guideline 
Patent Patience
When a pharmaceutical company is developing an original drug  it can apply for a patent that gives it the exclusive right to distribute that chemical compound for a specific time period  after which generic drug manufacturers can seek approval to manufacturer a non brand version 
In the United States  the latest major update to this regulatory process came with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act more commonly known as Obamacare in 2010  Obamacare established an exclusivity period of 12 years for drug patents  with the ability to extend that period only if significant updates or improvements are made to the drug 
Drugmakers oftent attempt to extend their exclusivity periods with a number of different strategies  In a process that critics call  Evergreening   pharmaceutical companies will typically try a variety of moves  including aggressive litigation and minor tweaks to a drug s inactive ingredients  in an attempt to delay generic competition 
Once a drug s exclusive period has expired  a wannabe generic manufacturer can file an Appreciated New Drug Application  ANDA  with the FDA to seek approval for their product  The ANDA looks at a wide variety of factors  including the quality standards mentioned above 
Once a generic drug s ANDA is approved  it can hit the market and is available to all patients who need the medicine  Generic drugs appeal to customers because they are typically significantly less costly than name brand drugs  as generic manufacturers have significantly less operating costs than other pharmaceutical companies 
It s important to keep in mind that generic manufacturers do not need to replicate the drug s original tests  and most generic businesses do not spend much money on marketing and promotion  which means the company s overhead remains lower  In 2010  the FDA found that FDA approved generics saved about  158 billion in that year alone 
Tickers to Watch
Of course  as an investor you re probably most interested in which companies operating in this sphere are publicly traded  As mentioned before  Mylan is one of the world s leading players in generics  while Teva Pharmaceuticals   NYSE TEVA   is the largest generic drug manufacturer in the world  especially after its recent  40 5 billion acquisition of Allergan s   NYSE AGN   generics business 
Other notable stocks to watch in the industry include Amphastar   NASDAQ AMPH    currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Axogen Corp    NASDAQ AXGN    currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Akorn Inc    NASDAQ AKRX    a leading supplier of therapies used in ophthalmology and other specialty areas  Perrigo   NYSE PRGO    which has a deep portfolio of generic sprays  ointments  and injectables  and Novartis   NYSE NVS    which operates its generic business through its Sandoz subsidiary 
ETF focused investors can also check out the VanEck Vectors Generic Drug ETF   which tracks companies that derive a significant portion of their revenues from generics or have the potential to derive a significant portion of their revenues from generics 
Complicated Competition 
At this point  you might be asking   If generic drugs are equally effective and cheaper  why would anyone ever opt for a name brand drug   Well  first remember our exclusivity windows  Plenty of pharmaceutical companies are cashing in on name brand drugs that have no generic alternative right now 
For those drugs that do have a generic versus name brand competition  the answer lies in the subtle differences of humans  All drugs have to operate within blood concentration thresholds  and some patients can notice the subtle differences or even react negatively to whatever the pill capsule is made out of  With some diseases  the range of safe concentration levels is incredibly narrow  which could make switching from name brand to generic dangerous 
In most cases  however  generic drugs are completely safe and more affordable than their name brand counterparts  For more coverage on drug prices  check out the latest episode of the  where Mylan s recent scandal was the first segment

106160,327675,AGN,Pharma Round Up  Mylan s Antitrust Probe  Allergan Limits Drug Price Hikes,opinion,"On Tuesday  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman opened an investigation into Mylan NV   NASDAQ MYL   that focuses on the drugmaker s contracts with local school districts to purchase its EpiPens 
In a statement  Schneiderman said  No child s life should be put at risk because a parent  school or health care provider cannot afford a simple  life saving device because of a drug maker s anticompetitive practices  
According to   the probe will be broad  but one of the main focus points is whether or not its EpiPens4School program  which offered a significant discount on the drug  locked schools into anti competitive contracts 
Last month  the pharma leader drew widespread criticism after it was discovered that the company increased the price of EpiPens over 400  over the last several years  To put that in perspective  the drug cost  57 a shot when Mylan acquired it in 2007  and now  a two pack of EpiPens costs more than  600 
Shortly afterwards  Mylan  it would take several steps to make the lifesaving allergy treatment more affordable to patients 
Allergan CEO Pledges Limit on Drug Price Increase
Also on Tuesday  healthcare giant Allergan Inc  NYSE AGN pa   s   NYSE AGN   CEO Brett Saunders has offered a promise to limit price hikes on the drugs it sells  writing in a  that  I understand the public outcry and add my voice to the condemnation of these behaviors  
Saunders argues that there is a  long standing unwritten social contract  between patients  physicians  policy makers  and the greater public  and  Those who have taken aggressive or predatory price increases have violated this social contract  
While not explicitly naming names  it s pretty clear he is referring to Martin Shkreli and Turing Pharmaceuticals  Valeant   NYSE VRX    and Mylan s recent EpiPen controversy 
Allergan s pricing pledge is significant  as it opposes the common practice taken by fellow biotech and pharmaceutical companies  raising drug prices two to three times every year  This usually means that drug costs can significantly exceed the annual inflation rate 
 For our industry to remain a vibrant and important part of the healthcare ecosystem  Allergan commits to this social contract and I encourage others to formulate their own self policing actions   Saunders continues

106188,327703,AGN,Is This Pharma Play Best In Class ,opinion,"As the bull market pushes past its seventh year and stock market averages triple in value off their great recession lows  it can become increasingly difficult to find good companies trading at reasonable values  As Buffett famously said   You can buy a good company  but at a bad price it can still turn into a bad investment   The S P 500 currently trades at 17x forward earnings and 19x TTM earnings  While this isn t bubble territory when factoring in generational lows in the risk free rates  it s far from cheap 

Which brings me to Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   which is trading at 7x forward and TTM earnings  5 year average is 21x  and 3 9x sales  5 year average is 7x  for a company that has grown revenue at an average annual pace of 32  for the last 5  and 10 year period and earnings at a pace of 40  50  annually for the same period  chart above   The company also displays operating and gross margins well above the industry average 
Now there are always two sides to every trade and the bears are looking at the overhead potential of drug pricing reform and more specifically at what other generic drugs may cut into Gilead s future revenue and earnings growth potential  While nothing is certain  it s usually a good idea to buy good companies with a margin of safety  In this case we have a solid company with good competitive advantages  exemplary management and revenue growth that exceeds even Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN   trading at a fraction of its historical average 

Taking a look at the weekly chart  GILD looks to have a confluence of support between the  82 50  84 range with the 200 week MA just below

106213,327728,AGN,Why Pfizer  PFE  Is A Great Stock To Buy For The Long Run,opinion,"Pfizer   NYSE PFE   is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies out there   With a market cap above  200 billion  many may think that the company doesn t have much more room to grow its share price  but what s not to love   The company has a solid dividend  great fundamentals  and a wide array of household drug brands which drive sizable profits for the company   For the reasons above  Pfizer deserves a spot in your portfolio for the long run 
Dividends
Pfizer has increased its quarterly dividend payout per share by 87 5  since 2009   From that year onwards  PFE has consistently raised its quarterly dividend by  0 02 per share every year   When looking at the company s cash flows  it is clear that Pfizer can easily afford to increase its current dividend payout substantially   The yield is pretty attractive  and it stands at about 3 5  right now   If you load up on this stock  your dividend yield stands to increase as Pfizer continues to raise its cash payout to shareholders over time 
Fundamentally Sound Investment
While revenues have decreased by a notable margin since 2013  the company is still churning out sales at a high level   2015 revenues came out to about  48 8 billion  and the company had high expectations going into fiscal 2016  posting sales guidance in a range from  49  51 billion   After Q1 of 2016 though  Pfizer raised its guidance even higher  and it now expects revenues to fall between  51 billion and  53 billion this year 
Pfizer has bought back over  20 billion in stock over the last three fiscal years  and this has helped to concentrate share value for investors   PFE also has close to  20 billion in cash on its balance sheet  and this will help the company in staying liquid and utilizing its investing power going forward   What s really great about Pfizer is its ability to consistently beat investor expectations over time   The chart below does a nice job of showing how good things happen to those who consistently top earnings expectations 
Promising Outlook
Pfizer is expected to experience some headwinds because of patents from some of its name brand drugs which are expected to expire over the next few years   While this is an area of concern worth analyzing  it should be noted that the company does have 30 projects in phase 3  as of February 2  2016   the last trial step before seeking drug approval from the FDA 
Pfizer has been known for its attempts to grow and realize synergies through making successful acquisitions   Pfizer s 2009 acquisition of Wyeth  a fellow drug maker  has been paying off nicely for the pharmaceutical giant  and  4 billion in savings have been realized so far   Wyeth helps to boost Pfizer s revenues  and its strong presence in the vaccines and consumer health products industries helps Pfizer in diversifying its sales  
Pfizer expects to see  1 billion in annual cost synergies by 2018 as a result of the Hospira acquisition   Hospira was acquired in September of 2015  and the company is a leading provider of injectable drugs   Hospira is a global leader in biosimilars  and the company also specializes in utilizing infusion technologies  Hospira has its hands in these industries  each of which are expected to see significant growth over the mid to long term 
Last month  Anacor   NASDAQ ANAC   agreed to be bought by Pfizer for  5 2 billion   PFE pursued the acquisition so that it could gain access to Anacor s non steroidal topical gel which treats eczema  a condition which up to 25 million people in the US suffer from 
If Pfizer continues to stay aggressive with regards to pursuing value adding growth opportunities  it stands to realize even more synergies and profitability over time  
Bottom Line
Pfizer seems to be making all of the right moves to pursue more growth for the long run   While shareholders are disappointed that the Allergan   NYSE AGN   merger couldn t happen  they still have a lot to be thankful for   They are invested in a company which provides them with income  share buybacks  robust revenues  profitability  and most importantly  a strive towards expanding a wide pipeline of drugs  products  and services for the broader pharmaceutical industry   Pfizer is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the US  and from the moves it is making  it stands extend its lead as the largest player in its industry

Under the terms of the deal  Pfizer will pay  99 25 per share in cash through a cash tender offer  reflecting a 55  premium over Anacor s closing stock price on May 13  The acquisition  expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year  has already been approved by the board of directors of both companies and is seeking approval from shareholders and regulators  The transaction will be slightly dilutive to Pfizer earnings in 2017 but accretive from the start of 2018 
The deal will allow Pfizer to gain control exclusively over Anacor s flagship asset   crisaborole   an experimental nonsteroidal topical gel treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis known as eczema  In phase 3 clinical trials  crisaborole reported strong results and was accepted for FDA review to treat mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in children and adults in March  If approved on January 7  2017  Pfizer expects the drug to generate annual sales of  2 billion  The buyout will bolster its inflammation and immunology drug business and add a new stream of revenue growth to Pfizer s innovate business 
About 18 25 million people in the U S  have the chronic inflammatory skin disorder  which causes inflammation and itching often in skin folds with symptoms lasting for two weeks or more  It is particularly common in infants and children  And as no drug has been approved for the illness over the last 15 years  this new Anacor drug could make a huge difference Market Impact
With the potential to dominate the atopic dermatitis market  ANAC soared 57 2  on the day to finish above the  100 per share mark  while its crushed its average volume figures  as more than 17 3 million shares moved hands compared to just 1 4 million on average  read

This fund tracks the S P Biotechnology Select Industry Index and provides equal weight exposure across 90 stocks  suggesting no concentration issue and huge diversification benefits  The product has a definite tilt toward small cap securities  as mid and large caps account for a combined 31  share  ANAC occupies the twelfth position in the fund s basket with 2  of the total assets  With AUM of  1 7 billion and average daily volume of 6 5 million shares  XBI is extremely liquid and an easily traded fund  It charges a relatively low fee of 35 bps a year for the exposure  see

According to a statement on his   Icahn  who notoriously advocates for management and strategy changes in companies he holds positions in  is very supportive of Allergan CEO Brent Saunders 
 We were instrumental in bringing Brent on board as the new CEO of Forest Labs a few years ago and worked cooperatively and constructively with him to help increase value for all Forest shareholders    We have every confidence in Brent s ability to enhance value for all Allergan shareholders   said Icahn 
The entire statement was brief and did not disclose how large Icahn s stake is  nor did it discuss what  if any  changes he wants to see the company make  In an interview with   an Allergan spokesperson said that the company recognizes Icahn s position and  has no reason to believe that this investment was made for purposes of influencing the actions of management or control of the company  
 We welcome all investors who recognize the value of our business  The Company is grateful for the confidence of our investors  whether they are new holders or have been long term investors   spokesman Mark Marmur said 
Icahn s announcement comes less than two months after new government regulations halted the company s merger with Pfizer  The  160 billion deal was stymied by the Obama administration s tougher rules on inversion  a business practice wherein a company will merge with a foreign rival to benefit from lower tax rates

106243,327758,AGN,Synergy Climbs On Takeover Chatter,opinion,"Synergy Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ SGYP  is having an incredible day in the market today as chatter with regard to a coming takeover is reborn  The big question is    Will a takeover happen  While this question is still yet to be answered  I believe that regardless of takeover possibilities  the stock is screaming  BUY ME   Today  we ll talk about the takeover chatter and how realistic the concept is  what we re seeing in the market as a result  and why the stock is a buy in my opinion  regardless of a takeover 
Takeover Chatter Is Reborn Surrounding SGYP
The idea of a company coming in and acquiring Synergy Pharmaceuticals is nothing new  In fact  just weeks ago we heard that Allergan  NYSE AGN  was currently in advanced talks with regard to acquiring the company  At the time  the stock climbed dramatically  However  over the past few weeks  the chatter has died down to silence 
Well  that s not the case anymore  Once again  investors seem to be talking about a takeover happening  and happening soon  Now the big question is    Is this realistic  In my opinion  the answer is yes  The reality is that Allergan was very close to a deal to acquire SGYP weeks ago  In fact  at the time  StreetInsider reported that a deal could be announced within a week  While there was no deal announced  that doesn t mean that a deal is an acquisition 
The reality is that at this point  SGYP is an acquisition waiting to happen  The company has made all the right moves  and recently submitted an NDA to the United States Food and Drug Administration  which was indeed accepted  If a company wants to get their hands on what Synergy Pharmaceuticals has done  they re going to want to do it before the FDA decision  At the end of the day  Plecanatide data was overwhelmingly positive and will likely lead to an approval  If a company waits to acquire SGYP until after the FDA s response in January  they re likely going to pay a hefty sum 
So  yes  an acquisition is on the table and a very real possibility at the moment  Will it happen  Only time will tell 
How The Market Is Reacting To The News
As investors  we know that the news moves the market  Any time there is positive news surrounding a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the value of the company  In this particular case  while there isn t much news  the chatter surrounding SGYP is overwhelmingly positive  After all  nothing seems to get investors more excited than the concept of an acquisition  As a result  the stock is climbing in the market today  Currently  12 07   Synergy Pharmaceuticals stock is trading at  4 19 per share after a gain of  0 35 per share or 9 11  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from SGYP  First and foremost  an acquisition is incredibly likely at this point  and will demand a very high premium  So  there s quite a bit of opportunity there alone 
However  I would take a bullish stance on Synergy Pharmaceuticals even if there wasn t an acquisition on the table  The reality is that the company has done incredible things with Plecanatide  Based on the results I ve read  I couldn t see the FDA not approving this treatment for chronic idiopathic constipation  Not to mention  the company is currently in the midst of Phase 3 studies on the treatment for the irritable bowel syndrome with constipation indication  The previous studies in this indication were overwhelmingly positive as well 
Based only on what we know to be fact   NDA with the FDA  promising results in the indication  new indication being studied  and solid financial and management to back it up   I d expect to see further growth in the value of the stock  The fact that an acquisition is on the table is just icing on the cake

106286,327801,AGN,Danger Zone  Compensation Committees And Shareholder Value,opinion,"When executives  compensation incentives are not aligned with creating shareholder value  you risk having executives whose goals are not aligned with investors  The consequences of such misalignment are behavior like what we are seeing with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  NYSE VRX   whose stock is down 74  YTD and whose internal controls may get a   The primary culprit for this kind of misalignment is the compensation committee  They are responsible for designing  approving and recommending to the Board of Directors the executive compensation plans for companies  They make the rules that the executives play by 
We know that Valeant is not the only company with misaligned executive incentives  There are many others  many of which have already been put in the Danger Zone and some who will go into the Danger Zone soon  This week  however  compensation committees land in the Danger Zone because of the role they play in creating the problems that lead to shareholder value destruction 
Here s How Non GAAP Performance Goals Misalign Executive Behavior
From a recent  by Valeant 

 The tone at the top of the organization and the performance based environment at the company  where challenging targets were set and achieving those targets was a key performance indication  may have been contributing factors resulting in the company s improper revenue recognition  

The  tone at the top  wasn t simply a performance based environment that led to issues  All executives should strive to achieve certain  performance goals   The problem comes from what type of performance was emphasized  in particular  achieving non GAAP targets that fail to reflect actual business operations  In   the goals for achieving cash and or stock bonuses at VRX ranged from 
Total shareholder return
Revenue growth
 Do at least one significant deal that creates substantial shareholder value 
 Cash EPS    Valeant s term for non GAAP EPS
None of these goals lead to generating the cash flows Valeant needs to pay its debt holders  In reality  they are straw men for corporate performance with no real connection to the economics of the business  The result of these misaligned goals manifests in a major divergence between real cash flows and Valeant s  cash   i e  fake  earnings 
Figure 1  Executives Grow  Cash  Earnings At Expense of Real Cash Flows

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
From 2010 to the trailing twelve months  Valeant grew  cash  earnings from  421 million to  3 55 billion  At the same time  free cash flow was positive only once  and  cumulatively is   38 4 billion 
Of all the goals  the worst for shareholders is  ironically   Do at least one significant deal that creates substantial shareholder value  because there was no accountability for the amount management would pay for acquisitions  As a result  executives could exploit the hi lo fallacy to boost earnings while gouging profits 
The only thing worse than a bad rule is not enforcing the rules  Valeant executives got paid for the Allergan  NYSE AGN  deal even though Valeant failed to actually acquire Allergan  a deal that would not have created shareholder value even if it had gone through  
Essentially  executives received the  significant deal  bonus with an  A for effort  note attached  In total  14 3 million was paid under the annual cash incentive program in 2014 and total compensation across five executives totaled  122 9 million  Compare this with 2013  when four executives were paid  only   23 8 million 
In hindsight  what happened at Valeant almost looks inevitable given the misalignment of their performance goals and creating shareholder value 
Compensation Committees Fail Across The Board
VRX s  tone at the top  admission may be rare  as only four other companies have used such language from 2010 2015 in their Internal Controls of Financial Reporting opinions  We cover four of these five companies  and each of them receives a Dangerous rating and has for quite some time  However  compensation committee s creating a misalignment of interests is widespread and often surfaces in companies that land in the Danger Zone  Since 2014  53 out of 69 companies placed in the Danger Zone have executive compensation plans directly related to non GAAP metrics  A sampling of these metrics include 
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted operating income
Adjusted Net Income
Core Sales Growth
Normalized Gross Margin
Non GAAP Net Revenues
Total Bookings
Customer Satisfaction
  Of Customers
Club Openings
 Financial Operations Efficiency 
Dollar retention
Manufacturing Cash Flow
Adjusted Free Cash Flow
Organic Net Revenue Growth
The large number of Danger Zone companies with poor executive pay plans is no coincidence  If compensation committees set goals misaligned with shareholder interests  it is only natural for executives to focus more on what their best interests  i e  pay  instead of shareholders  interests  i e  real cash flow  This divergence of interests expands over time as executive s efforts to compensate themselves at the expense of shareholders compound over the years  Figure 2 shows the five worst performing Danger Zone picks since 2014

Navistar  NYSE NAV  pays executives based on adjusted EBITDA margin and revenue growth  Men s Wearhouse  NYSE TLRD  paid executives for meeting EBIT growth  excluding the Jos  A Bank acquisition  Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  compensation committee emphasized  Cash  EPS and revenue growth  Universal Technical Institute  NYSE UTI  incentivized executives to meet EBIT  graduate placement  and completion rate goals while Twitter  NYSE TWTR  pay was solely at management discretion  with 99  of pay tied to equity based compensation 
Unfortunately  only four of the 69 Danger Zone companies referenced above include return on invested capital  ROIC  in their executive compensation plans  ROIC is a metric that has been  to create shareholder value    and  we believe  should be the first are foremost measure for executive compensation 
Misaligned Compensation Undermines the Integrity of the Capital Markets
We believe that the purpose of the capital markets is to allocate capital to its most efficient use  The best way to quantify  the most efficient use  is through ROIC  which measures the return of cash flow per dollar of capital invested  When compensation committee s align incentives with goals that fail to create true value  they undermine the integrity of capital markets  Investors must trust the agents of capital  i e   executives  to focus on earning the highest return per dollar invested  and thereby growing shareholder value  When this trust is broken  through misaligned incentives  Pandora s box is opened to any number of untrustworthy actions 
Worse yet  misaligned incentives tend to attract executives that are more likely to misbehave  Truly good managers will naturally want to maximize shareholder value  That is their purpose  not maximizing non GAAP EPS for a few quarters to get the big annual bonus  This short term focus mirrors the compensation and mindset of hedge fund managers  who can earn massive performance bonuses for outperforming in any given year  With the ability to earn hundreds of millions in compensation in just a few short years  executives can  and will  take actions with little regard to the future  If events take a turn for the worse  as in the case of Valeant  executives can ride off with little fear of losing the large compensation they received during their tenure as  
Investors Need To Be Aware of Poor Executive Compensation
It s a known fact that   One of the top reasons for manipulation is to meet bonus targets  which makes transparency and details on executive compensation material information to investors  We include a compensation analysis in each of our Danger Zone reports  it is important to note that the risk of a Valeant type episode exists for every company with misaligned executive compensation  Sometimes  the risk is more obvious  such as the case of Jarden Corporation  NYSE JAH   whose entire business model was built upon growing  adjusted EPS   Adjusted EPS was also the main determinant of executive pay  While growing adjusted EPS  the company s economic earnings remained negative and were only getting worse 
Other firms  such as Qlik Technologies  NASDAQ QLIK   have larger issues such as deteriorating margins and little competitive advantage  By itself  focusing on non GAAP metrics is no more a red flag than normal  However  alarms go off when the compensation committee states in the  
 Over the past three years  we have increased our emphasis on non GAAP operating profit and we now reward our executive officers for over performance of this key financial measure  
Not surprisingly  Qlik s GAAP net income  net operating profit after tax  NOPAT   ROIC  and economic earnings have declined as the company has focused more on non GAAP metrics  Figure 3 below shows the disconnect between true profits and non GAAP net income 
Figure 3  Qlik s Non GAAP Illusion

Another company we ve exposed for their egregious use of non GAAP metrics is Demandware  NYSE DWRE   The compensation committee at Demandware has aligned executive interests with non GAAP EBITDA and dollar renewal percentage  Figure 4 shows that non GAAP net income has grown from   1 million in 2012 to  11 million in 2015 while economic earnings have declined from   16 million to   55 million

Compensation Committee s Lack Accountability
At the end of the day  compensation committee s need to be held accountable  Currently  members of the committee are tightly tied to executives  In the case of Jarden  we noted in our Danger Zone report that the three largest recipients of a bonus tied to a non GAAP metric also held seats on the Board of Directors  The group that was supposed to protect the interest of shareholders was instead comprised of executives that can vote to give themselves larger bonuses  That is not how corporate governance should work 
It is clear that many compensation committees are failing shareholders  We will continue to find these companies and highlight them in the Danger Zone so our clients can make more informed investment decisions

106287,327802,AGN,Misaligned Incentives That Led To Valeant Disaster Go Unaddressed,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  finds itself back in the news this week  as Centerbridge Partners  a large holder of VRX bonds  of its intentions to call a default as a result of VRX s failure to file its annual report on time 
As   the company was getting traction in convincing debt holders to push the deadline back to May 31 But  with the new deadline came certain restrictions  which  as we highlighted in our February 29   would shut down the strategy that helped executives pump the stock to nosebleed heights 
What does Centerbridge know that no one else knows  Why are they pushing back on the concessions other debt holders seemed to be accepting 
Misaligned Compensation Incentives That Led To Disaster Remain Unchanged
We think Centerbridge understands that investing in VRX is not a good bet until Valeant s leadership fully addresses the serious corporate governance flaws that are the source of the problems at the company 
Executive compensation plans that pay executives for non GAAP metrics like Valeant s misalign executive incentives with investors  best interests  By paying executives for performance that does not generate real cash flows  Valeant s board of directors created the misalignment that precipitated the executive behavior that got the company into so much trouble in the first place  This misalignment is the fact that Valeant executives get paid big bucks for meeting non GAAP performance metrics while running the business into the ground and leaving investors holding the bag 
Until this misalignment is resolved and Valeant executives  interests are aligned with investors  how can we be sure that their behavior will not revert to what got them in this situation in the first place 
Responsibility for Proper Corporate Governance Begins with the Compensation Committee
We recently pointed out the  and how the structure of executive compensation can create inherent conflicts of interest between executives and shareholders  In many ways  Valeant is the poster child for how wrong things can go when executives  interests are misaligned  We specifically identified problems at Valeant  problems that can t be fixed with an annual filing  In a recent  by Valeant  the company noted 

 The tone at the top of the organization and the performance based environment at the company  where challenging targets were set and achieving those targets was a key performance indication  may have been contributing factors resulting in the company s improper revenue recognition  

This tone at the top starts with the incentives management is given in regards to performance  In Valeant s case  the following were goals management needed to achieve to receive cash and or stock bonuses  
Total shareholder return
Revenue growth
 Do at least one significant deal that creates substantial shareholder value 
 Cash EPS    Valeant s term for non GAAP EPS
None of these goals lead to generating the cash flows Valeant needs to pay its debt holders  even if there is no default  In reality  they are straw men for corporate performance measurement with no real connection to the economics of the business 
Of all the goals  the worst for shareholders is  ironically   Do at least one significant deal that creates substantial shareholder value  because there was no accountability for the amount management would pay for acquisitions  Lack of accountability directly led to the debt load   30 4 billion in 2014  including off balance sheet debt  Valeant is saddled with and increasing default risks 
A bad rule turns even worse when it is not enforced  Valeant executives got paid for the Allergan  NYSE AGN  deal even though Valeant failed to actually acquire Allergan  a deal that would not have created shareholder value even if it had gone through  
Essentially  executives received the  significant deal  bonus with an  A for effort  note attached  In total  14 3 million was paid under the annual cash incentive program in 2014 and total compensation across five executives totaled  122 9 million  Compare this with 2013  when four executives were paid  only   23 8 million 
Fund Holders Face Risks As Well
Shareholders aren t the only investors watching investment in Valeant dwindle away as executives receive massive bonuses  Fund holders in ETFs or mutual funds that have large allocations to VRX pose similar risks  risks we covered in more detail in our report      Funds have cut holdings in VRX since the fallout  but many still allocate significantly to the stock  Unfortunately  most fund research does not analyze the holdings of a fund  even though the performance of holdings equals the performance of a fund  Our predictive ratings for ETFs give investors a different perspective as they are based on the quality of a fund s holdings  Figure 1 shows the eight ETFs and mutual funds that allocate significantly to VRX and could pose a risk to investors  portfolio 
Figure 1  Funds With Exposure To and Risk of Decline from Holding VRX

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Since the 40  decline in VRX in mid March  investors in Sequoia Fund  SEQUX  have seen the importance of analyzing holdings prior to placing capital in a fund  On March 23  Robert Goldfarb  from his position managing Sequoia  a position he held since 1980  Only a week later  Morningstar lowered its analyst rating to Bronze from Gold  a move which can be tracked to large fund outflows  Perhaps more alarming was Morningstar s Gold rating on SEQUX  a sign that only reinforces why investors need independent fund research  In total  SEQUX is down 11  year to date while the S P 500 is up 1  
Stock Remains Overvalued  Even After Multiple Declines
All in all  VRX is down 51  since our Danger Zone report in late February  For investors hoping for a rebound  even after such a drastic decline  the stock is still overvalued 
In order to justify its current price of  31 share  the company would need to grow NOPAT by 15  compounded annually for the next 5 years  In this scenario  Valeant would be generating  18 billion in revenue  more than double its 2014 revenue  and greater than greater than Bristol Myers Squibb s  BMY  2015 revenue 
Even in an ideal scenario  in which Valeant focuses on internal growth and not destructive acquisitions  which as noted above  it may not even be allowed to undergo  VRX still has significant downside  If Valeant can grow NOPAT by 8  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  25 share today   a 19  downside

106288,327803,AGN,Corporate Taxes Are Out Of Sync  Discouraging U S  Job Growth,opinion,"On April 4  the Treasury Department issued new regulations directed at corporate inversions    in which a U S  parented multinational changes its tax residence in order to reduce its tax burden through a number of different strategies  Last Monday s new rules were the Obama administration s third round of efforts to obstruct inversions  following others from 2014 and 2015 
These are the toughest yet  surprising analysts and observers with their stringency  Some critics charged that the new regs were aimed specifically at a nascent mega tie up between U S  based Pfizer  NYSE  NYSE PFE  and Ireland based Allergan  NYSE AGN   which as of this writing have market capitalizations of about  200 billion and  95 billion  respectively  both have declined sharply in share price since the new regulations were announced   The administration denied this accusation  saying   The Treasury Department is not focused on a specific transaction  it s focused on specific loopholes  
Nevertheless  the new rules did indeed lead PFE and AGN to scrap their prospective deal  Some other deals currently in the works    such as those between U S  based Johnson Controls  NYSE JCI  and Ireland based Tyco International NYSE TYC     are likely to go ahead because they do not fall afoul of the most aggressive changes  which train their fire closely on  serial inverters  
 Serial Inverters  Under Fire
Those changes hinge on the existing rules governing inversions  which place a size threshold on a foreign acquirer relative to its U S  acquisition target  The agency notes 

 Some foreign companies may avoid  the tax code s existing curbs on inversions by acquiring multiple American companies over a short window of time    thereby enabling the foreign company to complete another  potentially larger  acquisition of an American company to which  existing rules  will not apply  Over a relatively short period of time  a significant portion of a foreign acquirer s size may be attributable to the assets of these recently acquired American companies 
 It is not consistent with the purposes of  the existing rules  to permit a foreign company  including a recent inverter  to increase in its size in order to avoid the inversion threshold under current law for a subsequent acquisition of an American company  For the purposes of computing the ownership percentage when determining if an acquisition is treated as an inversion under current law  today s action excludes stock of the foreign company attributable to assets acquired from an American company within three years prior to the signing date of the latest acquisition  

It was that final sentence that was the death knell of the PFE AGN tie up  since AGN has increased rapidly in size through acquisitions over the past three years  With those acquisitions excluded  the deal would yield no benefits 
The other new rules are aimed at  earnings stripping   in which after an inversion  a foreign parent company can use internal financial engineering to reduce the tax burden of its U S  subsidiary 
The Big Picture  A Broken U S  Corporate Tax Code Suppresses Growth and Job Creation
Last October  after the second wave of Treasury s new rules  we wrote about the negative effects of the U S  corporate tax system  and noted that as long as the system s perverse incentives remained unaddressed  phenomena such as corporate inversions would be inevitable  In fact  it could get worse  We wrote 

 Human economic actors will respond to incentives  and will act rationally within a system to maximize the value of their assets  Where there is an opportunity for tax arbitrage    by effectively moving income from high tax to low tax jurisdictions    and economic actors have the capacity to take advantage of that arbitrage  they will  Can rules or legislation stop the process  We doubt it  Incrementally  the effect will be to redouble the efforts of tax engineers to locate and exploit opportunities for arbitrage  If inversion deals are discouraged while the basic drivers that make them happen remain unaddressed  a simpler process will happen as U S  companies are just bought by foreign companies  For individual firms such deals can make good sense under the current U S  tax regime    even though on a macro level  they lead to the erosion of the U S  tax base and the incremental migration of good  highly skilled jobs abroad  

Yes  Treasury could stop the PFE AGN deal    and others like it    from going forward  But it will not stop the bleed of growth and high quality jobs that results from an ineffective and punitive corporate tax policy 
Further  the continued issuance of jerry rigged regulations contributes to an environment of uncertainty for business  in which future planning is derailed by the fear that unexpected new regulations will make those plans fruitless   Even though AGN and PFE were not that far along in the process  they had still spent millions pursuing the potential merger  
 What Is To Be Done 
The solution is straightforward  as we noted in October  but it is a political solution that neither U S  party shows signs of being interested in 

 Most member states of the OECD have acclimated themselves to an environment in which business is global  While the U S  and a few other members maintain a worldwide taxation system    in which the profits of their domestic companies are subject to tax no matter where they are earned    most have gone to territorial systems where only domestic earnings are taxed  The most obvious solution is for the U S  to move in the direction of a properly managed territorial tax system  rather than a worldwide one  but even that will produce perverse incentives and distortions unless the effective U S  corporate tax rate is transparently lowered to be more in line with OECD peers  

Further  the revelations of shadowy offshore tax haven activities in the leaked  Panama papers  should reinforce our awareness of this fact  when people are denied legitimate avenues for reducing their tax burdens to levels deemed reasonable by most global jurisdictions  more of them will resort to illegal means  This is not to excuse such behavior    far from it  But it is to observe  realistically  that the heart of the matter is the tax code    and that trying to achieve compliance with a fundamentally flawed tax code without reforming it will ultimately create far more and far bigger problems than it solves 
Investment implications   The U S  corporate tax code needs to be overhauled  and the top rate  the highest among developed nations  needs to come down  Corporate inversions    in which U S  companies reduce their U S  tax burdens by acquiring a foreign firm and redomiciling themselves in a lower tax jurisdiction    result in great part from this high tax rate  and curbing inversions does not solve the problem  The U S  needs economic growth and high quality jobs  Both of those are delivered by U S  businesses that have confidence about the regulatory environment  and can compete on a fair playing field with companies from other national tax jurisdictions  The Department of the Treasury has issued tough new regulations to stop inversions  but these regulations can ultimately only worsen the perverse incentives that result from a U S  corporate tax system that is completely out of step with its peers in the OECD  Absent tax reform  actions such as last week s new Treasury rules will only increase the perception that government is the adversary of business  creating unexpected roadblocks for business planning and strategy  And they will do nothing to stop the bleed of growth and high quality jobs that results from an ineffective and punitive corporate tax policy ",2016-04-15,Tim Shirata,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-corporate-taxes-are-out-of-sync-with-the-rest-of-the-world,-which-200125181",200125181

106319,327834,AGN,My Top 3 Fabulous Pharma Stocks ,opinion,"Introduction
I am a fervent believer that investment decisions should be made based on the relative merits of each individual investment under consideration  However  my anecdotal observations and experience suggests that many investors do not embrace that approach  This is especially true regarding investment decisions on common stocks  Instead of focusing on the opportunities and valuations available from select individual businesses  many investors are obsessed  and I allege blinded by generalized views or beliefs about the overall market and or the economy 
For example  in a recent article  I postulated about reasons why carefully selected growth stocks might benefit retired investors under certain circumstances  In the article I presented a few examples of high quality fast growing businesses that I considered fairly valued based on their earnings growth rates  Unfortunately  and as I expected might happen  a comment made in the article rejected my carefully selected growth stock research candidates based on what I believe are misguided views about the market in general  The comment is included in its entirety as follows 
 I like growth stocks but not when the market is at all time highs and way overpriced as it is now  Just for example  the Russell 2000 is at a P E of 40 and P B of 4   hardly compelling valuations 
Many growth stocks should be sold short here and that is what I am doing  When the market tanks  soon  I will close out my shorts and go long on some of the growth stocks I like 
Making a decision on buying a stock without looking at its relative valuation and that of the market is a dangerous proposition and one I am not interested in  
To clarify my position  I offer the following elaboration and critique regarding why I found this comment concerning  First of all  the reference that the P E ratio and price to book ratio of the Russell 2000 were at all time high valuations was not relevant to the valuations of the individual research candidates I presented  Each of the companies I presented was offered because I believed their valuations were in alignment with their past  present  and most importantly  their future earnings potential  The valuation of the Russell 2000 was therefore irrelevant 
The second paragraph also offered a generalized view of growth stocks and suggested that they should be sold short  But again  I don t believe this statement relates specifically to the candidates I offered in the article  Then the bold prediction was made that the market would tank soon  which of course  is impossible to accurately forecast  However  the comment also indicated that this could be timed to perfection by closing out shorts and then investing in growth stocks that were favored  Again  I contend that this is impossible to time or predict 
Finally  the comment suggested that buying a stock without looking at its relative valuation and that of the market was a dangerous proposition  Of course  I vigorously agree that investors should evaluate the valuation of the company  but only based on its specific fundamental merits  regardless of the valuation of the overall market  I elaborated on my belief that it s a market of stocks and not a stock market in a recent article  
The Pharma Sector Powerful Demographic Forces Support Growth Potential
Therefore  I was motivated to offer this follow up article on growth stocks for retirement portfolios by offering three attractive looking growth stock research candidates in the Pharma sector  Thanks to the demographic forces of an aging population  I contend that the Pharma sector offers enormous growth potential that is independent of the general economy or the stock market 
As I indicated in my previous article on the appropriateness of growth stocks in retirement portfolios  they are not necessarily a good fit for every retired investor  However  for those investors at or near retirement that are interested in adding some growth  I offer the following three Pharma growth stock opportunities that I am personally researching  Most importantly  my initial review indicates that each of these candidates are reasonably valued based on their respective future growth opportunities 
Three Fabulous Pharma Growth Stocks
Two of the following three Pharma growth stocks were originally previewed in my previous article  In this article I have added a third Pharma research candidate in what follows is my reasoning as to why I consider these attractive growth opportunities based on my preliminary research  Perhaps readers of this article that have more information or familiarity with any of these companies will help the rest of us by sharing their knowledge 
Actavis plc  NYSE ACT 

Actavis  my first research candidate  is well positioned to serve the growing pharmaceutical needs of our aging population  The company offers both branded and generic pharmaceuticals worldwide 

Short business description courtesy of S P Capital IQ 


 Actavis plc  a specialty pharmaceutical company  develops  manufactures  markets  and distributes generic  branded generic  branded  biosimilar  and over the counter  OTC  pharmaceutical products  It operates in three segments  North American Brands  North American Generics and International  and Anda Distribution 

The North American Brands segment provides patented and off patent trademarked pharmaceutical products primarily under the Dalvance  Bystolic  Canasa  Carafate  Daliresp  Fetzima  Linzess  Namenda  Namenda XR  Saphris  Teflaro  Viibryd  Actonel  Asacol HD  Atelvia  Delzicol  Doryx  Estrace Cream  Enablex  Lo Loestrin Fe  and Minastrin 24 Fe brands 

The North American Generics and International segment develops  manufactures  and sells generic  branded generic  and OTC pharmaceutical products 

The Anda Distribution segment distributes generic and brand pharmaceutical products primarily to independent pharmacies  pharmacy chains and buying groups  and physician s offices 

The company also develops and out licenses generic pharmaceutical products primarily in Europe through its third party business  and provides products in women s health  gastroenterology  urology  and dermatology areas 

The company sells its generic and brand pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers  retailers  and distributors  including national retail drug and food store chains  hospitals  clinics  mail order retailers  government agencies  and managed healthcare providers 

It has a collaboration agreements with Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Inc  to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of Herceptin  Avastin  Rituxan Mab Thera  and Erbitux  Ironwood Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize Linzessfor the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation  Sanofi Aventis U S  LLC  and Trevena for the development of TRV027  Actavis plc was founded in 1983 and is headquartered in Parsippany  New Jersey  


Both demographics and acquisitions have stimulated accelerating earnings growth since 2011  Nevertheless  Actavis trades at P E ratio that is less than its historical earnings growth achievement  However  the normal P E ratio has moderately expanded as a result of extraordinary growth in 2013 and 2014 



Importantly  Actavis has also generated cash flow growth that is aligned with its historical earnings growth  Consequently  the company has ample resources to continue funding research and development and its reasonable 36  debt to capital ratio is well covered 



Growth in earnings and cash flow since 2010 has resulted in significant total returns for Actavis shareholders  Returns have significantly out performed the general market  which is extraordinary when you consider that this timeframe has produced one of the best returns for the S P 500 in recent history  The stock market has nothing to do with the results that Actavis achieved 



Looking to the near to intermediate time future  leading analysts continue to expect earnings growth in excess of 20  per annum for this fiscal year and next  The company s current P E ratio is in alignment with this near term forecast growth  Consequently  the company offers double digit return potential over the next couple of years 



The following analyst scorecard summarizes analysts  accuracy when making earnings forecasts one year and two year forward  This provides additional confidence that Actavis might meet earnings forecasts for the next two years 



Analysts also provide 3 5 year earnings estimates  The consensus of 9 analysts expects long term  3 5 years  earnings growth to average slightly less than 15  per annum  This lower long term forecast offers a potential negative to this company s ability to generate double digit returns longer term  Although this is still a high earnings growth rate  the company s current P E ratio would indicate higher than optimum current valuation over the longer term 



The following slides provide additional insight into the growth opportunities for Actavis  For a more comprehensive review of the full presentation  follow this link 









Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  NYSE VRX 

Valeant Pharmaceuticals is also well positioned to serve the growing pharmaceutical needs of our aging population  However  this candidate offers additional diversification due to the specific markets that it serves 

Short business description courtesy of S P Capital IQ 


 Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  Inc  develops  manufactures  and markets pharmaceuticals  over the counter products  and medical devices worldwide 

The company offers Solodyn to treat red and pus filled pimples of acne in patients  as well as Ziana  Acanya  Atralin  Retin  A Micro  and ONEXTON gel  Wellbutrin XL for major depressive disorder in adults  Jublia for onychomycosis of the toenails  Xenazine for chorea  Targretin for Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma  Arestin  a subgingival sustained release antibiotic  and PROVENGE for the treatment of prostate cancer  It also provides Zovirax  an antiviral for recurrent herpes labialis and initial genital herpes  Syprine to treat patients with Wilson s disease  Elidel to treat atopic dermatitis  Prolensa for inflammation and pain following cataract surgery  Duromine  a weight loss drug  and Lotemax gel for post operative inflammation and pain 

In addition  the company offers PreserVision  an antioxidant eye vitamin and mineral supplement  CeraVe to rebuild and repair the skin barrier  ReNu Multiplus to lubricate and rewet soft contact lenses  Biotrue for healthy contact lens wear  Ocuvite  a lutein eye vitamin and mineral supplement  cleansing solution for gas permeable contact lenses  Artelac to treat dry eyes  AntiGrippin for acute respiratory and respiratory viral diseases  and influenza  and Bedoyecta  a vitamin B complex product 

Further  it provides SofLens daily disposable contact lenses  PureVision  a contact lens  various ophthalmic surgical products  Biotrue ONEday lens  medical device systems for aesthetic applications  and Bausch   Lomb Ultra  a contact lens 

Additionally  the company offers Tobramycin and Dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension for steroid responsive inflammatory ocular conditions  Cardizem CD to treat hypertension and angina  and Latanoprost for the treatment of glaucoma  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  Inc  was founded in 1983 and is headquartered in Laval  Canada  


Valeant Pharmaceuticals represents a second example of accelerating earnings growth since 2010  Even though the company has experienced P E ratio expansion thus far in 2015  I believe the company is still soundly valued based on earnings potential 



The biggest negative I find with this candidate is its high debt to capital ratio of 79   However  accelerating cash flow generation supports the company s ability to service the debt  and as we will see with the follow up slide presentation  the company is committed to reducing its debt moving forward 



Once again we see an example of extraordinary historical performance as a result of strong operating results  The total return potential from investing in growth stocks is powerful and significant  and not related to general stock market returns 



On a short to intermediate term basis  Valeant may be moderately overvalued  However  thanks to the power of compounding  the company still offers the potential for total returns exceeding 20  per annum out to 2017 



Once again the analyst scorecard summary indicates a high success rate for analyst forecasts made one year and two years prior to actuals  Consequently  this provides some evidence that current forecasts may be reasonable and accurate 



In contrast to what we saw with Actavis  long term  3 5 year  analyst forecasts are strong at over 20  per annum on average  Consequently  from a long term total return perspective  Valeant may be the strongest choice  However  that higher future return is somewhat less appealing based on the company s current debt load 



The following slides summarize the opportunity in front of Valeant  Note the discussions on cash flows and the balance sheet on the last slide  For a more comprehensive review of the full presentation   









Celgene Corporation  NASDAQ CELG 

Although my final candidate  Celgene  has the lowest historical growth since 2010 of the three  it has also had the most consistent double digit growth over a longer period of time  Consequently  although recent performance has been moderately lower than my first two examples  this is my favorite candidate of the three 

Short business description courtesy of S P Capital IQ 

 Celgene Corporation  a biopharmaceutical company  discovers  develops  and commercializes therapies to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases in the United States and Internationally 
It markets REVLIMID  an oral immunomodulatory drug for multiple myeloma  myelodysplastic syndromes  MDS   and mantle cell lymphoma  ABRAXANE  a solvent free chemotherapy product to treat breast  non small cell lung  pancreatic  and gastric cancers  POMALYST IMNOVID for the treatment of multiple myeloma  and VIDAZA  a pyrimidine nucleoside analog to treat intermediate 2 and high risk MDS  and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia  as well as acute myeloid leukemia  AML  
The company s products also include THALOMID for the patients with multiple myeloma and for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of erythema nodosum leprosum  OTEZLA for psoriatic arthritis  psoriasis  and ankylosing spondylitis  ISTODAX to treat cutaneous and peripheral T cell lymphoma  and FOCALIN  FOCALIN XR  and RITALIN LA products 
Its clinical stage products comprise oral anti inflammatory agents targeting PDE4  an intracellular enzyme that modulates the production of multiple pro inflammatory and anti inflammatory mediators  CC 122 and CC 220 to treat hematological and solid tumor cancers  and inflammation and immunology diseases  cellular therapies  such as PDA 001 and PDA 002 for Crohn s and peripheral arterial diseases  CC 486 to treat MDS  AML  and solid tumors  Sotatercept and luspatercept for the treatment of anemia  and CC 223 and CC 115 for lymphomas  hepatocellular  and prostate cancers 
The company has collaborative agreements with Novartis Pharma AG  Acceleron Pharma  Agios Pharmaceuticals  Inc   Epizyme Inc   Sutro Biopharma  Inc   bluebird bio  Inc   FORMA Therapeutics Holdings  LLC  MorphoSys AG  Acetylon Pharmaceuticals  Inc   OncoMed Pharmaceuticals  Inc   and NantBioScience  Inc  Celgene Corporation was founded in 1980 and is headquartered in Summit  New Jersey  


As previously mentioned  I favor the consistent growth that this company has historically achieved  But more importantly  and as we shall soon see  expectations are for future growth to continue at or above its historical achievements 



Celgene s debt to capital ratio is reasonable at 46  and supported by strong and accelerating cash flow growth 



Although historical performance since 2010 has been lower than my first two candidates  it is still extraordinary when compared to the average company 



Since we cannot invest in the past  only the future  the future growth expectations of Celgene are the primary reason I favor it over the other two candidates  Importantly  it appears that Celgene is soundly valued based on earnings growth estimates exceeding 25  over the next two years 

The one year forward and two year forward analyst scorecard for Celgene is also encouraging  The company has met or exceeded analyst estimates over 70  of the time 



Regarding longer term 3 5 year growth  Celgene is expected to grow faster than the previous candidates  Given this company s consistent historical record  I believe the potential for total annualized returns exceeding 20  are well defined 

The following slides illustrate the important and large opportunities that Celgene serves  For a more comprehensive review of the full presentation   









Summary and Conclusions

The three Pharma companies presented in this article offer intriguing potential for above average future long term earnings growth  Importantly  based on that earnings growth potential  each of them appear soundly valued at current levels  However and perhaps most importantly  their growth potential is  for the most part  independent of the overall economy  Each of these companies possess unique characteristics supported by the powerful demographic trend of an aging population 

Consequently  I believe it s worth putting concerns about the market or economy aside  and focusing instead on the opportunities that each of these big Pharma growth stocks offer  Finally  I remind the reader that I have not personally completed my research and due diligence  Therefore  I suggest that further comprehensive research and due diligence should be conducted  On the other hand  the long term total return potential of each of these candidates seems worthy of that effort

106323,327838,AGN,Tarnished Pharma Sector Can Still Shine  3 Stocks To Consider ,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
Big pharma is perhaps one of the world s most scrutinized business sectors  Its main goal is a bit of a conundrum create and provide drugs that maintain health and cure diseases  while at the same time profit from the entire costly enterprise  The challenge involved in balancing the two seemingly polar aspects of business and health is tricky  Sometimes they complement each other well  for example when a new blockbuster drug is developed and approved for common illnesses such as leukemia or chronic liver disease  both of which have new blockbusters scheduled to be released in 2016  by AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  and Intercept Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ICPT  respectively  and the medication s developers see their profits skyrocket 
But blockbuster drugs are harder to come by these days  and the expiration of patents often opens the door for cheaper  generic medication substitutes  badly hurting profits of the companies developing the new drugs  For this reason  some pharmaceutical companies have been engaging in a different kind of business model 
Of course  the best news from the pharmaceutical industry is another FDA approval triumph  but lately  pharma industry news has been rather bad  Back in August 2015  Turing Pharmaceuticals  then CEO Martin Shkreli decided to raise the price of Daraprim  a drug used to treat toxoplasmosis   after Turing acquired the medication  A  covering the sudden price hike sparked public outrage and numerous debates regarding the commercialization of healthcare and profit taking off lifesaving medicines and the seriously ill population that can t live without them 
Shkerli isn t alone  Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  also came under fire for the same practice during September 2015 price gauging  Leaders of the Democratic Party have called for a subpoena of the company s records  in order to examine its price setting processes  and on September 21  Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton  calling the practice  outrageous   That one tweet kicked off a bad week for the Dow Jones Pharmaceuticals Index  as it lost 8 5  between September 21st and September 28th 

Valeant Pharmaceuticals soon discovered that not all publicity is good publicity  The company s share price has lost over 74  from its high of  263 81 in August  It currently trades at  61 31  This past Monday  the company acknowledged a U S regulatory probe of its business related to fraudulent practices and misleading investors 

If these stories can teach us anything  it s that all that glitters is not necessarily gold  even and maybe especially in the pharma sector  Still  there s a deal brewing in the sector that we believe is already creating opportunities for savvy market players 
In late 2015  Allergan  NYSE AGN  agreed to an acquisition in principle by Pfizer  NYSE PFE   It s a much criticized mega pharmaceutical deal  but it continues to move forward 
The criticism stems from the view some have that by acquiring Ireland based Allergan  and moving business operations to that lower tax country  Pfizer s U S tax bill will be seriously cut via a loophole called tax inversion  President Obama referred to the tax loophole as unpatriotic and presidential candidates Clinton and Trump have also sounded off on the deal 

According to the terms of the deal  Allergan shares are priced at  333 24 a share  However  Allergan shares are currently trading at  288 67  potentially rewarding buyers today with a 15  return in the future 
The price discount reflects concerns of intervention by the U S Treasury which could block the deal in order not to lose the tax revenue  Still  the deal is expected to go through in the second half of 2016  and provide new markets for the merged mega company  which is set to become one of the world s largest companies  with a combined value of over  300 billion 
This is an exciting investments opportunity both in the short and long term  The quasi immediate return of price per share profits is enhanced by a larger  combined drug pipeline  The two companies claim to have over 100 drugs in mid to late stage development  in altogether different markets 
While Pfizer is focusing its development efforts on treatments for cancer  heart disease  and more conventional illnesses  Allergan is mostly focused on specialty markets such as cosmetics and dermatology  The merger will therefore not cannibalize sales of either company s list  which is both good and surprising news for the two big pharma companies 

Teva Pharma Industries  NYSE TEVA  is another beneficiary of the Allergan Pfizer deal  The Israeli company  valued at  57 5B  is set to acquire Allergan s generic drugs division for  40 5B  which would strengthen Teva s position as the world s largest manufacturer of generic drugs 
With a TTM EPS of 5 42  the company today trades at a P E ratio of 10 2  following a bad start to the year when the company s shares slid by 15   Teva s revenue has fallen YoY  and analysts expect Teva to post a small growth number in 2016  with an EPS expectation of  5 49  hence the discount price 
Its sclerosis drug Copaxone  which accounts for 20 percent of its revenue  is now facing competition from Novartis  NYSE NVS   and is another source of worries for the company and its shareholders  However  2017 and beyond should be brighter for the drug maker  with growth expected to continue at about 7  annually 
Moreover  the company  a free cash flow of 20 to 25 billion according to CEO Erez Vigodman  allowing it to continue making moves to cement its position in the pharmaceutical industry  With its standing as market leader strengthened within the generic drug market and a relatively low P E  Teva should be near the top of your list if you have the patience to wait a bit for larger gains down the road ",2016-03-07,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tarnished-pharma-sector-can-still-shine;-3-stocks-to-consider-200120645,200120645
106324,327839,AGN,Allergan s Inversion Headache,opinion,"This pharmaceutical is having an incredibly hard day in the market today    and for good reason  The company is the center of actions made by the U S  Treasury as well as the IRS  Today  we ll talk about those actions  why they are hitting AGN so hard  and what we can expect to see moving forward 
US Treasury And IRS Make Moves Hurt AGN
Allergan s  NYSE AGN  latest problem stems from moves made by the United States Treasury as well as the IRS  These agencies have issued temporary restrictions as well as proposed regulations to further reduce the benefit of and limit the number of corporate tax inversions  This is a major hit to AGN as the company is the product of several acquisitions and  ultimately  tax inversions to reduce costs in a big way for the company  However  the biggest effect of this action is likely an issue with the agreement between AGN and Pfizer  NYSE PFE   The truth is that  by limiting inversions  the merger between AGN and PFE will likely have incredibly high costs  Recently  BMO Capital analyst Alex Arfaei gave his opinion with regard to this issue  and he said it much better than I could 

Under current law  an inverted company is subject to potential adverse tax consequences if the shareholders of the former U S  parent  in this case current PFE shareholders  end up owning at least 60  of the shares of the new foreign parent  Therefore  we believe that the tax benefits of the PFE   AGN merger will likely be significantly diminished based on the Treasury s recent actions  If Pfizer is not able to invert and repatriate its ex U S  cash in a tax efficient manner to repurchase a significant portion of the 4 7Bn new shares it will be issuing to buy AGN  then we doubt that the current deal structure  and implied valuation for AGN  would make sense for PFE shareholders  If Pfizer still chooses to pursue Allergan for other strategic reasons  e g  to setup a split  our initial view is that the deal structure needs to be significantly revised 

Market Reaction
We all know that the news moves the market and  unfortunately  the news that was released late yesterday was incredibly bad for AGN  As a result  we re seeing a big reaction in the market today  Currently  10 11   the stock is trading at  232 50 per share after a loss of  45 05 per share or 16 23  thus far today 
What To Expect
Moving forward  things are incredibly uncertain at the moment  In the short term  Allergan is likely to see some struggles as the company s deal with Pfizer is likely to go down the tubes  Even if it ends up that the deal will continue forward  chances are that we will see big changes  and the pie won t be as sweet for the company  As a result  we re likely to see further declines in the short run  However  in the long run  I have an incredibly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from AGN  The reality is that the company has a long line of incredible products  not to mention the prospective products it is working on  With strong products  strong management  a strong team  and a decent amount of money to keep the ball rolling  I m expecting to see long run gains out of AGN however this plays out ",2016-04-05,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allergan's-inversion-headache-200124063,200124063
106325,327840,AGN,Waiting For Earnings,opinion,"Four weeks of corporate earnings are about to hit the market like an Arctic wind  As you brace yourself for the data  you will note that while stock prices have lifted into earnings season  expectations are still on ice  The strong U S  dollar versus a year ago  combined with weak bank earnings and very weak energy earnings  have done their job to lift negative preannouncements to recent highs and keep optimism in check  With investors not overweight risk  and the pain trade looking higher  a few well placed earnings beats or signs of optimism could cause a stampede into stocks  We are always a bit anxious going into earnings season  but it feels a bit more on edge this quarter with the Fed now looking determined to delay on interest rate increases  The other cross winds to keep an eye on right now are the weakening U S  dollar  which will help future earnings comparisons  and the rising interest in Emerging Market currencies  debt and equities  after 6 years of underperformance   Good luck with your earnings season 

The spike in negative preannouncements keeping expectations in check 

 FactSet  94 S P 500 cos  have issued negative EPS guidance for Q1  second highest total in 10 yrs  

Looking at where the markets interest lies  Gold Mining stocks  NYSE GDX  continue to be in demand with solid buying volumes 

International Treasury Bonds  NYSE BWX  also remain a focused area due to the weak U S  dollar and flight to a safety trade with overseas assets 

About that weakening U S  dollar 2014 levels look to be in store which would be welcome to global commodity players  as well as U S multinational earnings 



Besides U S  dollars  the market also dislikes Bank Stocks  NYSE KBE  

Trading revenues stink  Net Interest Margins stink  Credit will only deteriorate  Regulation continues to get worse  the Government continues to block announced M A and Factset is looking for Q1 EPS to fall 8 5   Does anyone see light at the end of this tunnel 

Speaking of M A   350b  in deals now canceled with the Pfizer  NYSE PFE  Allergan  NYSE AGN  deal sent back 


Trends in the Asset Management industry continue to amaze 
A striking 18 Morningstar 500 funds suffered outflows of at least 40  of assets under management in the trailing 12 months ended February 2016  61 shed 25  or more  and 168 had outflows of 10  or more 


If a Mutual Fund company wanted to get rid of all of its customers and financial advisors  I would recommend pay in kind for all redemptions 

When Tom Bentley tried to pull his money from a mutual fund troubled by its large stake in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  NYSE VRX    he instead received shares in a Springfield  Mo  auto parts retailer 
Sequoia Fund Inc  sent the retired computer hardware engineer about 5  of his money in cash and the rest was stock in one company O Reilly Automotive Inc  Mr  Bentley said he sold the shares as soon as they appeared in his account on April 7  but they had already dropped in value 
 It has been pretty horrendous   Mr  Bentley said 
Typically  mutual fund investors expect cash instead of stock when they ask for their money back  But investors seeking to pull large sums from Sequoia are getting a combination  according to people familiar with the matter 


If you have NFL clients  make certain that they are maxing out their 401 k  program  If you have other pro athlete clients  check to see if their league 401 k  is as lucrative 

The NFL has one of the best 401 k  programs in the country  according to Kerney  Players are automatically enrolled  and can put in up to  18 000 a year  unless they re a rookie or on a practice squad   And the league will put in two dollars for every dollar a player puts in   up to  13 000  So a player can set aside  44 000 a year in the plan   18 000    26 000

I bet that your elementary schooler will not need a driver s license  But don t only listen to me  read what the former Corp VP of R D and Planning at General Motors  NYSE GM  thinks 

 Driverless vehicles are not a fairy tale   Burns said at the AIC on Tuesday   I absolutely believe driverless vehicles are real  
Combined with the rise of electric engines and ride sharing services  driverless cars will eventually change the auto industry in profound ways  Imagine the end of driving  the internal combustion engine  car dealers  car ownership  and the car insurance industry as we know it 
Burns  who studied safety issues like distracted drivers while at GM  said autonomous cars have the potential to reduce accidents by as much as 94 percent  using integrated sensors  lasers  radars and cameras to make driving decisions and communicate with other vehicles 
 This is what we do with aircraft today   Burns said

106355,327870,AGN,Weekend Update  March 6  2015,opinion,"   VIX a rally above weekly mid Cycle resistance at 14 26 and Short term resistance at 15 77 put the VIX on a buy signal  SPX sell signal  A rally above Long term resistance at 16 77 and the Cycle Top resistance at 18 99 may put the VIX into high gear  
SPX has its first weekly loss since January 

SPX gave up all of its gains for 2015 as it reversed down to weekly Short term support at 2061 06  A further decline beneath that level confirms the reversal and beneath Long term support at 2000 05 puts the uptrend in jeopardy  The next decline may not be saved at Long term support as the last one did on January 29 
 Bloomberg     U S  stocks fell  with benchmark indexes tumbling the most in two months  as better than forecast jobs data fueled speculation the Federal Reserve is moving closer to raising interest rates 
The Standard   Poor s 500 Index fell 1 4 percent  the most since Jan  5  to 2 071 26 at 4 p m  in New York  The equity gauge lost 1 8 percent for the week 
 Investors are looking and focusing entirely on what the Federal Reserve will do in the coming months   Chad Morganlander  a money manager at St  Louis based Stifel  Nicolaus   Co   which oversees about  170 billion  said by telephone   Effectively good news in this data point supports the notion that they will raise rates in the not too distant future  That scotches the speculative fervor within the equity market  
NDX meets the upper trendline 

NDX tested the upper trendline of its trading channel on Monday but retreated into the week end The Composite Index managed to cross above its former high of 5000 00 for two days  but did not close above it 
 ZeroHedge  In the aftermath of Marc Cuban s op ed from two days ago  that the current second tech bubble is worse than the first dot com bubble of 2000  there has been much anguish by those deeply invested  on margin  in  bio tech stocks  to demonstrate that the Nasdaq at 5000  or Biotechs trading at 50x or 5000xP E  is perfectly normal and the global central banks   13 trillion in liquidity has nothing to do with it  Of course  the answer who is right and wrong on this issue will not be revealed until after the current bubble pops 
Luckily  there are some very clear clues 
Yield gives up all support 

The High Yield Index declined through the entire cluster of Model support levels  leaving the Cup with Handle formation the next target  The Cup with Handle formation has a very high probability of success The mainstream press has no idea what might be coming 
 NYTimes  Actavis Inc  NYSE ACT  is showcasing the value of being barely investment grade  The company  a drug maker that has been making many acquisitions  attracted huge demand this week for  21 billion of bonds it is selling at a mere notch above junk status  They yield less than a bigger and higher rated debt issue that Verizon did in 2013  Buyers of top tier debt can t help but keep looking further downward  Fears of deflation  government bond buying  slow growth and a lack of alternatives are squeezing interest rates in developed countries  Germany  for example  persuaded investors to pay for the privilege of lending to it for five years  The United States bond markets are a bit less desperate  The government here is paying 2 09 percent for 10 year debt That has left corporate issuers in a sweet spot  especially those edging toward junk  When Verizon issued  49 billion of debt rated BBB plus  it caused a stampede  There was more than  100 billion of demand for a yield of 2 25 percentage points over 10 year Treasuries  or a rate of about 5 2 percent at the time

 TheGuardian  The pound has hit a seven year high against the euro  bringing cheer for British holidaymakers but underscoring fears about the fragile European single currency as markets prepare for a flood of emergency electronic cash

The yen may make a deeper low 

The yen appears poised to make a deeper low  A sideways consolidation often leads to a continuation of the trend and it is down  This may last just a few more weeks at most  but if so  may decline as far as 78 00 
 Bloomberg     Japan s small and medium sized companies aren t feeling the benefits of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s reflationary policies  said the leader of a labor group that s fighting for pay increases 
The decline in the yen  which has slumped 29 percent since Abe took office in December 2012  is squeezing these companies through higher import costs  said Yukio Manaka  the president of the Japanese Association of Metal  Machinery and Manufacturing Workers 
 We are seeing raw material costs skyrocket because of the yen s depreciation  putting pressure on business performance   Manaka  59  said at a briefing in Tokyo on March 4 
The Nikkei Average appears to lose momentum 

The Nikkei appears to be losing upward momentum as it approaches its 6 year anniversary of the March 9  2009 low  It may continue rising to its anniversary  but the risk of a reversal is mounting  The Orthodox Broadening Top agrees with that outcome  since it represents a market that is out of control and has a highly emotional public participation  This may be the start of a dramatic decline that may be imminently due 
 JapanTimes  The Nikkei 225 average on Friday rewrote its highest closing level in 14 years and 10 months  boosted by purchases on persistent hopes for fund flows into global stock markets

U S  Dollar heading higher  but may reverse abruptly 

The US dollar appears to be in need of finishing Minor wave 5 before reversing back down  The rally may stop at 100 00  but seems to be targeting 101 40  This has been an extended rally and the Cycle is getting stretched  It s time for caution here 
 WSJ  The dollar pushed to an 11 year high against the euro on Friday  after a strong U S  jobs report solidified market expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates around midyear

USB in a shake out 

The Long Bond is doing a shake out of weaker hands in Wave  4  Since the end of January liquidity has been rotating out of bonds and into stocks and commodities as the Cycle inverted  The decline appears to be targeting weekly Long term support  currently at 143 60  Once accomplished  the rally in bonds may continue through mid year 
The Bond Vigilantes are back 
 WSJ  U S  government bonds suffered the biggest one day selloff since November 2013 as a solid U S  employment report stoked fears that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates in June 
Investors including hedge funds and portfolio managers shed holdings as they are worried that higher official interest rates from the central bank would undermine the value of outstanding bonds  Traders said the selloff reminded them of the  taper tantrum  during the summer of 2013 when the bond market was rattled by concerns of a pullback in the Fed s bond buying monetary stimulus 
 The selloff is seriously ugly and quite bloody   said Christopher Sullivan  who oversees  2 45 billion as chief investment officer at the United Nations Federal Credit Union   The U S  economy is poised to continue to be on an upward slope  A rate increase in June cannot be ruled out  
Gold breaks down 

Gold broke down beneath its January 2 low and appears to be capable of declining to or beneath its Cup with Handle formation  If so  the decline may last through the end of March 
 WSJ  Gold prices saw their sharpest drop in more than a year Friday  after data showing strong U S  job growth last month bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates around the middle of 2015 
Gold for April delivery  the most actively traded contract  fell 2 7  to  1 164 30 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange  That was the lowest settlement for the most active gold contract since Nov  13  2014  and the biggest drop for gold prices since December 2013 
For the year  prices are down 1 7   below the Dec  31 settlement of  1 184 10 for the first time 
Crude may be ready to rejoin the decline 

Crude appears to be st up to rejoin the decline  The shakeout attempt ran out of gas  There may be a mid month pause in the decline  but it appears capable of running through the month of March before another correction may be due 
 ZeroHedge  Don t look now  but the sharp slide in crude prices may be leading the proverbial sheep to slaughter  Investors have piled into the market s largest crude ETF over the last several months sending the number of shares outstanding to the highest level since 2009  We suspect many of these  investors  might be unaware that they re currently staring down the most severe decoupling between second  and first  month contracts in four years

Shanghai Index completing a reversal pattern 

The Shanghai Index fell back below weekly Short term support resistance at 3255 80 this week  confirming the retracement and resumption of the decline  The Shanghai Index may be in a panic decline that could last into May  The index had its final ramp on Monday and has been in decline since  Volatility is on the rise in China  despite massive liquidity injections 
 ZeroHedge  You wouldn t know it if you looked at the price of oil  but arguably the world s largest economy just unloaded a kitchen sink of fears  warnings  and downgrades on its economy  the most notable being 
 CHINA SETS 2015 GDP GROWTH TARGET AT ABOUT 7   from 7 5  in 2014 
In a report to be delivered to the government tonight  Premier Li Keqiang warned China may face more economic difficulties in 2015 vs 2014 and downward economic pressure is still growing  despite Western  analysts  proclaiming China fixed   The currency is weakening on the news and AsiaPac stocks are lower and as Chinese stocks open lower  despite hints at more easing   millions of newly minted  can t lose  Chinese investors begin to worry 
The Banking Index spiked  but no new high 

  BKX spiked higher today  but couldn t change its bearish outlook  This is the index that will lead equities and commodities in their next decline  The Cycles Model now implies that the next decline may last through mid April  Could this be a waterfall event 
 ArmstrongEconomics  The biggest problem we have with central banks is that they are run by academics with ZERO real world experience  This applies not just at the Fed  but most central banks with the lone exception of Bank of China  The greatest danger this presents is that the money center banks manipulate the central bankers during states of financial panic and they who are so frightened  they will do whatever the money center banks tell them
In the USA  there is nobody who would investigate the dark corners of the Federal Reserve being manipulated by the NY bankers who walk of water without ice  However  the system is much more open in Britain where the bankers do not control the courts as they do in New York City  Consequently  the Bank of England  BoE  is now being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office  SFO  for being  too  friendly with the money center banks during the crisis of 2008 
 ZeroHedge  Not  contained   Just six short months ago  the 2Y bonds of Austria s bank bank   HETA Asset Resolution AG   were trading well above par as the world and his mom reached for yield   6   in all the wrong places  Today  following the  spectacular development  over the weekend that the bank will be wound down due to the discovery of an  8 5bn  hole  in its balance sheet  the 2Y HETA bonds are trading below 50c on the dollar  at a yield of 54    This is indeed Austria s  Lehman  moment as for the first time in the new European  bail in  era  senior debt is getting a massive haircut 
 TheEconomist  BANKS are yet again in trouble not pure investment banks such as Lehman Brothers  or mortgage specialists such as Northern Rock  but a handful of huge global  network  banks  These lumbering giants are the woolly mammoths of finance  and if they cannot improve their performance they deserve a similarly grievous fate

106356,327871,AGN,Pharma Stock Outlook  Let s Make A Deal,opinion,Pharmaceutical Stock Outlook  Acquisitions   Deals in Focus  2014 turned out to be one of the most active years in the pharma sector where mergers and acquisitions  M As  and licensing agreements are concerned  While tax inversion deals were being actively pursued earlier  these cross border deals lost their luster considering new rules imposed by the Treasury Department Deal Making Frenzy Showing No Signs of Slowing Down Nevertheless  M As continue to play a major role in the pharma and biotech sector and are not showing any signs of slowing down  AbbVie s  NYSE ABBV   21 billion acquisition agreement with Pharmacyclics Inc  NASDAQ PCYC  is one of the biggest deals to be announced in recent times  The deal goes to show that lofty valuations will not deter large companies from pursuing acquisitions to boost their pipelines and product portfolios  Other major deals include the ones involving Actavis  NYSE ACT    Allergan  NYSE AGN    Shire Plc  NASDAQ SHPG   NPS Pharmaceuticals  Endo  NASDAQ ENDP    Auxilium  and Pfizer  NYSE PFE   Hospira  NYSE HSP   Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd  NASDAQ SLXP is currently being wooed by both Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  and Endo  Meanwhile  we expect small bolt on acquisitions to continue  In licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates have also increased significantly  Several pharma companies are focusing on in licensing mid to late stage pipeline candidates that look promising  instead of developing a product from scratch  which involves a lot of funds and time  Small biotech companies are open to such deals   most of these companies find it challenging to raise cash  thereby making it difficult for them to survive and continue with the development of promising pipeline candidates  Therefore  it makes sense for them to seek deals with pharma companies sitting on huge piles of cash  We recommend biotech stocks that have attractive pipeline candidates or technology that can be used for the development of novel therapeutics  Therapeutic areas attracting a lot of interest include central nervous system disorders  diabetes and immunology inflammation  The hepatitis C virus  HCV  market is also attracting a lot of attention  Another lucrative area is immuno oncology as these therapies have the potential to change the treatment paradigm for cancer    they basically use the natural capability of the patient s own immune system to fight the cancer  Major players in this field include Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY   Astrazeneca Plc  NYSE AZN   Merck  NYSE MRK  and Roche Holding Ltd  OTC RHHBY   Deals targeting immuno oncology are being inked by companies like Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE   Merck KGaA PK  OTC MKGAY   Bristol Myers  AstraZeneca and Incyte  NASDAQ INCY   Another trend witnessed recently is the divestment of non core business segments  Companies like Pfizer  Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT   UCB  Novartis AG  BA NVS   Glaxosmithkline  NYSE GSK  and AstraZeneca have all been a part of this trend  The monetization of non core assets allows these companies to focus on their areas of expertise  Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large pharma companies look to cut costs and streamline operations  Most of these companies like Allergan  Merck  Novartis  Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY   Shire and Sanofi  PARIS SASY  are re evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs with an unfavorable risk benefit profile  Products with Blockbuster Potential Gain Approval Several important product approvals as well as label expansions were gained last year  Gilead strengthened its position in the HCV market further with its combination treatment  Harvoni  gaining FDA approval  Harvoni is expected to bring in multi billion dollar sales for Gilead  The highly lucrative obesity market got a new player with Orexigen Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ OREX  Contrave gaining FDA approval  Meanwhile  it proved to be third time lucky for MannKind Corporation  NASDAQ MNKD  with the company finally gaining approval for diabetes product  Afrezza  The FDA also said yes to Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  s blockbuster hopeful Otezla and Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  s leukemia drug  Blincyto  Products like Medivation s  NASDAQ MDVN  Xtandi and Pharmacyclics  Imbruvica gained label expansions  Other highly anticipated treatments like Opdivo  metastatic melanoma   Viekira  HCV   Esbriet  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis   Keytruda  melanoma   Orbactiv and Dalvance  skin infections   and Zydelig  blood cancer  were among the 41 new molecular entities  NMEs  and Biologics License Applications  BLAs  approved last year  Meanwhile  so far in 2015  the FDA has approved 9 NMEs and BLAs Biosimilars Gaining Focus With the FDA approving the first biosimilar in the U S   Zarxio  a biosimilar version of Amgen s blockbuster drug  Neupogen   the floodgates have opened  While biosimilars have been available in the EU for quite a while  there was no regulatory pathway for biosimilars in the U S  Biosimilars should cut healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments  According to information provided by Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX   about  250 billion could be saved in the next decade  2014   2024  if biosimilars for 11 products including Neupogen  Avastin  Epogen  Humira  Neulasta  Remicade and Rituxan are approved  According to the company  Neupogen biosimilars alone represent potential savings of about  5 7 billion  However  at present  there is low visibility on the pricing of biosimilars in the U S  Unlike generics  which are sometimes priced at even a 90  discount to the branded drug  biosimilars are usually sold at a 20  30  discount to the price of the reference drug  So  it could be a while before biosimilar sales actually pick up and meet industry expectations  Apart from Novartis  companies like Merck  Amgen  Hospira  NYSE HSP   Biogen Idec Inc  NASDAQ BIIB  and Actavis are targeting the highly lucrative biosimilars market  Meanwhile  emerging markets remain focus areas with companies like Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   Pfizer  Merck  Eli Lilly  Glaxo and Sanofi all looking to expand their presence in India  China  Brazil and other emerging markets  However  while higher demand for medicines  government initiatives for healthcare  new patient population and increasing use of generics should help drive demand  we point out that emerging markets are also not immune to genericization Earnings Trends The Q4 earnings season is over for the medical sector  While the earnings  beat ratio   percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises  was 81 1   the revenue  beat ratio  was 69 8   Total earnings grew 23 9  compared to 15 5  in 3Q  while total revenue grew 11 9  in the quarter compared to 12 1  in 3Q  Looking at consensus earnings expectations for 1Q  earnings are expected to grow 10 5  and revenues 9   While results will be affected by negative currency movement  new products should start contributing significantly to results and increased pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should increase confidence in the sector  Overall  2015 earnings are expected to grow 9 7  and revenues 9 6   For a detailed look

106358,327873,AGN,Analysts Disagree Over Significance of Akorn  Inc s Financial Errors,opinion,"Akorn Inc  NASDAQ AKRX  announced on Friday that it will have to restate financials from 2014 due to accounting errors  Akorn warned that their financial reports for 2014  filed by KMPG  should not be relied upon  Though the pharmaceutical company affirmed its 2015 earnings per share guidance  the stock fell by more than 20  on Monday following the announcement 
Akorn identified the 2014 accounting missteps when reviewing financials for the first quarter of 2015  The miscalculations stemmed from understatements of rebates and other sales allowances  Though the company is still determining the exact impact of the miscalculations  initial estimates believe the errors resulted in a  20 million to  35 million overstatement of net revenue and pre tax income for the full year 2014 Consequently  Akorn warned investors that it does not expect to file its quarterly report by the SEC deadline  However  Akorn affirmed guidance for 2015 earnings  expecting to post adjusted diluted EPS between  1 88 and  1 98 
On April 27  Akorn announced recent executive appointments including Randall Pollard who was appointed Corporate Controller  In this role  Pollard will oversee all accounting and financial reporting 
Analysts weighed in on the impact the flawed accounting will have on the pharmaceutical company 
On Monday  analyst  reaffirmed a Buy rating on Akorn  though he did not provide a price target  Steinberg does not think the accounting errors will have a significant impact on the stock  He has rated Akorn once before on April 20  when he set a  56 price target for the stock  He was bullish on Akorn because he believed its clobetasol cream was more successful than that of Actavis  NYSE ACT  s 
Since David Steinberg has only rated Akorn once before on April 20  he has a 100  success rate recommending the stock with a  1  average return  Overall  David Steinberg has an 81  success rate recommending stocks with a  24 5  average return per rating 
Separately  analyst  of Piper Jaffray downgraded Akorn from Overweight to Neutral with a price target of  53  Amsellem commented   Though management does not believe the accounting issues will impact 1Q15 results  and it is sticking with its 2015 guidance  there is in our view far too large of a credibility gap to simply take those statements at face value   Amsellem believes the company has lost credibility to the point that Akorn must replace its CFO 
David Amsellem has rated Akorn four times since July 2012  earning a 67  success rate recommending the company with a  25  average return per AKRX rating  Overall  Amsellem has an 80  success rate recommending stocks with a  23 7  average return per recommendation

106383,327898,AGN,2 Stocks To Profit From As Corporate America Rushes Abroad,opinion,"Whenever Corporate America faces off with Washington lawmakers  one outcome is usually guaranteed Fireworks 
And the latest conflict   following a statement from President Obama and the Democrats last Thursday   is quickly shaping up to be a true battle royale  Be warned   This new policy not only demonstrates Washington s  Regulate Everything  culture  it also threatens the financial well being of America s corporations   and  in turn  your own wealth 
The Urge to  Invert 
These days  much of the sparks between Corporate America and Washington concern Uncle Sam sticking his grubby hands in the corporate cookie jar  and making off with obscene amounts of tax revenue 
Stifled by America s excessive taxation policies  a slew of companies have essentially expatriated from the United States in a process known as  corporate inversion  
It s a technique where companies restructure their businesses abroad  in hopes of reducing their tax burden  This includes re incorporating under a wholly owned international subsidiary  or simply buying a foreign company outright 
With their tax domicile then based in that country  the Internal Revenue Service can t touch their earnings 
The technique itself is nothing new  The first inversion deal was done in 1982  but the trend has set a record pace recently  as U S  companies   particularly healthcare and biotechs   divert overseas  as they battle for any competitive advantage they can get 
Those who ve done so are already reaping rewards  For example  Ireland has proved particularly popular 
New Jersey based Actavis  NYSE ACT  acquired Dublin s Warner Chilcott  NASDAQ  WCRX  in an  8 5 billion deal  and promptly  inverted  its business to tax friendly Ireland 
Chicago s AbbVie Inc   NYSE ABBV   recently just closed a deal with another Dublin based firm  Shire plc  NASDAQ SHPG  
Global medical device leader  Medtronic  NYSE MDT   shelled out  42 9 billion to buy Covidien plc  NYSE COV   which is based in Massachusetts  but incorporated in Ireland 
This year alone  we ve seen nine inversion deals finalized  Take that  Washington 
But as you d expect  politicians are eager to stop this practice  In fact  just last week  President Obama outlined his intention to close a loophole that allows companies to avoid U S  taxes by basing themselves abroad 
More specifically  Obama is supporting Democrat led anti inversion bills that would see companies with half their business in the United States be considered U S  domiciled for tax purposes  Quoted on Reuters  a White House official stated   We can t afford to wait to reform our tax code to deal with inversion   while claiming that inversion deals would cost the United States an estimated  17 billion in lost tax revenue over the next decade 
Of course  there s no guarantee that a bill will pass  But while the loophole still exists   and even amid Washington s attempts to close it   there s little sign of the trend slowing  U S  companies still want to get deals done to reap tax benefits while they still can   And naturally  they hope that a bill doesn t pass  
So which companies are ripe for the picking 
Inversion Investment  1  Bajan Bucks
If you re in the healthcare or biotech sector  and seeking a generous tax break  Barbados is a top destination 
Barbados is revered as one of the world s most corporate friendly tax havens  boasting 14 very favorable tax treaties with various countries   including the United States 
And it doesn t get much better than Concordia Healthcare Corp   TO  CXR   Why  Well  for a start  the firm is based in Toronto   which  in itself  makes the company an attractive proposition for American companies looking to  invert  
Second  it pulls in a large chunk of revenue from its Barbados based subsidiary  Concordia Pharmaceuticals  All told  Concordia Healthcare sports a blended tax rate in the single digits 
In fact  Concordia was close to finalizing an inversion deal with an undisclosed U S  firm in early 2014  But issues over the valuation ended the conversation 
This not only makes CXR an attractive corporate investment  but also a good option for retail investors  as it won t settle for anything less than its intrinsic value  And who can blame it  After going public as recently as January  Concordia s stock has surged from  7 80 to  36 70   a 370  surge 
As the inversion trend continues  Concordia remains a compelling target 
Inversion Investment  2  The Luck of the Irish
As I mentioned earlier  Ireland is a very popular place for corporate inversions 
Indeed  on July 14  Israeli newspaper  Globes  reported that Dublin based Perrigo plc  NYSE PRGO   which manufactures generic and over the counter drugs  had hired a team of investment bankers to help it consider a potential buyout 
The potential suitor  None other than  64 billion behemoth  Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT   Abbott is a well established worldwide manufacturer and distributor of healthcare products  with a segment of its business devoted to pharmaceuticals 
Perrigo shares shot up nearly 10  on the news 
Some argue that Perrigo isn t the right move for Abbott  But amid that debate  one thing remains undisputed  Perrigo is a prime takeover target 
Jefferies analyst  David Steinberg  notes that  Perrigo is an attractive candidate for certain strategic buyers  due to its durable  highly cash flow generative business model  
I agree  Over the last five years  Perrigo boasts a free cash flow  FCF  growth rate of 20 7  
But it s even more attractive when you consider the 10 year FCF growth rate of 25   This proves the company s ability to consistently generate money for expanding its business  paying down debt  and offering its  0 42 annual dividend per share 
And the fact that Perrigo operates in Ireland   a feat it accomplished through an inversion buyout of Elan Corporation   merely sweetens the deal  Why 
Because Ireland offers an extremely low corporate tax rate of only 12 5   It s a primary reason why AbbVie recently purchased Shire  The inversion deal will reportedly save AbbVie  8 billion in taxes 
In  Lew  of it All 
You can see why Washington isn t too thrilled with this recent surge in expatriation  All told  the future potential losses are massive 
According to Goldman Sachs  GS   United States faces nearly  40 billion loss of pre tax income from 2014 inversion deals alone 
U S  Treasury Secretary  Jack Lew  has urged Congress to crack down on foreign merger deals  citing  economic patriotism  as the main reason 
Give me a break 
My guess is that companies would choose being rich over being patriotic 
The Obama administration shares that concern  as it hustles to push through new legislation that will close the loophole and retroactively eliminate the tax breaks for most of this year s inversion deals 
We ll see how its efforts turn out  In the meantime  get in on the companies I mentioned while the getting s good ",2014-07-28,Marty Biancuzzo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-stocks-to-profit-from-as-corporate-america-rushes-abroad-220818,220818
106384,327899,AGN,Bullish Investors Jockey For Position As If Correction Is Over,opinion,"As many investors enjoy the final weeks of summer  some optimistic bulls seem to be positioning themselves well ahead of Labor Day in anticipation of a fall rally  Indeed  last week s action was impressive  After only a mere 4  correction  investors continued to brush off the disturbing violence both at home and abroad  and they took the minor pullback as their next buying opportunity  But was that really all the pullback we re going to get this year  I doubt it  But I also believe that nothing short of a major Black Swan event can send this market into a deep correction 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market overview 
Looking at the ten U S  business sectors  Technology  Utilities  and Healthcare each had a good week last week and are still the leaders year to date  while Energy fell back a tad  Notably  Basic Materials continues to show new life and is pulling away from the pack at the lower end of the performance scale    Industrial  Financial  Consumer Goods Staples  Consumer Services Discretionary  and Telecommunications 
U S  Treasuries continue to enjoy strong demand  even while the Fed continues to taper its bond buying activity  The U S  10 Year yield fell even further last week  closing Friday at 2 34   and the 30 Year last checked in at 3 13   Again  the strength in Treasuries is reflects global investors seeking the relative safety of the U S   given all the global turmoil  as well as an expectation that the Fed likely will not raise interest rates any time soon  Low rates entice businesses to borrow for expansion  hiring  and stock buybacks  and they support higher equity valuation multiples when low bond yields  and a low discount rate  are compared with future earnings in equities discounted back to a present value 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed Friday at 13 15  During the recent market pullback  VIX had spiked above 17  but soon fell back to as low as 12 on Friday morning during the early continuation of the market rebound  However  the Friday rumor regarding a direct Ukraine Russia military confrontation gave the VIX an intraday spike near 15 before settling back down  I said last week that if the VIX can stay below 15  bulls should be able to make a good upside run  and indeed they have  certainly aided by some option expiration week short covering 
Corporate earnings reports have been quite strong  and about two thirds of the S P 500 companies have beaten analyst estimates  which is a greater beat rate than normal  And rather than relying on cost cutting and productivity gains  top line revenue growth for 2Q 2014 was up  4 4  versus 2Q 2013 for the S P 500 large caps and  2 7  for the 30 Dow Jones Industrials blue chips  while small caps overall have reported revenue growth of over  11  
By the way  Sabrient s Baker s Dozen top stocks for 2014 appear to be making a move to pull away from the benchmark performance  Former laggard NetApp Inc   NASDAQ NTAP  certainly helped the cause with a strong earnings report  and others among the laggards are starting to show some juice  including Huntington Ingalls Industries  NYSE HII   Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC   Jazz Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ JAZZ   and Express Scripts   NASDAQ ESRX   The notable exception is Ternium S A   NYSE TX   But the top performers since January 13 inception  7 months  are NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI   Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   Arris Group  NASDAQ ARRS   Actavis plc  NYSE ACT   and Archer Daniels Midland  NYSE ADM  
Yes  the U S  economy has a lot going for it right now  but it is not immune to the global unrest  Between global central banks injecting liquidity and global investors seeking safe havens for those monies  the U S  has been the prime beneficiary 
However  I can t help but observe the similarities between what is going on with  for example  the Israeli Palestinian conflict  and what we are seeing right here on U S  soil in Ferguson  MO  I won t go into all the details on my mind  but in both cases  one of the fundamental problems is the widening income and opportunity gap between the haves and have nots    including legions of young men with more testosterone than education and productive skills  Whether they turn to gangs  crime  or extremism  the end result is inevitably violence  anarchy  police actions  and racial or religious conflict  This drains precious resources  dissuades local investment  and hinders economic progress everywhere 
Social programs that seek only to alleviate the suffering of the disenfranchised usually carry the by products of dependency  an entitlement mentality  breakdown of the family unit  and further disenfranchisement    in other words  an endless cycle of poverty and exclusion  I certainly don t have the answers  but creating real hope and opportunity for all is the only long term solution  And at least here at home  this starts with each of us taking personal responsibility for the actions and welfare of ourselves  our families  and our communities  What happens in Gaza or in Ferguson or outside your front door is not just a problem for President Obama or the local police chief  It is everyone s problem 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed last Friday at 195 72  which is up nicely from the prior Friday  After the 100 day simple moving average held during the prior week and the oscillators turned up  I predicted last week that we could see a nice rally  and indeed we did  SPY now sits smack dab in the middle of the long standing bullish rising channel and right on the confluence of the 50 day SMA with prior support turned resistance at 196  So  we will see early this week whether there is yet enough bullish conviction  and volume  to push the market higher at this point  Additional support levels are nearby  including resistance turned support lines at 190 and 187 5  and the lower line of the bullish rising channel at 188  followed by the critical 200 day SMA around 187  Oscillators RSI and MACD look like they could run further to the upside  whereas the Slow Stochastic might be signaling a brief consolidation is in order first 

The Russell 2000 small cap index closed Friday at 1141 65 and appeared to have been turned back at what I expected would be tough resistance from the convergence of both its 100  and 200 day SMAs  As I said last week  how it behaves at this test of resistance might be a tell tale sign for the market overall  Thus  the SPY might struggle around the 50 day SMA for a while  But I doubt there is anything short of a major Black Swan event that can send this market into a deep correction  So  if and when bulls can get it in gear and rally back toward the top of the bullish rising channel  the 200 level for the SPY will be extremely tough resistance 
Latest sector rankings  
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  NYSE IYF   Technology  NYSE IYW   Industrial  NYSE IYJ   Healthcare  NYSE IYH   Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK   Consumer Services  NYSE IYC   Energy  NYSE IYE   Basic Materials  NYSE IYM   Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ   and Utilities  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 
   Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1   Technology still holds the top spot with an Outlook score of 81  The sector displays solid scores across most factors in the model  including solid Wall Street analyst sentiment  net upward revisions to earnings estimates   a good forward long term growth rate  and strong return ratios  The forward P E is below average  Financial has the lowest   as well as insider sentiment  open market buying   Healthcare remains in the second spot this week with a score of 76 as the sector continues to display the strongest  and still improving  sell side analyst sentiment  upward revisions   a good forward long term growth rate  and reasonable return ratios  Utilities fell back in the pack this week just as suddenly as it jumped up last week  Last week s strong price performance coupled with a low forward long term growth rate made the forward valuation for Utilities a little less attractive this week  Instead  Energy has returned to the third spot  largely due to an improvement in sell side sentiment  Financial and Consumer Goods Staples round out the top five 
2   Telecom stays in the cellar this week with an Outlook score of 9  as the sector has low scores on most factors in the model  Consumer Services Discretionary stays in the bottom two with a score of 14  despite a strong forward long term growth rate  Telecom  Basic Materials  and Consumer Services Discretionary continue to take the brunt of the downward earnings revisions from sell side analysts 
3   Looking at the Bull scores  Healthcare again displays the strongest score of 59  while Utilities remains the clear laggard at 39  The top bottom spread has widened to 20 points  reflecting low sector correlations on particularly strong market days  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the all boats lifted in a rising tide mentality that dominated 2013 
4   Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities is the clear leader again with a score of 64  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  Telecom also has shown good relative strength during market weakness  Energy continues to display the lowest score of 41  The top bottom spread is 23 points  reflecting low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5   Healthcare displays the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Telecom is clearly the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Healthcare is the clear leader  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Energy  which at times has displayed the best Bull Bear combo score  shows the worst one now  indicating general investor avoidance during extreme conditions 
6   Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings continue to look neutral to me  although there are some signs of bullishness  Utilities has fallen back down the rankings while Energy has risen  but for the most part  defensive and economically sensitive sectors are mixed about in the rankings with no clear direction emerging  and the leadership of Healthcare is not highly inspiring 
These Outlook scores represent the view that the Technology and Healthcare sectors are relatively undervalued  while Telecom and Consumer Services Discretionary may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or bearish   suggests holding Technology  Healthcare  and Energy  in that order  in the prevailing neutral climate   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be neutral from a rules based standpoint when SPY is below its 50 day simple moving average while staying above its 200 day SMA  At the moment  SPY is sitting right on its 50 day but hasn t yet confirmed a breakout back above it   
Other highly ranked ETFs from the Technology  Healthcare  and Energy sectors include First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund  NASDAQ TDIV   iShares US Healthcare Providers ETF  NYSE IHF   and Market Vectors Oil Services ETF  ARCA OIH  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within Technology  Healthcare  and Energy  some long ideas include Open Text Corp  NASDAQ OTEX   Intuit Inc  NASDAQ INTU   Centene Corp  NYSE CNC   HCA Holdings  NYSE HCA   Cameron International  NYSE CAM   and National Oilwell Varco  NYSE NOV   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score within the top two quintiles  lowest accounting related risk  of our   a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  We have found EQR quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
However  if you think the market will continue to strengthen and you prefer to maintain a bullish bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Healthcare  Technology  and Energy  in that order   But if you have a bearish outlook on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Healthcare  and Technology  in that order

106385,327900,AGN,Stock Market Breakout  Not So Fast,opinion,"Was that really a breakout  With the S P 500 struggling around the 2 000 level for the past two weeks  Friday s strong finish might seem like a bullish breakout  But the market has already given us a couple of false breakouts at this level  and although I see higher prices ahead  I m still not convinced that we have seen all the near term downside that Mr  Market has in store  particularly given we are now in the historically weak month of September  Also  the improving economy is a double edged sword from an equity investor s perspective as they are concerned that the Fed might feel the need to raise rates sooner than currently planned 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market overview 
Yes  we are entering the historically weakest month of September  at least according to Stock Trader s Almanac  However  the reality is that the average monthly loss is only  0 5   and nearly half of the time the market finishes positive  Moreover  recent performances have bucked the averages  with solid gains in September the past two years and a robust  8 8  in 2010 
There is no doubt that the U S  economy is strengthening while central banks flood world markets with liquidity  and global investors look to U S  stocks and Treasuries for the unusual combination of more safety and higher returns  Hiring has surged starting with lower wage jobs but also with the expectation that higher wage jobs will soon follow  Corporate profits are at record highs and stock buybacks are raging  Also  oil prices have fallen as domestic production continues to rise  The European Central Bank has joined the other major central banks in lowering interest rates and launching its own version of quantitative easing  and much of that new liquidity should find its way into the relative safety of U S  stocks and Treasuries 
And don t forget  hedge funds are finding themselves way underweight in equities  After the ECB announced its stimulus program  David Tepper of hedge fund Appaloosa Management predicted that this signals the official end of the bond market rally  driving even more capital into equities  Although elevated  valuation multiples are not out of line given low interest rates and strong earnings growth expectations 
However  that doesn t mean that the stock market is destined to go straight up  There hasn t been a real 10  correction in nearly three years  which is twice as long as the typical interval between corrections  We are way overdue  Notably  leading sectors last week were defensive oriented Utilities and Telecom  which is not particularly encouraging to the bulls  And of course  ECB liquidity programs have little chance of making much difference in an EU in desperate need of major structural reform  although U S  equities will welcome the capital inflows  
The yield on the U S  10 Year Treasury fell to less than 2 4  during the summer and closed Friday at 2 46   so a significant weakening in Treasuries hasn t happened yet  In fact  Jeff Gundlach of DoubleLine Funds  who predicted this year s rally in bonds   has predicted the 10 year yield to remain between 2 2 2 8  for the foreseeable future  with the main risk being to the downside  So  there is still no consensus on the near term direction of Treasury bonds 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed Friday at 12 09 after taking a few stabs above 13 during the week and challenging its 50 day simple moving average  It has been gradually creeping higher over the past couple of weeks  Investors seem to be quite cognizant of historical market behavior during the month of September 
So  is VIX being kept artificially low to prevent it from reverting to its low term mean of 20  According to a  by Brian Stutland of Equity Armor Investments  a Sabrient strategic partner   monetary policy coupled with a strengthening U S  dollar has pushed money flow into both U S  bonds and stocks  and this enhanced liquidity has tamed realized volatility and equity movements  Nevertheless  he believes that the VIX has nowhere to go from here but up  although it could be a matter of days or months before it happens    VIX is not a timing signal 
Although we remain well overdue for a  10  cleansing correction  we also know that Q4 is traditionally strong for equities  particularly given the strengthening economy and global liquidity  So  whether or not we finally get a correction in the near term  buy the dips remains the mantra until proven otherwise 
By the way  Sabrient s annual Baker s Dozen portfolio of 13 top picks for the year is really starting to kick into gear  Because this portfolio represents a sector diversified group of our favorite Growth At a Reasonable Price  GARP  stocks without regard to timing signals  they usually take a few months to get going  and this year has been no different  Nevertheless  as of last Friday  the portfolio was up nearly  17  since its January 13 launch versus the SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY  performance of  11 7  over the same timeframe  Top performers include NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI  and Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   and Jazz Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ JAZZ  had a big  7  day on Friday  Portfolio performance is quite strong versus many other firms that publish annual Top Picks lists  as shown in  third party tracking site 
Also  there was an  on ETF com last week comparing the performance of the Guggenheim Defensive Equity ETF  NYSE DEF   which tracks our Defensive Equity Index  against the PowerShares S P 500 Low Volatility ETF  NYSE SPLV  as low volatility defensive oriented investments  DEF has been quite impressive 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  SPY  closed last Friday at 201 11  while the underlying S P 500 closed at 2 007 71   and seems to be showing the launch of a bullish breakout  Or is it 
Yes  it is above 200  but it has spent some time intraday below the 200 level virtually every day since it initially breached this psychological level  So  this is still within a consolidation range  The challenge remains recruiting enough new bullish conviction  and fresh capital  to break out in earnest  and that has not happened yet  I am certainly not convinced that a breakout has started  particularly as we just get started with the historically weak month of September  Moreover  the top line of the bullish rising channel is once again providing strong resistance  Like the price action  oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all looking neutral and could go either way from here

Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  iShares US Financials  NYSE IYF    Technology  iShares Dow Jones US Technology  NYSE IYW    Industrials  iShares US Industrials  NYSE IYJ    Healthcare  iShares US Healthcare  NYSE IYH    Consumer Goods  iShares US Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK    Consumer Services  iShares US Consumer Services  NYSE IYC    Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  NYSE IYE    Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM    Telecommunications  iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ    and Utilities  iShares US Utilities  NYSE IDU    Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 
  Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1   Technology still holds the top spot with an Outlook score of 92  The sector displays relatively solid scores across most factors in the model  including the best Wall Street analyst sentiment  net upward revisions to earnings estimates   a good forward long term growth rate  and strong return ratios  The forward P E is below average  Financial and Energy sport the lowest   but insider sentiment  open market buying  is now among the highest  Consumer Goods has taken the second spot this week with a score of 68 as the sector displays strong sell side analyst sentiment  upward revisions  and insider sentiment  as well as strong return ratios  Financial has risen to the third spot  followed by Healthcare and Industrial rounding out the top five 
2   Telecom stays in the cellar this week with an Outlook score of 2  as the sector has low scores on most factors in the model  Consumer Services Discretionary stays in the bottom two with a score of 20  despite a strong forward long term growth rate  Telecom and Energy have been hit recently with the most Wall Street downward earnings revisions 
3   Looking at the Bull scores  Healthcare displays the strongest score of 60  Telecom is the only sector scoring below 50  with a score of 43  The top bottom spread is 17 points  reflecting fairly low sector correlations on particularly strong market days  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the all boats lifted in a rising tide mentality that dominated 2013 
4   Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities is the leader again  but its score is only 54  which is lower than the 60 70 range it has been showing  Stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  Telecom also has shown good relative strength during market weakness  Energy continues to display the lowest score of 40  The top bottom spread has dropped to 14 points  reflecting higher sector correlations on particularly weak market days  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5   Technology displays the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Telecom is clearly the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Healthcare is the leader  followed by Utilities  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Energy and Telecom score the worst  indicating general investor avoidance during extreme conditions 
6   Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings continue to look neutral as defensive and economically sensitive sectors are mixed about in the rankings with no clear direction emerging  Also  all weather sector Healthcare displays the highest Bull score  which is not particularly exciting for a bullish investor 
These Outlook scores represent the view that the Technology and Consumer Goods Staples sectors remain relatively undervalued  while Telecom and Consumer Services Discretionary may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or bearish   suggests holding Healthcare  Technology  and Industrials  in that order  in the prevailing bullish climate   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based standpoint because SPY is above both its 50 day simple moving average and its 200 day SMA  
Other highly ranked ETFs from the Healthcare  Technology  and Industrial sectors include PowerShares DWA Healthcare Momentum Portfolio  NYSE PTH   PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio  NYSE PSI   Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF  NYSE SMH   and PowerShares Dynamic Building   Construction ETF  NYSE PKB  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within Healthcare  Technology  and Industrial  some long ideas include Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE EW   Actavis plc  NYSE ACT   Skyworks Solutions  NASDAQ SWKS   Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX   AECOM Technology  NYSE ACM   and Lowe s Companies  NYSE LOW   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score within the top two quintiles  lowest accounting related risk  of our    EQR    a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  We have found EQR quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
However  if you think the market has come too far and you prefer to maintain a neutral bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Technology  Consumer Goods Staples  and Financial  in that order   But if you have a bearish outlook on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Technology  and Consumer Goods Staples  in that order

following is reorganized  edited and summarized from the full S 1 referenced above    Business FOMX is a clinical stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing its proprietary minocycline foam for the treatment of acne  impetigo and other skin conditions    Market According to the American Academy of Dermatology  acne affects approximately 40 to 50 million people in the U S  alone  approximately 10 million of whom suffer from moderate to severe acne according to the Journal of Investigative Dermatology    The U S  market for branded prescription drugs for acne was estimated to be approximately  2 6 billion for the 12 months ended March 31  2014  of which  1 0 billion was attributed to oral antibiotics such as Solodyn  the current standard of care for moderate to severe acne  and the remaining  1 6 billion was attributed to topical drugs such as Epiduo and Aczone  which are used to treat mild acne    Technology platform FOMX developed FMX101 and FMX102 using its proprietary technology  which includes its foam based platforms    This technology enables FOMX to formulate and stabilize a wide variety of drugs and deliver them directly to their target site    FOMX s foam platforms have significant advantages over alternative delivery options and are suitable for multiple application sites  creating a potential pipeline of products across a range of conditions to drive future growth    Lead product candidates   clinical trials FOMX s lead product candidates  FMX101 for moderate to severe acne and FMX102 for impetigo  are novel topical foam formulations of the antibiotic minocycline  FOMX s clinically and statistically significant Phase II clinical trial results demonstrate that FOMX s minocycline foam  FMX101  provides a faster  more effective treatment than the reported results for oral minocycline  the current standard of care for moderate to severe acne  and does so with fewer side effects    Based on these results  FOMX believes that FMX101 has the potential to become the new standard of care for the moderate to severe acne market    FMX101 for moderate to severe acne     FMX101  a 4  minocycline foam formulation for moderate to severe acne  is its lead product candidate    In 2013  FOMX completed a dose ranging Phase II clinical trial of FMX101 in Israel  involving 150 patients aged 12 to 25 with moderate to severe acne    This trial demonstrated both clinically and statistically significant efficacy versus the control placebo group  with FMX101 reducing inflammatory acne lesions by 71  in only six weeks and non inflammatory lesions by 73  in 12 weeks  In addition  no drug related systemic side effects were observed    Phase II clinical trial for FMX102 FOMX has also completed a Phase II clinical trial for FMX102  and based on its efficacy and safety profile  FOMX believes it will present an attractive option for the treatment of impetigo  including impetigo caused by methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  or MRSA    FOMX expects to commence pivotal Phase III clinical trials for both product candidates in 2015    License agreements In addition  FOMX has entered into development and license agreements relating to its technology with various pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer AG NA  XETRA BAYGN   Intendis   Merz Pharmaceuticals  LLC and Actavis Inc  NYSE ACT   which  from FOMX s inception to June 30  2014  have generated approximately  14 7 million in revenues    The agreements may entitle FOMX to an additional aggregate amount of up to approximately  30 million in contingent payments if certain conditions are met    FOMX is further entitled to royalties from net sales of the licensed products  or  in certain cases  from net profits generated by them  if they are approved for marketing by the relevant regulatory authorities and commercialized by the licensees    Dividend Policy No dividends are planned    Intellectual Property FOMX s most important patent is its U S  patent relating to its lead product candidates  FMX101  FMX102 and FDX104  which is expected to remain in effect until 2030    This patent comprises a claim to a formulation of a tetracycline antibiotic which can include minocycline or doxycycline    FOMX s other patents granted in the U S  have claims relating to certain formulations of its foam platforms and other technology  including emulsion foams  hydrophobic foams and aqueous foams    As of August 31  2014  FOMX s continuous effort in protecting and fortifying its unique intellectual property has yielded a patent portfolio of 70 granted patents in certain countries worldwide  including 31 granted patents in the U S    Additionally  as of August 31  2014  FOMX had 114 pending patent applications worldwide  of which 60 are pending in the U S  describing and claiming its multiple foam based platforms and other technology    FOMX has several composition of matter patent applications pending in relation to FMX101  FMX102 and FDX104 in the U S  as well as one pending in each of the following international markets  Australia  Brazil  Canada  China  the European Union  India  Israel and Mexico  FOMX s other pending applications relate to various foam platforms such as emulsion foam  hydrophobic foam  hydro alcoholic foam and water free foams  as well as specialty foams  such as potent solvent foams  and FOMX s recently developed  metered dose dispenser  for controllable dosing    Competition As more companies develop new intellectual property in FOMX s markets  the possibility of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit FOMX s products or potential products increases  which could lead to litigation    In addition  FOMX faces competition from the current standard of care    The current standard of care for moderate to severe acne includes oral antibiotic drugs such as Solodyn  Doryx  Dynacin and Minocin  in which minocycline or doxycycline are the active ingredients  occasionally in combination with topical anti acne drugs such as Acanya  Aczone  Ziana  Epiduo  Benzaclin and Differin    The current standard of care for impetigo is the topical agent Bactroban  with Altabax being the most recently approved topical agent for such indication    The active ingredients in Bactroban and Altabax are the antibiotics mupirocin and retapamulin  respectively    The standard of care for moderate to severe rosacea are oral minocycline and doxycycline drugs such as Oracea  the most recently approved oral doxycycline drug for rosacea    The standard of care for milder cases of rosacea are topical drugs such as MetroGel and Finacea    However  based on its clinical trials  FOMX believes that FMX101 and FMX102 have competitive advantages over the current alternatives and have significantly less adverse side effects    5  stockholders Tamarkin Medical Innovation Ltd  21 1  Meir Eini Holdings Ltd  21 5  Amos and Daughters Investments and Properties Ltd

106388,327903,AGN,Bulls Expect Further Equity Gains  Looking For Strong 2015 ,opinion,"Another solid year for U S  equities came to a close  But it s not like everyone is jumping up and down with enthusiasm  which is a good thing  With plenty of bogeymen in the closet and under the bed  there is little in the way of irrational exuberance  Although some commentators noted that 2014 finished up much the same as 2013  there was really quite a bit of difference between the past two years  primarily in the way of lower correlations in 2014 as opposed to the all boats lifted environment of 2013 
Looking ahead  2015 looks promising for further gains  but not without bouts of volatility  In fact  it might look a lot like 2014  In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market overview 
As we see the close to yet another successful year for the U S  stock market  we can look back on 2014 and recall the many bogeymen that caused investor consternation  There was the end of the Fed s tapering of QE3  although maturing securities are still being reinvested rather than retired   There was the huge collapse in Crude Oil prices  and still falling today   causing major disruptions in global markets  Then of course we had the slowdowns in China  Japan  and Europe    and Greece is again in crisis mode 
There was major turmoil in Russia and the Ukraine  We witnessed the sudden emergence of ISIS as a terrorist organization with its own army  and social media savvy   There was the fear of Ebola spreading into a global epidemic  And here at home  we had the uncertainty surrounding implementation of Obamacare  as well as the mid term elections putting the GOP in control of both houses of congress  Did I miss anything 
The Dow Jones Industrials blue chips  the S P 500 large cap index  and the NASDAQ ended the year up about  7 5    11 3   and  17 4  respectively  while the S P Midcap 400 gained about  8  and the Russell 2000 small cap index gained only  3 7   The Russell 2000 made an attempt to break out above strong resistance at 1200  but ultimately failed  The NASDAQ at one point looked ready to challenge the 5 000 level for the first time in nearly 15 years  but couldn t gather enough bullish conviction before the year ended  The MSCI emerging markets index finished down  6   Defensive strategies like low volatility and dividend yield outperformed in a general flight to quality 
Still  with leadership from large caps and defensive strategies  total capital in U S  ETFs surpassed the  2 trillion mark  In addition  fixed income indexes rose in 2014 as long dated yields continued to decline despite the Fed s tapering of its quantitative easing  bond buying  
Among the ten U S  business sectors  the top performers for the year were Utilities   25    Healthcare   24    and Technology   19    and all spent a lot of time during the year near the top of Sabrient s forward looking fundamentals based SectorCast rankings  The worst performer by far was Energy  which is not surprising given the 50  haircut in oil prices  Also showing lackluster performance were Telecom and Basic Materials  which both spent a lot of time at the bottom of our sector rankings  Consumer Discretionary and Financial both showed good late year outperformance to make up some ground 
Economic reports continue to impress  at least domestically  Redbook weekly retail sales report showed a robust  5 4  year over year increase  Consumer confidence rose from 88 7 to 92 6  which is quite strong  Also  U S  manufacturing activity continues to expand despite the struggles of overseas economies 
Leading economic indicators are strong  job growth is the strongest since the  90s  and corporate profits sit at all time highs  Strong GDP growth is expected to continue into 2015 and beyond  which should propel equities to new heights  although the future for long term bond prices is not as clear  Although the near term will likely provide further flattening in the yield curve  eventually economic health will demand higher long term rates and a steeper yield curve 
The IPO market last year was the busiest since 2000  and the Healthcare sector was buoyed by FDA approval of the most new drugs in 18 years  including many high priced drugs that address rare conditions and orphan diseases 
For several years  oil production has been climbing in the U S  and Canada  and there has been a lot of recovery among oil fields in Iraq and elsewhere  In addition  rising demand in China and India and other developing nations have kept supply demand in balance  But North American production kept climbing far beyond expert predictions  while slowing growth and or recession in China  Japan  and Europe along with rising fuel efficiencies in the U S  led to reduced demand 
With traders and speculators no longer willing to keep the price artificially high due to geopolitical concerns  oil prices plummeted quickly  plunging much further than anyone thought possible  Sell side analysts covering the Energy sector began slashing earnings projections once it became clear that lower prices were likely here to stay 
But asset classes tend to overshoot in both directions  and I believe we will see oil stabilizing soon  Energy stocks are highly dependent on oil prices and might be dead money for the foreseeable future  but it is not a bad idea to begin accumulating them in long term accounts  particularly those stocks paying a reasonable dividend with hedges in place 
And the toll taker type companies with locked in pricing  including pipeline MLPs   which were the proverbial babies thrown out with the bathwater  might be the best long term accumulation targets of all  Although oil prices may decline further in the near term  they likely will return to a more normal trading range  And in any case  the overall impact is positive for virtually all other segments of the economy 
It is said that bull markets don t die of old age but rather from euphoria  in which valuations get totally out of whack  or when the economy falls into recession  And there seems to be nothing that can prevent a strong 2015  However  there is no denying the cautious and often defensive behavior of investors    as the little voice in the back of their heads tells them that something just doesn t feel right about it all  Bu this is healthy skepticism that is helping to prevent an unhealthy euphoria  a k a   irrational exuberance  
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed Friday at 17 79  which is still well above the line of complacency at 15  but below the important 20 threshold that suggests real fear  It is indicating heightened volatility and some lingering investor worry going into the New Year 
The U S  10 Year Treasury yield closed at 2 11   which is still quite low  indicating a continued flight to quality among global investors in spite of the Fed s desire for a normalization of interest rates  i e   higher fed funds rate and a steeper yield curve   Its 52 week range is 1 86 3 06  In addition  the US dollar continues to strengthen while the euro sinks to its lowest level since 2006 due to speculation that the ECB will soon begin a quantitative easing program by purchasing sovereign debt 
Any increase in interest rates here at home will serve to attract even more global capital into U S  Treasuries  This keeps lending rates down here at home  helping boost the housing market  but it also further strengthens the dollar  which makes it harder for those countries with the weaker currencies to pay down their debt 
While many are expecting the Fed to begin raising rates nominally sometime in the middle of 2015  the FOMC has taken a more dovish turn with its latest voter rotation  so some observers actually are speculating that we won t see a boost in rates until 2016  I think this scenario is entirely possible  But in any case  rates will not rise rapidly 
Of course  persistently low bond yields also serve to support higher P E multiples in equities  The forward P E on the S P 500 is only about 16  and the spread between the S P 500 earnings yield and the U S  10 Year yield is about 4  versus the historical norm of about 3   Also  robust stock buybacks are likely to continue for a while at the prevailing ultra low borrowing rates  which lowers the denominator in EPS and offsets new stock offerings and IPOs that typically serve to increase the denominator and dilute the overall profit pool  So  the market s forward valuation is still quite reasonable    particularly as corporate earnings continue to grow 
And with Q3 earnings season behind us and Q4 reports starting soon  sell side analysts are anticipating EPS of  29 92 for the S P 500 companies  which is an increase of  5 5  from Q4 2013  and total 2014 EPS growth is expected to come in at  7 5   compared with  4 5  for 2013  This would be the best earnings growth since 2011 s  14 3   Companies that generate real rising sales and earnings should outperform the speculative names  particularly in a global economy characterized by subdued demand and pricing pressures 
Yes  the U S  is the main driver of global growth  while Europe slogs along  Japan slides into recession  and the BRIC countries appear to be destined for their slowest pace since emerging from the Great Recession  This performance gap between the U S  and the rest of the world shows just how insulated we really are  Exports are just 14  of output  and big exporting countries like China  Germany  and Japan will be depending on us to help ignite their economies 
The New Year appears to be set to continue the path it set in 2014  The end of QE3 is allowing asset classes to perform according to their fundamentals rather than rewarding highly correlated risk on risk off behavior  Lower equity correlations  higher volatility  and a modest increase in U S  equity prices are likely in 2015  As a result  some market experts are suggesting greater exposure to long short  long hedged  and market neutral equity strategies 
One choice in this regard is a recently launched actively managed ETF    the First Trust Long Short ETF  FTLS   which employs as an input factor Sabrient s   a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  We have found EQR quite valuable both for identifying short candidates and for helping to avoid higher risk long positions 
As I predicted one year ago  2014 ended up displaying a general flight to quality among investors in which the best companies with the most sustainable earnings growth and reasonable valuations got the most attention  while the speculative high flyers that had been coat tailing on bullish exuberance lost their luster  Sounds like rational investing  But this apparently made life for a lot of portfolio managers difficult  In fact  the Financial Times reported that only about 10  of stock pickers beat their benchmarks  and Morningstar reported that only about 13  of actively managed large company mutual funds beat the S P 500 
However  Sabrient s annual Baker s Dozen portfolio of 13 top picks finished its sixth straight strong year  since 2009 inception   It was up about  22  since its January 13 launch while the S P 500 was up about  15  over the same timeframe  Top performers include Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI  NV  and Actavis plc  NYSE ACT  
And going into 2015  as we finalize our new portfolio  the top of our forward looking quantitative rankings once again reveals strength in airlines  semiconductors  and biopharma  Baker s Dozen represents a sector diversified group of stocks based on our Growth at a Reasonable Price  GARP  quant model and confirmed by a rigorous forensic accounting review by our subsidiary Gradient Analytics to help us avoid stocks at higher risk of issues that could result in a underperformance  It is packaged as a unit investment trust  UIT  by First Trust Portfolios  note  the new 2015 Baker s Dozen portfolio will launch on January 14  
Looking ahead  companies that generate increasing sales and earnings will outperform  particularly in a global economy characterized by subdued demand and pricing pressures  Moreover  removing the Fed s manipulation will eventually enable normalization to wider yield spreads  more profitable bank lending  increasing money supply  and robust economic growth 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed last Friday at 205 43 after hitting a new 52 week high at the beginning of the week  I am still hopeful that the December technical pullback down to the lower trend line of the long standing bullish rising channel was all the market needed in the way of a correction to avoid a more dramatic downside event in January  like the one we saw in Jan Feb last year 
Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all in a neutral position and could either cycle a bit further down to oversold territory or turn upward from here  The 50 day simple moving average  100 day SMA  and lower trend line have each provided reliable support levels over the past year  and should continue to do so 
Only the October news driven sell off violated all of these support levels before recovering quickly in a V bottom  Price closed Friday right at the 20 day SMA  and support follows at the 50 day near 204  the 100 day SMA near 201  and the lower trend line that is now approaching 200  There is a mid December gap acting as a bit of a magnet that could take price down to about 201 to fill the gap  which would correspond with the 100 day SMA  Overhead resistance could arise at the 52 week highs and then the upper trend line that is now approaching 211 


Latest sector rankings  
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs are used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  NYSE IYF   Technology  NYSE IYW   Industrial  NYSE IYJ   Healthcare  NYSE IYH   Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK   Consumer Services  NYSE IYC   Energy  NYSE IYE   Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM   Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ   and Utilities  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each ",2015-01-06,David Brown,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/bulls-expect-further-equity-gains,-looking-for-strong-2015-237510",237510
106389,327904,AGN,New Year Kicks Off With New Fears Keeping Investors On Edge,opinion,"As widely expected  the New Year has begun with plenty of volatility on high trading volume  as investors fear more than just a mild correction to start out the year  Despite the strong fundamentals here in the U S   there are plenty of dangers around the rest of the world  and many fear that our cozy comfort at home simply cannot remain insulated for much longer

Anyway  just when we all had grown accustomed to the old Wall of Worry and the scary bogeymen under the bed  there are new bogeymen peeking out from the bedroom closet  The new sources of worry are really bigger and scarier versions of existing ones  including the continued slide in oil prices  far further than hardly anyone believed possible   worsening recession and deflation in the Eurozone  leading to drastic actions   and the global metastasis of radical Islam  despite our successes in foiling their plots and destroying their infrastructure   News headlines seem to getting worse for both issues 
First  radical Islam has been with us for a long time  and of course it jumped to the forefront with 9 11  Today  splintered organizational infrastructures and terrorist training facilities have suffered highly publicized defeats by the skilled efforts of the civilized world  but each of these successes consumes an incredible amount of time and resources  while the hateful ideology continues to spread like wildfire around the world  with the helpful assistance of social media   I liken it to trying to fight a mosquito problem with a fly swatter  Sure you can swat a whole bunch of them  but the number you eradicate pales in comparison to the numbers that are proliferating in all those innumerable pools of stagnant water  Obviously  any long term solution will need to come from education rather than police action  But in the meantime  the impact on business investment  productivity  and consumer confidence is vast 
Oil prices have fallen beneath  50 barrel  and some observers see more pain ahead before finding a bottom and settling later this year into the  50 60 range   40 is generally considered to be the economic threshold for enhanced extraction techniques  This plunge in prices also has impacted the high yield bond market  which has lent heavily to oil projects  Nominal yields for junk bonds have reached 6 7  versus 5 3  just six months ago  which compared with the U S  10 Year Treasury yield of 1 8  is a wide  and enticing  credit spread 
The impact on petroleum exporting countries has been like a sledgehammer to their budgets but a boon to businesses and consumers everywhere else  Another bright spot from the fall in oil prices is that almost all of terrorist funding comes from oil revenues 
This sudden bear market in oil was created by a supply shock brought on by the tremendous success of enhanced extraction techniques like hydraulic fracking here in North America  coupled with the unwillingness of oil producers around the world to reduce production  The catch 22 is that as prices fall  they are compelled to make up the shortfall by producing and selling more  not less  thus worsening the situation  Scott Minerd of Guggenheim sees a lot of similarities between the current situation and the 1985 86 marketplace in which oil prices launched a recovery leading to tighter credit spreads  i e   rising junk bond prices  and a 20  rally in stocks within a year 
Indeed  the U S  economy seems to be firing on all cylinders  with improving consumer confidence  non existent inflation  further aided by falling oil prices   nominal GDP growth approaching 5   job growth the strongest since the 1990s  unemployment below 6   and corporate profits at all time highs  As Q4 earnings reports continue  the forward P E of the S P 500 is back down to a modest 16x  So far this earnings season  55  of the S P 500 companies that have reported have beaten analyst revenue expectations  and 77  have beaten earnings expectations  although projections have been largely revised downward  
GDP growth and falling unemployment should start to bring about wage growth  which will further propel consumer buying  Beneficiaries of lower oil prices include consumers  airlines  travel  hotels and fast food producers  In addition  although oil producers will struggle with lower revenues tied to energy prices  those involved in marketing refined products should do well  as demand remains steady for lower priced products that garner higher margins at the pump 
So  U S  equities appear to be a likely beneficiary  Nevertheless  volatility is likely to remain with us  as well demonstrated so far this year   so thoughtful stock selection is paramount rather than simply relying on a risk on  all boats lifted mentality of years past  Of course  stock selection becomes more critical as a bull market matures 
A continued flight to quality will favor companies generating strong free cash flow  increasing U S  sourced sales  displaying operational excellence and innovation  making shrewd capital investments  and using conservative accounting with solid earnings quality  This generally should favor Technology  Healthcare  and Consumer sectors  as well as larger  more established companies versus smaller companies with narrow business models  In other words  it looks a lot like 2014    with the exception that bond like Utilities will likely not be a top performer this time around 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed Friday at 20 95  which is above the important 20 threshold that suggests real fear  However from a technical perspective  it is displaying a series of lower highs in its series of spikes in mid October  mid December  and now mid January 
Also notable last week was the move by the Swiss National Bank to end its 3 year currency cap  which has sent the Swiss franc soaring versus the euro  while the dollar rose to an 11 year high against the euro  The ECB is widely expected to announce a massive bond purchase  quant easing  program this week in a desperate attempt to steer the Eurozone away from deflation  With oil prices falling so far  Europe s inflation rate has officially fallen below zero  Moreover  with the exception of Greece  sovereign debt yields are collapsing throughout the Eurozone  For example  10 year bond yields in Italy and Spain have declined below 1 9  and 1 7   respectively  and the mighty German bund is at 0 41   Thus  global capital continues to pour into the U S   making a strong dollar even stronger and further flattening the yield curve 
Despite the fact that only a small percentage of active managers beat their benchmarks last year  Sabrient s annual Baker s Dozen portfolio of 13 top picks finished its sixth straight strong year  since 2009 inception   It was up about  22  from its January 13 launch through year end  while the S P 500 was up about  15  over the same timeframe 
Top performers included Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   NXP Semiconductors NV  NASDAQ NXPI   and Actavis plc  NYSE ACT   and all three still rank highly in our models  The new portfolio officially launched last week as a unit investment trust  UIT  issued through First Trust Portfolios  and it looks very similar to last year s portfolio in its sector and industry composition  although only two stocks from the prior portfolio repeated into the 2015 portfolio  
Stocks from airlines  semiconductors  and biopharma continue to score among the top  along with a number of consumer names  Notably  few financial stocks  e g   banks  brokers  insurance  REITs  score near the top of our rankings  and so this sector is not represented in the portfolio this year  Baker s Dozen represents a sector diversified group of 13 stocks based on our Growth at a Reasonable Price  GARP  quant model and confirmed by a rigorous forensic accounting review by our subsidiary Gradient Analytics to help us avoid stocks at higher risk of issues that could result in a underperformance 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed last Friday at 201 63  which is down about  3 5  from its recent high in December  I had been hopeful that the December technical pullback down to the lower trend line of the long standing bullish rising channel was all the market needed in the way of a correction to avoid a more dramatic downside event in January  like the one we saw in January February last year 
We still haven t had an official 10  correction in three years  although the October pullback came close on an intraday basis   Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all in a slightly oversold position and could either cycle a bit further down to oversold territory or turn upward from here  The 50 day simple moving average gave up support  but price is now desperately clinging to the 100 day SMA and lower trend line  both have provided reliable support levels over the past year  
Shown on the chart below is the possible formation of a bearish head and shoulders pattern  with a head around 209 and a neckline at the lower trend line  which would project downside potential to 190  which would fill a previous upside gap in October  If current support fails  the next notable support level comes from the important 200 day SMA near 195  followed by the gap fill at 190  If instead price rallies from here  overhead resistance will come from the 50 day SMA around 204  the highs near 209  and then the upper trend line that is now near 212 
Latest sector rankings 
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
The outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  iShares US Financials  NYSE IYF    Technology  iShares Dow Jones US Technology  NYSE IYW    Industrial  iShares US Industrials  NYSE IYJ    Healthcare  iShares US Healthcare  NYSE IYH    Consumer Goods  iShares US Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK    Consumer Services  iShares US Consumer Services  NYSE IYC    Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  NYSE IYE    Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM    Telecommunications  iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ    and Utilities  iShares US Utilities  NYSE IDU    Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 
  Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1  Notably  all sectors recently have endured net downward revisions to Wall Street s earnings estimates  Technology ranks first with an Outlook score of 87  It displays the best return ratios  a good forward long term growth rate and forward P E  and relatively good sell side analyst sentiment  only slight downward revisions to earnings estimates   Healthcare is back in second place with a score of 75  displaying a strong forward long term growth rate  relatively good sell side analyst sentiment  slight downward revisions   solid insider sentiment  buying activity   and good return ratios  Financial is close behind in third place with a 72  followed by Industrial and Consumer Services Discretionary  This remains a bullish top five 
2  Energy continues to hold the bottom spot after the plunge in oil prices  Joining Energy in the bottom two is Basic Materials  as these two sectors have taken the brunt of Wall Street s downward revision to forward earnings estimates  and also display the lowest insider buying activity  Notably  Telecom has moved up to sixth place primarily on improving sentiment among both Wall Street analysts and insiders 
3  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy displays the top score of 60  followed by Basic Materials  Telecom scores the lowest at 49  The top bottom spread is only 11 points  which still reflects fairly high sector correlations during particularly strong market days  i e   highly correlated risk on action  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the all boats lifted in a rising tide  risk on  mentality 
4  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities displays the highest score of 58 this week  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  Energy has the lowest score of 41  The top bottom spread is 17 points  reflecting fairly low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  In other words  certain sectors are holding up relatively well while others are selling off  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5  Technology and Healthcare share the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Energy is clearly the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Healthcare is the leader  followed by Utilities  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Technology is the worst  somewhat surprisingly  indicating general investor avoidance  at least for the moment  
6  Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings look bullish to me  with the top five sectors all economically sensitive and growth oriented  or in the case of Healthcare  all weather   Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   moved to a neutral bias earlier in the year when the SPY confirmed a loss of support from its 50 day simple moving average  and it suggests holding Technology  Healthcare  and Financial  in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be neutral from a rules based trend following standpoint because on Friday  SPY remained between its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages  
Other highly ranked ETFs from the Technology  Healthcare  and Financial sectors include Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF  NYSE SMH   Market Vectors Pharmaceuticals ETF  NYSE PPH   and iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped  NYSE REM  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Technology  Healthcare  and Financial sectors include Tyler Technologies  NYSE TYL   Gartner Inc  Gartner Inc  NYSE IT   IDEXX Laboratories  NASDAQ IDXX   UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH   Jones Lang LaSalle  NYSE JLL   and Public Storage  NYSE PSA   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score within the top two quintiles  lowest accounting related risk  of our Earnings Quality Rank  a k a   EQR   a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  We have found EQR quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
However  if you prefer to maintain a bullish bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Healthcare  Technology  and Financial  in that order  And if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model suggests holding Healthcare  Utilities  and Consumer Services Discretionary  in that order 
IMPORTANT NOTE  I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio

106390,327905,AGN,Intellectual Property Company Boasts Strong Dividend,opinion,"The U S  economy is changing  Indeed  it already boasts far fewer brick and mortar stores and packaged goods than in days past 

And if we project this trend forward  we see the potential for companies whose entire rationale is the ownership of ideas  These companies would have a small staff and manufacture nothing  yet they d boast profits that are well worth an investment 

This is important for   because we need to focus on where the economy is going   not where it s been 

Accordingly  this week s opportunity is a company with trivial tangible assets beyond cash  In fact  it has just 10 employees  but it boasts an excellent dividend that s fully covered by earnings 

PDL BioPharma Inc  NASDAQ PDLI  was founded in 1986 to produce monoclonal antibodies  but in 2009  it changed its name and began managing a portfolio of patents and royalty assets 

With just 10 full time employees  as of late 2013   PDLI neither manufactures nor markets  Instead  it uses the expertise of its management to profit from intellectual property  IP   And the company has been profitable  indeed  In both 2012 and 2013  it made over  200 million in net income   and in the first three quarters of 2014  it had already brought in  267 million 

Best of all  the company s trailing four quarters P E ratio is a minuscule 3 6x  and it pays a generous dividend of  0 15 per quarter that equates to an 8 2  yield  Based on trailing earnings  that dividend is covered 3 3 times over 

Of course  there s a catch   as there always is when the numbers look that good 

You see  most of PDLI s income is derived from a collection of  Queen  patents relating to humanized antibodies that expired at the end of 2014 

And even though PDLI won a lawsuit against Glaxosmithkline  NYSE GSK  that will keep Queen patent income flowing until early 2016  PDLI needs to find replacement sources of income as soon as possible 

A Glimpse Into the Future

Luckily  the firm has a cash pile of about  280 million at the last balance sheet date  and it can use that cash to pursue new income opportunities  Plus  it s already invested around  780 million in new revenue producing assets  including deals with drug developers that effectively act as financing transactions 

For example  in 2013  PDLI invested  240 million for the right to receive royalty and milestone payments for sales of diabetes products licensed by Depomed Inc  NASDAQ DEPO   Under this agreement  PDLI will get all royalties until it has received twice the amount of money invested  after which it will split receipts 50 50 with DepoMed 

Another recent debt financing agreement with Durata Therapeutics  DRTX  had an interest rate of 14  for a five year term  And when Durata was acquired by Actavis Inc  NYSE ACT  in November 2014  PDLI received full repayment  accrued interest  prepayment penalty  and change of control fees 

Most recently  PDLI invested  66 million to purchase 75  of the University of Michigan s royalty interest in Cerdelga until the expiry of the licensed patents  The first payments under this deal are expected to arrive in the first quarter of 2015 

Ultimately  investors are relying on the skills of PDLI s very lean management to find and structure deals that make sense  And though there s little chance that future net income will equal the stellar levels of 2012 to 2014  I believe PDLI management will prove that they can find intellectual property deals that enhance shareholder value  allowing PDLI s substantial dividend to continue 

Over the longer term  PDLI appears to have a viable business model  After all  large companies   in pharma or elsewhere   aren t very good at innovating  Instead  this task is often carried out by smaller outfits with entrepreneurial management and little or no bureaucracy 

Of course  the smaller outfits need resources to get their innovations to market   and one way they can obtain these resources is by selling out to the big guys  But in the long run  this may doom their innovations  especially because management will have to deal with big company bureaucracy  

Alternately  they can license innovations to IP management companies like PDLI  which allows the innovators to remain small while giving PDLI returns from IP assets that far outstrip what s available in other financing businesses 

I believe this model for virtual business should become more common in the future  And in the meantime  PDLI s 8 2  yield and decent track record are worth looking at closely

106409,327924,AGN,EUR USD Moves To One Month Low Near 1 29,opinion,In the last 24 hours the Euro has reversed again and resumed its downwards move from the last week moving down towards 1 29  and in the process a one month low  It has also become evident over the last couple of days  especially on the 4 hourly chart below  that the 1 30 level is now providing some resistance and placing pressure on price  The Euro finished last week moving back down through the long term key level of 1 30  It did spend the last couple of weeks trading right around the 1 31 level and finding support and resistance at 1 30 and 1 32 respectively  however the former level has now been broken  In finishing last week below 1 30  it moved to levels not seen in over a month  Over the last month the 1 32 level has become quite significant and has been an obstacle to the Euro moving higher  evident in the right half of the daily chart below   During this time  it has had some periods of little movement followed by sharp bursts A couple of weeks ago  the Euro exhibited a classic pin bar reversal candlestick pattern which was indicating the significant selling pressure it experienced at any price above the 1 32 level and likely lower prices to follow  This reinforced the significance of the 1 32 level and how it was going to take considerable effort to move through there  On this pin bar  it moved to near 1 325 and to its highest level in more than two months  since the end of February when it was falling heavily from up near 1 34  Just as quickly  it has fallen away and now moved down to the one month low below 1 30  Prior to that  it was quiet and spent the most part of two weeks ago trading within a narrow range between 1 30 and 1 31  which reinforced how significant this two cent range was  In the middle of April the Euro surged up towards 1 32 and ran into a wall of resistance at that level  to then be followed by a sharp fall back towards the then support level at 1 30 Over the last month the Euro has done well to weather the storm through February and March which saw it fall sharply from around 1 37  although its decline over the last few days may be reversing this good fortune  Despite its strong rally in the first half of April  it was only a few weeks ago that the Euro dropped to its lowest level since the middle of November around 1 2750  so it did very well of late to move back strongly above 1 30  despite its recent lapse  The Euro has spent the best part of the last month consolidating above the key 1 30 and 1 29 levels after its decline throughout February  Over the last couple of weeks  the 1 30 level has been called upon again to prop up price  although it may have reversed roles now as it is providing some resistance to movement higher  Sentiment has completely changed with the Euro and the last couple of months has seen a rollercoaster ride for the Euro as it continued to move strongly towards levels not seen in over 12 months above 1 37 before falling very sharply to below 1 28 and setting a 14 week low a month ago The Euro moved lower after the release of disappointing German data  particularly ZEW Economic Sentiment  which was way below the estimate  Today s Eurozone numbers looked better  as Industrial Production climbed up and ZEW Economic Sentiment was within expectations  German releases have improved in recent readings  but any expectations that we would see the positive trend continue on Tuesday were dashed  Inflation numbers looked weak  as Final CPI declined by 0 5   matching the forecast  WPI also lost ground  dropping by 0 2   but this bettered the forecast of  0 3   The disappointment of the day was German ZEW Economic Sentiment  one of the most important German economic indicators  It posted a reading of 36 4 points  well below the estimate of 39 5 points  Today s Eurozone releases were stronger  as Industrial Production climbed to 1 0   beating the estimate of 0 6   Eurozone ZEW Economic Sentiment came in at 27 6 points  edging out the forecast of 27 3 points  The euro lost ground after the weak German numbers  and was trading in the 1 2980 range in the European  May 15 at 00 30 GMT 1 2933 H  1

range right around 1 2930 after having recently moved down towards 1 2900 and bounced off  Since the start of February  it has fallen sharply from new highs above 1 37  although it has experienced some strong rallies in that time trying to claw back lost ground  Current range  trading right around 1 2930 Further levels in both directions   Below  1 2900 and 1 2800   Above  1 3000  1 32000 and 1

106412,327927,AGN,AUD USD Lower Again To Below 0 99,opinion,The AUD USD has experienced its worst week in a long time which has seen it continue to move to new lows below 0 99  from highs above 1 0250  24 hours ago it did halt the slide a little as it consolidated and traded within a narrow range roughly between 0 9940 and 0 9960 however it has since moved to new 11 month lows below 0 99  It is likely the 1 00 level may now provide some resistance to higher prices as the AUD USD tried to claw back some lost ground  At the end of last week  it experienced its largest 24 hour drop in a long time falling strongly down through 1 02 and 1 01  It had an ordinary week last week as it wasn t so long ago it was moving up above 1 03  Up until recently  the 1 02 level was one of significance and presented as a long term support level however this has now clearly been broken  It had been showing some bearish signs over the last few weeks as it continued to place selling pressure on the 1 0220 and 1 02 levels and the RBA rate cut earlier last week was the catalyst for a strong push lower The last couple of weeks have seen the AUD USD establish a strong medium term down trend with lower peaks and lower troughs  as it has moved from near 1 04 down to below 1 in that time  In the previous few weeks  the AUD USD spent most of its time trading between 1 02 and 1 0360  During that time  it moved up to a two week high and back towards 1 04 however it has quickly handed back all of those gains and then some  A couple of times in that same period it received solid support around 1 0220  just above the key long term level at 1 02  All of this just gave way last week as the AUD USD was heavily sold down  and now the 1 02 level is poised to provide resistance and thwart attempts to push higher  although it seems distance away presently Over the course of the last month  the Australian dollar has fallen very sharply from near 1 06 to its lows around 0 9880  and in doing so  it also completely ignored any likely support at either 1 04 or 1 0360  In contrast  the week prior  it enjoyed a solid week moving strongly off the key level of 1 0360 towards 1 06 and to its highest levels

106414,327929,AGN,GBP USD  Falls Back Sharply To Support At 1 52,opinion,In the last few hours  the GBP USD is rallying a little higher having recently fallen strongly to a three week low at 1 52  This just continues the slide from last week  almost touching 1 52  a level that proved itself to be one of significance last month  Prior to last week  the pound has enjoyed a strong couple of weeks and moved to new highs above 1 56  It experienced all sorts of bother at 1 56 as it made several pushes to this significant level however it was turned away with excessive supply  For about a week it ran into a wall of resistance right around the 1 56 level  which is very evident in the four hourl chart below  This showed how much buying pressure there was on the 1 56 level but equally how well that level provided resistance to any movement higher  The pound had enjoyed a very solid couple of weeks moving from the support level at 1 52 to reach new highs at 1 56  a new 10 week high It was only a few weeks ago  it found solid support at 1 52 for about a week  which greatly assisted the recent surge higher  and now this level is being called upon again to offer some support and a soft landing  The last week has seen the pound fall strongly and return almost all of its gains from the last few weeks  About a month ago the 1 54 level provided a little piece of resistance and this level has since been broken as it offered limited support  Now that the pound has drifted back down below 1 54  it may provide some resistance again  During its push to 1 56  the pound was able to find some support at 1 55  although this level has also been broken last week  Over the last month or so  the GBP USD has been experiencing a variety of different levels  which have played a role on the price action Toward the end of March the GBP USD was trading within a range roughly between 1 51 and 1 5250 and now on a couple of occasions it has been able to move outside that range and push higher  A few weeks ago  the 1 5350 level was one of significance as it offered resistance before the GBP USD was able to move higher through to 1 56  In early March the pound moved to new lows around 1 4830 from a starting point near 1 64 at the beginning of the year  With the surge higher over the last couple of months  the GBP USD had completely turned around its fortunes from earlier in the year  however it is starting to ease off and return most of the good work  Toward the end of March the GBP USD was trading within a range roughly between 1 51 and 1 5250 and now on a couple of

106415,327930,AGN,Pharma And Biotech Stock Outlook   March 2014,opinion,"The pharmaceutical sector has been slowly but steadily recovering from the impact of the patent cliff being faced by several companies over the past few years  The worst of the patent cliff is over and the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index   DRG  is up 21 4  over the last year  So far in 2014  the index is up 6 9   Several companies which had been struggling to post growth in the face of genericization over the past few years are now on the recovery path  New products should start contributing significantly to results  and increased pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should increase confidence in the sector  Products that lost exclusivity recently include Eli Lilly s  NYSE LLY  Cymbalta and Evista  AstraZeneca s  AZN  Nexium could also start facing generics from May 2014 in the U S  where sales were  2 1 billion in 2013 
Collaborations  Acquisitions and Restructuring
The pharma sector witnessed major merger and acquisitions  M A  activity over the last couple of years  Going forward  we expect small bolt on acquisitions to continue  In licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates have also increased significantly  Several pharma companies are focusing on in licensing mid to late stage pipeline candidates that look promising  instead of developing a product from scratch  which involves a lot of funds and time  Small biotech companies are open to in licensing activities and collaborations  Most of these companies find it challenging to raise cash  thereby making it difficult for them to survive and continue with the development of promising pipeline candidates  Therefore  it makes sense for them to seek deals with pharma companies that are sitting on huge piles of cash  We recommend biotech stocks that have attractive pipeline candidates or technology that can be used for the development of novel therapeutics  Therapeutic areas which could see a lot of in licensing activity include immuno oncology  oncology  central nervous system disorders  diabetes and immunology inflammation  The hepatitis C virus  HCV  market is also attracting a lot of attention  Some recent acquisitions deals include Shire s  NASDAQ SHPG  acquisition of ViroPharma  Salix s  NASDAQ SLXP  acquisition of Santarus as well as the acquisition of Optimer Pharmaceuticals and Trius Therapeutics by Cubist  NASDAQ CBST  and that of Elan by Perrigo Company  NYSE PRGO   A major acquisition agreement was announced recently    that of Forest Labs  NYSE FRX  by Actavis  NYSE ACT   This deal shows the intention of generic companies to establish a strong position in the branded market  Another significant deal was the one signed between Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ OMED  for the joint development and commercialization of up to six anti cancer stem cell candidates from OncoMed s biologics pipeline  Another trend that we are seeing in recent months is the divestment of non core business segments  Pfizer  NYSE PFE  sold its Capsugel unit and its Nutrition business in August 2011 and November 2012  respectively  Pfizer then spun off its animal health business into a new company  Zoetis  ZTS   Meanwhile  GlaxoSmithKline  NYSE GSK  divested certain non core brands from its Consumer Healthcare segment  In Aug 2011  AstraZeneca sold its Astra Tech business to DENTSPLY  NASDAQ XRAY   The monetization of non core assets will allow the pharma biotech companies to focus on their areas of expertise  Abbott Labs  NYSE ABT  split into two separate publicly traded companies  while one company deals in diversified medical products  the other  AbbVie  Arca ABBV   is focusing on research based pharmaceuticals  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  is also looking to divest its ortho clinical diagnostics business  Vertex  NASDAQ VRTX  monetized its Incivo related royalties  the company can use the cash generated from this deal for its cystic fibrosis program 
Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large pharma companies are looking to cut costs and streamline their operations  Most of these companies are re evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs which do not have a favorable risk benefit profile  Some of the companies that announced restructuring plans include Merck NYSE MRK   Novartis  NYSE NVS    Eli Lilly  Shire and Sanofi  NYSE SNY  
Destination Ireland
Of late  several companies have been looking towards Ireland for acquisitions  The latest company to join the Irish club is Horizon Pharma  NASDAQ HZNP  which is doing a reverse merger with Dublin based Vidara  Tax benefits are a major attraction for such deals  Other such recent acquisitions include that of Warner Chilcott by Actavis and Elan by Perrigo 
Emerging Markets and Biosimilars
Another trend seen in the pharmaceutical sector is a focus on emerging markets  Companies like Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   Pfizer  Merck  Eli Lilly  Glaxo and Sanofi are all looking to expand their presence in India  China  Brazil and other emerging markets 
Until recently  most of the commercialization efforts were focused on the U S     the largest pharmaceutical market    along with Europe and Japan  Emerging markets are slowly and steadily gaining more importance  and several companies are now shifting their focus to these areas 
However  while higher demand for medicines  government initiatives for healthcare  new patient population and increasing use of generics should help drive demand  we point out that emerging markets are also not immune to genericization  Moreover  investigations into bribery charges in China could put a lid on near term growth  Meanwhile  growth in Europe will continue to be pressurized by austerity and cost containment measures  We are also seeing several companies entering into deals for the development of biosimilars  generic versions of biologics  Companies like Merck  Amgen  Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  and Actavis are all targeting the highly lucrative biosimilars market 
4Q Earnings
All companies falling under the Medical sector have reported fourth quarter and full year 2013 results  While earnings beat and revenue beat ratios  percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises  were pretty impressive  growth ratios were modest  Fourth quarter results were characterized by currency headwinds as well as the impact of generics  Fourth quarter 2013 earnings  beat ratio  was 74 0  while the revenue  beat ratio  was 76 0   Total earnings for this sector were up 1 1   compared to 0 2  recorded in the third quarter of 2013  Total revenues moved up 5 3  in the quarter versus 5 8  growth in the third quarter of 2013  Looking at the consensus earnings expectations for the first quarter  earnings are expected to decline 3 3   Tough challenges for some companies  negative currency movement and a few patent expirees will affect first quarter growth  However  growth should pick up from the second quarter for which 1 6  earnings growth is expected  Overall  2014 earnings are expected to grow 6 5  
Focus on New Products
2013 saw the FDA approving 27 novel medicines  about one third  33   of which were identified by the FDA as  First in Class   meaning they use a new and unique mechanism of action for treating a medical condition  These include drugs like Invokana  type II diabetes   Kadcyla  HER2 positive late stage breast cancer   Sovaldi  an interferon free oral treatment for some patients with chronic hepatitis C  and Mekinist  metastatic melanoma   Yet another one third of the approved drugs fall under the rare or  orphan  disease category that affects 200 000 or fewer Americans  These include Imbruvica  mantle cell lymphoma   Gazyva  chronic lymphocytic leukemia   Kynamro  homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  and Adempas and Opsumit  both for pulmonary arterial hypertension   Three of the approved drugs   Gazyva  Imbruvica and Sovaldi   had breakthrough therapy designation  Breakthrough status  a new designation that became effective after Jul 9  2012  is designed to cut short the development time of promising new treatments  Some important products approved in 2013 include Drugs like Tecfidera  Sovaldi and Imbruvica represent strong commercial potential  So far in 2014  drugs that have gained approval include AstraZeneca s Myalept  complications of leptin deficiency  and Farxiga  type II diabetes   Chelsea Therapeutics   NASDAQ CHTP  Northera  to treat neurogenic orthostatic hypotension   BioMarin s  NASDAQ BMRN  Vimizim  Morquio A syndrome  and Vanda Pharma s  NASDAQ VNDA  Hetlioz  non 24  hour sleep wake disorder   Upcoming events include FDA advisory panel review of the regulatory application for MannKind s  NASDAQ MNKD  experimental diabetes treatment  Afrezza  April should be an active month with the agency expected to deliver a response on the approvability of several experimental drugs including Afrezza  Glaxo s Eperzan  type II diabetes  and Arzerra  CLL  
Zacks Industry Rank
Within the Zacks Industry classification  pharma and biotech are broadly grouped into the Medical sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  and further sub divided into four industries at the expanded level  large cap pharma  med biomed gene  med drugs and med generic drugs  As a point of reference  the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank  88 and lower is  Positive   between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and  177 and higher is  Negative   The Zacks Industry Rank for large cap pharma is  225  med biomed gene is  69  med drugs is  84  while the med generic drugs is  8  Analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different medical segments  it is obvious that the outlook is Positive for med drugs  med biomed gene and med generic drugs and Negative for large cap pharma stocks 
OPPORTUNITIES
While several companies will continue to face challenges like EU austerity measures and genericization  the pharma industry is out of the worst of its genericization phase  Many companies which had faced generic headwinds in the last couple of years should continue to see a sustained improvement in results this year  Cost cutting  downsizing  streamlining of the pipeline  growth in emerging markets and new product launches should support growth  Among pharma stocks  Shire  a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock  looks well positioned for growth with the company expanding its product portfolio and pipeline through the acquisition of ViroPharma  Horizon Pharma  a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  also seems on the right path with the company announcing its plans to acquire Ireland based Vidara  In the biotech space  we are positive on Biogen  Tecfidera  the company s recently launched oral multiple sclerosis drug  is off to a strong start with the product delivering sales of  876 million  as of Dec 31  2013  since its launch in early April 2013  While Tecfidera has gained the top spot in the oral multiple sclerosis market in the U S   Avonex and Tysabri should continue contributing significantly to sales  Tecfidera gained EU approval recently  Biogen is also progressing with its hemophilia pipeline  We are also positive on Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Amgen should be able to deliver on its long term strategy based on expansion in key markets  launch of new manufacturing technologies  and pipeline development  Enbrel should continue performing well  Amgen s late stage pipeline is also moving along  While Amgen is a Zacks Rank  2 stock  Biogen is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  Gilead  NASDAQ GILD   a Zacks Rank  1 stock  continues to do well in the HIV segment and has a potential blockbuster in its portfolio in the form of HCV treatment  Sovaldi  Among generic companies  Actavis looks well positioned  Actavis is slowly and steadily building its position in the branded market through acquisitions  Actavis Group  Warner Chilcott and the upcoming acquisition of Forest   With fewer major patent expiries slated to occur in the next few years  we are encouraged by Actavis  focus on building its branded and biosimilars pipeline  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2 
WEAKNESSES
We recommend avoiding names that offer little growth or opportunity for a take out  These include companies which are developing drugs that are likely to face regulatory hurdles  Among large cap pharma companies  Eli Lilly is gearing up for another round of patent expiries    Cymbalta in Dec 2013 and Evista this year  We prefer waiting on the sidelines until the company is able to emerge from the impact of genericization    Companies that currently carry a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  include Bayer  BAYRY   Sanofi and Glaxo among others  Sanofi  which is facing currency headwinds  was in the news recently related to the development of its PCSK9 inhibitor  alirocumab  The FDA has asked Sanofi and partner Regeneron  NASDAQ REGN  to evaluate potential neurocognitive adverse events across the global development program for alirocumab  especially in long term studies  While results on PCSK9 inhibitors in development have been encouraging so far  this is the first time that serious safety concerns have been raised ",2014-03-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pharma-and-biotech-stock-outlook---march-2014-207530,207530
106425,327940,AGN,Gold Zooms  Stocks Surge As Open Ended QE3 Is Unleashed,opinion,Gold and Silver surged sharply higher after the FOMC announcement that the Federal Reserve has launched more Quantitative Easing  the much awaited QE3  Comex Gold December shot up from the day s  also the week s  lows close to  1702 to a fresh six month high of  1 775 00 as forecasted a day back  the highest for a most active contract since Feb  29  Given 12 Sep in  Gold Futures may soon enter last Massive Rally Lap   Alerted therein was that Comex Gold Futures remain strong till above the crucial  1702 level   can surge to target upside levels of  1756   1774    1810 also  The longer term Target of  1855 for Gold Futures remains within close reach on fresh US Monetary Easing  Till a few minutes before the FOMC announcement Gold had slumped off on some nervousness   traders preferred to maintain a cautious approach on mixed sentiments towards the crucial   much anticipated FOMC meeting results  but Gold surged happily within minutes to the day s highs after the aggressive announcements  When combining the MBS  Mortgage Backed Securities and the purchases via Operation Twist  the Fed is buying  85 billion each month through the end of the year  Gold  Silver  Metals   Equity Markets welcome QE3   Multiple Stimulus Efforts  Commodities surged to a five month high after the Federal Reserve announced a third round of fiscal measures to bolster the U S  economy  fueling expectations that raw material use will increase  reported   The Fed s QE3 compliments the ECB Bond Buying program   the ratification of the ESM timing as appropriate to add to the Global efforts to contain a crisis spreading wide  Gold and Silver gained the most in 10 weeks  leading the rally  Markets had anyways harbored a bullish outlook for Gold Prices  Market expectations favored the view that Bernanke will announce the QE3 or some sort of fresh stimulus package yesterday  after last week s atrociously dismal U S  jobs report  The FOMC statement was aggressively accommodative  which surprised even those who were already expecting QE3 to be announced Thursday  The Fed will now pump  40 billion a month into the U S  financial system and will keep interest rates very low until at least 2015  That news sunk the U S  Dollar index which extended its losses   hit a fresh four month low and was bullish for the U S  Equity Market which surged to a new 4 year high  The LME   London Metal Exchange index  which includes Aluminum  Copper  Lead  Nickel  Zinc and Tin  rose for the fifth straight session  the longest rally in eight months  The highlight   also the most unusualness about the QE3 is that it has an open ended timeframe which makes it positive for Gold because it heightens the inflation fears and weakens the dollar  The start to a Gold Price Rally   the QE3 timing were almost sealed when Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke s comments in Jackson Hole that QE could help alleviate the stubbornly high unemployment rate  calling the employment situation in theU S   A grave concern   The final boost for Gold came when the U S  Department of Labor released a lower than expected August employment report  On top of expected stimulus from the Fed  Gold found initial support on fresh stimulus from the European Central Bank and China  Unlimited QE3 is Gold Supportive  The  40 billion of mortgage debt each month will increase liquidity  thereby increasing potential for more Inflation  which in turn is good news for Gold  The Federal Reserve didn t set any limit on the ultimate amount of large scale asset purchases it would buy or the duration of the program  This stimulus will be expanded until the Fed sees  sustained improvement  in the labor market  Comex Gold till above  1742 5 may keep its momentum intact for further rises to  1797 4   1825 3   then to  1855   a major resistance zone  MCX Gold remains vulnerable on the INR valuations against the now declining US Dollar  MCX Gold may keep strength till above Rs  32 140 for further Targets of Rs  32 608   32 896 also  Silver should be the Metal to watch out for as repeatedly alerted since long  A push above  34 75 has the potential to send Silver prices to above  44 20   then close to  50 50 also  Base Metals have already shown a steady rise for the last two weeks   seem to have more steam left for further rises  Other Factors Supportive of Higher Gold Prices  The IMF said yesterday that Greece would need a third round of financial bailout assistance  In South Africa  newspapers report striking Gold miners marched to hostels and mine shafts at the Gold Fields KDC West mine to prevent non strikers from working  Around 15000 workers at KDC West began striking on Sunday  There have been calls for a nationwide mining strike following a series of disturbances of several platinum and gold mining sites  including Lonmin s Marikana platinum mine  where 45 people have died since protests began  including 34 shot dead by police last month  Crude Oil prices advanced to a four month high on the QE3 news   also on concerns that protests in the Middle East andNorth Africamay lead to supply disruptions  The QE3 that influenced a Global Rally in Gold  Equity   Commodity Markets  The unusual QE3 definitely is a significant shift in FOMC policy   a very aggressive commitment to success on its mandates  The Federal Reserve said it will expand its holdings of long term securities with open ended purchases of  40 billion of mortgage debt a month in a third round of quantitative easing as it seeks to boost growth and reduce unemployment   If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially  the committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage backed securities  undertake additional asset purchases and employ its other policy tools as appropriate   the Federal Open Market Committee said  The Fed does not have a defined upside limit to securities purchases  except to say that these will continue until the outlook for the labor market improves  If unemployment stays high  this means asset purchases will continue automatically  The FOMC said it would likely hold the federal funds rate near zero  at least through mid 2015   The Fed said it will continue its program to swap  667 billion of short term debt with longer term securities to lengthen the average maturity of its holdings  an action dubbed Operation Twist  The central bank will also continue reinvesting its portfolio of maturing housing debt into agency mortgage  backed securities  The decision risks provoking a renewed backlash from Republicans  including presidential nominee Mitt Romney  who say Bernanke s policies threaten to ignite inflation while doing little to spur the economy  Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin  Romney s vice presidential running mate  yesterday said the Fed is  trying to make up for failed fiscal policy   The U S  economy remains vulnerable to the so called fiscal cliff  the  600 billion of tax increases and spending cuts that will kick in automatically at the end of the year unless Congress acts  Bernanke said  Europe s sovereign debt crisis may also weigh on growth  he said  Influence of QE3 on Gold Prices  INR   Equity Trading in Indian Markets  The much awaited third round of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve   a fuel price hike decision by the Indian Government helped the Indian Equity benchmarks rise to a massive 7 month high  The government may also clear FDI in aviation and broadcasting soon which may give the necessary boost to the Indian Equity Market  The Indian Rupee has rallied up as expected but is yet trading around 54 60 per US Dollar  from the 58 4 life time low  seen a few months ago   yet has huge potential for corrections  Capital inflows from foreign funds in equity markets also boosted the Indian Rupee  MCX Gold Prices shot up yesterday to a New Record of Rs  32 421

106428,327943,AGN,Those Pesky Inflation Surprises ,opinion,Inflationary pressures  particularly food inflation  continue to percolate across some emerging markets nations  Central bankers don t like openly discussing the problem  fearing just talking about it could raise inflation expectations  But that does not make the problem any less real India  Even though the wholesale inflation  WPI  remains under 8   it has not declined further in spite of India s economic slowdown  see post   and actually rose last month  At the same time food prices remain elevated  Bloomberg  The Reserve Bank of India may focus on inflation when it meets later  especially after the U S  Federal Reserve s decision to embark on a third round of quantitative easing  Previous rounds of easing have stoked foreign capital inflows and increases in commodity prices  especially oil    Indian  wholesale price inflation accelerated to 7 55 percent in August  the highest level in three months  and remains well above the 4 percent to 4 5 percent range where the RBI intends to anchor inflation expectations  The central bank will also be concerned about potential spillover effects from the spike in global food prices  Russia  The central bank actually had to raise rates due to concerns about inflationary pressure   The Bank of Russia unexpectedly raised interest rates across the board on Thursday for the first time in nine months  as it struggles to contain increases in food prices and inflation while the economy slows  The central bank said its decision to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point was driven by a sharp rise in the rate of inflation in August and early September that had exceeded the bank s  medium term targets   The benchmark refinancing rate was increased to 8 25  from 8   The decision caught some economists off guard  Eight of 11 economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires before Thursday s announcement had said they expected the central bank to leave rates  Some other nations are seeing a pick up in prices as well    Indonesia s inflation unexpectedly accelerated in August on rising food costs  limiting scope for the central bank to cut interest rates even as exports slumped for a fourth month  Clearly slower global growth and weak manufacturing should keep inflation in check  but as monetary expansion in the US and the Eurozone picks up  these  inflation surprises  may become more commonplace ,2012-09-17,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/those-pesky-inflation-surprises-136580,136580
106429,327944,AGN,India s Stubborn Inflation Trend Puts RBI In A Bind,opinion,India continues to struggle with stubbornly high inflation levels  In spite of slower economic growth  the Wholesale Price Index  WPI  clocked at 7 81  in September  putting the RBI in a real bind  The central bank needs to cut rates as growth has moderated  but it is difficult to do with inflationary pressures unresolved    The Wholesale Price Index  WPI  inflation figures are out but those looking for repo rate reductions in the forthcoming October 30 monetary policy announcements by the RBI may be in for some disappointment  According to economists  the WPI figure  though certainly better than the 10  odd inflation numbers that the economy was totting up till recently  is still not good enough for the RBI to cut rates  In other words  things aren t as bad as before but they are not good enough to merit a growth inducing repo rate reduction by the RBI  Part of the issue with India s stubbornly high inflation is that it has been elevated for an unusually prolonged period    India has experienced a sustained period of high headline inflation since late 2009  In this period  inflation  as measured by the Wholesale Price Index  WPI   has averaged 9  and has not fallen below 7   Indeed  the high inflation period can be seen from 2007  with a blip due to the GFC between February and November in 2009  This prolonged period of high inflation has not been witnessed since the early 1990s  The problem that often accompanies long periods of inflation is the establishment of deeply rooted inflation expectations  Households now fully expect double digit near term and longer term inflation  The recent rise in food prices is only going to exacerbate these expectations  And as central banks learned from past experiences  inflation expectations create a feedback loop with the actual inflation that is extremely difficult to break  That s why RBI is likely to be on hold for some time ,2012-10-16,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/india's-stubborn-inflation-trend-puts-rbi-in-a-bind-139931,139931
106431,327946,AGN,India Fast Tracks Policy  Powers Remain Watered Down,opinion,India approved changes to a century old land law and set up a panel to fast track infrastructure projects worth 10 billion Rupees or more as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh extends a policy overhaul to revive economic growth The cabinet approved creation of a special panel yesterday  albeit with watered down powers to speed up the notoriously slow implementation of big ticket infrastructure projects  Amendments to the colonial era Land Acquisition Act may help the government curb often violent protests that have stalled projects for industry and highways  The cabinet committee also allowed the establishment of an infrastructure panel and a 30  reduction in the sale of airwaves  The government hopes the new body will help to increase investment in an economy that is likely to slow in fiscal 2012 13 to its worst pace in a decade  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh s chief economic adviser sees full year growth of 5 5  to 6   reports Reuters  The approvals add momentum to Singh s policy agenda by addressing transportation and energy bottlenecks that have handicapped growth in Asia s third largest economy  The prime minister has already won support to open the economy to overseas retailers  the biggest embrace of foreign investment in a decade  as he bids to repair the government s reform credentials before national elections in 2014  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will head a new panel aimed at speeding up approvals of infrastructure projects  The prime minister is seeking  1 trillion in investments for highways  ports and power plants from 2012 to 2017 to spur development  The cabinet approved a 30  cut in the reserve price of mobile phone airwaves in four telecommunication zones  after carriers shunned last month s auction in those zones saying the prices were too high  The cabinet also approved a ministerial panel s proposal to set the auction reserve price of more efficient 900 megahertz band airwaves at twice that of the basic phone airwaves in the 1800 megahertz band India plans to take more steps in the next few weeks  which combined with the measures taken so far will help turn around the economy  the Finance Minister P  Chidambaram said today  however  did not elaborate on the planned measures  India  Asia s third largest economy is headed for the weakest full year growth in a decade  at about 6   far below the near double digit pace before the global economic downturn   I am confident that the steps we have taken  and some more steps that we will take in the next few weeks  will help turn the Indian Economy around   Mr  Chidambaram said addressing the Delhi Economics Conclave Rating agency Standard   Poor s warned again on Tuesday thatIndia s credit rating faces a one in three chance of being downgraded to junk over next 24 months because of a heavy debt burden and pressure on the fiscal deficit  which is seen overshooting a target of 5 3  in the fiscal year ending in March India Sets up Panel   Powers Watered DownInfrastructure companies have pressed for the creation of such a board to speed up hundreds of delayed projects  Regulatory hurdles  such as delayed land acquisition and environmental clearances  have held up projects worth over 2 trillion rupees in the road  power  coal and mining sectors alone  according to government data  Due to opposition from within the government  the powers of the panel have been diluted and it will not be able to directly clear the projects  It will be up to individual ministries to approve projects  but where there are delays  the new panel will have the authority to intervene  It will not  however  be able to overturn any decisions made by the Environment Ministry  Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan had stalled the creation of the panel for months  calling it authoritarian  The watering down of the panel s powers  which will likely disappoint investors  underscore the government s struggle to push a reform agenda aimed at reviving growth  Red tape can delay projects for years or  in the worst cases  scupper them altogether  Bureaucracy and fights between industry and farmers over land have prevented India from plugging huge power shortages and upgrading its decrepit transport network  A typical infrastructure project requires clearances from 19 federal ministries and  on average  56 authorizations on issues ranging from the environment to defense  The whole process takes up to 24 months Reserve Bank Of India Interest RatesThe Reserve Bank of India  RBI  is expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Tuesday  Dec 18  according to a new Reuters poll  with respondents split over whether it will cut the cash reserve ratio  CRR  for banks  The RBI has left rates on hold since a 50 basis point cut in April  and expectations for a further cut have been pushed from December into the first quarter of 2013 following guidance by the central bank in late October  The CRR   a tool the Reserve Bank of India has been using to ease a cash crunch and prod banks to loosen lending rates  At 4 25   CRR is at its lowest since 1976  RBI Gov  Duvvuri Subbarao said in the October policy review there was a  reasonable likelihood  of further easing in the January March quarter  when inflation is expected to trend down  The RBI is expected to review monetary policy in January and again in March New Rules From SEBI To Avoid Market Glitches Flash CrashesIndia Stock Market regulator  SEBI   Securities and Exchange Board of India unveiled a new set of measures  including reducing the trading band for a wide category of stocks and capping single orders at nearly  2 million  to prevent future flash crashes  The new set of rules come after an erroneous trade order of more than  125 million from a broker at Emkay Global Financial Services sent shares sharply lower in October  Read more on  Under new guidelines from SEBI  Stock Exchanges will not be able to accept single orders for stocks  equity derivatives or exchange traded funds of more than 100 million rupees   1 8 million  in value  The restriction applies to orders for stocks  exchange traded funds  index futures and equity futures  In addition  the regulator narrowed the trading band for stocks that also trade on derivatives markets to 10  from 20   although exchanges will be able to adjust the band in increments of 5  depending on market conditions  SEBI also directed brokerages to set internal limits on the cumulative value of un executed orders  while directing them to reduce risk when 90  of the collateral for margin trading is utilized  All un executed orders will be canceled once that threshold is reached  and all new orders will be checked for sufficiency of margins  Exchanges have a month to institute the new rules  and can set  more stringent norms based on their assessment   according to the regulator  The NSE   National Stock Exchange of India Ltd   the nation s largest bourse  controls more than 90  of India s  28 billion equity derivatives market including the Nifty Index and handles 75  of stock trades  The exchange began trading equities electronically in 1994  prompting the 137 year old BSE  which runs the BSE India Sensitive Index BSE Sensex  to follow suit India Inflation Betters ForecastIndia s Inflation unexpectedly cooled in November to its weakest pace in 10 months  The wholesale price index  WPI   India s main Inflation gauge  rose 7 24  from a year earlier  below expectations for a rise of 7 6  and below October s 7 45   An easing in annual fuel and manufacturing inflation helped rein in price pressures  The RBI though may not be impressed enough to cut interest rates next week as price gains still remain above its comfort level  The inflation data comes after a spike in industrial output in October and data indicating that infrastructure output and investment is picking up  raising hopes a long slide in India s economic growth is coming to an end  RBI   Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao may wait for more evidence that inflation is on an easing trend before heeding Finance Minister P  Chidambaram s call for cheaper credit to back a government policy overhaul ,2012-12-14,Commodity Trade
