7510,229025,NWS,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Trade War Worries Aren t Going Away 
While earnings season s grip on market direction loosens  trade s impact on stocks persists 
It could be argued that the U S  and China are now officially in a trade war  if they weren t before   The two sides aren t talking and China is hitting back at every U S  salvo 
Today  the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said it will impose a 25  charge on  16 billion worth of U S  goods  raging from fiber optic cables to vehicles  The announcement from China comes after the Trump administration followed through with a 25  tariff on an additional  16 billion of Chinese goods Tuesday evening 
 This is very unreasonable   China s ministry said in a statement   In order to defend China s rightful interests and the multilateral trade system  China has to retaliate as necessary  
That takes the total of targeted goods to  50 billion on each side  China s tariffs are slated to come into effect on Aug  23 
From the market perspective  the longer this continues  the tougher it will be for Wall Street to find clear direction  Apart from the effects of tariffs on the bottom lines of companies  stocks will be subject to swings every time there are reports or statements that signify escalation or easing of the trade battles 
2  Market Will Be Hoping for Tame Inflation
Macro makes a comeback tomorrow after a very brief hiatus and investors will have two economic indicators on which to trade 
The featured act is wholesale inflation  Economists expect that the producer price index  PPI  rose 0 2  in July and is up 3 4  year over year  The core PPI  which excludes food and energy  is also expected to post a 0 2  rise on the month  up 2 8  on the year 
The report comes out at 8 30 AM ET  12 30 GMT  
Earlier today  Richmond Fed president Thomas Barkin said that the U S  central bank should follow through on gradually raising interest rates to more normal levels  given the current strength of the American economy 
 It is difficult to argue that lower than normal rates are appropriate when unemployment is low and inflation is effectively at the Fed s target   he said in a speech delivered Wednesday 
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak tomorrow at 9 30 AM ET  13 30 GMT  
Also on the calendar are initial jobless claims at 8 30 AM ET  12 30 GMT   Economists expect just a slight rise in weekly first time claims from the week before 
3  Media Earnings in the Spotlight
As noted  earnings season is waning  but it s not completely gone  Media stocks are some of the bigger names issuing results today and tomorrow 
Twenty First Century Fox  NASDAQ FOX  reported profit and revenue that topped expectations after hours Wednesday  Those results might help shares of  Disney   NYSE DIS   which is buying Fox s TV and movie studio assets 
Tomorrow  Viacom  NASDAQ VIAB  reports before the bell  Tronc  NASDAQ TRNC  will also issue results  And after hours  News Corp  NASDAQ NWS  will report earnings ",2018-08-08,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-1566244,1566244

7512,229027,NWS,Stocks   S P 500 Closes Shy of Record High as Energy Stocks Steam Ahead,news,"Investing com   The S P closed just shy of all time highs Monday  powered by rising energy stocks and easing fears over a full blown trade war ahead of U S  China trade talks later this week 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0 35   The S P 500 rose 0 23   while the Nasdaq Composite rose about 0 06  
Low level talks between China and U S  slated for this week have eased investor concerns the current tit for tat trade fight could evolve into full blown trade war  denting both global growth and demand for riskier investments like stocks 
While many are not expecting significant progress to made on the trade war front at this week s talks  it is hoped the dialogue would pave the way for more meaningful talks that could lead to the end of the dispute as early as November  when President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are due to meet 
Signs of optimism on trade helped support shares of Boeing  NYSE BA  and 3M  NYSE MMM   which have significant international exposure  making them vulnerable to rising trade tensions 
But gains on a more upbeat outlook for trade were limited by expectations for a further volley of trade tariffs from both the U S  and China  The U S  is expected on Thursday to impose 25  tariffs on an additional  16 billion in Chinese imports  And Beijing has threatened to retaliate with 25  tariffs as well 
Energy  meanwhile  rose sharply  pushing the broader market higher  as oil prices made a bullish start to the week on hopes for improved U S  China relations and expectations U S  sanctions against Iran would exacerbate the shortage of global supplies

12141,233656,NWS,Comcast  Solid Media Play,opinion,The NicheComcast Corporation  CMCSA  is a  74 billion media conglomerate operating in the Services sector that provides entertainment  information  and communications products and services in the United States and internationally  It operates everything from television channels such as USA and CNBC to theme parks such as Universal Studios Hollywood  Comcast is the nation s biggest cable TV operator  One of its biggest acquisitions was the January 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal from GE  GE  for  27 3 billion  This move continues to prove to have been a successful venture  S P Capital IQ recently noted that the  27 3 billion paid for NBCUniversal  seems like an even more attractive valuation  now OverviewComcast Corporation has been in the headlines recently  soaring atop of a 14 5  YTD gain in its stock price  Hulu  which it co owns along with The Walt Disney Company  DIS  and News Corporation  NWS   recently reported a 60  increase in revenues and announced it was starting a push into original programming in an attempt to attract more customers from Netflix  NBCUniversal  owned by Comcast  is also set to rack in a huge profit  approximately  250 million  from broadcasting the Superbowl matchup between the New England Patriots and New York Giants  Demand for Superbowl ad space has ballooned so much that insiders note NBCUniversal could net as much as  10 million per commercial  This huge demand and the millions in profit for NBCUniversal has led to S P Capital IQ recently reaffirming its buy rating on Comcast  Moreover  Comcast will benefit from its first free streaming of the Super Bowl  which will be accompanied by a different set of commercials  resulting in another stream of profit for Comcast However  Comcast has also faced some headwinds  The huge backlash over the SOPA bill  of which Comcast is a major advocate  could translate into negative publicity  Moreover  Comcast is facing political flak over its marketing alliance with Verizon Wireless  which is owned by Verizon Communications  VZ  and Vodafone  VOD   This marketing alliance solidified after Verizon spent nearly  4 billion to buy cable tv airwaves from SpectrumCo  which Comcast owns 64  of  Senate Antitrust Subcommittee chair Herb Kohl has in turn scheduled a hearing on the deal and the alliance  while regulators such as the FCC are probing the Verizon cable spectrum deals  Things are not looking bright for the marketing alliance  which  according to Macquarie Equities analyst Kevin Smithen  will most likely be cancelled by the FCC The ResultsComcast Corporation has sound fundamentals  although the results are hardly knockout  The average EPS growth of the last 3 quarters was 15   while its 3Q EPS was up 6 5  year over year at 33 cents per share  falling short of analyst estimates of 39 cents per share  Comcast also reported a 4 9  increase in Q3 revenue on  14 34 billion  ahead of analysts  expectation of  14 25 billion  Year over year  quarterly revenue grew 51 1   which crushed the industry average of 16 9   Revenue at NBCUnversal increased 4 6  to  5 2B  while Comcast s cable network revenue rose 12  to  2 01 billion From a long term perspective  Comcast has an 18  3 Year EPS Growth Rate and 4 consecutive years of annual EPS growth  Analysts expect the current fiscal year EPS to outperform last year s by 15 26   Comcast also has a 3 Year Sales Growth Rate of 11   These long term figures paint a picture of steady growth and expansion of Comcast s operations Comcast has a healthy Annual Pre Tax Margin of 16 2   but its Annual ROE of 8 5  is somewhat low  Its Gross Margin  TTM  is 52 92   which beats the industry average of 48 08   while its Operating Margin is 19 85   which also beats the industry average of 15 14  It should be noted that Comcast s growth has been hampered by its 67  Debt Equity Ratio  In fact  the major reason Comcast missed analyst EPS estimates was due to a  256 million year over year decline in investment income and higher interest expenses  Comcast has approximately  41B in debt on its balance sheet  which dwarfs the approximately  11 4B in cash and investments it has on hand  Investors should continue to be wary of thisThe VerdictComcast is a very solid media play  but don t expect it to be posting huge returns anytime soon  Comcast is faring pretty well with analysts  none rate the stock as Underperform or Sell  and 23 out of 30 rank the stock as either a Strong Buy or a Buy  The consensus price target of the analysts is  32  which represents an approximately 20  upside  It will continue to reap the rewards of its NBCUniversal acquisition  and is poised to benefit handsomely from the advertising fervor surrounding this year s Super Bowl  Iinvestors should also stay updated on developments in the status of Comcast s marketing alliance with Verizon Disclosure  I have no positions in any stocks mentioned  but may initiate a long position in CMCSA over the next 72 hours ,2012-02-12,George Liu,https://www.investing.com/analysis/comcast:-solid-media-play-113758,113758

900 new positions and push total employment at the plant to 3 000  Robert J  Samuelson   Washington Post on the fallacy of greedy  speculators  controlling the energy market  Conspiracy theories are appealing  The actual explanation is more humdrum  Oil demand is what economists call  price inelastic   People need it to drive cars  heat homes  fly airplanes and run factories  So small shifts in supply or demand can result in big price moves  A large jump in demand or loss in supply raises prices sharply  similarly  prices may plunge when demand dips  from  say  a recession  or supply increases  from  say  new fields    It s true that outside investors  a k a   speculators   have dramatically shifted money into commodities   raw materials  It s easy to imagine all this money chasing prices up in futures markets  just as speculative stock market frenzies push share prices to unrealistic levels  It s also wrong  The stock and futures markets operate differently  In the stock market  herd psychology can lead to speculative bubbles or panics  In a bubble  almost everyone seems to win  until the bubble bursts   in a panic  everyone seems to lose  until the panic subsides   By contrast  futures markets are  zero sum games   One investor s gain is matched by another s equal loss  Here s why  Under the standard futures contract  one investor agrees to buy the commodity  say  1 000 barrels of oil  at a future date for a given price  and another investor agrees to sell for the same price  But rather than futures markets raising spot prices  at times  economists Lutz Kilian  Bassam Fattouh and Lavan Mahadeva issued a report that concluded futures and spot prices reflect  common economic fundamentals  Samuelson  Casting speculators as scapegoats for our dependence on high priced global oil is easy and misleading  It obscures the only real solution  Use less  possibly through an energy tax  and produce more  So in light of the above  when it comes to natural gas  the Wall Street Journal reported that major players such as ExxonMobil have announced in recent days plans to reduce production further than was the case in the first quarter  which should help alleviate the huge oversupply of the product  The price has risen about 20  since the April 19 bottom  which represented the lowest level since September 2001 Speaking of nat gas  Chesapeake Energy Corp  CEO Aubrey McClendon was forced to apologize to investors for all the recent distractions  many involving his personal finances  plus the company missed analysts  expectations for the first quarter  including Chesapeake s new estimates that production will be far lower than the company forecast in February Earlier  Chesapeake s board said it would find an independent replacement for McClendon as chairman  while he would be allowed to stay on as CEO  but the bottom line is the company is a mess  with net debt of  12 4 billion  and gobs of off balance sheet financing  A Credit Suisse analyst says this last bit amounts to an additional  6 billion  plus there is  3 billion of preferred stock on the balance sheet  The Journal estimates that when you tally it all up  including a working capital deficit  you come up with total leverage in the neighborhood of  24 billion   The SEC has begun an informal inquiry into Chesapeake and McClendon  The current low natural gas price means less in some states  coffers  Wyoming  for example  was operating on a  4 forecast for nat gas this year and with the current price being in the  2 30 neighborhood  the state s tax receipts could be at least  100 million lower than expected  So the governor is warning of across the board agency cuts of 8  unless the price picture improves As noted in USA TODAY  another example would be Oklahoma  which is estimating  3 64 for its 2013 budget starting in July   Every  1 drop in price costs the state roughly  70 million a year   according to the state treasurer Natural gas pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners is acquiring Sunoco Inc  for  5 3 billion  with Energy Transfer picking up nearly 8 000 miles of pipeline  as well as 4 900 gas stations in 24 Eastern states  The stations will keep the Sunoco brand And Delta Air Lines announced it would purchase an oil refinery operation in Pennsylvania for about  150 million in an attempt to control escalating fuel costs  Fuel makes up about one third of an airline s expenses  but Delta says it can save  300 million a year by owning a refinery directly  ConocoPhillips had idled the facility in 2011  citing  severe market pressure  The board of directors of News Corporation says it has  full confidence  in Rupert Murdoch  this after a UK government media committee concluded that Murdoch was  not a fit person  to run a major international business  The board countered that Murdoch had  demonstrated resolve  to address mistakes of the company resulting from the phone hacking scandal From

12145,233660,NWS,The Week Ahead  More Earnings And The U S  Election,opinion,The first full week of November could be a pivotal one for the markets  The U S  Presidential Election will likely be the dominant news story for most of the week  With the end of the year just around the corner  investors will be looking to the election results to get a sense of the fiscal cliff s resolution    assuming a resolution is possible  If President Obama is re elected  it is possible that 2013 could bring aggressive tax hikes on dividends and higher wage earners  In that case  traders might sell stocks going into the final few weeks of the year  A  released earlier in the week indicated that many investors think a second Obama term would be worse for stocks than a Romney victory Of course  Obama might be more likely to keep the Federal Reserve staffed with  doves     economists who are more partial to keeping unemployment low rather than focusing on limiting inflation  In that case  a victory for Obama might be seen as guarantee that  easy money  policies will remain in place for quite some time    a positive for stocks For a Romney victory  more or less the opposite is true  Although Romney would not assume the Presidency until January    after the deadline of the fiscal cliff    it may be likely that his administration would work to keep taxes low on things like capital gains  Traders may also view a Romney administration as one being more favorable to business  thereby supporting equity valuations But Romney might pressure the Fed to limit or even wind down its quantitative easing policies  That could hurt stocks  which have run up over the last four years as the Fed has undertaken multiple rounds of asset purchases Beyond the election  earnings season continues for another week  Notable companies expected to report include Walt Disney Co   DIS   J C  Penney  JCP  and QUALCOMM  QCOM  Analysts at Citigroup were positive on J C  Penney  In a note released last week  Citigroup commented on a study conducted on the retailer s ongoing transformation  noting   The study indicated that JCP s transformation strategy may be gaining traction with consumers  It found that consumers are responding well to JCP s new product assortment  with increased conversion levels since July  Likewise  Bank of America released a favorable note on Disney following its Tuesday announcement that it would acquire Lucasfilm  Bank of America noted   We continue to view the DIS story favorably  as accelerating Parks fundamentals  the conclusion of a major reinvestment cycle  an increasingly positive Studio outlook  steady growth at Networks and improving profitability at Interactive all offer opportunity for upward estimate revisions  in our view  Additionally  later in the week  the European Central Bank and the Bank of England will meet to decide on interest rate policy  Those decisions could affect European stocks  and by extension  U S  markets MondayEarnings from  Time Warner  TWC   Tesla Motors  TSLA   Humana  HUM   Express Scripts  ESRX   and Walter Energy  WLT ISM Non Manufacturing Index  estimated at 54 5  TuesdayEarnings from  AOL  AOL   CVS  CVS   DirecTV  DTV   Fossil  FOSL   News Corp  NWSA  and Rackspace  RAX  U K  Industrial Production  year over year estimated at  1 6 percent   German Factory Orders  estimated at  0 5 percent  U S  Presidential ElectionWednesdayEarnings from  Leap Wireless  LEAP   Tenet Healthcare  THC  CBS  CBS   QUALCOMM  QCOM   Activision Blizzard  ATVI  and SodaStream  SODA  Eurozone Retail Sales  estimated at  0 1 percent   German Industrial Production  estimated at  0 5 percent   Australian Unemployment Rate  estimated at 5 5 percent  ThursdayEarnings from  Dean Foods  DF   Duke Energy  DUK   Kohl s  KSS   Groupon  GRPN   Walt Disney  DIS  and NVIDIA  NVDA  U K  Interest Rate Decision  estimated at 0 5 percent   Eurozone Interest Rate Decision  estimated at 0 75 percent   Canadian Trade Balance  estimated at CAD 2 0 billion   Chinese CPI  month over month estimated at 0 1 percent  FridayEarnings from  J C  Penney  JCP  and Apollo Global Management   APO  Chinese Retail Sales  estimated at 14 1    Chinese Industrial Production  estimated at 9 4 percent   German CPI  year over year estimated at 2 percent  By Sam Mattera,2012-11-04,Benzinga ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-week-ahead:-more-earnings-and-the-u.s.-election-142171,142171
12146,233661,NWS,Risk Assets Drifted Higher Ahead Of US Elections ,opinion,Risk assets drifted higher ahead of the US presidential election  Equities in Europe gained despite some uninspiring economic releases and a looming Greece austerity vote  The positive momentum continued in US trade where equities also gained ground in a fairly quiet session  Most risk currencies were fairly range bound apart from the Aussie dollar which experienced a sharp move following yesterday s RBA rate decision  AUD USD peaked at 1 04478 in US trade and remains firm heading into the Asian session  USD JPY traded at a low of 79 96  but swiftly recovered as it found support at around 80 and printed a high of 80 45 in US trade  Ahead of the open  we are calling the Aussie market up 0 5  at 4505  It will be all about elections today as results are expected to hit the wires as the day progresses  This will probably warrant some caution among most investors  There is still a probability that we won t get a definitive result until tomorrow should key states be very close  Such a situation will probably prolong the conservative mood investors are currently in  An outright winner will probably be the most desirable outcome for markets  On the local economic front we only have the AIG construction index due out today  On a stock level  we expect to see a firmer start for BHP Billiton with its ADR pointing to a 0 5  rise to  34 97  Commodities bounced back yesterday and this should support resource names today  Gold rallied back above USD 1700 to a high of US 1721 and this could see local gold names outperform their mining peers  Oil names will also be in focus after crude enjoyed a sharp move higher which will be positive for energy names  It is Commonwealth Bank s  CBA  turn to be under the spotlight today after releasing its September quarter trading update  CBA shares could test recent highs at  58 05 today  Newscorp  NWS  will also be in focus after releasing its first quarter earnings  Analysts were impressed by NWS s results as its shares rallied in the US  A move back above  24 for the local stock could see it test October highs at  25 20 ,2012-11-07,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/risk-assets-drifted-higher-ahead-of-us-elections-142596,142596

is poised to make a bundle off it  Tie that in with the company s already strong growth prospects and the future looks strong for PXP  Walt Disney  DIS  Disney s recent acquisition of Lucas Films is pure genius  The markets may have not reacted but this was a home run acquisition by Disney  Buying a brand like  Star Wars  will be a future gold mine for Disney  With two new trilogies in the works and the Star Wars characters being added to all the Disney Parks not to mention the merchandise makes the revenue potential on this deal unlimited for DIS  Hain Celestial  HAIN  Things have never been better than right now for Hain Celestial and we expect this will all translate into strong stock performance going forward  Company sales during Hurricane Sandy have been through the roof  Backed by strong analysts recommendations the ceiling for future potential is high for HAIN  QUALCOMM  Inc   QCOM   Don t let the recent downgrade scare you away  QCOM is still a strong stock loaded with potential  EOG Resources  Inc   EOG  Natural Gas and Energy are booming sectors and within the sector specifically no company is stronger from top to bottom than EOG  With analysts across the board saying  BUY  we are to as the future looks strong for EOG  Fossil  Inc   FOSL  Don t let the missed earnings fool you into thinking that FOSL is dead as a stock  Instead let this be a time to buy Fossil on a dip as shares have fallen 12  down from  94 to  84  UBS AG  UBS  UBS has restructured their business and from the looks of it it s for the better  UBS is getting out of their money losing businesses and into money making ones  If executed properly  this could be a big swing in the right direction for UBS  Nevertheless  they are saying and doing the right things  which makes us optimistic and liking where things are headed  ADT Corp  NYSE  ADT  ADT Security Company is a stock to out for as after back to back analyst upgrades  it makes us confident that the company s on the way up  News Corp  NWSA  News Corp is set to spin off its ailing publishing business  which will overall be a big winner for shareholders  U S  Bancorp  USB  USB is being rewarded by domestic exposure making this U S  centric mortgage bank a very attractive investment   Wells Fargo   Company  WFC  Much like USB  strong domestic exposure will reward WFC investors with stronger earnings  profits  and in all higher stock price  Apple Inc   AAPL  Can you ever go wrong by investing in Apple  If you look at the Apple s historical prices  whenever people say it s time to SELL or the company is set for a drop it soars even higher  AAPL is being unfairly punished by Wall Street  which we believe makes the company more attractive allowing investors to purchase shares at a lower price point  As iPad

therefore there s no reason to go down the food chain and invest in MGM  If you want a strong casino stock  look at Las Vegas Sands  LVS   Walgreens Company  WAG  While some people are saying to buy Walgreen based on weakness  we think that s a reason to avoid the stock altogether  Align Technology  Inc   ALGN  After poor quarterly results and overall performance we are staying on the sidelines when it comes to ALGN  If you already own it HOLD and stay put however don t buy shares if you re an investor looking for new opportunities  McDonald s Corporation  MCD  Hold off on the Big Mac and

the food chain when it comes to Casino stocks and Ceasars is even below MGM  The stock has been dropping ever since it s IPI and we expect share prices to continue to slide even further  Like we said  if you want a casino stock to invest in  then go with Las Vegas Sands  LVS   Intel Corporation  INTC  Apple s decision to drop Intel as their chip maker and go in house making their own is huge news

12150,233665,NWS,Who Runs The World  Solid Proof It s A Core Group Of Wealthy Elitists,opinion,Does a shadowy group of obscenely wealthy elitists control the world  Do men and women with enormous amounts of money really run the world from behind the scenes  The answer might surprise you  Most of us tend to think of money as a convenient way to conduct transactions  but the truth is that it also represents power and control  And today we live in a  in which the super rich pull all the strings  When I am talking about the ultra wealthy  I am not just talking about people that have a few million dollars  As you will see later in this article  the ultra wealthy have enough money sitting in offshore banks to buy all of the goods and services produced in the United States during the course of an entire year and still be able to pay off the entire U S  national debt  That is an amount of money so large that it is almost incomprehensible  Under this ne0 feudalist system  all the rest of us are debt slaves  including our own governments  Just look around   everyone is drowning in debt  and all of that debt is making the ultra wealthy even wealthier  But the ultra wealthy don t just sit on all of that wealth  They use some of it to dominate the affairs of the nations  The ultra wealthy own virtually every major bank and every major corporation on the planet  They use a vast network of secret societies  think tanks and charitable organizations to advance their agendas and to keep their members in line  They control how we view the world through their ownership of the media and their dominance over our education system  They fund the campaigns of most of our politicians and they exert a tremendous amount of influence over international organizations such as the United Nations  the IMF  the World Bank and the WTO  When you step back and take a look at the big picture  there is little doubt about who runs the world  It is just that most people don t want to admit the truth  The ultra wealthy don t run down and put their money in the local bank like you and I do  Instead  they tend to stash their assets in places where they won t be taxed such as the Cayman Islands  According to a report that was released last summer  the global elite have up to  stashed in offshore banks around the globe  U S  GDP for 2011 was about 15 trillion dollars  and the U S  national debt is sitting at about 16 trillion dollars  so you could add them both together and you still wouldn t hit 32 trillion dollars  And of course that does not even count the money that is stashed in other locations that the study did not account for  and it does not count all of the wealth that the global elite have in hard assets such as real estate  precious metals  art  yachts  etc  The global elite have really hoarded an incredible amount of wealth in these troubled times  The following is from an article     Rich individuals and their families have as much as  32 trillion of hidden financial assets in offshore tax havens  representing up to  280 billion in lost income tax revenues  according to research published on Sunday  The study estimating the extent of global private financial wealth held in offshore accounts   excluding non financial assets such as real estate  gold  yachts and racehorses   puts the sum at between  21 and  32 trillion  The research was carried out for pressure group Tax Justice Network  which campaigns against tax havens  by James Henry  former chief economist at consultants McKinsey   Co  He used data from the World Bank  International Monetary Fund  United Nations and central banks  But as I mentioned previously  the global elite just don t have a lot of money  They also basically own just about every major bank and every major corporation on the entire planet  According to an outstanding   a study of more than 40 000 transnational corporations conducted by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich discovered that a very small core group of huge banks and giant predator corporations dominate the entire global economic system     of the relationships between 43 000 transnational corporations has identified   mainly banks  with disproportionate power over the global economy  The researchers found that this core group consists of just 147 very tightly knit companies    When the team further untangled the web of ownership  it found much of it tracked back to a  super entity  of 147 even more tightly knit companies   all of their ownership was held by other members of the super entity   that controlled 40 per cent of the total wealth in the network   In effect  less than 1 per cent of the companies were able to control 40 per cent of the entire network   says Glattfelder  Most were financial institutions  The top 20 included Barclays Bank  JPMorgan Chase   Co  and The Goldman Sachs Group  The following are the  banks and corporations at the heart of this  super entity   You will recognize many of the names on the list    1  Barclays plc 2  Capital Group Companies Inc 3  FMR Corporation 4  AXA 5  State Street Corporation 6  JP Morgan Chase   Co 7  Legal   General Group plc 8  Vanguard Group Inc 9  UBS AG 10  Merrill Lynch   Co Inc 11  Wellington Management Co LLP 12  Deutsche Bank AG 13  Franklin Resources Inc 14  Credit Suisse Group 15  Walton Enterprises LLC 16  Bank of New York Mellon Corp 17  Natixis 18  Goldman Sachs Group Inc 19  T Rowe Price Group Inc 20  Legg Mason Inc 21  Morgan Stanley 22  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc 23  Northern Trust Corporation 24  Soci t  G n rale 25  Bank of America Corporation The ultra wealthy elite often hide behind layers and layers of ownership  but the truth is that thanks to interlocking corporate relationships  the elite basically control almost every Fortune 500 corporation  The amount of power and control that this gives them is hard to describe  Unfortunately  this same group of people have been running things for a very long time  For example  New York City Mayor John F  Hylan said the following during a speech all the way     The real menace of our Republic is the invisible government  which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy legs over our cities  states and nation  To depart from mere generalizations  let me say that at the head of this octopus are the Rockefeller Standard Oil interests and a small group of powerful banking houses generally referred to as the international bankers  The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States government for their own selfish purposes  They practically control both parties  write political platforms  make catspaws of party leaders  use the leading men of private organizations  and resort to every device to place in nomination for high public office only such candidates as will be amenable to the dictates of corrupt big business  These international bankers and Rockefeller Standard Oil interests control the majority of the newspapers and magazines in this country  They use the columns of these papers to club into submission or drive out of office public officials who refuse to do the bidding of the powerful corrupt cliques which compose the invisible government  It operates under cover of a self created screen  and  seizes our executive officers  legislative bodies  schools  courts  newspapers and every agency created for the public protection  These international bankers created the central banks of the world  including    and they use those central banks to get the governments of the world ensnared in  from which there is no escape   is a way to  legitimately  take money from all of us  transfer it to the government  and then transfer it into the pockets of the ultra wealthy  Today   and almost all members of Congress absolutely refuse to criticize the Fed  but in the past there have been some brave members of Congress that have been willing to take a stand  For example  the following quote is from a speech that Congressman Louis T  McFadden delivered to the U S  House of Representatives     Mr  Chairman  we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known  I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks  The Federal Reserve Board  a Government board  has cheated the Government of the United States and the people of the United States out of enough money to pay the national debt  The depredations and iniquities of the Federal Reserve Board has cost this country enough money to pay the national debt several times over  This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the United States  has bankrupted itself  and has practically bankrupted our Government  It has done this through the defects of the law under which it operates  through the maladministration of that law by the Federal Reserve Board  and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it  Sadly  most Americans still believe that the Federal Reserve is a  federal agency   but that is simply not correct  The following comes     The stockholders in the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks are the privately owned banks that fall under the Federal Reserve System  These include all national banks  chartered by the federal government  and those state chartered banks that wish to join and meet certain requirements  About 38 percent of the nation s more than 8 000 banks are members of the system  and thus own the Fed banks  According to researchers that have looked into the ownership of the big Wall Street banks that dominate the Fed  the same names keep coming up over and over  the Rockefellers  the Rothschilds  the Warburgs  the Lazards  the Schiffs and the royal families of Europe  But ultra wealthy international bankers have not just done this kind of thing in the United States  Their goal was to create a global financial system that they would dominate and control  Just check out what Georgetown University history professor Carroll Quigley      T he powers of financial capitalism had another far reaching aim  nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole  This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert  by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences  The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basle  Switzerland  a private bank owned and controlled by the world s central banks which were themselves private corporations  Sadly  most Americans have never even heard of the Bank for International Settlements  but it is at the very heart of the global financial system  The following is     As an organization of central banks  the BIS seeks to make monetary policy more predictable and transparent among its 58 member central banks  While monetary policy is determined by each sovereign nation  it is subject to central and private banking scrutiny and potentially to speculation that affects foreign exchange rates and especially the fate of export economies  Failures to keep monetary policy in line with reality and make monetary reforms in time  preferably as a simultaneous policy among all 58 member banks and also involving the International Monetary Fund  have historically led to losses in the billions as banks try to maintain a policy using open market methods that have proven to be based on unrealistic assumptions  The ultra wealthy have also played a major role in establishing other important international institutions such as the United Nations  the IMF  the World Bank and the WTO  In fact  the land for the United Nations headquarters in New York City was purchased and donated by John D  Rockefeller  The international bankers are  internationalists  and they are very proud of that fact  The elite also dominate the education system in the United States  Over the years  the Rockefeller Foundation and other elitist organizations have poured massive amounts of money   Today  Ivy League schools are considered to be the standard against which all other colleges and universities in America are measured  and the last four U S  presidents were educated at Ivy League schools  The elite also exert a tremendous amount of influence through various secret societies  Skull and Bones  the Freemasons  etc    through some very powerful think tanks and social clubs  the Council on Foreign Relations  the Trilateral Commission  the Bilderberg Group  the Bohemian Grove  Chatham House  etc    and through a vast network of charities and non governmental organizations  the Rockefeller Foundation  the Ford Foundation  the World Wildlife Fund  etc    But for a moment  I want to focus on the power the elite have over the media  In a   I detailed how just six monolithic corporate giants control most of what we watch  hear and read every single day  These giant corporations own television networks  cable channels  movie studios  newspapers  magazines  publishing houses  music labels and even many of our favorite websites  Considering the fact that the average American watches  of television a month  the influence of these six giant corporations should not be underestimated  The following are just some of the media companies that these corporate giants own    Time Warner Home Box Office  HBO  Time Inc  Turner Broadcasting System  Inc  Warner Bros

classes  a k a  the 20  of the population that holds 93  of the wealth  the happy few who run the corporations and the banks  own and operate the news and entertainment media  compose the laws and govern the universities  control the philanthropic foundations  the policy institutes  the casinos  and the sports arenas   Have you ever wondered why things never seem to change in Washington D C  no matter who we vote for  Well  it is because both parties are owned by the establishment  It would be nice to think that the American people are in control of who runs things in the U S   but that is not how it works in the real world  In the real world  the politician that raises more money wins  in national races  Our politicians are not stupid   they are going to be very good to the people that can give them the giant piles of money that they need for their campaigns  And the people that can do that are the ultra wealthy and the giant corporations that the ultra wealthy control  Are you starting to get the picture  There is a reason why the ultra wealthy are referred to as  the establishment   They have set up a system that greatly benefits them and that allows them to pull the strings  So who runs the world  They do  In fact  they even admit as much  David Rockefeller wrote the following      For more than a century  ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions  Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States  characterizing my family and me as  internationalists  and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure   one world  if you will  If that is the charge  I stand guilty  and I am proud of it   There is so much more that could be said about all of this  In fact  an entire library of books could be written about the power and the influence of the ultra wealthy international bankers that run the world  But hopefully this is enough to at least get some conversations started  So what do you think about all of this  Please feel free to post a comment with your thoughts below   ,2013-01-30,Michael T.

12157,233672,NWS,Phone hacking scandal  The woman who defied the Murdoch empire,opinion,As James Murdoch prepares for a second line of questioning from the Culture  Media and Sport Committee  one of the key investors of News Corp  Julie Tanner of CBIS  remembers the AGM where democracy fought back against the Murdoch family  Assistant director at Christian Brothers Investment Services  CBIS   Julie Tanner has for a long time advocated transparency  CBIS  a leader in socially responsible investing  prides itself in promoting  transparent corporate governance and mak ing boards accountable to shareholders  In 2005 it raised concerns with Time Warner over the issue of an independent chair  and more recently made the same complaint with Goldman Sachs  Then  during the summer  news of the phone hacking scandal emerged that sent shockwaves across the media  How could a national newspaper be so wreckless  How could its corporate governance be so negligent  By the time the News Corp AGM was held in October  shareholders had decided to do something   It was clear that investors wanted to use their vote to speak out against board members and to the Murdoch family   says Mrs  Tanner   It is apparent that independent shareholders believe this insider arrangement is the polar opposite of transparent corporate governance  In a protest vote  more than half of the shareholders voted against the reinstatement of James Murdoch as CEO of News Corp and although he was re elected to the board  the 232 million votes against him has severely undermined his position CBIS became aware of the phone hacking scandal when it was revealed that the Sunday tabloid  the News of the World had hacked the phone of Milly Dowler  a teenager murdered in 2002  Following the discovery  the newspaper was been shut down within weeks  by Ruper Murdoch   Our concerns were raised due to the phone hacking scandal that led to an erosion of public confidence  within the corporation   said Tanner   It threatened the journalistic reputation and viability of publications critical to News Corporation s success  The NOTW closure wasn t enough to stop the momentum as further information began to be revealed  A domino effect had been put in motion that led to the arrest of journalists  former editors and investigators  And then Rupert and James Murdoch were called in front of the parliamentary committee The series of incidents led to massive drop in investor confidence and CBIS  along with other shareholders  realised that the AGM was a chance to voice concern against News Corp   a company they had invested millions of dollars into   The events that led to the closure of News Corporation s News of the World operations raised investor concerns about the cost in jobs  reputation  market position and enterprise value  It was an inadequate oversight and maintenance of corporate culture within the company   said Tanner This afternoon  James Murdoch will face the committee once again  The Labour MP Tom Watson  who also flew to LA to attend the meeting to meet distressed shareholders  will lead questions on how much Murdoch Jr  knew about the phone hacking  Tanner hopes the investigation will go even further   We believe that the board should launch a truly independent investigation into the failures of company culture that enabled these ethical lapses   she says   The newly created Management and Standards Committee must be strengthened so that it is led by an organisation or person who can look objectively at News Corp s ethical failures and that has the authority to take the bold actions needed to remedy them ,2011-11-10,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/analysis/phone-hacking-scandal:-the-woman-who-defied-the-murdoch-empire-105320,105320

12475,233990,NWS,5 Undervalued Stocks With 0  Earnings Growth,opinion,"Q4 Earnings Growth
This earnings season continues to be a story of growth  According to Zack s Investment Research  219 members of the S P 500 have reported earnings as of Wednesday  February 1st  Total earnings from these companies have grown 5 4  in Q4 compared to 2 7  in Q3  Overall  S P 500 member earnings are on pace to reach their highest level in nearly two years 
In light of these positive growth figures  we thought it would be interesting to search for stocks that appear undervalued based on an Earnings Power Value analysis 
Earnings Power Value
The Earnings Power Value  EPV  analysis is a quick way to estimate the fair value of a stock by making an assumption about the sustainability of earnings  The approach was popularized by Professor Bruce Greenwald in the book   The formula 
Value   Adjusted Earnings   Cost of Capital
As the formula suggests  future earnings growth is excluded from the calculation  Learn more about the  
5 Undervalued Stocks At Zero Growth
According to Yahoo finance  there are 875 companies expected to report earnings this week  2 6 2 10   However  finbox io data shows that only five appear to be trading below their fair value estimate derived from finbox io s EPV analysis  Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   News Corporation  NASDAQ NWS   Viacom Inc  NASDAQ VIA   Whole Foods Market Inc  NASDAQ WFM  and Teradata Corporation  NYSE TDC  
Gilead is expected to report earnings on Tuesday and our EPV analysis implies a fair value of  114 47 per share  That s nearly 50  above the company s current trading price  This implies the market is expecting significant earnings erosion  approximately 5  per year  
News Corporation is expected to report earnings on Thursday and nine separate valuation analyses imply the stock s almost 40  undervalued  Even at no earnings growth  the company still appears to be nearly 30  undervalued 
Nine cash flow analyses imply that Viacom is 19  undervalued  Interestly  the EPV analysis concludes over 30  upside  The company is expected to report earnings on Thursday before the market opens 
Whole Foods Market is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday after the market closes and the stock is currently trading near its 52 week low  If the company could sustain its current earnings level  the stock s intrinsic value would be closer to  40 per share 
Teradata is slated to report earnings on Thursday before the market opens  The EPV analysis implies about 17  margin of safety  However  Wall Street and the market expect future earnings to decline 
The EPV model is not a perfect predictor of fair value  not unlike any other valuation model  However  the technique is quite useful for quickly getting a sense of the risk of investing in a company at the current price  With a few assumptions  you can quickly determine if a company justifies further research  Hence  it may be worth looking closer at some of the companies mentioned above ",2017-02-02,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-undervalued-stocks-with-0-earnings-growth-200174536,200174536
12495,234010,NWS,Will Amazon s Bookstores Thrive In New York City ,opinion,"E commerce giant Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN   is  its first bookstore in New York City tomorrow  bringing the total number of physical bookstore locations for the company to seven  Customers can currently shop at Amazon Books in Seattle  Chicago  San Diego  Portland  and Dedham and Lynnfield  Massachusetts 
The store is located in a 4 000 square foot brick and mortar space in The Shops at Columbus Circle  a mall like structure in Manhattan  This will be one of two New York City Amazon Books locations  and like others  the bookstore will display ratings and reviews  mimicking the bookselling experience of Amazon com  3 000 books will be stocked  and each book will have reached a four star or more rating on Amazon  with the exception of certain bestsellers and new releases 
The bookstores are very tech savvy  and customers can utilize the Amazon app on their smartphones to scan bar codes placed next to the books to see additional information  Even popular Amazon devices like the Echo and Fire tablets will be on display  in addition to other gift items typically found in a bookstore 
One thing that makes Amazon Books stand out is its payment method  it doesn t accept cash  Prime members can  instead  use the Amazon app to pay for purchases  while non members can use a credit or debit card  As for pricing  it s the same as on Amazon com  but non Prime members pay the list price on books and other items 
For Amazon  location is key for Amazon Books  Not only is the bookstore entering into rival Barnes   Noble s   NYSE BKS   territory  but Columbus Circle has that mall vibe  housing other stores like H M  J  Crew  Coach   NYSE COH    and Whole Foods   NYSE M    so a bookstore makes a perfect addition 
Additionally  New York City is a key city for book publishing  home to some of the industry s giants like Scholastic   NASDAQ SCHL    News Corp   NASDAQ NWS    which owns publishing house HarperCollins  global academic publishing company John Wiley   Sons   Time Inc    NYSE TIME    and Pearson  LON PSON  Plc   NYSE PSO    Amazon Books is  these company s corporate headquarters  perhaps as a reminder that Amazon is still there  and still redefining the media industry 
How will Amazon Books do in the Big Apple  Probably pretty well  These bookstores seemed to be designed for the masses  and the company s first New York City location is perfectly placed in a shopper and tourist friendly space  Even the second bookstore on 34th Street will be near the city s Macy s   NYSE M   flagship location  another prime shopping hub 
More Amazon Books locations coming soon include one in New Jersey  another in Bellevue  WA  and two more in California
