President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Kevin  Good morning  everyone  This morning  we announced financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020  which represented improved local case growth in our US Foodservice segment  primarily driven by our independent customers  I will start with second quarter results  continue with segment specific commentary  transition into the first half of fiscal 2020 results  and then close with a general business update Our total Sysco results for the second quarter include a sales increase of 1 8  to  15 billion  which was driven by US Broadline local case growth of 3 7   Gross profit grew 2  to  2 8 billion  and gross margin increased 5 basis points  We saw growth in our sales of Sysco brand products in the second quarter  which increased 27 basis points to 47  of local US cases and 42 basis points to 38 3  of total US cases  Adjusted operating expense increased 1 5  during the quarter  which resulted in an adjusted operating income increase of 3 9  to  626 9 million  Adjusted earnings per share grew 13 2  to  0 85 I ll now transition to our quarterly results by business segment  starting with our US Foodservice Operations  Local case volume increased 3 7  versus the prior year period and has now grown for 23 consecutive quarters  As previously noted  we remain disciplined in our approach to managing our national account business  which was reflected this quarter in our total case volume growth  As a result  total case volume growth was 2  for US Broadline operations  Sales for the second quarter were  10 4 billion  which was an increase of 3 2  versus the prior year period  This includes the divestiture of Iowa Premium  our beef processing facility that was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  which had a negative impact of  122 million for the quarter Gross profit grew 2 4  to  2 billion for the quarter  While we are pleased with the gross profit dollar growth  gross margin declined 17 basis points to 19 7   This is primarily driven by a few key levers  First  we saw an unusually high rate of inflation specifically in the dairy and beef categories  As a result  we re unable to efficiently pass inflation through to our customers  Separately but still related  we saw a return to more normalized pricing in produce markets  compared to a sharp increase in the second quarter last year  which resulted in a negative impact to our gross profit dollar growth  We expect this year over year headwind to continue into the third fiscal quarter  Lastly  fuel surcharges  which appear in gross profit for us  were less this year than in the prior year period Turning our attention to costs  Our adjusted operating expenses increased 1  to  1 3 billion  As we ve discussed in our previous quarters  our labor costs were slightly higher due to our decision to retain driver and warehouse personnel in a tight labor market  We ll continue to evaluate our staffing trends relative to our business model over the next couple of quarters  Additionally  we experienced a 12 day strike in Denver  which resulted in added costs from the business impact of continuing to serve customers during that period  Adjusted operating income increased 4 7  to  772 million within our US Foodservice Operations segment Moving to International Foodservice Operations  we had mixed results for the quarter  Our international results were modestly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates  On a constant currency basis  sales increased 0 9   gross profit increased 0 4   adjusted operating expenses increased 2 2   and adjusted operating income decreased 11 1   Our business results in Canada softened for the quarter as a result of a slowing economy in some parts of the country and the loss of a large chain customer  Our business results across Europe were mixed As mentioned during the first quarter call  we continue to experience operational challenges arising from our integration efforts between our two businesses in France  which is offsetting growth in our other international businesses  We expect this to continue through the end of our fiscal year  However  the UK business performance remained stable despite ongoing uncertainties around Brexit  We are continuing our work around modernizing the business and growing our customer base In Sweden and Ireland  we saw positive results versus the prior year period stemming from a positive business environment and solid independent sales growth  We remain convinced that Europe will be a growth opportunity for the company in the years ahead As for our business in Latin America  the companies are performing well and we remain excited about the growth opportunities in this region  We extended our retail cash and carry footprint from Costa Rica into Panama with plans to open more stores there in the future In Costa Rica  we saw solid growth despite a slight economic slowdown due to the recent implementation of a value added tax  In Mexico  the business has improved meaningfully year over year despite continued economic contraction  Our SYGMA segment continues to show improved profitability as we remain disciplined and focused on our portfolio of customers  As a result  we saw planned top line softness as sales decreased 5 3  versus the prior year period  but gross margin expanded 62 basis points Adjusted operating expenses were down for the quarter  driven by a focus on business and routing optimization  which led to an adjusted operating income improvement of  8 million versus the prior year period  We feel good about the continued progress we re making within SYGMA and are confident in our ability to drive improved performance going forward Finally  it is important to note that our core business is performing fairly well as our adjusted operating income from operations increased 5 5  versus the prior year period  However  our corporate expenses increased due to several discrete items such as costs from the Denver strike and other liability claims  Therefore  our adjusted operating income increased only 3 9  versus the prior year period Now  turning to our results for the first half of fiscal year 2020  Sales increased 1 2  to  30 3 billion  Our local case growth in the US Broadline was 2 9   and total case growth was 1 4   Gross profit increased 1 7  to  5 8 billion  and gross margin increased 10 basis points  Our overall expense management was solid with adjusted operating expenses increasing only 0 5  for the first 26 weeks Adjusted operating income increased 5 7  to  1 4 billion  resulting in a gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth of 120 basis points  Adjusted earnings per share increased by 10 7  to  1 83  Cash flow from operations was  754 5 million for the first half of fiscal 2020  Net capex for the first half of the year was  383 1 million or about 1 3  of sales  which as a reminder is in line with our previously noted guidance Free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2020 was  371 4 million  which is  329 5 million lower compared to the same period last year  The decline in free cash flow was impacted by an increase in working capital as we continue to experience challenges from our ongoing implementation of the finance transformation road map as well as an increase in bad debt accounts  Strong cash flow has always been a strength of Sysco  and we are confident that we will see an improvement to this trend by the end of the fiscal year Before closing  I d like to make a few additional comments about our financial performance where we stand relative to our three year plan goals and our outlook for the year  We have a chart on Slide 14 of the earnings presentation slides on our website detailing anticipated results compared to our most recent three year plan guidance As you recall  our three year plan included six different financial objectives  These included total case growth of 2 5  to 3   for which we are tracking to 2 5   local case growth of 3  to 3 3   for which we are tracking to 3 3   sales growth of 3 5  to 4   for which we are tracking to 3 7   gross profit dollar growth of 3 5  to 4   for which we are tracking to 3 6   adjusted operating income growth of about 8  or  600 million  for which we are tracking to 7   and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15   for which we are tracking to approximately 15 5  When we announced senior leadership changes last month with a goal of accelerating growth and operating improvements  we noted that our fiscal year 2020 performance was generally tracking along with consensus estimates  As you can see from the chart  we continue to generate strong performance relative to our three year plan across virtually all metrics However  after closing the second fiscal quarter and considering recent performance even with some clear positives such as an acceleration in local case growth  we have decided to make adjustments to our outlook  Specifically given challenges we are seeing and have discussed this morning relative to year to date performance  specifically challenges related to inflation changes  integration challenges in France  discrete corporate expenses I noted earlier  and given certain investment opportunities we see today that can deliver strong returns over time  we have decided to amend our plan Specifically  we are lowering our adjusted operating income growth target to approximately  500 million to  525 million to the previously communicated approximately  600 million target and lowering our three year adjusted operating income growth guidance from approximately 8  to 7  We would note that the benefits we re seeing below the line in areas such as interest and tax rate provided added flexibility to make these investments now  while still delivering on our previously communicated top line and bottom line earnings per share targets  While we do not like to move backwards at any part of our previously communicated commitments  when given the decision between achieving a short term goal or investing for the long term  we will always choose to invest for the future The investments we are making will allow us to advance work that will both further enhance our customer focus while accelerating future growth and to continue our efforts to efficiently manage costs through improved processes  It is important to note that we are incredibly excited about Sysco s future  one that will include continued leadership across the foodservice industry driven by investments in our customer centric strategies and fueled by the best associates in the business With that  operator  we are now ready to take questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo Edward Kelly    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystHi  Good morning  guys  And Kevin  let me just me be the first to say welcome to Sysco  My first question actually is for you  Kevin  I mean  I know it s obviously very early days  but you and the Board have clearly highlighted the desire to grow faster as a company over time  Can you just give us some sense as to what that means and how you get there profitably  I think there is just some concern around when companies make CEO changes and talk about accelerating growth about what the cost of that potentially could be  And I m just curious philosophically how you re thinking about    how you think about the path to that  Yeah  good morning  and I appreciate the call    the question on the call this morning  First  I do want to acknowledge the good work that the company has been doing and the strong results and  as Joel said  the very capable team here at Sysco  And to directly answer your question  where do we see opportunities for growth  The first is  we need to and can leverage our scale and our size more efficiently  Joel referenced improved processes  taking cost out of the system  That cost that we can take out of the system that is where we can fuel and fund top line growth in the future  We will be very pragmatic and disciplined on our pricing strategies  Joel  I know  has covered that consistently quarter over quarter  We will be very thoughtful about how we price the business  Ed referenced there are underserved markets for Sysco  A specific example would be the metro market where we under represent versus our national average  There are some things we can do vis a vis how we serve those customers more strategically with  we ll call  customized tailored supply chain solutions for those markets  and that would be again another area of where and how we can grow that s not tied to price  I guess  I would just wrap up with saying  as you know  this is a very highly fragmented market  one where the largest player in the space through the investments that we can make  the capabilities that we can bring to the table  we can take increased share over time  and that s our plan Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd Ed  if I could just add one thing to that  I think  look  we ve said many times  and we ve said that our strategy as a leader in this industry has never been to lead with price  It never has been  it never will be  And so  I think the    again  some of the stuff that you re seeing this quarter as we talked about was related to some    a bit elevated inflation that happened at a higher level and at an accelerated rate that allowed us some inefficiencies on passing that along  But again  I just want to reiterate  Indecipherable  what Kevin said and just to add on to that question just a bit  and that is not and never will be a strategy of ours to lead with price Edward Kelly    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystCan I just follow up then  Joel  The case level profitability on gross profit per case this quarter was obviously disappointing  And you mentioned the inflation component  But inflation overall didn t really accelerate from Q1  I m just    I guess I m struggling with what changed from an inflation standpoint and why you had issues with passing through costs within dairy and the protein side  And then  why even through the back half of the year  it sounds like you expect that pressure to continue Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So  a couple of points  First  I would say  one of the things that we saw    remember  the average that we talked about inflation is one number  but obviously it s made up of a lot of different categories  And some of those categories tend to be harder to pass along inflation with    than others  And again  certainly the Center of the Plate category is the ones that tend to be more emotional on our space  And so  what we experienced  and particularly in the later part of the quarter  was an acceleration in the areas that we talked about primarily in Center of the Plate and beef  in dairy and    as well as some in canned and dry  But really the beef and dairy categories were the primary ones  And I think  again  as we ve talked about a number of times  it s not just that overall number  it s the rate at which they re actually accelerating  And certainly that s part of what we saw again toward the later part of this quarter that we struggled to pass along The other point I would make  when you actually look at the overall  given if you will gross profit per case  One of the things we called out here is  some of the produce market that we had last year that was related to weather impacts in California  And so  at that time  we had some positive gains from the produce markets  That was the latter part of the second quarter last year  and we actually saw that carry into the early part of the third quarter of last year as well  And so  on a per case basis  when you look at the overall gross profit  it really is related to  again  some of the struggle of the inefficiency of passing some of the inflation along to the produce markets  again the piece around the fuel surcharge  particularly areas that we struggled with The question that you had in terms of    as we see that outlook moving forward  I think one of the things we did continue to see is some of those challenges that we had toward the latter part of this quarter and carry into the early part of the third quarter  And so  I think that some of it  again  will be somewhat self correcting in a sense that in the case of our multi unit customers  so that 50  of the business that we have on a cost plus arrangement where it s a relatively short time lag to pass some of that cost along  Again  we ll anticipate seeing  I d say  some improvement there  But again  particularly the categories that we saw the inflation in and the rate that we saw the increase is why we had some challenges passing that along  And it impacted our margins  particularly in the US Foodservice business Edward Kelly    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystGreat  Thank you Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Ed OperatorOur next question comes from Chris Mandeville with Jefferies Chris Mandeville    Jefferies    AnalystHey  good morning  Kevin  I guess  similar to Ed s question here  I imagine a little bit more of a detailed go forward strategy is going to be laid out at some point  So  I guess I m just wondering what the reasonable time frame to expect there  And is there any ability to elaborate a bit more on the comments surrounding a desire to improve in underdeveloped markets and your ability to deliver strong results in large complex environments  I mean  I guess when I think about that  it sounds like you re referring to urban markets and from what we understand that s already a fairly competitive environment and comes with low margins  So  how do you navigate those waters and accelerating sales but yet not diluting your margin Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo let me take that  I ll let Kevin add in if he so desires  Obviously it s pretty much his first day on the job  so we should take that into consideration here  But what I will say is the following  The idea that the metro markets are competitive is certainly true  The idea that the metro markets are somehow inherently unprofitable  I would certainly debate that with you significantly  because again there s    one of the areas that we have been underdeveloped is in some of the most sort of dense urban markets And in some of those cases  it is about the ways that we go to market and the value that we provide to those customers  And in so many of the cases  and particularly in some  again  the    some of the high end restaurants and some of the different metropolitan areas  again  price becomes much less of an issue when the go to market strategy is the right one  And so  I    so I ll let Kevin chime in here  but I just want to probably a little bit debunk this idea that somehow we re just charging into the less profitable area Kevin  I ll let you take it from here Kevin Hourican    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Joel  So what I was referring to  yes  was the more metro markets where our share underrepresents  And the why as I mentioned earlier was the supply chain solutions and the go to market strategy that works in more suburban or rural area does not necessarily work in a downtown metro environment  Some of these high volume  let s just call  New York City restaurants  they may need delivery multiple times per day  And what we will work on are solutions that provide more tailored support for those types of customers in a cost efficient way so that the business would be profitable  And Joel already covered the profit per customer  so I won t build on that Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think the other thing I would point out  Chris  when we talk about investments that we re making  some of the investments that we re talking about here are to continue to enhance the way that our technology tools interact with our customers  to continue to enhance the way our technology tools allow our salespeople to be supported in a different way that allows  again  for these types of interactions  So I think  again    so a lot of these things that we re talking about here is certainly    are where we see opportunities  and again particularly in these areas where we re very    we re significantly underpenetrated Chris Mandeville    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then  Joel  I guess recently I believe there was a decision to outsource your customer service department  Any way that you can elaborate on what went into that analysis with respect to potential cost savings versus maybe some service disruption or just changes for that matter  How does the department change with respect to its overall interaction with account  And does anyone else in the industry necessarily have a similar model Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  let me start with the premise of why that decision was made and the thought process around that  If you look at Sysco historically  one of the challenges that we ve had in servicing our national customers is the idea that we ve primarily had customer care at each operating company level  So if you re a    name the CMU customer  and you had to solve issues whether it were credit issues  whether it were customer service issues  your primary points of contact were in a very decentralized    we service in 50 locations  you basically had 50 points of contact  which obviously is suboptimal in terms of the service for a large national account So the basic strategic premise for doing this was to actually have a situation where you actually had  again  sort of a one call  one single point of contact for customer care  single point of contact for credit issues  And so  the whole reason strategically for doing this was around that  Part of the work that we did and the decisions in terms of why we chose to do things in the way that we did was again both to have a partner that would allow us to provide the technology support to enable that work  and again to restructure the team somewhat differently in a way that again it was really more focused around teams of this sort of single point of contact for customers So  I actually look at this as a very good strategic enhancement for our business both from the perspective of the ability to actually sell those customers and serve them in a different way and take care of their needs  But in addition to that  and again  I d say a little bit later down the line from a cost perspective  Obviously  there s some initial work required to invest in this model  Over time  we do believe it will be a more efficient model  but that s the premise of what that was done for Chris Mandeville    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  I appreciate it  Thanks Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah OperatorOur next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities John Heinbockel    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystMaybe for Kevin  When you think about the market share opportunity  right  particularly in those metro markets  what s your early thought on the structure and size of the sales organization  right  Do you think you need to step up hiring of MAs in some of those areas  And then  distribution platform  do you think capital is required to put facilities in closer to some of those metro markets or it s really not a capital issue as much as it s maybe trucking equipment and scheduling Kevin Hourican    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thank you for the question  John  I d say  on the talent and people side  it s too premature for me to comment upon that  as Joel mentioned  just started with the company  And a big part of my on boarding will be  what we call  listening tour  which is going out and talking to our MAs all throughout the country our sales associates to listen and to learn from them  Some of the best most customer centric ideas  innovations come from that front line associate  It could be the MA  it could be the driver that s been delivering to an account for many  many years in some instances at Sysco decades  They have great ideas on how we can better serve the customers  So  I can t wait to get started in regards to traveling around the country and meeting our great associates  and learning from them on how we can best serve our customers So too premature to comment upon are there more or fewer over time  You ll hear more from us later in the year on our strategy and where we re headed in that regard  As it relates to supply chain solutions  this is my expertise by trade and by background  We will do a thorough end to end network optimization review to determine number of facilities  optimization of which end points are stored from those facilities  The work we do there though will be thoughtful  and we will self fund the work that we need to do  We re not at this point communicating a need to increase capital investment  We can reduce cost and use that reduction in cost to fuel and fund the investments that we will make  That is our remit  that is our charter  and I know you re looking for specifics today  Those specifics will come in due time John Heinbockel    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystAnd then  Joel  maybe    I don t know  if you have an idea of how much lower your share is in these urban metro markets  I assume it s more than half what your overall share is  but any idea how much lower it is Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt depends on the market as you can imagine  There s some that we re better penetrated than others  But I would say  generally it s    I would say  somewhat less than half would be the way I would think about that John Heinbockel    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystOkay  Thanks Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah Kevin Hourican    President and Chief Executive OfficerI just want to add one thing to that  I don t want the participants on the call to perceive that our singular sole step  Phonetic  growth is through those metro markets  We have multiple vectors of growth  We just highlighted one of them as an example to answer a question earlier on in the call John Heinbockel    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Judah Frommer with Credit Suisse Judah Frommer    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  Thanks for taking the question  I just wanted to circle back on kind of this decision to pull forward operating expense  and then what s going to effectively kind of limit the adjusted operating income growth over this three year period  So  there are clearly some issues with operating expense and delivery on operating income growth both internationally and locally  whether it s labor in the US or the consolidation in France  So  can you help us with the decision to pull forward and kind of layer on top of what seems to be going in fits and starts  And then  maybe more specifically  is a lot of this tied to the metro market share or are there other aspects you can highlight as well Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So  a couple of points  Again  just as a    the general gist of the three year plan to takedown  it was    as we talked about some of the things related to some of the margin  challenges and opportunities  the work    the integration work in France  some of the discrete expenses from a corporate perspective  The investments in the business  the way I would actually characterize that and again  this falls into the category of the point I made literally toward the end of my prepared remarks  where we talked about the decision  Would we just simply hold off on investments that we believe are really important in order to hit short term goals or in order to accelerate some of those investments to continue to move forward on some of the things we believe are really important  And a little bit    and certainly we always have and always will choose the latter in that scenario So  the point Kevin made earlier  again  the metro example was just simply one idea or one point that was an example of some of the areas we re looking to accelerate  But the investment is really centered around a few key areas that I d probably highlight for you  It centers around these areas around accelerating work in our customer facing technologies  It centers around accelerating work in the technologies that support our salespeople and allow them to go to market  support our customers in the way that we think  again  certainly moves some of these things forward in an accelerated way  They focus on areas what I would call simplification of our business in terms of the way that we interact with our suppliers  with our customers  They look at the way that we can actually accelerate And when I say cost savings  I look at cost from almost an end to end view in terms of both how we accelerate areas of cost of goods all to indirect spend  all of those types of things that some of the investments that we re making  we believe  will allow us to accelerate in each of those areas  again both due to simplifications as well as some of the enhancements again in technology  And then  so I    those are the way I would categorize some of the work in the investments And certainly  as we ve talked about the need to continue to accelerate growth in this business  they need to leverage scale in a better way  they need to go to market in a way that enhances our ability to service this wider group of customers in a better way  I would characterize our investments as falling into that  And again    and frankly  we felt it is important to    they re important long term investments that we thought were very much worth accelerating Judah Frommer    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  Maybe just a follow up on that  Kevin  would you say you had a hand in kind of pulling forward these investments or are these kind of investments that have been now there beyond the current three year plan that the Board is deciding to pull forward  And then  Joel  if you could just help us with modeling the EPS growth coming in  in line  any help on the interest expense or tax line would be great Kevin Hourican    President and Chief Executive OfficerJoel will start and then I m going to do a follow up close to what Joel covered Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean    so look  what I would say is that there is    it is a continuation of some degree of investments that have already been made  but an acceleration at work  So what I would say is    and again  I ll let Kevin say this to you  I mean  I think Kevin  there s an alignment with the strategic approach we re taking  But to say Kevin was one that directly said  hey  we d accelerate that would not be a fair statement  We certainly believe that as a leadership team that that was important work  again  supported by Kevin and by our Board  I ll let you   Kevin Hourican    President and Chief Executive OfficerI ll just    I ll build on  I ll ask a question and answer  and it s    Kevin  are you aligned with the Sysco priorities and the investments that Joel just referred to are directly driving those key priorities  The answer to that is  yes  I am  The company s number one priority is to be a customer first culture  and I m 100  aligned to that culture  As I mentioned earlier  the best ideas  the most innovation    innovative solutions come by better understanding the needs of your customer and providing solutions that help you do better business with those customers  Joel referenced that  It s also our MA sales force  providing them with better tools to be able to be more effective at their roles  That s a part of this investment  and I m 100  aligned with that The second one is our local transformation  And Joel talked about essentially a framework of capabilities that can then be deployed to match the needs of a local trade area  One of those happens to be metro  and that s customer onboarding  I mentioned supply chain solutions and a customer ordering tool improvement  I m aligned with all of those things And last but not least is business optimization  Joel talked about funding sources for growth by improving the manner with which we run our business  We ve talked about leveraging our scale  Leveraging our scale is  we should be the lowest cost operator in the business  and therefore then be able to pass upon to our customers savings tied to the efficiency improvements and also create sources for investing growth dollars  So  I am aligned with the priorities and I m very supportive of the decision that was made Judah Frommer    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat OperatorOur next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Jeffrey Bernstein    Barclays    AnalystGreat  Thank you very much  Keith  you talked about just    I m sorry  Kevin  you ve talked about traveling the country and meeting with associates and management across the organization  I m just wondering  how long you think before you complete that initial review and maybe we get an update on the    what you see as the vision for Sysco and whether or not we would get another three year guide or how you kind of think about the strategy of providing guidance to the Street Kevin Hourican    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  That s a great question  Jeffrey and thank you for it  I think most new CEO is coming in  there s a 90 day  100 day plan and this listening tour will be a part of that  In addition by the way  it s doing very specific deep dives into the business while doing that  It s not just a listening tour  but the listening tour is a vital and important part of onboarding  I think what I would say at this point in time is late summer is when you could expect to hear from us from an update perspective on where we are with our strategies  And more on that later  Neil will help manage and communicate in that regard Jeffrey Bernstein    Barclays    AnalystGot it  And then  I know you mentioned in your    up to kind of three year plan guidance chart within the slide deck you talked about continued disciplined approach to profitable growth with your national and SYGMA accounts  and this has been something we ve been hearing for a little while now I m just wondering as it relates to that  where do we stand on that  I mean  is that a process that you think is just something that we should expect to hear about for just ongoing  and therefore it s just every quarter every year that s kind of that  Or maybe is there kind of a short term opportunity to pull that forward in order to no longer happen to be focused on pruning those national accounts Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  I mean I would think that    again  that s something I think you ll actually continue to hear us talk about  Actually we ve talked about that consistently for actually many years in terms of how we view that  Again  those customers and the opportunity are really disciplined in how we grow  I would say  the only thing I would maybe say is  I mean  what you re seeing in our SYGMA segment right now  which actually has a fairly acute decrease in the top line that was planned for and as part of this thing  again  that s probably a little stronger year over year than you may anticipate as we move forward  But I think  generally speaking  we will remain disciplined in this space It is an important area to us both strategically and in terms of covering fixed and providing opportunities for us to enter in service markets and outlying areas that may have that type of business that then allows us to have a great local business there as well  So  again  it s a strategically important part of the business  but nonetheless one that I think you ll continue to hear us talk about as one that we ll be disciplined in terms of how we approach Jeffrey Bernstein    Barclays    AnalystUnderstood  And then  lastly  just    I think  Joel  you mentioned something about bad debt expense  It sounds like you re making reference to an increasing of late  I m just wondering if you could talk about where you re seeing that pressure from  We didn t get much color in terms of from a restaurant industry perspective whether you re talking about national chains or independents or maybe one or both of their operating environments becoming more difficult leading to the elevated bad debt expense Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Here s how I d answer that  I mean  there s a little bit of both in terms of the market  I think  again  I    just one thing I would really emphasize here  We re    there s no panic button being pushed for us in terms of the market itself  There is a bit of softness  We ve had a few increased bankruptcies  And again  I would say  it s really both across the national and the local  I d say  the bigger impact though at this point certainly remains just continued challenges around the stabilization and implementation of some of the work that we did that really centralized credit activity in an area that used to be a very decentralized activity across our businesses And so  that s accelerated a bit over the last couple of quarters  We re certainly doing a lot of work to continue to stabilize that and certainly anticipate that happening  So  again  I d say  it s a little more self induced  But again  there s  I would say  a little softness certainly though not ready to push the panic button on the marketplace Jeffrey Bernstein    Barclays    AnalystGreat  thank you Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah OperatorOur next question comes from Josh Nolan with Piper Sandler Josh Nolan    Piper Sandler    AnalystGreat  Thank you for taking the question  Wanted to circle back to the commentary around outsourcing the support  That was very helpful  Curious if that was more of a proactive decision or if this is feeding off of commentary you ve received from your customers and your key members Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  I would say  it s probably a little bit of both in the sense that obviously feedback from customers in terms of how we have serviced them over many years is that  hey  I d rather have a single point of contact  I d rather have    instead of calling 50 people  I d rather call one  I d rather have a team that knows my business well that can relate to me  again  both from a care perspective  from a credit perspective  etc  etc   So I would say  it s in response to customer feedback and how we can do a better job servicing But again  in that sense then  I would call it proactive in the way that is something that we believe that was an important investment  one that we again found both the right what we believe structure  partner and technology support in order to do that  It s still new  We re still again moving into that  and it will continue to improve and evolve  but the team has done a great job of rolling that out  And so  again  I d call it proactive  but in response certainly to listen to our customers and feedback that we received from them over a number of years of doing business with us Josh Nolan    Piper Sandler    AnalystGreat  That s very helpful context  And then  thinking about the international strategy  particularly in Europe  sounds like that s still a long term growth opportunity for you  Can you talk about what you ve learned with the integration process  particularly with the French businesses that you mentioned and kind of how that process is coming along Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So  I think  a couple of areas that I would say thinking about how that business is integrating  It was two businesses that were acquired even prior to our acquisition of Brakes  They were similar sized businesses that we have then ultimately chosen to bring together  And I d say  the two bigger challenges really are  what we call  a single delivery  meaning instead of customers getting delivered by both businesses are being delivered by one  and the technology to support that  And so  I think  those    in both cases  there has been challenges in making that happen  On a positive note  doing some of that type of integration in France is often complex due to some of the labor and work councils and all that  And I think actually we ve got through that part of it very well  But nonetheless  those challenges remain  And then  some of the impact you ve seen have been service levels that have been less than we d like them to be  which then has translated into gross profit dollar impact there  And then  what I ll call dual running costs  meaning we ve had to have some of those things where both businesses running longer than we would have liked them to have done So  I think  again  we re certainly    we ve got a strong leadership team there  We ve got lots of resources that we ve dedicated both there and from here in order to enhance that  Some of the investments that we re talking about here as well fall into the category of how we accelerate the stabilization of that  But as you said  again  we certainly are confident that we ll get there  And certainly  as you pointed out believe that  again  this is a good long term investment for us and  again  in a market that we certainly think will be one of the strongest ones that we have in the future Josh Nolan    Piper Sandler    AnalystGreat  thank you Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks OperatorOur next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Kelly Bania    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystHi  Good morning  Thanks for taking the questions  I was wondering  maybe for Joel  the decision to kind of the less consensus two weeks ago and lower kind of the outlook today  Can you just help us understand that decision  You talked about some of the factors  I m just trying to really understand how much was the quarter and how much really is these investments and certain opportunities that you talked about  And I think what people are trying to struggle with understanding today is  how many more investments really need to be made out there over the next couple of years Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Let me start with the first  And what I would say is a couple of things  So  the timing of the announcement that was made on January 13th was obviously fairly early in both the processes of closing as well as the    how we got into the third quarter  So I think one of the things that I would say  as we ve evolved and certainly finished the closing process of this quarter as well as saw some of the results that we talked about as we moved into the third quarter  part of that was some of the reasons that you probably heard a little bit different tone from both of those things And so  I think  as we looked at some of the challenges that we talked about from a margin perspective that we continue to see fall into the third quarter  We took a look at some of the work that  again  was happening in this business in France as we talked about  And I m certainly looking forward to see some continued challenges there And in addition to that  again  it was just some of the work that we talked about with some of the investments again  these aren t brand new investments  They aren t things that we ve never talked about doing  But certainly the opportunity to accelerate that growth    to accelerate as we build some momentum at the end of this year and head into the next year  we thought were very important in terms of how we did that  And so  I would just say the combination  Kelly  of some of the kind of wrapping up of the quarter  seeing some of the way the third quarter was starting to play out in a number of different areas of the business  obviously some transition costs as well of the leadership change  and then thinking about how we actually spend that investment dollars moving forward  The question is how much are continue to need to invest in this business  Look  I think  this has been  as I know you know  a multi year journey of transformation because the reality of it is  is that this company  again even 10 years ago was a business that had    it was significantly decentralized in a way that we approach the marketplace If you think about the things that used to happen at a local operating level  where for the most part  I always joke about this a little bit  but pretty much only things they couldn t do or they couldn t give themselves a pay raise and then to report according to US GAAP  Other than that  it was for the most part their business to run And so  when you think about the things that we ve done in terms of how we standardize  how we leverage scale  how we    the category management processes and the way that we go to market and set an assortment in a different way that is not just decided by every individual operating company  those type of transformations    again the latest one again we ve talked about on this call things like finance technology roadmap  things like the centralized customer care  all those things are bits    are one step along the way to continue to drive a more leveraged efficient nimble organization that can go to market in a different way  And so  again  there s not necessarily sort of a beginning and an end point to that  I do believe this business will continue to invest in itself As we ve talked about our top capital allocation priority is and has been  the ability to take the cash we generate and reinvest it in this business to continue to get better  And as Kevin said  as you ve heard Ed talk about  our ability as the market leader to continue to leverage scale to drive the things that we can do and again go to market in a different way I think are important  And so  you will    you should expect us to continue to invest in our business that way Kelly Bania    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  And then  maybe just one follow up on the gross margin and the inflation impact  How much of that  just given that it does look relatively manageable on an overall basis  but obviously there s more happening  I think  in meat and dairy  but how much of that is just pure mechanics of the type of inflation and the environment you re seeing versus the execution of that either at the local or the chain side Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  it s a little bit of both  I mean  on the chain side again  it s actually a fairly mechanical process in the sense that as we ve talked about before  there s    depending on the category  there s about a seven to 30 degree    30 day lag in terms of when prices recalculate  So that one is a little more  I d call  mathematical and environment driven  Obviously there s some market driven and there s some execution as well on the local side Although as we ve talked about  historically one of the areas that s actually really allowed us to do a better job of that certainly over the last few years is our revenue management function  That s been an area that we ve leveraged well both in deflationary times and inflationary times  And I certainly anticipate work that we have done and will continue to do in the rev man area will help us work through that  But we ve also talked about the fact that in certain cases where inflation    and in certain categories  when inflation hits higher levels and escalates in a more rapid way that we still have some challenge in passing some of that along  So  I think that s how I would frame it up  It s probably a little bit of all of that  but certainly something that I believe moving forward we ll get a handle on  Again  our rev man function has certainly done a good job of helping us work through that over the number of years  and I anticipate that continuing to move forward Kelly Bania    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystThank you Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Kelly OperatorOur next question comes from Bob Summers with Buckingham Bob Summers    Buckingham    AnalystGood morning  guys  So  just help me understand of the operating income revision  which I think is really just what two more quarters  how much of that is being driven by this investment pull forward  And what I d really like to understand is  what s the run rate of that investment  How should I think about it as we bleed into 2000    or 2021  And then  on the benefit side of the equation how are you thinking about the return on this  either through cost savings or bolting on acceleration and case volume growth  And when is that or when should we expect that Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So  just starting with your first point on sort of the takedown  Again  we haven t broken out the specifics of those things  but just to reiterate again a couple of the key points  Again  it is    there s a portion of it that s related to some of the challenges we ve talked about both  again  as we kind of exit this quarter and enter the next one as it relates to some of the margin challenges Again  it s related to some of the challenges that we ve talked about in France  Again  there are some discrete costs in corporate that  I d call  are unplanned things like the strike we had in Denver  things like that we ve seen a bit of higher level  I ll call  claims activity in terms of things like auto liability and workers  comp  Some of those type of things that were part of    where you saw our corporate expenses elevate a bit obviously as well as some of the transition costs we talked about related to leadership  So those are things that are  again  some of the components to that as well as an investment Bob  I don t know that we re going to go and break down the detail of every one of those components  I would say  certainly probably    and the biggest ones really fall into the category of some of the point on the margins  the areas in France as well as the investments broadly speaking And I guess  from a run rate perspective  as I said  I don t know if we re going to go into that type of breakdown detail  What you could    what you should expect though as we head into our Investor Day and as we talk about  as Kevin onboards as we talk about our ongoing strategic opportunities  we certainly plan to go into more detail of that both in terms of how it impacts our growth  how it impacts the expenses and the ability to fund that growth through some of the efficiencies  So  certainly more to come on that  But I would say  again  those are the main categories of how to think about why the takedown happen Bob Summers    Buckingham    AnalystOkay  Thank you Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks OperatorOur next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan John Ivankoe    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  Thank you  I think the comment was made that we shouldn t expect an increase in capex  so I just want to make sure that I heard that correctly  I guess  especially in the context of what may be in coming years kind of a broad need to modernize facilities really not just for you but across the industry  and also potentially the use of new facilities into smaller facilities to better penetrate some of the urban markets  So that s kind of the first point And secondly  is part of the plan or part of the thought at this point that you would enter new European countries or is kind of you re getting the current countries to your acceptable returns the priority in the near term  Thanks Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So let me take that one first and then I ll go back to your other one  I think the answer on that is that certainly stabilization is the highest priority right now in terms of that  And then  again  just    maybe just to reiterate one thing  and then we talk about Europe is just one entity  Within that  again  three out of the four main countries we re in Europe are actually performing  what I d call  acceptably well  And obviously the biggest challenge is in France  But from a priority standpoint there  definitely stabilization is our focus at this point in time  Certainly over the long term  we ll continue to look for opportunities to grow in that part of the world The capex piece  so look a couple of things I would say on that  As we have    as we ve talked about actually over the last couple of years  we actually have accelerated  even heading into this year our capex level a bit  In other words  we ve been running in that 1 1  ish range  somewhere in the 1 1   1 2   As we talked about this year  we actually bumped that up a bit to 1 3  of sales for some of the investments we plan to make  And as we talked about a little bit earlier in the prepared remarks  we re actually running at that rate And so  I would say  on one hand  there is a bit of acceleration from the perspective of that  but that was talked about and it s where we re going  And so  I think Kevin s point was  we re not certainly saying what we re doing now at this moment in time  There are going to be  I think  some increased potential investments  But as we also look at how we rationalize those things at the moment as a percentage of sales  I think you can think about fairly consistently how we ve talked about as we re headed into this year we ve talked about a bit of acceleration John Ivankoe    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  So more or less model 1 3 would be safe Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think that s fair John Ivankoe    JPMorgan    AnalystThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Rebecca Scheuneman with Morningstar John Ivankoe    JPMorgan    AnalystGood morning  So I d like to circle back to protein inflation  Given the global protein shortage that has resulted from African swine fever  it s likely to think that this protein inflation will continue for at least the next year  Are you beginning to like proactively work with your customers on some price increases or are you just kind of playing it by ear  They have been admittedly volatile  the prices  I m just wondering what we should expect if we ll    if there are possibly some further gross margin compression due to difficulties passing on this expected inflation  Thank you Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Thanks for the question  So  I would  first of all  decouple a couple of these things a bit  The impact that we ve seen from the African swine flu has actually been very minimal  I would say  And this is something we ve taken questions on for some time  And again  that s not something I would say has been a sizable or even  again  just barely above minimal impact in terms of us  I think the markets for Center of the Plate and beef do move around some  And I d say  again  we experienced a little bit more of acute inflation here in that category  I don t know that I d look right now though out a longer term and say  yeah  there s some fundamental reason that there s going to be a highly inflationary Center of the Plate markets for any time to come of any real significance Here s what I would say though  just as a reminder  in terms of how we deal with some of those things and why    back to maybe your customer point  why this has been something actually we have historically been a strong partner for our customers  And obviously we have scale benefits that have allowed us to    in any of these types of moments have access to products  have a traceability that obviously is deep and well appreciated by our customers  the availability of substitutes And so I think  the alternative products    and so  I think  if you think back a few years ago even when we had the issues with avian flu  one of the things that we were able to bring to our customers is simply the availability of product  And again  a traceability program that actually ensure that those are safe and in a way that they would expect  So I think I    I guess  what I would say to summarize that all  again  decouple a little bit the African swine flu elements that has not been something that we ve done    we ve had a significant issue with  Some Center of the Plate challenges right now although again not necessarily looking at what I d call acute inflation in that area over the longer term  But in the event of any of those things  I think the company is well positioned to manage through that stuff in a better way Rebecca Scheuneman    Morningstar    AnalystOkay  Joel  Thanks for the color  I will pass it on Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorThe next question comes from Marisa Sullivan with BofA Securities Marisa Sullivan    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  good morning  and thanks for taking my questions  Just wanted to circle back  Joel  I think you ve referenced some challenges with the implementation of your finance transformation road map Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes Marisa Sullivan    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystJust wondering  if you can give a little bit more color on that  And then  in the timeframe for working through those  and then as it relates to working capital and free cash flow  can you just comment on when or how quickly you might start to see improvements there  Thank you Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Sure  So a couple of things  So think about the finance technology road map as    in our history  we would have had all of the finance related functions  things like credit  things like cash app  accounts payable  general ledger  each of those types of areas that would actually have been in each individual operating units that over the last couple of years enabled by technology  we ve moved many of those functions into a centralized place and  in some cases    in some cases with an offshore partner as well And I think  what you re hearing us talk about here are challenges related specifically to local credit  where in the past each one of our operating units would have had a credit department responsible for credit and collections in each of their local markets  And in today s world  it s certainly again through the uses of technology and a bit of different structure  We re just working through some of the bumps in terms of managing how to do that in a way that s more somewhat market  but also is much more centralized  And so  again  an interesting example on working capital of a process Accounts payable had some bumps along the way as well  and we had a little bit of a positive benefit  if you will  on working capital on that in our previous year  That process has actually stabilized and again in a strange way had a little bit of a negative impact on working capital in a sense that we paid our suppliers in a more efficient manner  So  I would say that  in general  we certainly feel confident about our ability to stabilize that  We re certainly making the appropriate investments and leveraging the technology in order to do so  but there are some short term bumps that we re having along the way  I actually certainly in some of my prepared comments talked about the fact that we anticipate some of this continuing to improve over the course of the year  And I certainly expect that to be the case The other point I would make  and just as a reminder  as part of the free cash flow is related to capex on a year to date basis  If you remember  at the end of our fiscal 2018 based on some opportunities presented by US tax reform  we actually accelerated the process of investing in some fleets  That actually then allowed us to invest at a lesser rate at the beginning of our fiscal 2019  So  where we ve gotten back to  what I ll call  a normalized    more normalized capital spend as it relates to fleet  the year over year comparison certainly for the first half of the year and again this will level out a little bit as the year goes by  looks worse  particularly due to that factor  So  again  all that to say  I do think we ll see some improvement in this area in the second half and certainly over the long term  I feel good about where we re at Marisa Sullivan    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAnd then  just very quickly  I m wondering if you can give any comments about the current trends you re seeing with independent restaurants  You saw a nice acceleration in your local case growth this quarter  and I m just wondering if you expect this to continue in the third quarter or if you can comment on quarter to date trends  Thanks Joel T  Grade    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think  look  a couple of things  I mean  I think the team did a great job    we talked about actually a favorable exit rate from the first quarter  That continued to accelerate over the course of this quarter  particularly in our local business  and I would say particularly in the area of account penetration  So  what this was not was just kind of going out and just    people often ask where did the growth come from  And it wasn t so much in the area of new customers  but is an area that actually as we ve talked about is best for us in that further account penetration The market itself  I would say  is kind of where it has been  I think it s in a decent place  There s sort of lots of reports that move around from time to time  And the check size has generally seemed to be continuing to elevate  Traffic seems to be flattish  You say it s up a little  you say it s down a little  But I would generally say the market is in an OK place  probably similar to what it has been  But I think  again  certainly a lot of good work by our teams in the US to drive a strong level of growth  again certainly in the independent space  and we anticipate some of those trends continuing as well Marisa Sullivan    Bank

In a tweet  Trump said the U S  will impose  starting June 10  a 5  tariff on all imported goods from Mexico that would  gradually increase until the illegal immigration problem is remedied  
Analysts said the reaction in the global markets suggest that investors fear the threat from Trump will hurt stocks and global growth 
 Evidently  the market is implying additional second order effects   Citi said  such as further tariffs  a depreciation in asset quality and slowing growth 
Corners of the market sensitive to proposed levies on Mexico  such as automakers  transports and apparel companies  fell sharply amid concerns that margins could take a hit from increases in input costs 
 Margins are so thin in the U S  market right now that there s no way that any automaker is not going to pass on these tariffs to their customers   said analyst Janet Lewis at Macquarie Securities

135600,357115,SYY,SYY Vs  LW  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Food   Miscellaneous sector might want to consider either Sysco  SYY  or Lamb Weston  LW   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Right now  both Sysco and Lamb Weston are sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
SYY currently has a forward P E ratio of 21 47  while LW has a forward P E of 26 19  We also note that SYY has a PEG ratio of 2 18  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  LW currently has a PEG ratio of 2 97 
Another notable valuation metric for SYY is its P B ratio of 17 02  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  LW has a P B of 66 87

135637,357152,SYY,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Sysco  SYY  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Sysco in Focus
Headquartered in Houston  Sysco  SYY  is a Consumer Staples stock that has seen a price change of  1 03  so far this year  The food distributor is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 39 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 13   This compares to the Food   Miscellaneous industry s yield of 0 22  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 78  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 80 is up 20  from last year  Sysco has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6 41   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Sysco s payout ratio is 43   which means it paid out 43  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for SYY for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 is  3 82 per share  with earnings expected to increase 7 61  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  SYY is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2020-01-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-sysco-syy-could-be-a-great-choice-200496346,200496346

135666,357181,SYY,USFD Vs  SYY  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Food   Miscellaneous sector have probably already heard of US Foods Holding Corp   USFD  and Sysco  SYY   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
US Foods Holding Corp  has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Sysco has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This means that USFD s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
USFD currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 33  while SYY has a forward P E of 20 68  We also note that USFD has a PEG ratio of 1 86  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  SYY currently has a PEG ratio of 2 17 
Another notable valuation metric for USFD is its P B ratio of 2 52  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  SYY has a P B of 16 19 
These metrics  and several others  help USFD earn a Value grade of A  while SYY has been given a Value grade of C 
USFD sticks out from SYY in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that USFD is the better option right now ",2019-10-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/usfd-vs-syy-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200477488,200477488
135667,357182,SYY,Sysco  SYY  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Sysco  SYY  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This food distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 97 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 6  
Revenues are expected to be  15 54 billion  up 2 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sysco 
For Sysco  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sysco will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Sysco would post earnings of  1 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 10  delivering a surprise of  2 80  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Sysco doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sysco-syy-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200479143,200479143
135668,357183,SYY,Duplicating Chart Names S P 500  The Long And Short Of It,opinion,"The S P 500 closed to new highs following yesterday s Fed meeting  supported by higher earnings whilst also taking comfort from Powell s comments that a hike is unlikely  Technically  it rests on the pivotal level of 3028  yet resistance nearby awaits  A break above the Jan 2018 resistance level assumes bullish trend continuation  whereas a break back beneath 3028 warns of a bull trap and deeper correction 









Flicking through equities for the S P500 showed greater potential for short setups than longs  Perhaps that s a bad omen for new highs on S P500  although part of the reason many longs were rejected were because they were either too close to earnings or overextended without any signs of a pullback  

  Sysco Corp    NYSE SYY  CFD DFT  Trading just off its all time highs  prices have had a chance to consolidate below 80  which has provided adequate mean reversion for a potential long setup  The recent higher low has respected the 20 day average and it appears that prices could just as easily break higher as it could produce another higher low to form a potential ascending triangle 

Keep in mind that earnings are on the 4th November  where a notable earnings miss could topple this from its highs  Hopefully  though  they ll be supportive of this compelling setup 





O Reilly Automotive Inc CFD DFT  Positive earnings saw this explode higher out of an ascending triangle and found resistance around the monthly R3 pivot  not pictured for a cleaner chart   A hammer at the highs showed prices were exhausted and now a retracement is underway  This may be a little premature for the watchlist  but it s worth keeping an eye on none the less given the strength of the breakout 
With little in the way of support above 410 415  traders can see if prices stabilize around a Fibonacci level  If satisfied a higher low has formed  volatility such as ATR can be used to calculate the  invalidation point  of the bullish bias  Bullish swing traders could then look to enter  or for a more conservative approach  wait for signs bullish momentum has returned to provide greater confidence the low is in    





eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  CFD DFT  Long known for its discounts  Ebay s stock price also found itself on sale following poor earnings last week  Thursday s large gap lower saw it plummet through the 200 day eMA and now prices are clinging onto key support around  35  The fact it has failed to provide any meaningful rally despite the S P500 hitting new highs is telling  as is the declining volume during this week s lacklustre  rebound  
Bias is for a break to new lows and for prices to target the upside gap around 32 33 Bears can either wait for a break below 35 00 35 19 or fade into rallies below 37 23 If the trend takes off then bears could look to  close  the gap around 31 and take it south A break above 37 23 places it onto the back burner  although it still leaves the potential for a large rounding top pattern to develop over the coming weeks if it remains below 39 35




Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  CFD DFT  The gap lower last week took prices straight down to the bullish trendline and 200 day eMA  So  we re at another juncture where bulls either save the day and keep prices above these levels  or the dead cat has bounced and we re waiting for a break lower 
Given the magnitude of the gap from its highs  a breakaway gap  and that the pullback from the trendline has found resistance below the 100 day average  the bias is for a break lower 
The bias remains bearish below 122 10Bears can wait for a break below the 200 eMA and bullish trendline  A more cautious approach is to wait for a break beneath 115 87 A break above 122 10 also breaks the 100 day eMA  Bulls could look to close the gap towards 128 23  although 126 63 could provide interim resistance ",2019-10-31,Matt Simpson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/duplicating-chart-names-sp-500-the-long-and-short-of-it-200480562,200480562

135672,357187,SYY,Sysco  SYY  Q1 Earnings Top Estimates,opinion,"Sysco  SYY  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 98 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 97 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 91 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 03   A quarter ago  it was expected that this food distributor would post earnings of  1 07 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 10  delivering a surprise of 2 80  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Sysco  which belongs to the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry  posted revenues of  15 30 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 50   This compares to year ago revenues of  15 22 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Sysco shares have added about 27 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 2  
What s Next for Sysco 
While Sysco has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Sysco was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 84 on  15 22 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 81 on  61 99 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

135699,357214,SYY,Sysco  Time To Buy This Defensive Stock ,opinion,"Now that global economic growth is decelerating  many investors are flocking to defensive  recession resistant equities  This tends to happen during late stages of an economic cycle  as well as during mid cycle slowdowns between periods of growth 




For example  the consumer staples sector has outperformed the broader S P 500 by over 9  over the past 12 months 
And the utilities sector has outperformed by more than 12  




The problem  however  is that these sectors are becoming very expensive  For example  the SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF  MX XLU  has a P E ratio of 23 58 with expected forward growth of just 5 34   resulting in a P E G ratio of 4 4 and a dividend adjusted P E G ratio of over 2 8 
For those that are not familiar  the P E G ratio is the price to earnings  P E  ratio of a stock or group of stocks divided by the earnings growth rate  G   and was popularized by famous investor Peter Lynch  The lower the number  the more growth you are getting relative to the valuation  which is good  Lynch  whose Magellan Fund massively outperformed during his tenure as portfolio manager  looked for companies with a P E G ratio below 1  although these days  even finding a stock below 2 is attractive  The dividend adjusted version of the calculation adds the dividend yield to the growth rate  which makes the ratio fairer to moderate growth higher yielding stocks 
Perhaps more concerning is that major stocks in both the consumer staples and utility sectors have broken far above their normal valuation ranges  Investors are fleeing from more cyclical businesses like industrials and small cap stocks  and crowding into these defensive names  Many investors aren t interested in holding bonds either  because yields on most safe bonds these days are below the inflation rate 
For example   Church   Dwight  Company  NYSE CHD   the maker of the Arm   Hammer brand and other leading recession resistant household products  is trading far above its historical average P E ratio represented by the blue line 




Sysco Corporation  NYSE SYY   Defensive but Reasonably Priced
Sysco Corporation  NYSE SYY  is a defensive company that distributes food to restaurants  hotels  hospitals  and other facilities  They re the largest food distributor in the world and have built up a considerable set of infrastructure which gives them a cost advantage over competitors 
The company has raised its annual dividend for 49 consecutive years  including through at least six recessions  Their earnings growth rate has been 7 2  per year over the past decade  and consensus analyst expectations are for 7 5  growth over the next three years 
If there s one notable flaw for this stock  it s that the balance sheet is mediocre  The company has a net debt income ratio of just under 5  which is near the high end of my allowed range  However  its free cash flows often exceed net income  and are very stable  which justifies the leverage and keeps it relatively safe  Basically  the stock doesn t have a bad balance sheet  but it doesn t have a fortress balance sheet that many investors in this space would prefer  Investors would do well to keep an eye on this figure to make sure it doesn t creep up much higher 
The company consistently earnings returns on invested capital  ROIC  in the double digits  which is above its weighted average cost of capital  WACC  and is evidence of a substantial economic moat  In addition  Sysco  NYSE SYY  management actively targets high ROIC  which research has shown tends to be one of the most strongly correlated metrics with stock performance 




Sysco  NYSE SYY  is not quite as expensive as many of its defensive peers  For starters  it trades in line with its historical average P E ratio 




With a P E ratio of 23 65 and earnings growth of 7 5   Sysco  NYSE SYY  has a P E G ratio of 3 15 and a dividend adjusted P E G ratio of less than 2 5  While this may not be a deep bargain  the risk adjusted returns for the stock are decent compared to safe bonds  other defensive stocks  and perhaps the broad U S  stock market in general 
Overall  Sysco  NYSE SYY  is a reasonable stock for safe and growing dividends as part of a diversified portfolio and is likely a good candidate to buy on dips ",2019-09-08,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sysco-time-to-buy-this-defensive-stock-200462654,200462654

135719,357234,SYY,Sysco  SYY  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Sysco  SYY  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 12  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This food distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 07 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 8  
Revenues are expected to be  15 56 billion  up 1 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sysco 
For Sysco  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sysco will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Sysco would post earnings of  0 70 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 79  delivering a surprise of  12 86  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Sysco doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-08-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sysco-syy-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200450816,200450816

135740,357255,SYY,Sysco  SYY  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Sysco  SYY   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Sysco currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for SYY that show why this food distributor shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For SYY  shares are up 2 05  over the past week while the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 8 25  compares favorably with the industry s 0 18  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Sysco have increased 9 69  over the past quarter  and have gained 14 93  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 6 81  and 9 91   respectively 
Investors should also take note of SYY s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  SYY is averaging 2 315 548 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with SYY 
Over the past two months  6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost SYY s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 40 to  3 50 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that SYY is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Sysco on your short list ",2019-05-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sysco-syy-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200419657,200419657

135770,357285,SYY,Why Sysco  SYY  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Sysco in Focus
Based in Houston  Sysco  SYY  is in the Consumer Staples sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 6 08   Currently paying a dividend of  0 39 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 35   In comparison  the Food   Miscellaneous industry s yield is 0 21   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 93  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 56 is up 13  from last year  In the past five year period  Sysco has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 5 70   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Sysco s current payout ratio is 44   This means it paid out 44  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
SYY is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  3 40 per share  with earnings expected to increase 8 28  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that SYY is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-04-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-sysco-syy-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200404001,200404001

135776,357291,SYY,Sysco may face about  1 billion in costs if US Foods merger dies,news,By Diane Bartz and Greg Roumeliotis WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters     Sysco Corp   N SYY  will be left with a bill of around  1 billion if the U S  government kills its  3 5 billion merger with US Foods  regulatory filings show  underscoring the perils of doing deals that have a good chance of being blocked by antitrust regulators      Sysco  the biggest U S  food distributor  has spent more than  400 million so far on a combination of integration planning  financing charges and on defending the transaction in court  based on a Reuters analysis of its filings  To put that into context  Sysco s net profit for its fiscal year ended June 28  2014 was  932 million      If the Federal Trade Commission  which filed a lawsuit to block the merger in February  eventually has its way  Sysco will have to pay US Foods  its No  2 rival   300 million as a termination fee  Separately  up to  25 million would go to Performance Food Group  which has agreed to buy assets to be divested as part of the Sysco US Foods deal      Furthermore  if the deal does not close by Oct  8 or is terminated by then  Sysco would likely incur another  265 million in losses  which includes the cost of redeeming  5 billion in bonds set to be used for the acquisition  as well as associated financing costs that have not been booked yet on its balance sheet  filings show      Even a successful deal would come at a hefty price  as prolonged delays led to higher financing charges and legal advisory fees to fight the government in court  The company had forecast it would close the transaction in the third quarter of 2014 when it announced the deal in December 2013      Arguments between the FTC and Sysco on whether the deal is legal will conclude with closing arguments on May 28  It is not known when the judge will rule           MORE AGGRESSIVE STANCE     The potential  1 billion in costs if the merger fails to be completed underscores the dangers that companies face when they decide to go forward with an aggressive deal at a time when the U S  government is taking a more active stance in stopping deals that reduce competition significantly in an industry      Comcast s  O CMCSA   45 billion bid for Time Warner Cable  N TWC   which would have married the two largest U S  cable operators  collapsed in April due to regulatory opposition   Comcast spent  336 million on the abortive bid  filings show  but it did not have to pay a break up fee       Mergers can be expensive  They re an investment in a business  future success and can help transform an industry   said Sysco spokesman Charley Wilson  He declined to comment on the deal s prospects      Sysco and US Foods  which is controlled by private equity firms KKR   Co LP  N KKR  and Clayton  Dubilier   Rice LLC  have defended the merger by saying that the market for food distribution is extremely competitive  and that the merger would allow it to capture  600 million in synergies annually three to four years after the deal closes      The FTC says that merging the two biggest U S  food distributors would give Sysco 75 percent of the market for customers like hotel chains which want nationwide contracts for a broad range of goods  from onions to napkins to cleaning supplies  That dominance of the market would allow Sysco to raise prices  the FTC argues      The perception that regulators have become tougher could also make sellers more reluctant to accept takeover offers from big rivals  forcing buyers to either offer a substantial premium or big regulatory break up fee to convince unwilling targets  dealmakers said       The FTC declined comment for this story      But the top antitrust official at the Justice Department  which shares jurisdiction with the FTC and also reviews mergers to ensure they comply with antitrust law  recently expressed frustration with aggressive deals       There are some ideas that should never get out of corporate headquarters   Bill Baer said in April at a meeting of the American Bar Association antitrust section       It wastes the time of my people  Basically at the end of the day it s an embarrassment for companies to get out there and invest in something  get its shareholders all excited and then have to pull out at the last minute   he said      Sysco has spent roughly  100 million so far to finance its planned takeover  filings show  Most of the costs were incurred after October  when the company replaced a bridge loan facility with long term financing for the merger  issuing  5 billion in bonds  Sysco paid roughly  80 million in interest on the debt in the last two quarters       It spent another  258 million on integration planning and to hire advisers to defend the deal  the filings show  Sysco also spent a further  53 million to allow the two companies  computer systems to communicate with each other  officials said      Legal expenses for an antitrust review can easily top  1 million dollars a month if a deal goes to litigation  and could exceed  10 million for the duration of a trial  according to a senior litigator who asked not to be named      It is unclear whether the prolonged struggle over the deal has led to some less discernible costs for Sysco  Often the management of a company can get distracted by such events or miss out on other possible acquisitions ,2015-05-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sysco-may-face-about-$1-billion-in-costs-if-us-foods-merger-dies-342074,342074
135777,357292,SYY,States line up to scrutinize Aetna s  33 billion Humana deal,news,By Caroline Humer  Karen Freifeld and Diane Bartz NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  insurance regulators and state attorneys general are lining up to scrutinize Aetna  NYSE AET  Inc s proposed  33 billion takeover of rival  Humana Inc   NYSE HUM  for potential harm to consumers  complicating what is already expected to be a tough and lengthy review by federal antitrust authorities  Insurance commissioners in 18 states including Texas  Kentucky and Florida will study merger documents provided by Humana to determine whether the deal will harm competition and lead to higher insurance premiums or diminished access to healthcare providers  according to Reuters interviews with regulators and insurance experts   At least three state attorneys general   in Florida  Mississippi and Massachusetts   said they will look at the proposed acquisition  Local politicians and medical industry groups such as the American Medical Association have also voiced concerns about the biggest deal ever in the U S  health insurance industry  The Department of Justice is taking the lead on the transaction and may ask for asset sales or challenge a deal in court  But the concerns of state insurance commissioners are likely to have added weight since health insurance is heavily regulated at the local level  antitrust experts said  State regulators are also expected to provide the DOJ with their own data on how the deal will affect insurance markets   The antitrust division makes the final decision on the competitive analysis but will take into account the information provided by the states   said Andre Barlow  an antitrust lawyer at Doyle  Barlow and Mazard PLLC  who s not involved in the inquiry  The proposed acquisition comes after years of health insurance change driven by the politically divisive Affordable Care Act  often called Obamacare  Republicans say the new law has driven insurance costs higher and hurt consumers  while Democrats say it is insuring more people  Aetna and Humana have said that because the health insurance market is now more focused on consumers  being bigger will let them offer more competitive products  When the nation s largest insurer  UnitedHealth Group  N UNH   bought Nevada s Sierra Health Services in 2008  the Nevada Attorney General and the DOJ both filed antitrust complaints and signed off on a settlement requiring UnitedHealth to divest administration and sales of Medicare Advantage plans for seniors and the disabled in two counties   In 2004  California s state regulator first rejected the acquisition of WellPoint Health Networks by Anthem  The companies challenged the move in court and eventually agreed to concessions  including putting  265 million towards California health projects that would benefit consumers  The Humana purchase would create a company with more than 33 million customers in two thirds of the United States  In individual states  their footprint is much bigger   In a combined Medicare Advantage business  Aetna and Humana would have an 88 percent market share in Kansas  80 percent in West Virginia  58 percent in Iowa and 51 percent in Missouri  according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation  In commercial insured plans  the new company would have more than a third of individual customers in Florida  Illinois and Kansas and 68 percent of Georgia  according to SG Cowen and SNL Financial   Healthcare investors already have concerns over the Humana deal passing muster at the federal level  particularly after antitrust objections scuttled several other major transactions this year  including Sysco  NYSE SYY  Corp s proposed purchase of US Foods and Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  Corp s planned acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc  NYSE TWC   They are also weighing the risk of another major health insurance merger being forged  possibly between Anthem Inc  N ANTM  and  Cigna Corp   N CI   In that case  antitrust authorities would have to account for the market effect of both deals when raising any objections  The value of Aetna s cash and stock offer has dropped 10 percent since it was announced on July 3  as its share price fell over antitrust risk and other concerns  Aetna and Humana have said they view the regulatory process as  manageable   targeting a deal closing in the second half of 2016 to account for a lengthy review  Aetna and Humana both declined to comment on antitrust issues for this story       STATE BY STATE California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones plans to talk to antitrust authorities and other states through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners about the Humana deal s impact on California  where he sees even their combined 5 percent share as an issue    I will be raising whatever concerns I have on behalf of California consumers   Jones said in an interview   I am generally concerned that historically health insurance company mergers have resulted in higher  not lower  premiums for consumers       For example  insurance premiums rose 13 7 percent in Nevada in the year after UnitedHealth Group s acquisition of Sierra Health Services compared to health plans in a similar market that was not affected  according to a 2013 study published in the journal Health Management  Policy and Innovation  In Kentucky  where Humana is based  Insurance Commissioner Sharon Clark said her department would work with federal regulators as they evaluate the transaction as well as conduct its own review  which could take six months to a year to complete  Georgia state commissioner Charles Hudgens said in a statement he will perform an in depth analysis of the proposed transaction s effect on competition in the state  Texas  Illinois and Florida said they are also awaiting filings from Humana  State attorneys general may also look at the deal  but often don t disclose if they have opened an investigation   In Connecticut  where Aetna is based  a spokesman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen declined to comment on whether the office plans to probe the deal   In Connecticut  the AG has the independent authority to look into mergers and to challenge them if it will lessen competition under the state s antitrust laws   Robert Blanchard said   In Kentucky  where Humana is based  a spokesman for Attorney General Jack Conway said his office will look at the terms of the potential merger when they are released and determine if any action is necessary  In Florida  where Humana has 1 63 million customers  a spokeswoman for Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said the state would look into the proposed merger for its effect on competition

While the Houston based company saw its quarterly profit fall by more than 70  for the three month period that ended in June  the majority of the losses were attributed to the collapse of its acquisition attempt of rival U S  Foods earlier in the month  The merger attempt fell apart when a federal judge sided decisively with the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  after two weeks of contentious hearings in an antitrust lawsuit  In late June  U S  district judge Amit Metha blocked the merger  citing antitrust regulations related to industry concentration that could harm competition  Sysco suffered a  313 million loss in expense related to the termination of the merger  along with another  117 million charge in legal  interest and other related expenses 
Nevertheless  Sysco s adjusted operating income  excluding the expenses related to the failed acquisition  increased 5 8  on the quarter to  509 million on a year over year basis  On the fiscal year as a whole  Sysco s revenues increased 4 7  to  48 7 billion while its gross profit increased 4 5  to  8 6 billion  In addition  the company s adjusted earnings per share rose 5 1  to 1 84  while its free cash flow stood at  1 0 billion

 NEW YORK  May 9  Reuters    U S  stocks were little changed
on Monday as concerns over European debt offset gains in
natural resource shares  lifted by a bounce back in
commodities 
 Standard   Poor s once more downgraded Greece s debt
rating  saying there is increased risk Athens will restructure
its private debt  For details  see  ID nLDE7481EG 
 The rating cut weakened the euro against the U S  dollar 
shaving gains off commodities and reducing some risk appetite
that earlier had lifted futures 
  Europe s problems have gotten worse   said Shawn Hackett 
president at Hackett Advisors in Boynton Beach  Florida 
  Demand in commodities was already being destroyed by the
high prices  and the dollar is making commods now more
expensive  
 The energy and materials sectors were the best performers
on the S P 500 as the Reuters Jefferies commodities index
 jumped more than 1 percent 
 The iShares Silver Trust exchange traded fund  rose
4 1 percent to  35 90 
 But Hackett  who specializes in commodities  said if the
large declines last week were perceived as exaggerated 
Monday s bounce back would have had to be stronger 
  We re in a bear market in commodities   Hackett said   The
stock market is really in trouble  
 Commodities  stocks and the euro have traded in a similar
pattern in recent months as low interest rates in the United
States boosted risk appetite 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  gained 24 10
points  or 0 19 percent  to 12 662 84  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  rose 2 63 points  or 0 20 percent  to
1 342 83  The Nasdaq Composite Index  added 5 48 points 
or 0 19 percent  to 2 833 04 
 On the S P 500  1 340 and 1 333 are key levels that should
provide strong support and entice buyers according to Ryan
Detrick  senior technical strategist at Schaeffer s Investment
Research 
 Despite last week s losses  the S P 500 held above
important technical levels  with the week s low just below
1 330 and Friday s close above 1 340 
 Among companies reporting earnings Monday  SYSCO Corp
 gained 10 2 percent to  31 41  About 70 percent of S P
500 companies that have reported results have beaten
expectations 
 Relatively low volume so far this year could see a further
decline as Citigroup Inc s  1 for 10 reverse stock split
comes into effect Monday  Citi shares have recently accounted
for about 6 percent of composite volume   ID nN06213103  
 Citi shares traded at  44 93 after closing at  4 52 on

135806,357321,SYY,Exclusive  Minnesota AG questions divestiture in Sysco US Foods merger,news,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Minnesota s attorney general expressed concern about the merger of food distribution giants Sysco Corp and US Foods  USFOO UL   saying it was questionable whether any divestiture could restore competition lost in the transaction 
Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson said in a Dec  10 letter that her office had heard complaints from Minnesota based restaurants that the  3 5 billion acquisition would leave them  fewer choices among distributors and potentially resulting in higher prices for consumers  
The letter was addressed to Federal Trade Commission Chairwomen Edith Ramirez  The FTC is looking into the deal to ensure it complies with antitrust law 
Sysco announced in December 2013 that it would buy US Foods from its private equity owners in a deal that would combine the two largest U S  food distributors 
Minnesota is not a part of a group of about 25 U S  states  including Florida and Indiana  which are also reviewing the deal because the companies are the only two national food distribution companies  Both companies distribute foods to restaurants  hotels  hospitals  schools and other institutions 
Sysco  with annual revenue of about  44 billion  is the largest operator in the U S  food distribution business  US Foods holds the No  2 spot 
Swanson noted that clout in her letter  saying that schools  universities and hospitals frequently take bids from both companies 
Sysco is negotiating with a smaller  regional company  Performance Food Group  in hopes that it can sell Performance sufficient assets  including distribution centers  that the FTC would be reassured that competition would not be lost 
Performance is owned by Blackstone Group 
Most of the distribution centers are in the western United States  where PFG is weak  and one is in California  according to two sources knowledgeable about the talks 
But Swanson expressed skepticism that asset sales would be enough   It is questionable whether any amount of divestiture can recreate the loss of US Foods as a strong competitor in the broadline food distribution market   she wrote in the letter 
The Minnesota attorney general stopped short of asking the FTC to block the deal  saying   I encourage the Commission to closely scrutinize the proposed merger

A group of about 25 state attorneys general  including those in Florida and Indiana  are also reviewing the deal  Minnesota s attorney general wrote a letter to the FTC in December saying it was questionable whether any divestiture could restore competition lost in the transaction ",2015-01-30,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-sysco,-us-foods-offer-to-divest-11-facilities-to-win-ftc-deal-approval-325918",325918

135822,357337,SYY,General Mills  GIS  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of General Mills  NYSE GIS   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 2 9  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  49 5 in the previous session  General Mills has gained 24  since the start of the year compared to the 10 8  move for the Zacks Consumer Staples sector and the 4 5  return for the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on March 20  2019  General Mills reported EPS of  0 83 versus consensus estimate of  0 69 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 51  
Valuation Metrics
General Mills may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
General Mills has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 15 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 11 8X versus its peer group s average of 11 9X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 16  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  General Mills currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if General Mills meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though General Mills shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does General Mills Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of General Mills have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including Sysco  SYY   MGP Ingredients  MGPI   and MEDIFAST INC  MED   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 40  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for General Mills  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-03-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/general-mills-gis-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200399765,200399765
135823,357338,SYY,The Secret Value Stock Screen To Use Now,opinion," 0 45    Are You Willing To Pay To Much For Growth Stocks  3 25    Stock Screener Criteria For Top Value Stocks 8 50    Tracey s Top Stock Picks 15 45    Episode Roundup  ALL  BBY  WMT  SYY  CNC Welcome to Episode  134 of the Value Investor Podcast
Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks   shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 
With stocks still rallying to start 2019  it s been hard for value investors to find true value stocks 
The old price to earnings screens simply aren t going to cut it in this type of market 
That s why value investors have to take a fresh look at how they search for value stocks 
How Do You Screen for Value 
Most value investors simply use the P E or the PEG when looking for value stocks  There s nothing wrong with those screens 
But one of Tracey s favorite value fundamentals is the price to sales  P S  ratio 
A P S ratio under 1 0 means that an investor is getting the sales on sale  Investors are paying less than the sales are worth for the sales 
The Secret Screen for Value
The secret screen includes a P S ratio under 1 0 as well as the Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy   These should hopefully be stocks that are seeing rising earnings estimates 
We want only the best and the Zacks Rank allows us to narrow the universe 
This screen returned 176 stocks 
That s a lot to dig into  so a market cap above  500 million was also added to exclude the microcaps 
The screen then returned 125 stocks 
That gave us plenty of choice 
5 Stocks with Attractive P S Ratios
1        Allstate   NYSE ALL    the property insurer  has a P S ratio of just 0 8  But it s also cheap on a P E basis  with a forward P E of 10 2  Shares have been weak in 2019  falling 8 1  year to date  Could this be a buying opportunity 
2        Best Buy   NYSE BBY   shares are down 12 8  year to date which has pushed them into the value category  It has a P S ratio of just 0 4  It also pays a dividend  currently yielding 2 9  
3        Sysco   NYSE SYY    the food distributor  has a P S ratio of just 0 6  Earnings for fiscal 2019 are expected to rise 8 3  and another 10 4  in fiscal 2020  Investors also get a dividend  currently yielding 2 4  
4        Walmart   NYSE WMT   is cheap by a P S ratio metric as it s P S is just 0 6  However  it s forward P E is on the high side  at 21  Do you buy the cheap sales even though you re paying more for the earnings  Walmart does reward shareholders with a dividend yielding 2 1  
5        Centene Corporation   NYSE CNC   is a health insurer  The health insurers HMOs have been hit hard in 2019 on fears of  Medicare for all  even though there is no actual legislation for it  Year to date  the shares are up just 2 4   It s cheap with a forward P E of 14 2 and a P S ratio of just 0 4  Earnings are also expected to rise 19 5  in 2019

135826,357341,SYY,Can Strong Brands   Saving Efforts Pare Tyson Foods  Hurdles ,opinion,Despite sluggishness across some units  Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   has managed to maintain a firm footing in the food space on efficient strategies  Well  this renowned meat products player is gaining from consistent focus to bolster protein packed offerings  Additionally  its saving efforts are encouraging  Let s take a closer look Efforts to Strengthen PortfolioFor fiscal 2019  USDA expects overall domestic protein production  chicken  beef  pork and turkey  to rise roughly 3  year over year  Rising demand for protein packed food products is a fueling factor for higher protein production  In fact  Tyson Foods boasts a rich portfolio of protein packed brands that are growing rapidly across the globe To further expand protein offerings  Tyson Foods frequently engages in business acquisitions  We note that on Feb 6  2019  the company announced a deal to acquire the European and Thai operations of BRF S A  for approximately  340 million in cash  The buyout is likely to strengthen Tyson Foods  foothold in the Thai poultry space and expand its presence in the U K  and the Netherlands  On Nov 30  2018  the company acquired Keystone Foods business  which supplies a broad array of meat and chicken products across the globe  The move is likely to bolster Tyson Foods  international presence as well as improve sales and distribution network in growth markets  Other notable acquisitions of Tyson Foods include   AdvancePierre  Original Philly Holdings  Hillshire as well as Mexican food restaurant chains  Circle Foods and Don Julio Foods Apart from this  the company is steadily expanding fresh prepared foods offering to cater to consumers  rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without any added hormones or antibiotics  In this respect  the buyout of Tecumseh is quite noteworthy  The deal has added the popular air chilled Smart Chicken brand along with a variety of chicken sausages  fresh and deli style chicken to its portfolio  Tyson Foods is venturing into alternative sources for meat and protein products  which is evident from its investments in Beyond Meat and Memphis Meats Saving Efforts on TrackToward the latter half of 2017  Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program to enhance operating and supply chain efficiencies  reduce overheads as well as fuel the bottom line in the forthcoming periods  In fact  the company generated savings worth  253 million in fiscal 2018  higher than the earlier goal of  200 million   The company aims to generate savings from this program  through synergies from acquisition integration along with incremental cost optimization  Earlier  management had stated that it expects the program to generate savings worth  400 million in 2019 and  600 million by 2020  Majority of these savings are expected to drive the Prepared Foods and Chicken segments  Can Efforts Mitigate HeadwindsWe note that lower sales in the Pork and the Prepared Foods categories have been weighing on Tyson Food s top line for a while  Pork segment sales volumes are dismal due to the company s efforts to balance supply with consumers  demand  Further  the Prepared Foods category is bearing the brunt of business divestitures Apart from these  the company is witnessing rising input costs in categories like pork bellies  beef and pork trim and turkey breast  These costs are likely to continue to rise in the forthcoming periods  Further  the company is experiencing cost pressures due to a tight labor market Nevertheless  we expect Tyson Foods to overcome these headwinds backed by robust endeavors to expand in the protein space and efforts to boost financial strength through savings plans  In fact  such well spun efforts have boosted investors  optimism in this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock that rallied 31 9  in the past three months compared with the  s rise of 20 4  Greedy for

Sysco  which belongs to the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry  posted revenues of  14 77 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 59   This compares to year ago revenues of  14 41 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Sysco shares have added about 1 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 8  
What s Next for Sysco 
While Sysco has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Sysco was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

135856,357371,SYY,Is Sysco  SYY  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks  Nevertheless  we know that our readers all have their own perspectives  so we are always looking at the latest trends in value  growth  and momentum to find strong picks 
Considering these trends  value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One company value investors might notice is Sysco  SYY   SYY is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as a Value grade of A 
Investors will also notice that SYY has a PEG ratio of 1 76  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  SYY s PEG compares to its industry s average PEG of 2 12  Over the past 52 weeks  SYY s PEG has been as high as 2 22 and as low as 1 62  with a median of 1 81 
Value investors also love the P S ratio  which is calculated by simply dividing a stock s price with the company s sales  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  SYY has a P S ratio of 0 57  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 07 
These are just a handful of the figures considered in Sysco s great Value grade  Still  they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment  Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook  and we can clearly see that SYY is an impressive value stock right now ",2019-03-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-sysco-syy-stock-undervalued-right-now-200399017,200399017
135859,357374,SYY,This Is Why Sysco  SYY  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Sysco in Focus
Headquartered in Houston  Sysco  SYY  is a Consumer Staples stock that has seen a price change of 6 06  so far this year  The food distributor is paying out a dividend of  0 39 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 35  compared to the Food   Miscellaneous industry s yield of 0 22  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 96  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 56 is up 13  from last year  Sysco has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5 07   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Sysco s payout ratio is 44   which means it paid out 44  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for SYY for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  3 40 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 8 28  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that SYY is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-03-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-sysco-syy-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200399013,200399013
135876,357391,SYY,UNFI Vs  SYY  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Food   Miscellaneous stocks are likely familiar with United Natural Foods  UNFI  and Sysco  SYY   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
United Natural Foods and Sysco are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  4  Sell   respectively  right now  This means that UNFI s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
UNFI currently has a forward P E ratio of 6 35  while SYY has a forward P E of 19 07  We also note that UNFI has a PEG ratio of 0 88  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  SYY currently has a PEG ratio of 1 84 
Another notable valuation metric for UNFI is its P B ratio of 0 60  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  SYY has a P B of 12 78 
These metrics  and several others  help UNFI earn a Value grade of A  while SYY has been given a Value grade of C 
UNFI has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than SYY  so it seems like value investors will conclude that UNFI is the superior option right now ",2018-11-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/unfi-vs-syy-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200362845,200362845

135880,357395,SYY,Sysco  SYY  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Sysco  SYY  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This food distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 72 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 1  
Revenues are expected to be  14 85 billion  up 3 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 72  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Sysco 
For Sysco  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 01  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sysco will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Sysco would post earnings of  0 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 91  delivering a surprise of  1 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Sysco doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sysco-syy-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200380070,200380070

Sysco has been actively pursuing strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio and expand its base  In this regard  the company closed its Kent Foods buyout during the fiscal third quarter and expects the same to bolster the U K  and European business bandwagon  During the fiscal third quarter  the company also concluded the acquisitions pertaining to Hawaii based HFM FoodService and Louisiana based Doerle Food Service  Incidentally  the HFM buyout aided the company s U S  Broadline operations during the quarter  Sysco also remains on track with the integration process of London based Brakes Group that was acquired in July 2016

these companies have increased 24  from the year ago quarter  while revenues have risen 9 5  Further  the earnings trend report suggests that the top and the bottom line performances in this season are on track to mark the highest growth rate in seven years  As a whole  earnings for the S P 500 companies are projected to improve 23 1  year over year on revenue growth of 8 6   In fourth quarter 2017  earnings and revenues rose 13 4  and 8 6   respectively A Glimpse of the Consumer Staples SectorThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors  all of which are expected to witness year over year earnings growth this season  The  sector is expected to record earnings growth of 7 3  and revenue increase of 3 9  The Consumer Staples sector is currently placed at the bottom 6   15 of 16  of all Zacks sectors  Well  the segment has been grappling with headwinds such as rising input costs as well as intense competition that has increased promotional spending  This  in turn  has created significant pricing pressure  Thanks to such deterrents  the sector has lost 10 4  in a year  against the S P 500 index s gain of 9 8  Even amid such concerns  companies in the sector are trying to stay afloat through well chalked innovations and other efforts to meet consumers  changing tastes and preferences  Firms have been resorting to restructuring and cost savings efforts to minimize the negative impacts of higher costs of operations and materials   Further  to consolidate their footing in this space and expand their portfolio  companies have been undertaking strategic buyouts That said  let s see what s in store for the following stocks when they release their quarterly results on May 7 Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank  1

Food Demand Bodes Well For TSNTyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN    that is slated to report second quarter fiscal 2018 results  has long been cheering on rising demand for protein rich products  Such a trend has led to significant growth in the company s Beef  Chicken and Prepared Foods segments  Further  management expects demand for protein to continue rising and is well placed to exploit opportunities in the space  The company s investments in Memphis Meats and Beyond Meat are the latest examples in this connection  It has also been bolstering its poultry production capacity  Such efforts combined with the acquisition of AdvancePierre and Original Philly indicate the company s dedicated focus on augmenting protein packed food products  Further  Tyson Foods also strives to enhance savings and induce operating efficiency through its Financial Fitness Program   Read more   Driven by the aforementioned factors  the consensus mark for earnings in the to be reported quarter is currently pegged at  1 37  depicting a surge of 35 6  from the year ago quarter s figure  Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales for the impeding quarter to be approximately  9 954 million  depicting a rise of almost 9 6  from the prior year quarter s tally However  Tyson Foods has been struggling with increased labor and freight expenses  Such headwinds are expected to linger and hurt performance in the second quarter as well  We also note that Tyson Foods has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters  Also  this time around  the company has an Earnings ESP of  2 88   Although the company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  You can see  U S  Foodservices Likely to Aid SYY  Sysco Corporation   NYSE SYY   will be releasing third quarter fiscal 2018 results   The company has been progressing well with U S  Foodservices  wherein restaurant sales have been strong  Notably  local case volumes in this segment has been rising year over year for 15 consecutive quarters  Management expects a stronger second half  wherein it also anticipates favorable results in its International segment To top it  we remain encouraged about Sysco s focus on its strategy for 2020  as it gives out positive signals for the quarter to be reported as well  In this regard  the company is focused on enhancing assortments  making constant innovations  ensuring food safety and revitalizing brands  Further  to evolve with the changing consumer preferences  Sysco is committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e commerce operations Indeed  such well spun strategies place Sysco well on the growth trajectory  That said  the consensus estimate for third quarter earnings is pegged at 64 cents  which marks a solid 25 5  improvement from 51 cents recorded in the year ago quarter  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for overall sales is pegged at  14 382 million  up from  13 524 million recorded in the year ago quarter However  the company has been incurring lower gross margin in the past two quarters  mainly stemming from higher inbound freight costs and food cost inflation  Persistent hurdles like these are a threat to Sysco s performance  Further  our proven model doesn t show that Sysco is likely to beat bottom line estimates this quarter  Though Sysco has

Pinnacle Foods  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Although net sales of  883 5 million for the quarter missed the consensus mark of  909 million  the same depicted growth of 2 9  from the prior year period  Top line results during the period mainly gained from a 7 2  benefit stemming from the 53rd week combined with a 0 6  recovery from the negative impacts of hurricanes that had adversely impacted third quarter results  Management further stated that the company s in market performance continued to remain quite strong in the fourth quarter Nevertheless  these upsides were partially offset by negative impacts of 2 4  stemming from the Aunt Jemima   AJ   exit  0 1  from the Boulder SKU rationalization and a decline of 2 4  in underlying sales  We note that underlying sales during the quarter suffered from lower retail inventory levels and lower volume mix  These were partially countered by 0 8  higher net price realization and impacts of 0 1  stemming from favorable currency translation  Further  inflationary trends leading to higher packaging and logistics costs have also been weighing on the company s margins Owing to such factors  shares of the company have lost 9  in the past six months compared with the  s fall of 1 9  Moving on  adjusted gross profit for the quarter in review was  274 3 million  advancing 2 5  from the prior year quarter  Adjusted gross margin  however  slipped 10 basis points  bps  to 31 1  on account of the AJ exit and higher manufacturing investments  Moreover  gross margin also suffered from unfavorable volume mix and higher inflation On a GAAP basis  gross profit increased 2 2   gaining predominantly from improved sales  strong productivity and reductions in performance based compensation program  These were somewhat offset by higher input cost inflation arising from increased packaging and logistics costs  Further  gross profit also encountered unfavorable impacts of product mix  increased manufacturing investments and discrete costs arising from the AJ exit Further  adjusted earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT  went up 11 9  to  204 2 million in the quarter  gaining from growth in gross profit as well as dedicated cost management efforts mainly in discretionary spending Segment ResultsFrozen  Sales increased 2 7  in the quarter to  381 million on account of benefits arising from the 53rd week as well as recovery from the hurricane related impacts witnessed in the preceding quarter  These were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from the AJ exit and underlying decline in sales  Adjusted EBIT for the segment gained 1  to  89 million Grocery  Sales rose 3 8  to  309 6 million backed by the benefits from the 53rd week  partially offset by a decline in underlying net sales   Adjusted EBIT for the

quarter 2017  sales at the Boulder segment jumped 13 4  to  110 5 million  fueled by robust underlying sales growth and benefits stemming from the 53rd week  These upsides were somewhat mitigated by the SKU rationalization program and shutdown of the Boulder U K  operations  Adjusted EBIT for the segment totaled  24 5 million  a remarkable surge from the prior year quarter figure of  12 7 million Specialty Foods  Sales tumbled 9 9  to  82 5 million due to negative impacts of the AJ exit and underlying sales decline  Underlying sales were majorly hurt by the lower volume mix stemming from the company s previously announced exit from its gardein private label business  These declines were partially countered by improved net price realization and benefits arising from the 53rd week  The segment s adjusted EBIT came in at  11 3 million  gaining 13 5  from the prior year quarter Full Year ResultsIncluding a benefit of 5 cents from the 53rd week  adjusted earnings per share for 2017

net sales growth from favorable volume mix and net price realization  Top line performance also gained from the 53rd week and the additional three weeks of Boulder Brands acquisition  These upsides were partially offset by lower retail inventories  the AJ exit and the combined negative impacts of U K  business closures and Boulder SKU rationalization   Adjusted gross profit during the year went down 0 9  to  913 2 million  while adjusted gross margin slumped 40 bps to 29   Further  adjusted EBIT gained 5 7  from the prior year to  569 3 million We also note that during 2017  the company s

136020,357535,SYY,Will U S  Foodservice Unit Drive Sysco  SYY  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Sysco Corp    NYSE SYY   is slated to release second quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 5  The food products giant delivered positive earnings surprise in seven out of the past eight quarters  while sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for three consecutive quarters  Sysco s strong record has also helped it to jump 22 8  in a year against the  that dipped 0 2  So  let s see if this Texas based company can keep its spectacular surprise streak alive this time too Factors at PlayWe expect Sysco to continue gaining from its cost saving and revenue management efforts  which have been driving its performance for a while now  Incidentally  the company has been impressively managing expenses for the past few years  and is making progress in both SG A and supply chain areas  In the supply chain area  the company is witnessing positive momentum from its productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements Driven by these endeavors  the company remains on track to achieve the high end of the three year adjusted operating income growth target of approximately  600  650 million through the end of FY18  This growth is expected to come from lower administrative costs and improving gross margin  which gives out positive signals for the quarter under review Further  the company s focus on acquisitions  new product developments  value added services and improved e commerce capabilities remains a growth driver  In this regard  the company s recent acquisition of HFM Foodservice is likely to augment its top line  by boosting revenues of the U S  Foodservice segment  Notably  Sysco expects to achieve 0 5 1  sales growth through acquisitions in the long term  Other than aiding sales growth  these acquisitions also enhance Sysco s presence in international markets Backed by these factors  Sysco has been witnessing year over year growth in top and bottom lines for quite some time now  and we expect this trend to continue in the quarter to be reported How Are Sysco s Segments Placed Taking a segment wise look  we remain optimistic about the company s U S  Foodservice Operations  which delivered a strong performance in the last reported quarter despite bearing the brunt of hurricanes  Notably  sales in this segment advanced 4  to  9 849 9 million  with local case volume within U S  Broadline operations up 2 8   Also  gross profit increased 3 8   backed by the company s focus on product management  efficient pricing and revenue management initiatives Going forward  management expects its domestic business to be buoyed by increased consumer demand and traffic  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at  9 561 million  which reflects 5 2  growth from the year ago period Moving to the International Foodservice Operations  this unit delivered improved sales too in the last reported quarter  However  results were partly hurt by softness in Europe  which is battling slow traffic  Moreover  weak UK currency resulted in food cost inflation  thereby leading to pricing pressure  These headwinds are likely to persist throughout the fiscal  though management remains focused on reducing the impact of such obstacles  Additionally  the company remains encouraged about the growth prospects in Latin America  Markedly  the consensus mark for International sales stands at  2 784 million compared with  2 626 million in the same year ago period The company also remains hopeful of growth in its SYGMA segment  for which the consensus estimate for sales is  1 613 million  up 6 1  from the year ago reported sales figure Q2 Expectations as a WholeSysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Given these factors and Sysco s focus on its recently announced   we believe that the company will continue with its top and bottom line growth in the second quarter Encouragingly  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings is pegged at 65 cents  which represents more than 12  growth from the year ago period  Moreover  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  14 186 million  up 5 4  from the year ago reported figure What the Zacks

	 Call it lack of conviction if you will  either side of the fight today plain didn t show up to work  The total range on the S P 500 was about 13 handles  If you fast forward past the first hour of the session then the market was stuck in a 4 handle range all day  Volume was much lighter than usual too with the S P 500 only trading about 2 3 of its typical count      Dave BartosiakInsider Trader   The focus is still on the passage of the tax plan  There aren t many congressional days left in the current session before the Christmas holiday  But if the Congress can pass it  even if just in the House  this could provide a much needed catalyst to move stocks to the next level 
	 Speaker Ryan keeps insisting the House will vote on this tax plan by next week  before the Thanksgiving recess  But that leaves little time  when they come back  for the Senate to vote on theirs and for any bill reconciliation to take place 
	 The small cap companies  in particular  really want the tax cuts by 2018

136101,357616,SYY,Why Is SUPERVALU  SVU  A Viable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,"The food grocery industry is grappling with a number of headwinds of late  Shift in consumer purchase decisions  evolving shopping behavior and increasing presence of small firms continue to plague the industry  A shift in consumer preference toward non genetically modified  organic  and gluten free products is also hurting business  Also  there is an industry wide weakness  as deflationary pressure in commodities such as dairy  beef and eggs are hurting the margins of food companies like Sysco Corp    NYSE SYY    United Natural Foods  Inc   Sprouts Farmers Market  Inc 
The recent news of e Commerce king Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN    Whole Foods Market Inc    NASDAQ WFM   has further unnerved food competitors and raised concerns 
The not so impressive scenario in the food grocery industry is evident from the fact that out of the 260 plus industries  the  industry falls in bottom 42  of Zacks classified industries and holds a Zacks Industry Rank  153  To learn more visit   
Value Investing
In such a scenario  investors must be looking out for value stocks that are compelling buys or offer up lucrative discounts when compared to fair value  Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment 
With the help of our new   we have identified that SUPERVALU  Inc    NYSE SVU   can be a good choice for value oriented investors right now  as the stock carries a Zacks Rank  2 and flaunts a Value score of  A  
Our Value Style Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of  value traps  and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount  Our research shows that stocks with Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential  You can see  
Now let s look at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process 
PE Ratio
A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  PE   This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world 
On this front  SUPERVALU has a trailing 12 months PE ratio of 6 6  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 is 20 1  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified industry s trailing 12 months PE ratio  which is pegged at 21 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  as you can see in the chart below 

Notably  SUPERVALU has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 0  which compares favorably with industry s average of 19 8 and S P 500 average of 18 9  So it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for SUPERVALU stock in the near term too 
P S Ratio
Another key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Right now  SUPERVALU has a P S ratio of about 0 1  This is significantly lower than the industry average of 1 8 and S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 1 right now 
P FCF Ratio
Another great indicator of value is the P FCF ratio  which comes in at 4 6  which is much better than the industry average of 25 6 and S P average of 27 8  Clearly  SVU is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles 
A Stock Overview 
SUPERVALU is one of the nation s largest supermarket retailer and largest food distributor  However  we note that this grocery dealer does not have a good track record of financial performance  The company s earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  with an average miss of 6 7   Moreover  its sales have lagged the consensus mark in six of the seven straight quarters  In fact  SUPERVALU s shares have underperformed the Zacks categorized industry in the last six months  During the said time frame  shares of this company plunged 33 3  compared with the industry s decline of 5 8   

Nevertheless  it is commendable that SUPERVALU is taking measures to turn around the stock and improve its business  In fact  the company is taking initiatives to expand its retail banners in to boost sales  Further  SUPERVALU is focusing on its wholesale business  which is mainly driven by sales to new customers as well as from new outlets operated by existing customers  Also  the recent acquisition of Unified Grocers is expected to radically boost the company s wholesale segment  alongside offering new growth opportunities across multiple geographies  Moreover  it has undertaken several measures to improve comps in the retail sector and increase operating efficiency 
Estimates have increased for 2017 over the last 30 days  Further  it is expected to witness earnings growth of 18 97  in 2017 SuperValu Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Bottom Line
SUPERVALU is surely an inspired choice for value investors  buoyed by its incredible line up of statistics  amid sluggish grocery market scenario

136105,357620,SYY,Pinnacle Foods  PF  Dips Despite Q2 Earnings Beat  Here s Why,opinion,Pinnacle Foods Inc    NYSE PF   posted mixed second quarter 2017 results  wherein though the bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate  top line missed the same  Further  management reiterated full year adjusted earnings guidance at the low end of its previously stated range The company s shares have declined nearly 2 1  yesterday  probably as investors were disappointed with the top line miss and the bleak earnings view  However  we note that the stock has rallied 4 5  in the last three months against the  s decline of 1 2   Nonetheless  the industry is placed at top 47  of the Zacks Classified industries  120 out of 256  Q2 HighlightsAdjusted earnings of 53 cents per share rose 26 2  from the year ago period  and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents by 1 9   This was in line with the company s robust earnings trend in recent quarters  Notably  the company has a track record of either meeting or beating earnings estimates   much similar to Colgate Palmolive Company   NYSE CL   that  has maintained this trend for over seven years now  barring one quarter of negative earnings surprise in Jun 2015 Coming back to Pinnacle Foods  the company has delivered positive earnings surprise in eight of the last 14 quarters and posted in line results in the remaining six Pinnacle Foods  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    However  GAAP earnings for the quarter came in at 16 cents versus 39 cents in the prior year period  significantly hurt by items affecting comparability Net sales fell 1 6  to  744 6 million in the second quarter and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 766 million by 2 8   In fact  its top line has lagged the consensus mark in 10 of the last 14 quarters The decline is attributed to the 2 6  negative impact from the sale of its low margin businesses comprising Aunt Jemima  AJ  retail and foodservice frozen breakfast products  In addition  the company s top line included a 0 9  impact from the closing of Boulder UK operations as well as SKU rationalization program initiated in the second half of 2016  However  these negatives were offset by robust underlying sales growth of 1 9  Adjusted gross profit decreased 6 8  to  203 8 million with the gross margin contraction of 150 basis points  bps  to 27 4   This was attributable to adverse margin that was over 200 bps from the certain discrete items Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT  slipped 0 5  to  114 2 million in the quarter Segment DetailsFrozen  Segment sales rose 2 5  to  295 9 million in the quarter on the back of higher volume mix of 9 2   partially offset by reduced net price realization of 2 4  and currency headwinds of 0 3  However  adjusted EBIT for the segment dropped 14 4  to  38 1 million as unfavorable impact from discrete items was higher than increased productivity as well as positive timing of marketing spending Grocery  Segment sales fell 1 8  to  276 1 million due to the unfavorable net price realization of 2 1   somewhat compensated with favorable volume mix of 0 3  Adjusted EBIT for the segment grew 15  to  61 9 million backed by productivity savings  synergies from the Boulder Brands acquisition as well as favorable impact from items affecting comparability  These items were offset by input cost inflation Boulder  Pinnacle Foods completed the acquisition of Boulder Brands on Jan 15  2016  Consequently  it became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company In second quarter 2017  Boulder segment contributed  94 7 million to net sales  which is in line with the prior year period  This represents higher volume mix of 4 9   along with favorable net price realization of 2 8   which were mitigated by the winding down of the Boulder UK operations and SKU rationalization program Adjusted EBIT for the Boulder Brands segment totaled  15 8 million  up 30 3  from the prior year quarter Specialty Foods  Segment sales declined 15 1  to  78 million due to reduced volume mix of 6 8  and 8 9  decrease from the AJ exit  partly favorable net price realization of 0 6   Meanwhile  the private label business continued to be under pressure in the quarter as was anticipated by the company  due to lower sales of USDA stew as well as the exit of the gardein private label business  Also  the segment s adjusted EBIT plunged 39 5  to  4 4 million in the reported quarter Notably  this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company has been witnessing sluggish net sales for the Specialty segment for quite some time now  Due to a heightened competitive bidding environment for the already low margin USDA stew business  the company continues to expect Specialty to remain challenged through 2017  reflecting lower sales of private label canned meat Other Financial AspectsPinnacle Foods ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  130 9 million  long term debt of  2 940 8 million  and total equity of  1 944 9 million In the quarter  the company generated cash flow from operations of  57 million and incurred capital expenditure of  20 million  Additionally  its total free cash flow for the quarter totaled  37 million 2017 GuidancePinnacle Foods reaffirmed its adjusted earnings guidance in the band of  2 55  2 60 per share for 2017 but expects the same to be at the lower end  This reflects a year over year increase of nearly 19   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  2 59 for the full year Net sales and adjusted earnings for 2017 are anticipated to gain roughly 1  and 3 cents  respectively  from the 53rd week  Further  this is likely to benefit the fourth quarter as well Moreover  the company continues to expect input cost inflation in the range of 2 5 3  for the year  Productivity is estimated to be at the top or marginally above its cost of products sold range of 3 5 4   Notably  this does not include the synergies of not less than  15 million from Boulder Brands acquisition  which are likely to benefit the gross margin as well as SG A overhead Additionally  capital expenditures for the full year are expected to be in the range of  115  125 million Our TakeOverall  the company boasts of a strong brand portfolio and intends to continue investing in innovation products to further differentiate its brands in the marketplace  It has also been pursuing various acquisitions over the years to enhance its distribution network  customer base and long term growth Moreover  Pinnacle Foods has an operational excellence program to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain  In fact  these productivity savings  along with higher pricing have been mitigating the impact of input cost inflation to drive gross margins Stocks to ConsiderBetter ranked stocks in the same industry

Buy rated Visa shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Services Transaction sector over the last year  up  16 1  vs   14 7   but is behind rival Mastercard  up  19 4    Visa s earnings beat expectations and also increased year over year  Results were driven by the acquisition of Visa Europe and solid growth in payments volume as well as processed transactions 
The Zacks analyst likes the company s strategic acquisitions and alliances  technology upgrades and effective marketing efforts  In addition  global economic uncertainty and legal headwinds are major concerns  Higher client incentives also pose a risk on profitability   You can  
Shell shares have outperformed the Zacks Integrated Oil industry over the past six months  up  6 5  vs   2 6  gain for the industry  as well as its smaller rival BP  LON BP   up  4 4    The integrated behemoth s upstream unit swung to a Q1 profit from a year ago loss thanks to steady oil price recovery during the period and production contribution of BG assets 
The Hague based supermajor was also able to reduce operating costs and progress on its large divestment program  Importantly  the Anglo Dutch company generated a surge in cash flows  allowing it to cut debt and cover its cash dividend  However  with oil falling below the psychologically critical  50 threshold again 
Shell s near to medium term revenue outlook remains cloudy  Hence  the Zacks analyst thinks investors should wait for a better entry point before buying shares in Europe s largest oil company   You can  
HSBC shares underperformed the Zacks categorized Foreign Banks industry over the least six months  gaining  9 1  vs  14 5   Further  the bank s first quarter 2017 net income declined  reflecting absence of Brazil business results  A dismal European economy and weak loan demand are expected to lead to muted revenue growth in the quarters ahead

136132,357647,SYY,The Week Ahead  Is The Housing Rally Over ,opinion,"With soft housing data last week and higher interest rates expected  it is a good time to ask 
Is the housing rally over 
Last Week Recap
The big economic news last week was the Fed policy decision and guidance  Friday s announcement of the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  purchase of Whole Foods  NASDAQ WFM  grabbed the headlines  Attorney General Sessions  Senate Testimony got the gavel to gavel treatment 
Our question from last week   a possible change in market leadership   did attract some discussion  Friday s grocery news is still being digested  but the sector shifts were pronounced 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart of the S P 500  via Jill Mislinski  Despite the mid week Fed announcement  the result for the week was barely changed 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read the entire post for several more charts providing long term perspective  including the size and frequency of drawdowns 
Note to Readers
Thanks to all of those who offered suggestions for changes in WTWA and feedback on my first attempt  I am still working on many of the other suggestions  I am off next weekend  but I will again try to post an abbreviated version including an indicator update 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
The economic news last week was mixed  
The Good
Jobless claims declined to 237K  maintaining the current record low levels 
Forward earnings estimates are holding up  This may seem like faint praise  but those criticizing the use of analyst estimates point to excessive optimism and repeated cuts in forecasts   tracks these estimates  He notes the comparative strength  but also warns about possible weakness in tech 
Chemical activity barometer  suggests continued growth through 2017    for the full story 
Small business optimism remains high  I have upgraded my attention to this series  since the importance has increased  Sluggish business investment  hiring  and loans to small companies have all been issues  Improved confidence from small business owners is helpful on all fronts  While some have  already   become pessimistic on the Trump agenda  those relieved of regulations have been more positive   provides analysis and this chart 


CPI remained benign with an increase of only 0 1  in the core rate  Some see this as bad news since it is below the Fed s target and or the take inflation as a signal of economic growth  Growth without inflation is good  It gives the Fed a little leeway 
FOMC decision got a positive reception  The small increase in the Fed Funds target was expected by markets  demonstrated by the small change in bond yields  Prof  James Hamilton  Econbrowser  explains why the    He explains  and also provides some interesting data  importantly noting the effects of other news 

The Bad
Industrial production was unchanged  The decline from April s 1 1  gain was expected  but disappointing nonetheless 
LA port data is a subject of some controversy   sees a positive trend  using a 12 month rolling average  Steven Hansen    prefers rolling unadjusted three month averages  but notes some anomalies this time  Data nerds should read both pieces in detail to understand how the methods chosen affect what you conclude 
Michigan Sentiment declined to 94 5 from a prior of 97 1 
Retail sales declined 0 3  compared to the April gain of 0 4  and expectations of unchanged 
Housing starts declined and missed expectations  Building permits did the same  On the surface this was bad news  but there is some debate over the data  See below for more discussion 
The Ugly
Collateral damage from the Amazon decision to purchase Whole Foods  While it was obviously bad news for competitors in the grocery business  the reach was much greater  Here is a heat map that I tweeted an hour after Friday s opening 

There may be some logical extensions of the Amazon strategy  but the effect on only four other stocks exceed the entire size of the deal  In some cases  the declines came because of mutual ETF membership  not any specific analysis  This topic deserves more scrutiny

Insight for Investors

Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be Wade F  Slome s excellent analysis of the stock market rally   accompanied by  worry  pessimism  and skepticism   He describes his list as a  small sample  

He notes as follows 

the endless laundry list of crises and concerns has not broken this significant  multi year bull market  In fact  stock prices have more than tripled since early 2009  As famed hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman noted 
 Bull markets don t die from old age  they die from excesses  
On the contrary to excesses  corporations have been slow to hire and invest due to heightened risk aversion induced by the financial crisis  Consumers have saved more and lowered personal debt levels 

Read the full article to see his warning signs   a combination of several trends 
Stock Ideas
 does his usual careful analysis of restaurant supplier Sysco  NYSE SYY   The dividend is safe  but there are some issues on the horizon  Amazon  which he regards as unlikely to compete in this space  and extra debt taken on for a recent acquisition  That said  he assigns a  dividend Safety Score  of 97  DIY investors interested in dividends should read this post carefully  This is the kind of work required 
A brief digression   which I hope you will enjoy  On trading floors people are watching different things  There is no reason to have everyone covering the same news flow  When there is news  we often shout it out so everyone knows what is happening  This is one reason that managers often choose to work from a desk on the trading floor 
When I see a Sysco truck or news about the stock  I am reminded of a  about how to avoid confusion 

 Wrong Sysco   SYY  preannouncing  
In a market that is so Cisco dominated   NASDAQ CSCO    and believe me  this is Cisco dominated   just the sheer possibility that someone might take Cisco shares on Sysco saying something positive required that our trader shout out the good news for the food broker 

 offers a comprehensive analysis of AbbVie  NYSE ABBV   which he notes has growth  value  and high yield  The analysis uses the stock as an example that helps explain his method  You get both an interesting idea and some information strong stock selection methods 
Energy stocks   reports that this sector accounts for nearly half of the Q2 growth in earnings for the S P 500 
And how about wind and solar energy  The  that monthly generation from these sources has reached 10  of the total 

A lagging railroad   recommends a look at the Genesee and Wyoming railroad  NYSE GWR   You cannot guess where they operate  It is an interesting idea  although real value depends upon a resumption of earnings growth 
Personal Finance
Abnormal Returns always has first rate  daily links for investors  His  is personal finance   of special interest to the individual investor  I especially liked the discussion about the recent reversal for value stocks  the underlying factors  and the long term success  The  includes a range of good sources and provides a balanced perspective  Also excellent is the  on how an investor should avoid distractions  Hint  Why do you think your brokerage makes it easy for you to see online quotes 
Seeking Alpha Senior Editor Gil Weinreich has an interesting topic every day  This week I especially enjoyed the  about thrift versus economic growth  Your own viewpoint is probably reflected and discussed 
Value versus Growth
 that value stocks showed strong gains in 2016  which have been erased in 2017  There are always shifts  but this has been much more dramatic than usual  They provide an exhaustive analysis of the trends and possible causes and highlight this conclusion 

Overall  the lion s share of the performance gap between value and growth across the globe can be accounted for by an expansion in multiples that has outstripped even the habitually bullish analysts  expectations for future earnings  This should be no small consolation to valuation oriented investors  Multiples running ahead of fundamentals is a classic sign of over extrapolation by investors

Watch out for  
What is in your ETF holdings  Here is a little test  If you own an ETF  try to name the top holdings  If you do not like a particular stock  go the other way  Is this a big holding for some of your ETFs 
Final Thoughts
This week s topic raises interesting questions that have relevance for many other current issues 
Topping markets  The first sign of a rollover in an economic series always gets a reaction  One viewpoint is that it is a clear sign of a top   time to expect the worst  Often it simply puts us on alert  but requires more evidence  If you look at a data series of almost anything  you will see small declines from a top followed by further increases 
Economic relationships do not work like light switches  Changes are not accurately described as two person transactions   buyer and seller  A change in mortgage interest  for example  affects the point of intersection of supply and demand curves  It shifts the supply at a given price  While we know that this reduces quantity  we do not know by how much 
Even after we improve the analysis by thinking of supply and demand curves  we must consider the micro   the behavior of the individuals making up the curve 
Some buyers  who have been on the edge of a decision and fearing higher rates  may step up   See  citing this as the reason behind the jump in mortgage applications   This changes the shape of the demand curve 
Some sellers  sensing a tightening market  may absorb some of the implied price increase  This changes the supply curve 
Anyone who begins with a conclusion that  buyers are priced out  is leading with his chin 
Demographic changes  Millennials are starting families and establishing homes  The worries about the overhang of foreclosure homes has decreased  The big wild card now is the level of future immigration   See this excellent post from   
One reason that I continue to love the homebuilders is that the factors moving interest rates higher   stronger economic growth and higher wages   are the same as those that will increase housing demand 
What worries me

136133,357648,SYY,Sysco Corp  SYY   A Future Dividend King Worth Reviewing,opinion,"Dividend investing has proven to the be  for investors to compound their wealth and income over time 
And when it comes to dividend growth stocks  they don t get much more consistent than the  and dividend kings  groups of companies that have raised their dividends for at least 25 and 50 consecutive years  respectively 
Let s take a closer look at Sysco Corporation  NYSE SYY   which is a dividend aristocrat and  thanks to 48 consecutive years of dividend growth  is just two years away from becoming a dividend king 
More importantly  learn if Sysco seems likely to reward dividend investors with many more years of income growth and if today s valuation appears to be reasonable 
Business Overview
Founded in 1969 in Houston  Texas  Sysco is one of the world s largest food distributors  essentially acting as a middleman between food producers and retail consumers 
Sysco s 65 000 employees serve  customers in 13 countries  although the U S  is its most important region by far

Business Analysis
A company s ability to steadily grow its dividend for decades usually depends on two key factors 
First  the business model needs to be stable  providing consistent and recurring cash flows from which to reward income investors  The second is a competitive advantage or moat of some kind in order to preserve  and hopefully grow  its margins and returns on shareholder capital over time 
Sysco Corp enjoys both of these attributes  That s because even during economic downturns people still need to eat  sales declined just 2  in 2009   and the company s highly diversified customer base somewhat insulates it from industry downturns  such as those that occur with restaurants during a recession  As a result  Sysco generates highly consistent cash flow 
Wholesale food distribution is a simple business as well  which is likely one reason why Warren Buffett bought into the industry in 2003 when  for  1 45 billion 
The industry s pace of change is very slow  and new innovations seem unlikely to pose any material threat to the way the wholefood distribution space operates  At the end of the day  food manufacturers need a cost efficient way to get their products to retailers and consumers 
The best operators offer prompt and accurate delivery of orders  a broad assortment of products  and competitive pricing  Since distributors are middlemen  their margins are very low  Sysco s operating margin has averaged less than 5  over the last decade  and players must either establish themselves as price or niche leaders in a given region 
Not surprisingly  Sysco s scale plays a big advantage and forms a moat  Since its formation nearly 50 years ago  Sysco has grown from  115 million to more than  50 billion in annual sales  driven by a long history of well executed acquisitions in this highly capital intensive industry 

Sysco benefits from having the industry s best economies of scale  and few companies have the capital and supply chain network and expertise to match Sysco s inventory assortment 
When combined with Sysco s wide network of warehouses and distribution systems  the company enjoys an advantage in serving national accounts and can offer daily delivery to most of its customers  Thanks to its dense delivery network around its warehouses  Sysco can offer lower pricing than most other distributors in its geographic regions  too 
The company s latest acquisition  Sysco s  3 1 billion purchase of European food distributor Brakes Group in 2016  gives the business a solid foothold into international expansion  which is necessary because the opportunity for needle moving growth in the mature U S  market is narrowing 
Specifically  that s due to Sysco s large market share  revenue and operating income are two and three times the size of its nearest competitor  according to Morningstar   which is one main reason why the Justice Department decided to block the company s  8 2 billion attempted buyout of America s second largest food distributor  U S  Foods  due to antitrust concerns 
As a result  Sysco has turned to global industry consolidation to fuel steady  but slow  growth in both its top and bottom line  You can see that Sysco s annual revenue has pretty consistently grown at a mid single digit rate over the past decade 

That being said  Sysco s profitability and returns on shareholder capital have shown signs of deterioration  due to the incredibly fragmented industry  Sysco s market share in the countries it operates in is about 16   that provides for limited pricing power  Combined with high fixed operating costs  this explains why Sysco s margins are razor thin

Then again  thank s to its large economies of scale and ongoing cost cutting efforts  Sysco still boasts industry leading profitability and impressive returns on investor capital 

Source  Morningstar
Management is laser focused on maximizing cost cutting in the coming years as well  That s partially thanks to activist investor Nelson Peltz  who took a 7  stake in the company in 2015 promising to make the company much leaner and has a seat on the company s board of directors 
In fact  thanks to efficiency improvements Sysco expects that it can grow its operating income by  600 million to  650 million between 2016 and 2018  That would represent a 33  increase in profitability  with operating income growing at an impressive 10 2  annual rate 
In addition  management believes it can achieve a long term return on invested capital  ROIC  of 15   which would be highly impressive in this low margin industry 

Source  Sysco Investor Presentation
While such cost control efforts are far from guaranteed to succeed  if management can deliver on its plan  this bodes very well for Sysco s future dividend growth prospects 
Key Risks
There are several main risks to consider before investing in Sysco 
First is the highly competitive and mature nature of the food distribution business  Sysco competes with tens of thousands of domestic U S  rivals  and smaller specialty distributors have taken some market share in the higher margin restaurant business in recent years  This makes the industry highly commoditized  meaning that maintaining industry leading profitability can be a challenge over the long term 
Sysco is working to combat these challenges by expanding internationally  gaining greater scale  and offering a more localized approach to many of its customers  For example  the company offers locally produced foods and ingredients targeted more specifically at certain demographics  Sysco can also use its size to acquire some of the local and regional niche distributors to protect its business  if necessary 
Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  could also affect the industry s dynamics in the future  especially after news of its acquisition of Whole Foods  Amazon is the expert in warehousing  inventory management  and delivery capabilities  but I would be surprised if they went after Sysco s business 
Establishing all of the necessary supplier and restaurant relationships would require a lot of work  and Sysco s margins are already quite thin  The inventory and delivery mechanisms needed for wholesale food are also quite different 
Perhaps the bigger risk would be if large national accounts or food producers decided to enter the distribution business themselves and cut out the middleman  However  this doesn t seem to be happening today   probably because of the industry s capital intensity and low value add 
The second risk is that in order to acquire Brakes Group  as well as steadily buy back shares over time  at a pace of 1 8  of shares annually over the last decade   Sysco has had to take on a large amount of debt in recent years  As a result  the company s ability to further grow through consolidation may decline somewhat in a rising interest rate environment 

Finally  be aware that due to Sysco obtaining the majority of its business from the cyclical restaurant industry  its results can be a bit lumpy depending on the health of the economy  For example  during the Great Recession sales growth fell from 7  in 2008 to  2  in 2009 
While that performance was better than most companies  results  it s worth being aware of the unpredictable short term trends that can affect results  Volatile commodity prices  e g  fuel  and consumer spending patterns  e g  grocery vs  restaurants  are two examples  However  neither of these issues should affect Sysco s long term earnings potential 
Sysco s Dividend Safety
We analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend 
Our Dividend Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at  such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more 
Dividend Safety Scores range from 0 to 100  and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least 60  Since tracking the data  companies cutting their dividends had an average Dividend Safety Score below 20 at the time of their dividend reduction announcements 

We wrote a detailed analysis reviewing how Dividend Safety Scores are calculated  what their real time track record has been  and how to use them for your portfolio  
Sysco has a dividend Safety Score of 97  indicating that its dividend appears to be among the safest and most dependable on Wall Street  That s not a surprise given that Sysco has grown its dividend every year since its founding 

Source  Simply Safe Dividends
This impressive track record is courtesy of the company s highly predictable cash flow and management s disciplined approach to maintaining a safe payout ratio 
As a result  Sysco s dividend is backed by plenty of cash flow to act as a buffer during times of economic distress  making it an ideal candidate for low risk investors  You can see that Sysco s free cash flow payout ratio has remains between 40  and 70  most years  which is a healthy level for such a defensive company 

It s also interesting to note that Sysco s free cash flow meaningfully increased during the recession  This is because the company does not have to build up as much inventory and working capital when demand falls  allowing it to sell its existing inventory and raise more cash 

In addition  despite its increased use of debt in recent years  Sysco s balance sheet remains sound  As a result  management has the flexibility to keep investing in future growth without having to sacrifice the annual dividend growth that investors have come to expect 
For example  while Sysco does has a large amount of debt  we can t forget that this highly capital intensive industry is also marked by highly consistent and stable cash flow 

And when we compare Sysco s relative debt metrics to its peers  we can see that  while slightly higher than average  the company s debt burden is far from alarming 
In fact  the strong interest coverage and current ratios  short term assets short term liabilities  give Sysco an investment grade credit rating  This means that Sysco is likely to continue to have strong access to low cost debt  a major competitive advantage in a capital intensive industry and during a period of rising interest rates 

Sources  Morningstar  Fast Graphs
While Sysco does have a somewhat high payout ratio near 70  and a lot of debt  the stability of its business and the strong free cash flow it generates each year make the company s dividend payment very safe 
Sysco s Dividend Growth 
Our Dividend Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Sysco s dividend Growth Score of 43 indicates that investors can expect slightly below average dividend growth going forward compared to the broader market of dividend paying stocks  This isn t surprising given the slow growth nature of the industry and Sysco s lower payout growth rate in recent years 
You can see that Sysco s annualized dividend growth rate has declined from 6 2  over the past decade to 3 5  over the last three years 

Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Of course that doesn t mean that Sysco won t still grow the dividend faster than inflation  After all  analysts expect Sysco to generate 3  to 4  annual sales growth  0 5  to 1 0  of which will likely come from ongoing acquisitions 
That  combined with around 2  annual share repurchases  plus growing margins from its ongoing cost cutting efforts  should allow the company s free cash flow per share to grow at around 5  to 8  annually 
Given that the company s FCF payout ratio will probably remain stable  it seems likely that Sysco s long term payout growth will also come in at a mid single digit rate 
Valuation
Over the past year Sysco has about matched the market s total return of about 20   However  the stock s current valuation is looking a bit rich 
For example  the company s forward P E of 20 3 is rather high given its slow growth profile and is slightly above its 13 year median of 19 5  It s also higher than the S P 500 s forward PE of 17 8 
Sysco s current 2 4  dividend yield is also much lower than the stock s 13 year median yield of 3 2   From a historical P E ratio and yield perspective  investors might be better off waiting for a more attractive entry point 
That being said  even at today s somewhat inflated valuation  investors can likely expect around 7 4  to 10 4  annual total returns  2 4  dividend yield   5  to 8  annual earnings growth   For such a high quality and low risk dividend growth stock  that s not a bad potential return  especially when you take into account the fact that Sysco s stock has historically been much less volatile than the S P 500 
In other words  while buying Sysco today may not represent an ideal situation  there doesn t seem to be a strong valuation case to sell the stock either  especially since it makes a reasonable holding as part of a low risk  diversified dividend growth portfolio 
Conclusion
While Sysco may not be a high flying growth stock  that doesn t mean that it can t help you steadily grow your income and wealth over time  Sysco is a simple  boring business  and its time tested operations  economic moat  and dependable cash flow generation make it a very reliable dividend aristocrat 
Sysco s current valuation doesn t look that appealing for new investors today  making it a good watch list candidate  but I continue to believe Sysco remains a reasonable long term hold for conservative investors seeking sources of safe dividend income  Investors looking for higher yields but still focusing on safety can review some of the   too ",2017-06-18,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sysco-corp-(syy):-a-future-dividend-king-worth-reviewing-200195782,200195782

Gross margin expanded 20 basis points  bps  to 15 3  in the reported quarter  The increase was driven by top line growth and favorable impact of acquisitions  which tend to generate higher gross margins by providing more value added services  Despite margin growth  we note that gross margins continued to remain challenging due to competitive pricing pressure  moderated supplier promotional activity  and a reduction in fuel surcharges 
The company also faced modest deflation of 13 basis points in the quarter  which impacted categories such as produce  meat and cheese  In fact  this was the first quarter of deflation for United Natural in at least seven years 
Adjusted operating margin decreased 26 bps to 2 34  due to higher operating costs related to acquisitions

Our Take 
The company is putting in efforts to build out its store strategy and enhance its business through acquisitions  In the past 12 months  the company has acquired four exciting and uniquely positioned companies including Haddon House specialty foods  Global Organic  Nor Cal and Gourmet Guru  With these companies  United Natural is now positioned as a large national provider of fresh produce  proteins  bakery  deli  specialty and natural products 
Though encouraged by consumers  increasing demand for organic products  driven by a healthy lifestyle  food safety and environmental sustainability  we cannot ignore the fact that the company has been struggling from continued weakness in gross margin over the past few quarters  This is due to a shift in customer mix to the lower margin supermarkets channel  The company s recent acquisitions  despite being accretive to the top line  put pressure on margins  The deflationary pressures are also affecting the produce and protein categories

are projected to improve 4   However  the sector is currently placed at bottom 38  of the Zacks Classified sectors  10 out of 16   So  let s see what awaits the following food stocks that are queued up for earnings releases on May 8 Sysco Corporation   NYSE SYY    the global food products maker and distributor  is slated to report third quarter fiscal 2017 results  before the market opens  The company s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five straight quarters now  with a trailing four quarter average of 9 3  Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Sysco this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Sysco Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Sysco has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 51 cents  Though the company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  but we need to have a positive ESP in order to be confident about earnings surprise Sysco has a strong business portfolio and has been taking initiatives to reduce costs  Also  the company has been carrying out various acquisitions to grow its distribution network and customer base  However  Sysco remains concerned about the deflationary trend which is likely to continue in the fiscal year 2017  creating modest sales and gross profit headwind   Read more   Another food stock Tyson Foods  Inc

optimistic about earnings beat Tyson has also been focusing on acquisitions to expand its portfolio  We expect  its recent acquisition of AdvancePierre Foods to enable the company to grow in the fastest growing portfolio of protein packed brands and expand its fresh prepared foods offering for both out of home and in home eating occasions  Additionally  it is focusing on providing meat based

Everyone s a little sluggish on the Monday after the Thanksgiving holiday  Stocks were no exception today  But the market didn t overload on food and drink  Instead  it gorged itself on new highs and three straight weeks of gains in the wake of the presidential election  It was about time to take a break for profit taking  As Jeremy said in Counterstrike   I sense a bit of exhaustion in the markets that might lead to a slight pullback this week  
None of the major indices saw green on Monday  and a late day selloff meant they finished the session near the lows  The S P was off 0 53  to 2201 7  the Dow declined 0 28  to 19 097 9 and the NASDAQ slipped 0 56  to 5368 8  Furthermore  the Russell 2000 had its first down session in 15 days     slipping 1 29  to 1329 8   As I mentioned last week  any pullback should be shallow and short lived   said Kevin in Options Trader   I m expecting the market to rally into the end of the year and gear up for a test of 2 400 in the S P in 2017  
Given all the new highs and the holiday  it s easy to overlook the turn of the month barrage of economic data that s set to hit the street  It culminates on Friday with the Government Employment Situation report  but along the way there s also the first revision to Q3 GDP  ADP Employment and ISM Manufacturing  among several others  The election is now out of the way  so maybe some solid economic reports will actually be a benefit to the market instead of being ignored 
In the portfolios  Zacks Counterstrike shorted a couple of names that Jeremy feels got a bit too big for their britches in the post election rally  Options Trader made two moves in the hot semiconductor space  Finally  Black Box Trader swapped four positions this week and all four sells were profitable  Learn more about all this below  along with some analysis on retail from RTA 4 for 4 in Black Box Trader
  All four stocks that the Black Box Trader sold in this week s adjustment were positive  but the big winner was NCR Corp   NCR  with a profit of 10 7   General Motors  NYSE GM  also had a strong return of 8 3   while TTM Tech  TTMI  gained 2 8  and Sysco Corp   NYSE SYY  advanced 0 8   Learn about the four new additions below Today s Portfolio Highlights 
  Some stocks have gotten a bit carried away in this post election rally  On Monday  Zacks Counterstrike shorted a couple of names that have moved too high in the past few weeks  They are both Zacks Rank  4s  Sells  
   Shares of Tempur Sealy  TPX  have soared approximately 30  of late which has flabbergasted Jeremy  Earnings estimates for the mattress giant are down 6  for the current year  and its chart suggests that a bearish channel is starting to form  He expects the middle of the channel to be tested around the  55 area at the very least  TPX is still over  60   The editor shorted the company with a 7  allocation 
   The other short today is BJ s Restaurants  BJRI   which reported EPS and revenue misses last month along with sluggish same store sales  Yet  shares of this casual dining restaurant company are up 10  since election day  Jeremy doesn t think this will hold either  so he shorted it with a 4  allocation  Read the complete commentary for a lot more on both of today s moves in Zacks Counterstrike 
  Options Trader wants to get into semiconductors  and Kevin found two ways to do it  First up  the editor bought to open an April 75 00 Call in Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN   which is a global semiconductor company with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a Zacks VGM Score of B  It is also in the top 8  of the Zacks Industry Rank  TXN is hanging around  74 right now  but Kevin s price target is  85  He plans to increase the position on a pullback or an upside breakout from here 
The portfolio also added a bull call spread in Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  to diversify its semiconductor play  This company focuses on semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment  which means its part of a space in the top 4     of the Zacks Industry Rank  It is also a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  with a Zacks VGM Score of A  Kevin bought to open an April 30 00 Call AND sold to open an April 35 00 Call  If it gets to  35 or higher by the April expiration  the spread will bring an increase of 122   Like TXN  the editor plans to add to the position on a pullback or an upside breakout from here  Read the complete commentary for more on these moves 
  As mentioned above  all of the outgoing stocks in this week s adjustment for Black Box Trader were profitable  The four new names replacing these winners are Chico s FAS  CHS   FedEx Corp   NYSE FDX   LPL Financial  LPLA  and MasTec Inc   MTZ   Read the Black Box Trader s Guide to learn more about this computer driven service designed to take the emotion out of investing    The media is doing its best to scare investors over the supposed decline in holiday shopping this past weekend  However  I tell you emphatically that investors should buy retailers with both fists after Monday s unnecessary drop  You see  the shape of holiday shopping changes every year  That is because each year there is a dance with consumers deciding whether to go to the stores or just buy online  Or whether to wait a bit longer for deeper discounts  But truly I tell you there is no reason to sweat ANY of these details  All you need to know is that the American consumer will spend whatever money they have come the holidays  This is as much a tradition as football and turkey for Thanksgiving   said Steve in Reitmeister Trading Alert  which is overweight the group with retail plays in Burlington Stores  BURL   Dick s Sporting Goods  DKS  and Foot Locker  NYSE FL

136188,357703,SYY,United Natural  UNFI  Q1 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"United Natural Foods  Inc    NASDAQ UNFI   is set to report first quarter fiscal 2017 results after the market closes on Dec 7  Last quarter  this food products manufacturer posted a positive surprise of 12 90  
In fact  the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in three out of the last four trailing quarters  making for an average positive surprise of 5 36  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement UTD NATURAL FDS Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Factors to Consider
United Natural s productivity initiatives  improved operational efficiency  acquisitions and continuous increase in demand for organic and natural food products have been the strength of the company  In the past 12 months  the company has acquired four exciting and uniquely positioned companies including Haddon House specialty foods  Global Organic  Nor Cal and Gourmet Guru  With these companies  United Natural is now positioned as a large national provider of fresh produce  proteins  bakery  deli  specialty and natural products 
Though encouraged by consumers  increasing demand for organic products  driven by a healthy lifestyle  food safety and environmental sustainability  we cannot ignore the fact that the company has been struggling from continued weakness in gross margin over the past many quarters  This is due to a shift in customer mix to lower margin supermarkets channel  The company s recent acquisitions  despite being accretive to the top line  put pressure on margins 
Further  we note that the grocery supermarket business is grappling with food deflation  stiff competition  aggressive promotional environment and waning store traffic  These headwinds have resulted in a sharp decline in share price of major food grocers like The Kroger Co    NYSE KR    Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM   Inc   Supervalu  Sprouts Farmers Market as well as United Natural  An oversupply in some types of food    particularly meat  poultry and dairy    has dragged prices lower and forced grocery stores into more aggressive promotions 
The price wars between companies are eating up profits  resulting in a further decline in margins in the near term 
Though the share price of United Natural has been outperforming other companies in the space like Campbell  Kellogg  and J M  Smucker  its gross margin is declining and is far below these companies 
 

 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that United Natural is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The ESP for United Natural is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 62 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  United Natural has a Zacks Rank  3  However  the favorable rank when combined with a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 and  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Stocks in the consumer staples retail sector that have both a positive earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include 
Sysco Corp    NYSE SYY   with an Earnings ESP of  1 89  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see

136189,357704,SYY,Why You Should Hold On To Tyson Foods  TSN  Stock For Now,opinion,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that offer solid prospects and selling those that appear risky  Again  at times it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions 
Meat processor Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   seems to be one such stock that investors need to hold on to if they are looking to reap long term gains even though the stock is plagued by several headwinds at the moment   However  these concerns are short term and transitory in nature and still keeps space for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company to rebound in the long run 
Further  Tyson s stock price history reveals that the company hasn t been a disappointment in a long time  In fact  so far this year  the shares of this meat processor have risen 5 3   outperforming the Zacks Categorized Food Meat Products Market  which has showcased a decline of 5 3   Let s delve deeper and bring what s hidden to the surface 

Concerns Remain
Tyson Foods has been witnessing soft results in the Beef  Chicken and Prepared Foods segments  Lower cattle supply and higher fed cattle costs have been responsible for the sluggishness  Moreover  the company decided to reduce its beef production capacity in response to lower cattle supply 
The chicken segment is also facing several transitory headwinds of late  The company was unable to respond to demand fluctuations  which resulted in higher cost to the company  Moreover  higher soybean meal input cost has been denting margins in the sector 
These headwinds have resulted in Tyson Foods  top and bottom line failing to meet Zacks Consensus Estimate for the recently reported fourth quarter fiscal 2016  While earnings missed the consensus mark by 22 6   sales lagged by 1 6  
Underlying Growth Drivers
Tyson continuously innovates and adds products to an already rich food lineup  As an increasing number of health conscious U S  consumers are focusing on nutritious breakfasts  Tyson considers it a high potential category  Launches like  Day Starts  breakfast sandwiches  Hillshire Farm American Craft line of smoked sausage and Chef Pierre Luxe Layer pies have received good response from consumers TYSON FOODS A Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   Moreover  the addition of Individually Quick Frozen  IQF  products has further augmented Tyson s 100  antibiotic free NatureRaised Farms brand which is keeping in view the increased health consciousness among customers and their choice of nutritional food items  Additionally  the company is striving to eliminate the use of human antibiotics from its U S  broiler chicken flocks by the end of Sep 2017 
The strong fundamentals of the company have resulted in significant upward revision of estimates for the first quarter fiscal 2017  The stock s long term earnings per share growth rate is 11  and it carries a VGM Score of  A  
We expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat even amid difficult times  Hence  we suggest investors to hold on to the stock as the rest is a wait and watch story 
Other Stock Picks
Some better ranked stocks in the broader consumer staple sector include Sanderson Farms Inc    NASDAQ SAFM    Hormel Foods Corp    NYSE HRL   and Sysco Corp    NYSE SYY   
Sanderson Farms sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has an expected earnings growth rate of 5   You can see

136210,357725,SYY,5 Stocks To Watch Before The Market Opens On Monday,opinion,"ARIAD Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ARIA   Ariad has seen estimates edging significantly higher leading into its third quarter report  with expectations now reflecting a 49  increase on the bottom line and 56  on the top  It s recent success has rewarded shareholders with the stock up 40  in 2016  Shares were up well over 100  until this past month s sell off into the election  Investor s focus will be primarily on its core leukemia treatment  Iclusig  which currently generates a majority of total revenue 
Continued demand for the drug  along with expansion into new territories  will help support the top line  In addition to increased traction in domestic markets  Iclusig was recently approved in Japan which is expected to increase exposure and provide a new layer of revenue for this very successful drug  The only downside to its recent success comes from an over reliance on one particular drug  Many pharmaceutical companies often have a robust pipeline and catalogue of treatments to offset any losses when its other treatments struggle 
Sysco Corp  NYSE SYY   Sysco has made significant strides in recent quarters on the back of continued acquisitions and efforts to diversify and strengthen its product portfolio  Its efforts appear to be paying off  as the second quarter delivered a robust 23  increase on the bottom line and 10  on the top  Strong sales can be attributed to its success as a major supplier of organic and healthy foods across major markets  This will likely continue when the company reports earnings Monday morning but margins could start to tick down  Food cost deflation along with unfavorable currency headwinds is likely to result in weaker margins and softer earnings growth  The deflationary trend is reflected in current estimates that are calling for about 15  growth 
Dean Foods  NYSE DF   Dean Foods  recent focus on price realization  cost productivity and creating a balance between price and volume is expected to deliver strong returns despite industry wide headwinds  Analysts are expecting this to lead to a 29  increase in earnings but a 4  decline in sales  The top line is more likely to be impacted by the broader pullback from processed and unhealthy to organic and high quality ingredients  Shares have been on the up this month after news broker that the company was fielding takeover bids  Any hints of chatter surrounding sales during the company s conference call will overshadow the outcome  good or bad  of the earnings results 
Lending Club  NYSE LC   Lending Club was one of the earliest pioneers of what we are now calling fintech but it is now also the first company in the space to come under regulatory scrutiny due to questionable business practices  This hiccup may not have a long lasting impact on financial performance but it certainly dented share prices and brand reputation  Shares are down 55  in 2016 heading into what s expected to be a lackluster third quarter report  Heavy marketing investments and rising expenses related to attracted users is likely the biggest threat to margin growth  Lending Club posted a loss in the second quarter and is projected to do the same in the third  marking two consecutive quarters of unprofitability  The top line is unfortunately trending down as well with current estimates forecasting a 10  decline from a year earlier 
MGM Resorts International  NYSE MGM   Travel trends have picked up this earnings season beginning with strong results from airlines and continuing with better than expected results from Las Vegas Sands this week  Major hotels are lined up to report next week with expectations edging higher on improving industry trends  MGM in particular is expected to report a beat Monday morning from higher demand at its Las Vegas resorts  Strong employment and increased tourism has been largely credited with this surge during the third quarter  Near term headwinds include potential struggles in Macau gaming  despite some promising reports that the region is improving ",2016-11-06,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-before-the-market-opens-on-monday-200162950,200162950

136213,357728,SYY,All Eye On Election Results,opinion,"To say the outcome of the 2016 General Election in the U S  is highly anticipated is to woefully understate matters  Not only the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump for the presidency  but down ticket to decide which party   Democrat or Republican   will control the Senate  the House is solidly Republican  will have much to do with how the markets will anticipate future U S  policy  economic and otherwise 
	For months  a Clinton victory had been baked in the cake  A near double digit lead for most of the summer kept the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  at historically low levels  but as the months moved on the race has tightened  sending the VIX higher as the prospects of Trump s chances increased  Not only because Clinton s economic policies appear to be generally in line with those of President Obama  who will have served two full terms  but that Trump s proposed policies often veer from traditional Republican  GOP  interests 
	The Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  comes to mind  which solidifies trade agreements between the U S   China and other countries of the Far East  Even though Clinton has also voiced disapproval of the TPP  this has been viewed by political analysts as a campaign tactic to keep supporters of anti TPP Democratic Socialist   Clinton s primary competitor   Senator Bernie Sanders from abandoning the Democratic nominee  Trump  on the other hand  has vowed to  get tough  with China from the earliest days of his campaign  most of these same analysts expect Trump to enter into a trade war with China  which would spike volatility and generate lots of near term uncertainty 
	Key to tomorrow s election is whether or not the Senate might swing to Democratic control  giving the gavel of the Senate Budget Committee to Sanders and additional empowerment to Sen  Elizabeth Warren  whose tough rhetoric about Wall Street  excesses  had been a hallmark of a more visible left wing of the Federal level this campaign season  The market traditionally prefers gridlock anyhow  as long as progress moves slow enough for the Street to digest   or not move at all  even better   the market can minimize their projections of economic uncertainty 
	After nine straight down sessions of the S P 500   the most in nearly 36 years   we see futures bouncing back  bigly  this morning  S P futures are  30  the Dow  260 and the Nasdaq  76  With a mini saga over the past week and a half involving CIA Director James Comey and Clinton s emails when she serves as Secretary of State now having been resolved  although we still have 24 hours for some additional  news  to grab headlines   the odds of a Clinton victory appear to be again growing  That said  this race remains tight  and most analysts do not expect a clear victor to emerge until after the polls close tomorrow  at the earliest

136248,357763,SYY,Consumer Staples Tumbles  5 Stocks Still Worth Buying ,opinion,"The consumer staples sector  which has been performing well over the past few months buoyed by rising consumer confidence and improving economy  fell 0 9  yesterday  The disappointing ISM manufacturing and services indexes readings and soft jobs data in August may have triggered the decline which also left investors pondering about the economy s recovery 
Factors Leading to the Dip
Per Wall Street Journal  the U S  factory sector showed contraction in August  highlighting manufacturers  struggles and a broader drag on the economy from weak business spending and an uncertain global outlook  The U S  service sector index also sank to its lowest level in August in more than six years  Additionally  the U S  economy created a total of 151 000 jobs in August  considerably lower than the consensus estimate of 179 000 
The release of the Federal Reserve s Beige Book  which is a key indicator of the U S  economic health and a critical tool for the Fed in decision making  also unnerved investors about a possible rate hike in September 
The Beige Book indicated moderate wage growth in the coming months  one of the key conditions set by the Fed for considering an interest rate hike  raising concerns among investors  thereby leading to a decline in the consumer staples index 
While uncertainty over the timing of the rate hike still persists and investors should wait for the central bank policy meetings  we know for sure that such worries are short lived and the economy remains stable despite the recent trend of disappointing data 
Economy Remains Stable
According to comments from San Francisco Fed President John Williams  the economy is doing well and the employment level will improve next year  He said that unemployment is likely to drop from the current level of 4 9  to 4 5  next year  Williams also believes that inflation will achieve the Fed s target of 2  within the next two years 
Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fisher is also optimistic about the state of the economy  Fisher said that the labor market was extremely close to full employment levels 
Lower gas prices and strong labor market also helped increase household wealth  which eventually boosted consumer spending 
Consumer Confidence Surges
Consumer confidence   a key determinant of the economy s health   surged during the month of August  indicating that the economy is on the recovery path after a dismal show during the first half of the year 
In August  consumer confidence surged to its highest level in 11 months  The  index increased 4 4 points to 101 1  well above the expected level of 97 4  Additionally  the expectations index increased to 86 4  but remained below the highest level achieved since the end of the 2008 recession 
Buildup of Bullish Data
Housing data released in August was also encouraging owing to favorable durable goods and industrial production  The only disappointment was the Department of Commerce s second estimate for second quarter GDP  Though GDP growth of 1 1  in the second quarter improved from first quarter s 0 8  growth  it was down a tenth of a percent from the initial reading 
Despite sluggish GDP  household consumption increased on an annualized basis of 4 4   higher than the rate of 4 2  estimated earlier 
Hence  there is enough evidence that the economic picture may rebound in the third quarter  owing to improved residential construction and strong labor market conditions 
The Winning Strategy
Investing in the consumer staples stocks is safe because of their defensive nature  Surging consumer confidence and indications that the economy is poised to grow stronger in the second half of the year  is also making the consumer staples sector attractive  In fact  consumer staples stocks have the potential to face headwinds from Brexit aftershocks  the Federal Reserve s still pending decision over the rate hike  currency headwinds and other global growth issues 
This is why it may be a good idea to pick consumer related stocks at this point  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult 
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score 
We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a VGM Score of  A  combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
These stocks certainly have bright prospects to ride out the impending volatility

136250,357765,SYY,4 Low Beta Consumer Staples Stocks For A Risky October,opinion,"The month of September was quite volatile for investors and ended with turbulent events like the debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton for the U S  Presidential election 2016  along with a sudden surge in oil prices  Meanwhile  uncertainties surrounding the Fed rate hike are expected to aggravate the concerns 
Elections to Spur Volatility
Elections have traditionally been a significant driver of stock market volatility and this time too  it will be no different  The first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump for the White House that occurred last week was quite a heated one  and included discussions about various sectors  alongside some sensitive topics  As a result  investors must gear up for an extremely volatile October ahead of the Presidential elections 
Surge in Oil Prices
Recently  the members of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  decided to curb the output for the first time in eight years  which led to a rebound in oil prices  in turn having a mixed effect on the global economy  While the energy sector got a boost from the news  the surge in oil prices hurt the airline and consumers stocks 
A rise in gas prices is always a pain for consumers  who change their spending pattern accordingly  They become more cautious and try to curb non essential spending  such as dining out or going for a vacation 
Further  with the stage all set for the third quarter earnings season  investors  anxiety is at its peak as to how the quarter will unfold amid mixed economic data  thus fueling market speculations 
The Winning Strategy
Amid such a backdrop  investing in the consumer staples stocks is safe because of their defensive nature  The consumer staples sector has managed to perform fairly well in the past few months  buoyed by rising consumer confidence and an improving economy 
Consumer confidence   a key determinant of the economy s health   surged for the second consecutive month in September and is now at its highest level since the recession  indicating that the economy is on the recovery path  The consumer confidence index  which had increased to 101 8 in August  further improved in September and now stands at 104 1  The index surged as consumers expect a positive view of the labor market  Given an improving labor market  we expect consumer spending to pick up 
Though experts believe the economy is reviving  low risk investors should be very careful about their strategy 
Safeguard Your Portfolio
A time tested way to earn stable returns in the face of prevailing economic conditions is to invest in low beta stocks  Beta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset in comparison to the market  In other words  beta measures the extent of a security s price movement relative to the market  So  investors should go with low beta stocks  which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in  In this case  a low beta ranges from 0 to 1 
We have selected four low beta consumer staples stocks  beta less than 0 75  that boast a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   The search was also narrowed down with a  of  A  
Value stocks offer an opportunity to buy a stock that is currently undervalued by the market  We think investing in these stocks could actually be a safer bet  given their inclination for steady growth and momentum in price

Strong Q4 Results
The global food products maker and distributor posted better than expected fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 earnings  Its focus on acquisitions and margin improvement probably resulted in the beat  However  revenues marginally missed expectations in both the periods 
Adjusted earnings  excluding restructuring and merger related costs  of 64 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents by 6 7  and were up 23 1  year over year  Growth in sales  expense management and improved gross and operating margin led to the growth  On a constant currency basis  earnings increased 15 4  to 60 cents SYSCO CORP Price and Consensus   Gross margin improved 44 basis points  bps  to 18 3  due to the company s ongoing growth strategy  which focuses on accelerating sales  reducing costs and mitigating ongoing gross margin pressure  Adjusted operating margin improved 50 bps to 4 6  
Food cost deflation was 1 2 as the company witnessed deflation in the meat and dairy categories  partially offset by modest inflation in other categories 
Sysco s sales of  13 65 billion marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  13 71 billion by 0 4   and increased 10  on a year over year basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  as strong volume growth was offset by unfavorable currency impact of 0 5   Excluding currency  sales increased 2 2  in the fourth quarter 
Sales from acquisitions completed within the last 12 months increased sales by 1 2  in the quarter  The company s sales have improved consistently driven by acquisitions  Though the termination of the long awaited US Foods merger in June was a disappointment  the company remains positive on the acquisition front 
We believe that the company s consistent initiatives to improve sales through acquisitions and volume growth will boost earnings in the near term  offsetting the impact of food cost deflation

Consumer Stock Earnings Around the Corner

	The second quarter earnings season  or the quarter ended Jun 30  2016  is on its last leg  With almost 92 1  of S P 500 companies already having reported their quarterly results the overall earnings picture is becoming clearer 

	Per the Zacks   the quarter saw a 3 7  decrease in earnings due to a 0 7  dip in revenues  both on a year over year basis  The Q2 2016 is the fifth quarter in a row to display a declining trend in earnings 

	Nevertheless  we note a sequential improvement in earnings  Interestingly  this quarter is witnessing positive revenue growth and is currently reversing the trend displayed in the preceding quarter  Almost 71 1  of the companies surpassed earnings estimates  while 52 9  outpaced top line expectations in the second quarter 

	The second quarter earnings season is critical for investors to ascertain the most attractive picks as the market has somewhat stabilized after Brexit  which shook the global economy in Jun 2016  Post Brexit  investors became jittery and have been resorting to safe haven stocks 

	In this scenario  the consumer sector might be quite reliable  So far  the consumer sector has reported modest results this quarter 

	As of Aug 10  2016  80 6  companies from the consumer staples sector enlisted in the S P 500 index have reported second quarter earnings  Out of these  72  of the companies have posted an earnings beat  while 52  surpassed revenue estimates  Leading firms from the industry like The Hershey s Company     are among the ones that delivered modest Q2 earnings despite currency headwinds and sluggishness in emerging markets 

	In the consumer discretionary sector  94 3  of the companies have reported earnings  Out of these  87 9  topped earnings estimates and 52  surpassed revenue expectations  Consumer discretionary stocks like Coach  Inc      reported decent Q2 earnings backed by higher revenues and margins  

	With the current earnings cycle drawing to a close  some more companies are scheduled to report their financial results this week  Let s take a look at how some of these companies might fare 

Sysco Corporation      is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results before the opening bell on Aug 15  The  for Sysco is 0 00  and the company holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Though stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2 or 3  Hold  have a higher chance on beating on earnings  the company s 0 00  Earnings ESP complicates surprise prediction 

	Last quarter  this global food products maker and distributor posted a positive earnings surprise of 9 52   The company beat earnings estimates in two quarters and reported in line earnings in the remaining two with an average positive surprise of 6 65  in the last four quarters 

	The company s strong business portfolio and strategic acquisitions have been driving growth  Encouragingly  Sysco delivered higher gross margins in the past one year period after witnessing declining gross margins in the last two fiscal years  The company s growth strategy seems to be paying off and its efforts to boost sales and margins are likely to have a favorable impact on its results in the to be reported quarter  However  Sysco expects food cost deflation and currency translation to adversely affect fiscal fourth quarter results  The company believes that deflation headwinds will persist in the fiscal fourth quarter as well  which will limit earnings growth   Read    

   

Burcon Nutrascience Corporation    is set to report first quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 12  The company carries a Zacks Rank  3 but has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   In spite of the company s favorable Zacks Rank  the surprise prediction is complicated by its 0 00  Earnings ESP  Burcon Nutrascience reported a positive earnings surprise of 40 00  in the preceding quarter and an average positive surprise of 30 00  for the trailing four quarters  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at a loss 5 cents per share for the fiscal first quarter 

   

Barfresh Food Group Inc      is set to report second quarter 2016results on Aug 15  The company carries a Zacks Rank  3 but has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   The company has a favorable Zacks Rank but its 0 00  Earnings ESP renders surprise prediction inconclusive  It reported in line results in the preceding quarter and an average negative surprise of 16 67  for the trailing four quarters  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at a loss 3 cents per share for the second quarter

Adjusted earnings  excluding restructuring and merger related costs  of 64 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents by 6 7  and were up 23 1  year over year  Growth in sales  expense management and improved gross and operating margin led to the growth  On a constant currency basis  earnings increased 15 4  to 60 cents 
Quarter in Detail
Sysco s sales of  13 65 billion marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  13 71 billion by 0 4   and increased 10 0  on a year over year basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  as strong volume growth was offset by unfavorable currency impact of 0 5   Case volume for the company s U S  Broadline operations grew 10 2   while local case growth within U S  Broadline operations grew 10 3   Acquisitions contributed 1 2  to sales growth 
Excluding currency  sales increased 2 2  in the fourth quarter 
Gross profit improved 12 7  to  2 5 billion in the quarter  while gross margin improved 44 basis points  bps  to 18 3  due to the company s ongoing growth strategy  which focuses on accelerating sales  reducing costs and mitigating ongoing gross margin pressure  Excluding currency  gross profit increased 4 7  
Adjusted operating income also increased 23 4  in the quarter to  628 million despite a 9 6  increase in adjusted operating expenses  Adjusted operating margin improved 50 bps to 4 6  
Food cost deflation was 1 2 as the company witnessed deflation in the meat and dairy categories  partially offset by modest inflation in other categories SYSCO CORP Price and Consensus   Fiscal 2016 Results
In fiscal 2016  adjusted earnings increased 14 1  to  2 10 per share  Earnings also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 03 per share by 3 4   On a constant currency basis  earnings increased 12

Our Take
We are impressed by the fact that Sysco has delivered higher gross margins for the last five consecutive quarters  after witnessing declining gross margins since the last two fiscal years due to multiple factors  It seems that the company s growth strategy is paying off and its efforts to boost sales and margins are bearing fruits 
The company s sales have also improved consistently driven by acquisitions and volume growth  However  the company expects earnings to remain under pressure due to currency headwinds and food cost deflation

136346,357861,SYY,A Common Sense Approach To Long Term Investing Success ,opinion,"Introduction
In order to understand what the intrinsic value or fair value of a common stock is  you must think like a long term business owner and not like a stock trader  Additionally  you must think like a business owner that has no intention of selling their business  Put another way  your business generates your livelihood  Therefore  your primary focus and attention is on answering the question  how s business 
When you own your own business you care about sales  cash flows and ultimately net profits  These are the things that make your business valuable to you simply because these are the things that produce your income 
Valuation is a Mathematical Principle and Not a Vague Concept
When I speak of valuation  I am referring to the mathematical calculation of the returns  including both capital appreciation and dividend income  which you could prudently expect to earn from the company s cash flows  earnings   Those returns should be large enough to compensate you more than you could earn from a theoretically riskless investment like a Treasury bond  If you are not being compensated for the extra risk you re taking by investing in stocks  then I believe you are paying more than you should be 
 Price Is What You Pay  Value Is What You Get 
The venerable investor Warren Buffett has a real knack of putting complex concepts and ideas into simple and easily understood terms  In my opinion  his quote   Price is what you pay  Value is what you get  is one of the more profound and important statements he has ever uttered  If truly understood  these simple words represent perhaps some of the most important bits of investment wisdom that an investor in common stocks could ever receive 
The concept of fair valuation represents the key to receiving the full benefit that these wise words provide  Knowing the price you pay is simple and straightforward  And  although many have an intuitive understanding of value  its deeper meaning is often only vaguely comprehended  Anyone who has truly made the effort to study Warren Buffett s investment philosophy understands that receiving value on the money he invests is of high importance to him 
So how do you know  when buying a stock  if you re getting value or not for your money  I contend that the answer lies in the amount of cash flow  earnings  that the business you purchase is capable of generating on your behalf  And regardless of how much cash flow the business can generate for you  its value to you will be greatly impacted by the price you pay to obtain it  If you pay too much you get very little value  but if you pay too little then the value you receive is greatly increased 
Therefore  if value is what you re looking for  then it s important that your attention be placed on the potential cash flows that you re expecting to receive  Unfortunately  few investors possess the presence of mind to focus on this critical element  Instead  investor attention is more commonly and intensely placed on stock price and its movement  A rising stock price is usually considered to be good  and a falling stock price is considered bad  However  prudent investors understand  recognize and acknowledge that the stock market often incorrectly prices the stock behind a business relative to its intrinsic value 
Another investing great offered his view on this important point  

 Just because you buy a stock and it goes up does not mean you are right  Just because you buy a stock and it goes down does not mean you are wrong     Peter Lynch  One Up On Wall Street 

Just like the Warren Buffett quote  Peter Lynch s quote is also based on the principle of sound valuation  The point is that a rising stock may be dangerously overvalued  while a falling stock price may indicate that the company is becoming a rare opportunity on sale 
Knowing the difference will materially impact not only the long term rate of return the investor receives  but perhaps more importantly  the risk they are taking to get it  As I will illustrate later  you can dramatically overpay for even the best company  It is a truism that the stock market can  and will  inaccurately appraise the value of a business from time to time   up or down 
From what has been said so far  it should be clear that in order to receive value  you have to know how to calculate value  Then  and only then  can you be absolutely certain that you re investing in a stock and receiving value for the price you pay  However  there is an important caveat that needs to be introduced 
Just because you buy a stock at value doesn t necessarily mean that you will receive a high return  This is because value  although important  is only one component of future return  The other important component is the earnings growth rate of the business 
To clarify  you can buy a slow growing company at sound valuation  and even at the same valuation as a faster growing company  while still earning only a modest rate of return  In fact  it could be argued that only being willing to invest at sound valuation is more critical for a slow grower than it is for a faster grower 
The rationale here is that there is very little margin for error when investing in a low growth security  Therefore  it s even more imperative that you get valuation correct  This may be one of the most confusing aspects of fair valuation  or value  that I will elaborate on later 
The Foundational Principles of Value
What gives a business  stock  value  Ultimately  any business  public or private  has its value derived from the amount of cash flow it is capable of generating for its stakeholders  stockholders   Not only will capital appreciation depend on the level of earnings  dividends are also a function of earnings  It is because of this principle that the discounted cash flow  DCF  method of valuing a business is so widely accepted by scholars and professional investors  Consequently  this article on how to value a business is strongly based on utilizing fundamental valuations based on cash flows  earnings  as the primary method for assessing fair value or True Worth  as I like to think of it as 
However  I intend to spare the reader the tedious task of evaluating or calculating long and complex mathematical formulas in order to assess fair valuation  Instead  I will focus on presenting logical explanations and straightforward discussions of the principles behind these important valuation methods  Additionally  I will provide what I hope the reader finds as easy to understand pictures as evidence supporting my points  Anyone who is interested in a more scholarly approach can simply Google  How to value a company using the discounted cash flow method  DCF  
I believe investors can possess a practical and useful understanding of the basic principles of fair value  In order to receive value when you buy a stock  you have to be careful that you are only paying a price that represents sound valuation  Fair valuation is only manifest when your investment in a business is supported by a strong foundation of fundamentals  These would include  but are not limited to  strong cash flow and earnings generation supported by a proven business model with prospects for continued growth 
Furthermore  the terms  value  and  valuation  though not synonymous  are very closely related  I am going to do my best to illustrate that the investor can only get value when buying a stock if they apply the discipline of sound valuation when they initially invest 
In other words  when the price you pay is at a level that equals sound valuation  then good value is what you will receive  As previously suggested  if you overpay your value will be less  and if you re fortunate enough to buy on the cheap  your long term value will be enhanced 
Calculating Intrinsic Value with Zero Growth  Moderate Growth and Low Growth
Let s start by looking at sound valuation from the perspective of minimum to maximum levels based on rates of growth  The reader should understand that much of what I will present next represents an overly simplistic view of valuation  However  I believe that this is the best way to lay a sound foundation of understanding of this important investing principle 
There will be subtle calibrations that investors need to apply when actually making investments in real world situations  On the other hand  the core principle will aptly apply and hold true  Let s initially look at how you would value a future stream of income that doesn t grow  A 10 year Treasury bond would represent a good proxy to illustrate this principle  The interest rate is fixed and guaranteed  but it does not grow 
Common sense and logic would dictate that you would never be able to buy a Treasury bond at one times its interest  In other words  a stream of income has an intrinsic value that is some multiple of its annual income stream  In order to calculate current valuation  you simply divide the interest rate it pays into its price  With 10 year Treasuries yielding approximately 2 2  today  you divide 2 2  the rate  into 100  the price  and discover that it is selling at approximately 45   times interest 
Historically  this is a very high price  which means that yields are also historically low  Therefore  people  possibly still traumatized by the Great Recession  are buying Treasury bonds today because they are willing to pay the high price for the safety they perceive they are receiving  Under more normal levels of interest rates  10 year Treasury bonds have been more typically offered at yields of 6  to 8   Do the division and this calculates to valuations of approximately 12 to 17 times interest  Nevertheless  any investment has a value that is greater than its annual income stream  but investors should understand there are rational limits to the multiple you pay for an income stream that should not be exceeded 
Common stocks are certainly not as safe as Treasury bonds  however  the principles behind sound valuation still apply  In other words  as long as a company generates an income stream  even if it doesn t grow  it will have value that is greater than its annual income stream  Otherwise  this no growth investment would be generating cash on cash returns of 100   Clearly  this would be illogical  Consequently  just like a Treasury bond trades at a multiple of interest  a common stock will trade at a multiple of its income stream which is generally represented as earnings  It is commonly expressed as a P E ratio 
The reason I started with looking at a safe but no growth fixed income vehicle was to establish the minimum foundation of valuation  Historically  the average price earnings ratio that has been applied to the average company  the S P 500  for the past 200 years has been approximately within a range of 15 16  This calculates to an earnings yield of approximately 6 to 7   
I do not believe it is a coincidence that this also represents the long term average return that stocks have produced  In order to keep my promise of keeping it simple  I additionally point out that this valuation calculation also relates to normal fixed income yields of 6  to 8  as discussed above 
Most importantly  this 15 P E multiple should be thought of as a barometer used as the starting point for valuation calculations and not an absolute number  However  this helps explain why my three examples presented below  each with different earnings growth rates  have approximately the same fair value PE of 15 
Utilizing the fundamentals analyzer software tool  my first example will review the low growth utility stock SCANA Corp  NYSE SCG   In order to illustrate the low rate of earnings growth that SCANA and utility stocks in general grow at  I am utilizing the logarithmic option of the research tool  This first graph plots SCANA s earnings only since 1997  The orange line on the graph represents a P E ratio of 15 which  as discussed above  I offer as a proxy of fair value for a company growing earnings at 3 2  per annum 
As I will introduce next  when stock prices are overlaid on the graph we should see a high correlation between price and earnings   if my thesis has any merit  In other words  we should see the price tracking the earnings line and we should also see evidence of fair valuation  overvaluation and undervaluation manifesting from time to time  More plainly stated  if the price is touching the orange line the company s stock is fairly valued  if the price is above the orange line the company s stock is overvalued  and when the price is below the orange line it is undervalued 

This next graph on SCANA is presented arithmetically because I also include dividends represented in two forms  The light green shaded area above the orange line represents dividends after they have been paid to shareholders  The second iteration of dividends is the white line  it s actually honeydew green  that represents those same dividends as part of earnings  the dark green shaded area  prior to being paid to shareholders 
What I am asking the reader to focus on is how monthly closing stock prices  the black line  over this timeframe have closely tracked the company s earnings at a P E ratio of 15  the orange line   Also notice what happened every time the price fell below or above the orange P E ratio of 15  These times represent vivid depictions of overvaluation  undervaluation and how price inevitably returns to fair valuation 

When examining SCANA s performance over this time period notice how capital appreciation and earnings growth are in close alignment  Also notice the contribution of dividends to total return 

With my next example I present the Dividend Champion ABM industries Incorporated  NYSE ABM   a company that has increased its dividend for 48 consecutive years  This particular example has grown earnings at the average rate of 6 5  since 1996  or approximately twice as fast as we saw with our SCANA example  Nevertheless  we draw the orange valuation reference line utilizing the same fair value P E ratio of 15 
Without presenting a long and detailed explanation  the fair value P E ratio of 15 represents a sound proxy of fair valuation for companies with earnings growth ranging from 0  15   Here I again ask that the reader keeps in mind that the fair value P E ratio of 15 should be thought of as a valuation reference and not an absolute 
The primary principle that supports this valuation level is the fact that a P E ratio of 15 represents an earnings yield of approximately 6 7   which as previously stated  is also the common long term return that stocks on average have generated  I also ask that the reader remembers that fair value is only one component of potential future returns  The second important component is the earnings growth rate that a given company achieves 
To be clear  even though I am arguing that both SCANA and ABM Industries are fairly valued at a P E ratio of 15  this only establishes the principle of sound valuation  In other words  even though both companies are theoretically fairly valued at a P E ratio of 15  ABM Industries is likely to generate a higher level of capital appreciation due to its faster earnings growth rate  In this regard  and as I previously suggested  fair valuation is more representative of a reasonable level of risk based on current valuation than it is on generating a higher long term return 
Most importantly  I chose this ABM example because it also clearly validates my previous statement that the market will incorrectly price a company s stock from time to time  If you analyze the following earnings and price correlated graph closely  you will see that over the long run stock price does follow earnings  However  you will also see numerous periods of significant overvaluation  when the price is disconnected from and above the orange line  
But most importantly  these periods of significant overvaluation also vividly represent the risk I discussed above  and supports the principle that price inevitably moves back into alignment with fair value  Of course  the same principle applies on the few times that ABM s stock price became temporarily undervalued  Furthermore  this illustrates the important principle that fair valuation is not related to market timing  Instead  fair valuation is a principal of soundness supported by a foundation of fundamental values based on earnings and cash flows 

Examining the long term performance of ABM Industries we again see a high correlation between earnings growth and capital appreciation  Note that the reason that capital appreciation is greater than earnings growth is because the company is currently overvalued 

How Do You Account for PE Ratios Below 15 
Anytime you come across a company whose price earnings ratio is less than 15  which I have described as a foundational P E ratio in this article  it s usually associated with uncertainty  A current P E ratio below 15 might possibly imply a concern that future earnings are expected to be less than current levels  In other words  this could mean that you are paying a higher P E ratio for these expected lower future earnings 
For example  let s assume you buy a dollar s worth of earnings today and pay  15  or a PE ratio of 15  One year later  the dollar s worth of earnings you paid  15 for today have fallen to only   50 worth of earnings  Therefore  you have paid a P E ratio of 30 for those lower future earnings  Consequently  we might assume that the market may have been acting as a discounting mechanism  or as suggested  just mispricing the company 
Other uncertainties that could cause chronic low P E ratios below the standard P E ratio of 15 could relate to quality considerations  There are also certain sectors  the energy sector comes to mind  where the market routinely applies a lower valuation  Of course  as previously stated  uncertainty is usually associated with those lower than justified valuations  Additionally  a P E ratio below 15 may just be an example of the market undervaluing the company  as I pointed out earlier in this article 
Calculating Fair Value on Fast Growing Companies  15  Or Better 
Thus far I have attempted to lay the foundation of understanding how to value a common stock  So far I have presented low to moderate earnings growth examples and commented on collapsing earnings which really have no value  Next I will look at companies that grow earnings at 15  or greater as I investigate the nuances of valuating this faster growth 
Extensive research over many years has led me to conclude that a P E ratio equal to a company s earnings growth rate  P E EPS growth  is more appropriate for companies that grow at faster rates  In Chapter 7 of his best selling book One Up On Wall Street  the renowned investor Peter Lynch identified six general categories of common stocks  slow growers  stalwarts  fast growers  cyclicals  asset plays and turnarounds  This part of this article will focus on the fast grower category 
My definition of a fast grower is one that has consistently compounded earnings at 15  per annum or better over extended periods of time  five years or longer   Furthermore  the more consistent the growth has been  the better it fits my definition of a high growth stock 
This category of fast grower  Peter Lynch referred to as  superstocks  that he contended deserve the most attention from investors  The reason he believed they deserved the most attention  is because these are the stocks that will generate the highest total returns over the long run  Assuming of course you invest in them at fair value  Companies with these attributes are what Peter hunted for when he was seeking his  10 baggers  because he believed these were the most explosive stocks 
MasterCard Incorporated  NYSE MA  represents a classic example of a fast growing company  stock   Earnings growth since it went public in May 2006 has averaged 26 8   Therefore  consistent with the P E ratio equal to the company s earnings growth rate formula  the orange line on the graph represents a fair value P E ratio of 26 8 for this faster grower  Fair value for this high growth company is significantly higher than what we saw with our previous examples because of the compounding power of its faster earnings growth 
Once again  utilizing this as a valuation reference  we see that stock price  the black line  follows earnings  and we also see periods of time where the stock is undervalued relative to the business as well as times when the stock is overvalued relative to the business 

When you examine the performance associated with the above graph you see a vivid example of a  superstock  like the venerable Peter Lynch looked for  Even though the fair value P E ratio for this example is almost twice as high as the foundational fair value P E ratio of 15 seen in our previous examples  the earnings growth and long term shareholder returns justifies it 

As a bonus  I have prepared a free  which provides a more in depth and detailed look at fair valuation and why it s important  
Summary
Previously I offered the idea that a P E ratio of 15 was appropriate for companies whose growth rates fell in the range of 0  to 15   In other words  in addition to the fact that the P E ratio of 15 has been the average for indices like the S P 500  there is also a logical and mathematical reality behind its validity  However  although a P E ratio of 15 was an appropriate valuation to pay for growth of up to 15   I also pointed out that it did not necessarily indicate the rate of return investors should expect to receive 
Also  the 15 P E ratio should not be looked at as an absolute  instead it should be viewed as a baseline barometer or reference for fair value  In other words  the 15 P E is a good starting point guideline to ensure that you are not overpaying and taking too much risk  Consequently  anytime you come across a moderately growing company  5  15    whether a blue chip or even a moderate to high dividend payer that is trading at a P E ratio above 15  then caution is called for  However  there are certain companies that historically have usually commanded a premium valuation  Sysco  NYSE SYY  and Automatic Data Processing are two examples that come to mind  On the other hand  fair value can be present at higher P E ratios when faster growth supports it 
The moral of the story is that the primary determinant of what investors should expect as a reasonable rate of return is the company s actual growth rate of earnings growth  To clarify  the assumption is that if a slow to moderate growing stock is bought at a reasonable P E ratio of 15  in the long run the investor should expect to achieve capital appreciation that equates to its earnings growth rate  This of course assumes that the P E ratio at the end of the timeframe being measured is also close to 15  If the ending P E ratio is higher than 15  then the rate of return the investor achieves will be higher  and vice versa  Also  total returns will additionally include dividends  if any  Moreover  as previously illustrated  P E ratios above 15 are only justified when earnings growth is also above 15  
One of the key points about paying attention to fair value is that it positions you as an investor to achieve results commensurate with what the company is capable of generating as a business  If you overpay  the company can generate excellent results  but your returns will not keep up because you paid too much when you originally invested  Peter Lynch summarized this well in his best selling book  One Up On Wall Street  when he said 

 You can see the importance of earnings on any chart that has an earnings line running along side the stock price  On chart after chart the two lines will move in tandem  or if the stock price strays away from the earnings line  sooner or later it will come back to the earnings  

Conclusions 
From the insights provided by the F A S T  Graphs  above  the relationships between valuation and earnings growth rates should be clear  They also validate the notion that the concept of fair value  or what I like to call True Worth   should always be a consideration for investors  Valuation clearly matters  in fact  valuation matters a lot  When stocks are only viewed from the perspective of price alone  the principles behind valuation are easily missed or ignored  This can lead to very expensive investor mistakes 
Although the principles of valuation that the F A S T  Graphs  research tool is built upon are extremely relevant  they are not perfect  However  if used intelligently they can be a tremendous aid towards assisting investors in making the hard decisions of when to buy or sell a common stock  This is why we refer to them as  tools to think with   The price earnings relationships that this tool provides should be thought of as barometers or valuation references offered to think about and analyze valuation with  Their real value is in providing investors with an intelligent framework from which to make decisions upon 
As Warren Buffett has said   the fact that people will be full of fear  greed or folly is predictable  The sequence is not predictable   The relevance of this statement implies accepting and recognizing periods of time when markets are behaving irrationally  There s no need to attempt to rationalize illogical behavior  What makes no sense   makes no sense  On the other hand  there is a great need to recognize crazy activity when it is occurring  Then  and only then  can investors protect themselves from the dangers that exist when irrational exuberance or irrational pessimism rears its ugly head

You ve learned how to see what the billionaires are buying and how to decrypt their elusive trading strategies through their  
But  as you know  not all  are created equal 
Direxion Investments tracks 16 of the nation s top performing funds in its iBillionaire Index  and the vast majority posted negative one year returns 
However  two of them did manage to beat the market this year   and they may have the blueprint for success in 2016 
The two outperforming iBillionaire funds are Appaloosa Management  3 8  gain  and Trian Fund Management  2 6  gain   Their winning formula for 2015 
Consumer discretionary and staples plays 
As Americans pocketed big savings at the pump  these funds cashed in on increased consumer spending  But let s take a closer look at where they re putting their money for next year 
Follow the Leaders
Appaloosa Management s biggest third quarter buy was Delta Air Lines Inc  N DAL  
David Tepper s fund scooped up 1 8 million shares of Delta  effectively doubling its holding  Delta now makes up 9 6  of Appaloosa s total long equity portfolio 
The company trades at just nine times forward earnings   a 22  discount to the industry  Currently  Delta has a price to sales ratio of 1 0 times   a 44  discount to the S P 500 Index  1 8 times  
But what separates Delta most from competitors is outsized earnings growth 
Delta projects a 26  increase in year over year earnings for 2016  thanks to record low oil prices  Analysts expect its closest competitor  JetBlue Airways Corporation  O JBLU   to grow at 15   barely more than half of Delta s projection 
From a technical perspective  shares are trending upward with strength  In September  Delta s chart produced a  golden cross    a cross of the 50 day moving average over the 200 day moving average 
This is a typically bullish indicator for traders  And shares are pounding at the door of their 52 week high  Time to get on board 
Distributing the Goods
Trian Management s largest buy in the third quarter was Sysco Corp  N SYY   Nelson Peltz s firm tripled its existing position  adding more than 31 million shares to the portfolio  At present  the Sysco position comprises 13 8  of Trian s portfolio 
Sysco is North America s largest distributor of food and related products  and the company provides goods and services to 425 000 customers across the continent 
Over the last five years  the company has lagged in earnings per share  revenue  and share price growth versus the industry 
But Trian  a well known activist hedge fund  specializes in turning around underperforming companies   particularly food services  And Sysco certainly fits the bill 
Peltz advocates deep cost cutting and innovative solutions to boost revenue growth  He s also not afraid to suggest unpopular spinoffs or outright sales to rivals 
Now  shares currently trade at 37 times trailing earnings   a hefty premium to both the food industry and the S P 500 
But while Sysco isn t the best bargain  investors love Peltz s boardroom prowess  Since announcing his stake in August and his election to the board of directors  the stock has gained 15

136348,357863,SYY,SYY  Dependable Dividend Aristocrat For Retirement Income,opinion,"Sysco  N SYY  is a holding in our Conservative Retirees dividend portfolio  The company is a dividend aristocrat that has paid dividends since 1970 and appears to offer a very safe 3  yield today 
While SYY s growth rate is very moderate  the company s durability has been noteworthy  The pace of change in the foodservice distribution industry is really slow  and SYY derives several benefits from being the largest player in the market 
Despite several years of sluggish growth and some pricing pressures  we believe SYY will keep plodding forward as it executes on its cost improvement plan and becomes even more competitive  A well known activist investor also purchased 7  of the company in August 2015 and could help the company unlock additional value Business OverviewSYY was founded in 1969 and is the largest distributor of food products in the country  It basically acts as the middleman between food producers and retail consumers 
Restaurants are its biggest customers at about 64  of total sales  followed by healthcare cafeterias  9    schools  8    hotels  8    and other facilities  11    Overall  SYY sells to about 425 000 customers 
SYY s product mix is fairly well diversified  Some of its biggest segments are fresh and frozen meats  21  of sales   canned and dry products  16    frozen fruits  vegetables  and bakery products  13    dairy products  11    and poultry  11   Business AnalysisWholesale food distribution is a simple business  That is likely one reason why Warren Buffett bought into the industry in 2003 when he acquired McLane Company from Wal Mart  N WMT  for  1 45 billion 
The pace of change is very slow  and new innovations  even drones   seem to pose little threat to the way the industry operates  At the end of the day  food manufacturers need a cost efficient way to get their products to retailers and consumers 
The best operators offer prompt and accurate delivery of orders  a broad assortment of products  and competitive pricing  Since distributors are middlemen  their margins are very low  SYY s operating margin has averaged less than 5  over the last decade  and players must either establish themselves as price or niche leaders in a given region 
Not surprisingly  SYY s scale plays a big advantage  Since its formation nearly 50 years ago  SYY has grown from  115 million to nearly  49 billion in annual sales  acquisitions have been a significant growth driver  
As the largest food products distributor in North America  SYY works with thousands of suppliers to offer the broadest assortment of products  over 400 000  on favorable terms  Few companies have the capital and supply chain network and expertise to match SYY s assortment  For these reasons  SYY is one of a handful of players that can serve national accounts 
Furthermore  SYY s wide network of warehouses and distribution systems allows it to offer daily delivery to most of its customers and provide competitive rates  With a dense delivery network around its warehouses  SYY can offer lower pricing than other distributors that attempt to play in its geographic regions 
In addition to economies of scale  high capital costs  and product assortment  new entrants are also challenged by supply contracts SYY has with many of its customers 
While the food distribution business has several favorable characteristics that seem to ensure its durability  it is a very mature market  As the largest player  SYY is especially challenged to grow  The company had historically increased in size by acquiring market share  but there are few big enough deals left to really move the needle 
Most notably  SYY made an offer to acquire the number two player in its market  U S  Foods  for  8 2 billion in December 2013  The acquisition would have given SYY 25  share of the national market but was blocked by the U S  government  requiring SYY to significantly alter its core strategic plan and pay hundreds of millions of dollars in breakup fees to U S  Foods 
Less than two months after the merger was terminated  activist investor Nelson Peltz took a 7  stake in the company and secured two seats on the board of directors  Peltz brings meaningful experience in the food industry and has previously held positions in Kraft  O KHC   Wendy s  O WEN   PepsiCo  N PEP   Mondelez  O MDLZ   and several others 
SYY s new three year plan calls for stricter cost management  smaller acquisitions  and better sales efforts to improve operating income by  400 million and deliver a 15  return on invested capital by 2018  The company is also focusing on updating its product offerings and technology to better compete with smaller rivals that have more organic products and online ordering 
While the future will be much different without U S  Foods under its belt  we think SYY will continue squeezing out modest profit growth over time and remain a force in the  265 billion foodservice market for years to come Key RisksAs we mentioned earlier  the wholesale food distribution market is very mature  With SYY s planned takeover of U S  Foods getting rejected by the FTC  meaningful growth will be even harder to come by 
Smaller specialty distributors have also taken away some higher margin restaurant business from SYY  and the sluggish economy has resulted in generally softer restaurant sales over the last few years  These factors have created some price pressure and suppressed SYY s margins 
SYY is taking action to combat these factors by offering a more localized approach to many of its customers  This includes offering locally produced foods and ingredients targeted more specifically at particular demographics  We expect SYY to also be more acquisitive of these local and regional niche distributors 
Otherwise  it seems like Amazon  O AMZN  is worth mentioning as their reach continues to extend into many different markets  They specialize in warehousing  inventory management  and delivery capabilities  but it seems like more of a stretch for them to establish all of the supplier relationships that SYY has  The inventory and delivery mechanisms for wholesale food are also very different 
Perhaps the bigger risk would be if large national accounts or food producers decided to enter the distribution business themselves and cut out the middleman  However  this doesn t seem to be happening today   probably because of its capital intensity and low value add 
Finally  it s worth mentioning that swings in commodity prices  e g  fuel  and consumer spending patterns  e g  grocery vs  restaurants  can impact SYY s results from time to time  However  we don t believe these factors have an impact on the company s long term earnings potential Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
SYY s dividend is very secure with a Safety Score of 93  We can see that the company s payout ratios have increased over the past decade to about 70  today  While that is on the higher side of what we like to see  it is a reasonable level for SYY because the business is so steady  However  it does suggest that future dividend growth will need to more closely align with the company s earnings growth Source  Simply Safe Dividends
SYY EPS Payout Ratio
A high payout ratio can be dangerous if a company s earnings are cyclical  However  SYY is a very stable business  As seen below  the company s sales dipped by just 2  in fiscal year 2009  While less people eat out at restaurants during difficult economic times  they still need to consume food  SYY s stock fell 23  in 2008 but outperformed the S P 500 by nearly 15  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Despite its low margins  we can see that SYY has generated a solid return on invested capital over most of the past decade  Returns have decreased a bit in recent years  but it otherwise looks like a company that has a bit of an economic moat Source  Simply Safe Dividends
SYY has also generated free cash flow ever year  It s interesting to note that free cash flow meaningfully increased during the recession  This is because the company does not have to build up as much inventory and working capital when demand falls  allowing it to sell its existing inventory and raise more cash Source  Simply Safe Dividends
If it weren t for SYY s reliable cash flows  its balance sheet would be somewhat concerning  The company has a lot of debt relative to cash on hand  but its debt burden is reasonable compared to its free cash flow generation  S P has also given the company an A  credit rating Source  Simply Safe Dividends
While SYY has somewhat high payout ratios and a lot of debt  the consistency of its business and the strong free cash flow it generates each year make its dividend payment very safe Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
SYY s dividend Growth Score is 40  suggesting that the company s dividend growth potential is below average  This shouldn t come as a surprise given the mature state of the foodservice distribution industry  the company s large size  and its above average payout ratios 
Despite its lower growth profile  SYY is a member of the S P Dividend Aristocrats Index and has paid a dividend since 1970  The company most recently increased its dividend by about 3  in late 2015  and we expect continued dividend growth in the range of 2 4  per year  the company is using most of its cash left from the failed U S  Foods acquisition to repurchase shares  ValuationSYY trades at 21x forward earnings and offers a dividend yield of 3 0   which is lower than its five year average dividend yield of 3 25   Looking only at the earnings multiple  SYY appears to be somewhat highly valued given its lower earnings growth profile 
With that said  if the company can deliver mid single digit earnings growth under its new three year plan  its total return potential would appear to be around 8  per year 
With an extremely safe dividend payment  low business volatility  and activist involvement behind the stock  SYY is potentially an appealing stock for investors living off dividends in retirement  However  it looks like more of a long term hold than a new buy today ConclusionSYY is about as boring of a business as they come  but its time tested operations  well known brand  economic moat  and strong cash flow generation certainly qualify it as a blue chip dividend stock 
The stock s price does not look cheap today  but we believe SYY remains a quality long term hold for conservative investors seeking sources of safe dividend income ",2016-01-06,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-dependable-dividend-aristocrat-for-retirement-income-378941,378941

Gross profit improved 4 1  to  2 1 billion in the quarter  while gross margin improved 34 basis points  bps  to 17 9  due to the company s ongoing growth strategy  which focuses on accelerating sales  reducing costs and mitigating ongoing gross margin pressure

We are impressed by the fact that Sysco has delivered higher gross margins for the last four consecutive quarters  after witnessing declining gross margins since the last two fiscal years due to multiple factors  It seems that the company s growth strategy is paying off and its efforts to boost sales and margins are bearing fruits 
The company s sales have also improved consistently driven by acquisitions and volume growth  Though  was disappointing  the company still remains positive on the acquisition front and expects to move forward with more such deals  However  the company expects earnings to remain under pressure due to currency headwinds and food cost deflation

136373,357888,SYY,Understanding Fair Valuation,opinion,"Introduction
In order to understand what the intrinsic value or fair value of a common stock is  you must think like a long term business owner and not like a stock trader  Additionally  you must think like a business owner that has no intention of selling their business  Put another way  your business generates your livelihood  Therefore  your primary focus and attention is on answering the question  how s business 
When you own your own business you care about sales  cash flows and ultimately net profits  These are the things that make your business valuable to you simply because these are the things that produce your income 
Valuation is a Mathematical Principle and Not a Vague Concept
When I speak of valuation  I am referring to the mathematical calculation of the returns  including both capital appreciation and dividend income  which you could prudently expect to earn from the company s cash flows  earnings   Those returns should be large enough to compensate you more than you could earn from a theoretically riskless investment like a Treasury bond  If you are not being compensated for the extra risk you re taking by investing in stocks  then I believe you are paying more than you should be 
 Price Is What You Pay  Value Is What You Get 
The venerable investor Warren Buffett has a real knack of putting complex concepts and ideas into simple and easily understood terms  In my opinion  his quote   Price is what you pay  Value is what you get  is one of the more profound and important statements he has ever uttered  If truly understood  these simple words represent perhaps some of the most important bits of investment wisdom that an investor in common stocks could ever receive 
The concept of fair valuation represents the key to receiving the full benefit that these wise words provide  Knowing the price you pay is simple and straightforward  And  although many have an intuitive understanding of value  its deeper meaning is often only vaguely comprehended  Anyone who has truly made the effort to study Warren Buffett s investment philosophy understands that receiving value on the money he invests is of high importance to him 
So how do you know  when buying a stock  if you re getting value or not for your money  I contend that the answer lies in the amount of cash flow  earnings  that the business you purchase is capable of generating on your behalf  And regardless of how much cash flow the business can generate for you  its value to you will be greatly impacted by the price you pay to obtain it  If you pay too much you get very little value  but if you pay too little then the value you receive is greatly increased 
Therefore  if value is what you re looking for  then it s important that your attention be placed on the potential cash flows that you re expecting to receive  Unfortunately  few investors possess the presence of mind to focus on this critical element  Instead  investor attention is more commonly and intensely placed on stock price and its movement  A rising stock price is usually considered to be good  and a falling stock price is considered bad  However  prudent investors understand  recognize and acknowledge that the stock market often incorrectly prices the stock behind a business relative to its intrinsic value 
Another investing great offered his view on this important point 

 Just because you buy a stock and it goes up does not mean you are right  Just because you buy a stock and it goes down does not mean you are wrong   
 Peter Lynch  One Up On Wall Street 

Just like the Warren Buffett quote  Peter Lynch s quote is also based on the principle of sound valuation  The point is that a rising stock may be dangerously overvalued  while a falling stock price may indicate that the company is becoming a rare opportunity on sale 
Knowing the difference will materially impact not only the long term rate of return the investor receives  but perhaps more importantly  the risk they are taking to get it  As I will illustrate later  you can dramatically overpay for even the best company  It is a truism that the stock market can  and will  inaccurately appraise the value of a business from time to time   up or down 
From what has been said so far  it should be clear that in order to receive value  you have to know how to calculate value  Then  and only then  can you be absolutely certain that you re investing in a stock and receiving value for the price you pay  However  there is an important caveat that needs to be introduced 
Just because you buy a stock at value doesn t necessarily mean that you will receive a high return  This is because value  although important  is only one component of future return  The other important component is the earnings growth rate of the business 
To clarify  you can buy a slow growing company at sound valuation  and even at the same valuation as a faster growing company  while still earning only a modest rate of return  In fact  it could be argued that only being willing to invest at sound valuation is more critical for a slow grower than it is for a faster grower 
The rationale here is that there is very little margin for error when investing in a low growth security  Therefore  it s even more imperative that you get valuation correct  This may be one of the most confusing aspects of fair valuation  or value  that I will elaborate on later 
The Foundational Principles of Value
What gives a business  stock  value  Ultimately  any business  public or private  has its value derived from the amount of cash flow it is capable of generating for its stakeholders  stockholders   Not only will capital appreciation depend on the level of earnings  dividends are also a function of earnings  It is because of this principle that the discounted cash flow  DCF  method of valuing a business is so widely accepted by scholars and professional investors  Consequently  this article on how to value a business is strongly based on utilizing fundamental valuations based on cash flows  earnings  as the primary method for assessing fair value or True Worth  as I like to think of it as 
However  I intend to spare the reader the tedious task of evaluating or calculating long and complex mathematical formulas in order to assess fair valuation  Instead  I will focus on presenting logical explanations and straightforward discussions of the principles behind these important valuation methods  Additionally  I will provide what I hope the reader finds as easy to understand pictures as evidence supporting my points  Anyone who is interested in a more scholarly approach can simply Google  How to value a company using the discounted cash flow method  DCF  
I believe investors can possess a practical and useful understanding of the basic principles of fair value  In order to receive value when you buy a stock  you have to be careful that you are only paying a price that represents sound valuation  Fair valuation is only manifest when your investment in a business is supported by a strong foundation of fundamentals  These would include  but are not limited to  strong cash flow and earnings generation supported by a proven business model with prospects for continued growth 
Furthermore  the terms  value  and  valuation  though not synonymous  are very closely related  I am going to do my best to illustrate that the investor can only get value when buying a stock if they apply the discipline of sound valuation when they initially invest 
In other words  when the price you pay is at a level that equals sound valuation  then good value is what you will receive  As previously suggested  if you overpay your value will be less  and if you re fortunate enough to buy on the cheap  your long term value will be enhanced 
Calculating Intrinsic Value with Zero Growth  Moderate Growth and Low Growth
Let s start by looking at sound valuation from the perspective of minimum to maximum levels based on rates of growth  The reader should understand that much of what I will present next represents an overly simplistic view of valuation  However  I believe that this is the best way to lay a sound foundation of understanding of this important investing principle 
There will be subtle calibrations that investors need to apply when actually making investments in real world situations  On the other hand  the core principle will aptly apply and hold true  Let s initially look at how you would value a future stream of income that doesn t grow  A 10 year treasury bond would represent a good proxy to illustrate this principle  The interest rate is fixed and guaranteed  but it does not grow 
Common sense and logic would dictate that you would never be able to buy a Treasury bond at one times its interest  In other words  a stream of income has an intrinsic value that is some multiple of its annual income stream  In order to calculate current valuation  you simply divide the interest rate it pays into its price  With 10 year treasuries yielding approximately 2 2  today  you divide 2 2  the rate  into 100  the price  and discover that it is selling at approximately 45  times interest 
Historically  this is a very high price  which means that yields are also historically low  Therefore  people  possibly still traumatized by the Great Recession  are buying Treasury bonds today because they are willing to pay the high price for the safety they perceive they are receiving  Under more normal levels of interest rates  10 year Treasury bonds have been more typically offered at yields of 6  to 8   Do the division and this calculates to valuations of approximately 12 to 17 times interest  Nevertheless  any investment has a value that is greater than its annual income stream  but investors should understand there are rational limits to the multiple you pay for an income stream that should not be exceeded 
Common stocks are certainly not as safe as Treasury bonds  however  the principles behind sound valuation still apply  In other words  as long as a company generates an income stream  even if it doesn t grow  it will have value that is greater than its annual income stream  Otherwise  this no growth investment would be generating cash on cash returns of 100   Clearly  this would be illogical  Consequently  just like a Treasury bond trades at a multiple of interest  a common stock will trade at a multiple of its income stream which is generally represented as earnings  It is commonly expressed as a P E ratio 
The reason I started with looking at a safe but no growth fixed income vehicle was to establish the minimum foundation of valuation  Historically  the average price earnings ratio that has been applied to the average company  the S P 500  for the past 200 years has been approximately within a range of 15 16  This calculates to an earnings yield of approximately 6 to 7   
I do not believe it is a coincidence that this also represents the long term average return that stocks have produced  In order to keep my promise of keeping it simple  I additionally point out that this valuation calculation also relates to normal fixed income yields of 6  to 8  as discussed above 
Most importantly  this 15 P E multiple should be thought of as a barometer used as the starting point for valuation calculations and not an absolute number  However  this helps explain why my three examples presented below  each with different earnings growth rates  have approximately the same fair value PE of 15 
Utilizing the F A S T  Graphs  fundamentals analyzer software tool  my first example will review the low growth utility stock SCANA Corporation  NYSE SCG  In order to illustrate the low rate of earnings growth that SCANA and utility stocks in general grow at  I am utilizing the logarithmic option of the research tool  This first graph plots SCANA s earnings only since 1997  The orange line on the graph represents a P E ratio of 15 which  as discussed above  I offer as a proxy of fair value for a company growing earnings at 3 2  per annum 
As I will introduce next  when stock prices are overlaid on the graph we should see a high correlation between price and earnings   if my thesis has any merit  In other words  we should see the price tracking the earnings line and we should also see evidence of fair valuation  overvaluation and undervaluation manifesting from time to time  More plainly stated  if the price is touching the orange line the company s stock is fairly valued  if the price is above the orange line the company s stock is overvalued  and when the price is below the orange line it is undervalued 

This next graph on SCANA is presented arithmetically because I also include dividends represented in two forms  The light green shaded area above the orange line represents dividends after they have been paid to shareholders  The second iteration of dividends is the white line  it s actually honeydew green  that represents those same dividends as part of earnings  the dark green shaded area  prior to being paid to shareholders 
What I am asking the reader to focus on is how monthly closing stock prices  the black line  over this timeframe have closely tracked the company s earnings at a P E ratio of 15  the orange line   Also notice what happened every time the price fell below or above the orange P E ratio of 15  These times represent vivid depictions of overvaluation  undervaluation and how price inevitably returns to fair valuation 

When examining SCANA s performance over this time period notice how capital appreciation and earnings growth are in close alignment  Also notice the contribution of dividends to total return 

With my next example I present the Dividend Champion ABM Industries Incorporated  NYSE ABM   a company that has increased its dividend for 48 consecutive years  This particular example has grown earnings at the average rate of 6 5  since 1996  or approximately twice as fast as we saw with our SCANA example  Nevertheless  we draw the orange valuation reference line utilizing the same fair value P E ratio of 15 
Without presenting a long and detailed explanation  the fair value P E ratio of 15 represents a sound proxy of fair valuation for companies with earnings growth ranging from 0  15   Here I again ask that the reader keeps in mind that the fair value P E ratio of 15 should be thought of as a valuation reference and not an absolute 
The primary principle that supports this valuation level is the fact that a P E ratio of 15 represents an earnings yield of approximately 6 7   which as previously stated  is also the common long term return that stocks on average have generated  I also ask that the reader remembers that fair value is only one component of potential future returns  The second important component is the earnings growth rate that a given company achieves 
To be clear  even though I am arguing that both SCANA and ABM Industries are fairly valued at a P E ratio of 15  this only establishes the principle of sound valuation  In other words  even though both companies are theoretically fairly valued at a P E ratio of 15  ABM Industries is likely to generate a higher level of capital appreciation due to its faster earnings growth rate  In this regard  and as I previously suggested  fair valuation is more representative of a reasonable level of risk based on current valuation than it is on generating a higher long term return 
Most importantly  I chose this ABM example because it also clearly validates my previous statement that the market will incorrectly price a company s stock from time to time  If you analyze the following earnings and price correlated graph closely  you will see that over the long run stock price does follow earnings  However  you will also see numerous periods of significant overvaluation  when the price is disconnected from and above the orange line  
But most importantly  these periods of significant overvaluation also vividly represent the risk I discussed above  and supports the principle that price inevitably moves back into alignment with fair value  Of course  the same principle applies on the few times that ABM s stock price became temporarily undervalued  Furthermore  this illustrates the important principle that fair valuation is not related to market timing  Instead  fair valuation is a principal of soundness supported by a foundation of fundamental values based on earnings and cash flows 

Examining the long term performance of ABM Industries we again see a high correlation between earnings growth and capital appreciation  Note that the reason that capital appreciation is greater than earnings growth is because the company is currently overvalued 


How Do You Account for PE Ratios Below 15 
Anytime you come across a company whose price earnings ratio is less than 15  which I have described as a foundational P E ratio in this article  it s usually associated with uncertainty  A current P E ratio below 15 might possibly imply a concern that future earnings are expected to be less than current levels  In other words  this could mean that you are paying a higher P E ratio for these expected lower future earnings 
For example  let s assume you buy a dollar s worth of earnings today and pay  15  or a PE ratio of 15  One year later  the dollar s worth of earnings you paid  15 for today have fallen to only   50 worth of earnings  Therefore  you have paid a P E ratio of 30 for those lower future earnings  Consequently  we might assume that the market may have been acting as a discounting mechanism  or as suggested  just mispricing the company 
Other uncertainties that could cause chronic low P E ratios below the standard P E ratio of 15 could relate to quality considerations  There are also certain sectors  the energy sector comes to mind  where the market routinely applies a lower valuation  Of course  as previously stated  uncertainty is usually associated with those lower than justified valuations  Additionally  a P E ratio below 15 may just be an example of the market undervaluing the company  as I pointed out earlier in this article 
Calculating Fair Value on Fast Growing Companies  15  Or Better 
Thus far I have attempted to lay the foundation of understanding how to value a common stock  So far I have presented low to moderate earnings growth examples and commented on collapsing earnings which really have no value  Next I will look at companies that grow earnings at 15  or greater as I investigate the nuances of valuating this faster growth 
Extensive research over many years has led me to conclude that a P E ratio equal to a company s earnings growth rate  P E EPS growth  is more appropriate for companies that grow at faster rates  In Chapter 7 of his best selling book One Up On Wall Street  the renowned investor Peter Lynch identified six general categories of common stocks  slow growers  stalwarts  fast growers  cyclicals  asset plays and turnarounds  This part of this article will focus on the fast grower category 
My definition of a fast grower is one that has consistently compounded earnings at 15  per annum or better over extended periods of time  five years or longer   Furthermore  the more consistent the growth has been  the better it fits my definition of a high growth stock 
This category of fast grower  Peter Lynch referred to as  superstocks  that he contended deserve the most attention from investors  The reason he believed they deserved the most attention  is because these are the stocks that will generate the highest total returns over the long run  Assuming of course you invest in them at fair value  Companies with these attributes are what Peter hunted for when he was seeking his  10 baggers  because he believed these were the most explosive stocks 
Mastercard Incorporated  NYSE MA  represents a classic example of a fast growing company  stock   Earnings growth since it went public in May 2006 has averaged 26 8   Therefore  consistent with the P E ratio equal to the company s earnings growth rate formula  the orange line on the graph represents a fair value P E ratio of 26 8 for this faster grower  Fair value for this high growth company is significantly higher than what we saw with our previous examples because of the compounding power of its faster earnings growth 
Once again  utilizing this as a valuation reference  we see that stock price  the black line  follows earnings  and we also see periods of time where the stock is undervalued relative to the business as well as times when the stock is overvalued relative to the business 

When you examine the performance associated with the above graph you see a vivid example of a  superstock  like the venerable Peter Lynch looked for  Even though the fair value P E ratio for this example is almost twice as high as the foundational fair value P E ratio of 15 seen in our previous examples  the earnings growth and long term shareholder returns justifies it 

Summary
Previously I offered the idea that a P E ratio of 15 was appropriate for companies whose growth rates fell in the range of 0  to 15   In other words  in addition to the fact that the P E ratio of 15 has been the average for indices like the S P 500  there is also a logical and mathematical reality behind its validity  However  although a P E ratio of 15 was an appropriate valuation to pay for growth of up to 15   I also pointed out that it did not necessarily indicate the rate of return investors should expect to receive 
Also  the 15 P E ratio should not be looked at as an absolute  instead it should be viewed as a baseline barometer or reference for fair value  In other words  the 15 P E is a good starting point guideline to ensure that you are not overpaying and taking too much risk  Consequently  anytime you come across a moderately growing company  5  15    whether a blue chip or even a moderate to high dividend payer that is trading at a P E ratio above 15  then caution is called for  However  there are certain companies that historically have usually commanded a premium valuation  Sysco  NYSE SYY  and Automatic Data Processing Inc  NASDAQ ADP  are two examples that come to mind  On the other hand  fair value can be present at higher P E ratios when faster growth supports it 
The moral of the story is that the primary determinant of what investors should expect as a reasonable rate of return is the company s actual growth rate of earnings growth  To clarify  the assumption is that if a slow to moderate growing stock is bought at a reasonable P E ratio of 15  in the long run the investor should expect to achieve capital appreciation that equates to its earnings growth rate  This of course assumes that the P E ratio at the end of the timeframe being measured is also close to 15  If the ending P E ratio is higher than 15  then the rate of return the investor achieves will be higher  and vice versa  Also  total returns will additionally include dividends  if any  Moreover  as previously illustrated  P E ratios above 15 are only justified when earnings growth is also above 15  
One of the key points about paying attention to fair value is that it positions you as an investor to achieve results commensurate with what the company is capable of generating as a business  If you overpay  the company can generate excellent results  but your returns will not keep up because you paid too much when you originally invested  Peter Lynch summarized this well in his best selling book  One Up On Wall Street  when he said 

 You can see the importance of earnings on any chart that has an earnings line running along side the stock price  On chart after chart the two lines will move in tandem  or if the stock price strays away from the earnings line  sooner or later it will come back to the earnings  

Conclusions
From the insights provided by the F A S T  Graphs  above  the relationships between valuation and earnings growth rates should be clear  They also validate the notion that the concept of fair value  or what I like to call True Worth   should always be a consideration for investors  Valuation clearly matters  in fact  valuation matters a lot  When stocks are only viewed from the perspective of price alone  the principles behind valuation are easily missed or ignored  This can lead to very expensive investor mistakes 
Although the principles of valuation that the F A S T  Graphs  research tool is built upon are extremely relevant  they are not perfect  However  if used intelligently they can be a tremendous aid towards assisting investors in making the hard decisions of when to buy or sell a common stock  This is why we refer to them as  tools to think with   The price earnings relationships that this tool provides should be thought of as barometers or valuation references offered to think about and analyze valuation with  Their real value is in providing investors with an intelligent framework from which to make decisions upon 
As Warren Buffett has said   the fact that people will be full of fear  greed or folly is predictable  The sequence is not predictable   The relevance of this statement implies accepting and recognizing periods of time when markets are behaving irrationally  There s no need to attempt to rationalize illogical behavior  What makes no sense   makes no sense  On the other hand  there is a great need to recognize crazy activity when it is occurring  Then  and only then  can investors protect themselves from the dangers that exist when irrational exuberance or irrational pessimism rears its ugly head

136397,357912,SYY,Sysco   Building A Case For A Return To Growth ,opinion,This article will specifically cover Sysco  SYY  and why I believe it represents an exceptionally safe opportunity for dividend growth investors and retirees looking for yield  Specifically  it also offers a follow up to an article on Sysco  SYY  that I wrote approximately a year ago   However  I have ulterior motives that go beyond this individual stock that deal with broader  and I believe  more important universal investing principles  At its core  I will use this article on Sysco to illustrate important differences between speculation and investment  Once again  I will offer a quote from Chapter 1 of legendary investor Ben Graham s highly regarded book The Intelligent Investor  Investment versus Speculation  What do we mean by  investor    Throughout this book the term will be used in contradistinction to  speculator    As far back as 1934  in our textbook Security Analysis  we attempted a precise formulation of the difference between the two  as follows    An investment operation is one which  upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return  Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative  This is important  because what prompted Ben Graham to devote his first chapter to the important distinction between Speculators versus investors parallels the prevailing attitudes of many people today that consider common stocks speculations or gambles  Later in his first chapter  Ben Graham gave us this  Compare this with the attitude of the public toward common stocks in 1948  when over 90  ov those queried expressed themselves as opposed to the purchase of common stocks  About half gave as their reason  not safe  a gamble   In addition to the importance of thorough analysis that defines a person as an investor  I believe that another important distinction implies a long term holding  The true investor does not expend the time and resource necessary to conduct thorough analysis with the intent of only holding an investment for a very short period of time  In other words  true investors exercise what I call intelligent patience based on the confidence garnered by thorough analysis  For example  Sysco was trading at  29 34 a year ago when I wrote the first article  and was paying approximately   98 a share in dividends  Today  Sysco trades at approximately  28 a share  but currently offers a dividend of  1 08 per share  As an investor who purchased this stock to own for the long run  the current price does not disturb me because I had not planned to sell for at least 3 to 5 years  a minimum of a full business cycle   On the other hand  I am pleased that my dividend income has increased Unfortunately  at least in my opinion  we seem to live in an age driven by the desire for instant gratification that is inadvertently turning wannabe investors into speculators  gamblers   Consequently  there is an inherent lack of patience with people willing and ready to react to every little wiggle in stock price that Mr  Market offers up  To those  speculators  the lack of a rise in Sysco s stock price troubles them  while in contrast  it bothers me not  I ve admired this company for many years  but Mr  Market valued it well beyond my comfort range  Therefore  the rest of this article will deal with why I m gratified to have the opportunity to now hold this blue chip dividend paying stalwart in my portfolios Sysco   A Dividend Champion On SaleFor starters  I would like to state that I believe that Sysco is one of the highest quality dividend paying common stocks available  Standard   Poor s currently awards them an  Extra Strong A1 short term issuer credit rating   and an A  long term issuer credit rating  Value Line rates Sysco s financial strength A    Therefore  I am confident that this Dividend Champion Aristocrat with 42 consecutive years of dividend increases offers a safe and well covered dividend and an above average and growing current yield The following 20 year performance  19  years  clearly illustrates Sysco s excellent record of continuous dividend increases and above average capital appreciation  One of the criticisms that I have heard regarding this blue chip is how their dividend growth rate has been rather anemic lately  But I do not consider the last two years dividend increases of 5  and 7  especially low  Most utility stocks with similar yields that are popular have lower growth than that  However  there are also a couple of extremely important points that I believe these critics are additionally failing to consider First of all  Sysco has recently been investing heavily into a transformation project that portends to increase future profitability  perhaps even dramatically  as I will discuss later  Second  you will note that the company has significantly increased its payout ratio which I believe illustrates a commitment to shareholders during the recent  and I believe temporary  slowdown in profitability  I believe that Sysco s generous attitude towards shareholders will result in a reacceleration of dividend growth when the initial expense of their transformation project subsides Short Term Profitability Has SlowedSince 1993  Sysco has generated average earnings per share growth in excess of 11  per annum  As the performance table above illustrates  the company s dividend growth rate has far exceeded earnings growth  However  as the following earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  illustrates  Sysco s average earnings per share growth rate has fallen to 6 6  per annum since calendar year 2007  one year preceding the great recession The pessimist could see this slowdown in earnings growth as a negative  however  I the eternal optimist  offer a different perspective  To me  it s a testament to the quality of this company and its management team that its profitability has remained positive and strong during and through these recent challenging economic times  Growth may have slowed  this blue chip industry leading company has remained profitable through it all  and dividends have continued to grow  albeit it at a slower rate When you compare Sysco s earnings record during and through our recent recessionary period with that of the average company  we get a perspective of the quality of this business  The following earnings and price correlated graph on the S P 500 clearly shows that the average company struggled a lot more than Sysco did  Furthermore  I would like to interject here  and expand more on later  that Sysco s operating record includes a significant increase in capital investment to improve future profitability  that most of their competitors were incapable of doing Sysco   A Legacy of Premium ValuationSysco is a company that the market has historically placed a quality premium valuation on its share price  Consequently  although I always admired the company and its prudent management team  overvaluation precluded me from investing  until the great recession of 2008 came along  Finally  after admiring this company from afar for so many years  it finally was priced at a valuation that made sound economic sense  Nevertheless  I find it befuddling that many want to avoid this stock now  when for the first time in decades  it can be purchased at a sound and reasonable valuation  Oh the peculiar illogic of Wall Street Even at today s historically low valuation  long term shareholders of Sysco have seen their investments significantly outperform the average as benchmarked against the S P 500  I want to repeat  and emphasize  that this is even considering that Sysco s shares have gone from being mostly overvalued during this time to currently fairly valued Forecasting Sysco s Future Growth RatesThe following estimated earnings and return calculator is based in part on the five year consensus earnings growth rate estimates from 10 analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ  However  this fiscal year s and next fiscal year s actual earnings per share estimates are also provided  There is a lot of cynicism regarding the accuracy  or even the reliability of trusting analyst estimates to predict the future growth of the business  Personally  based on many decades of experience  I believe the skepticism is way overblown Many will try to point to the fact that analyst estimates are rarely accurate  But my contention is that it would be na ve to expect them to be perfectly precise  On the other hand  I believe it is logical to expect them to be within a reasonable range of probabilities  In other words  if an analyst estimates a company to earn a dollar per share  but the company only earns   99 is that really a miss   To my way of thinking  it is not a miss  because it would be well within a realistic range  Consequently  I believe there is greater error in how we tabulate the accuracy of analyst estimates  than there is within the actual analyst error Furthermore  I believe consideration should be given to the reality that most of the analysts  forecast comes directly from the company s management  In my experience at least  no one can forecast the prospects of a company s future better than the people that are directly in charge of creating it  Moreover  it behooves the management team to provide conservative guidance that they can exceed  than it does to set unreachable targets  Moreover  prospective investors should understand most analysts are basing their estimates on the same information that is available to all the other analysts  Consequently  I would argue that consensus earnings estimates represent a conservative and sound starting point from which to evaluate the future prospects of the business Therefore  from the following graph we can expect a modest  2  drop in earnings growth for this fiscal year ending June 30  followed by a modest 1  increase for next fiscal year before the 6  to 8  five year growth rate kicks in  In other words  for reasons which I will discuss later  Sysco s short term earnings should be flat before beginning to grow again at the estimated 6  to 8  rate  rounded to 7  on the graph   However  I would also add that in my opinion  I believe the shorter term estimates may be reasonably close  but I believe the longer term growth rate is conservatively understated Thesis For Growth The following excerpts from Sysco s third quarter earnings  by CEO Bill Delaney summarizes Sysco s quarter and provides insight into the company s ambitious transformation project  William J  DeLaneyThank you  Neil  and good morning  everyone  This morning  Sysco reported sales of  10 5 billion for the third quarter  a 7 6  increase  Case volume grew 3  including acquisitions  and we believe we continue to gain market share in the industry  which has shown little to no real growth for a number of quarters Net earnings for the quarter were  260 million and reported EPS was  0 44  Adjusted EPS was  0 49 and excludes several items including gross business transformation costs  On this basis  adjusted EPS grew 2  for the quarter  We believe this adjusted amount is more representative of the performance of our underlying business  The modest improvement in market conditions we experienced in the latter portion of the second quarter continued through the third quarter  due in part to an unseasonably mild winter in much of the northern part of the geography we serve  Our volume growth for the quarter was solid across nearly all of our business segments as we improved our customer retention  increased our overall account penetration and attracted many new customers to Sysco     Turning to an update on our multiyear business transformation initiative and as we discussed on our second quarter earnings call  we implemented a new technology platform at our second pilot facility back in Oklahoma back in January  While we saw significant improvement in the system s performance compared to our early experience in our first pilot in Arkansas  we did identify certain processes that require additional assessment and enhancement  We are addressing those opportunities now and are targeting a third rollout early in fiscal 2013  Successfully implementing this technology platform is a critical component to our transformation of Sysco  Effectively driving our transformational change in a company such as Sysco  which has enjoyed a great deal of success over the past 40 years  can be challenging at times  However  in our case  we absolutely need to embrace such change if we are to continue to perform at a high level in a world that is much different than just a few years ago  Notwithstanding the predictable bumps that come with this type of journey  we remain highly focused on positioning Sysco to be a top performing company for years to come  The following clip from Sysco s website provides further detail on Sysco s commitment to accelerating their growth as their general industry mends  The point I m trying to illustrate here  is that Sysco s management team is  in my opinion  taking the necessary steps to ensure that the company remains strong  competitive and poised for future growth  Moreover  the expense of these initiatives  which incidentally have exceeded original estimates  is as much a contributor to the company s short term weakness and earnings slowdown than is the overall state of their industry 2012 Investors Day May 17  2012The following slides are taken directly from Sysco s recent presentation that has provided the foundation for the analyst estimates discussed above  This full slide presentation can be found by going onto the company s website and clicking the investors tab and then Events and Presentations  By doing this  you can review of the same information that the analysts were given and from which they base their earnings estimates  For the sake of time and space  I offer the slides as reasons and evidence of long term growth opportunity for this blue chip dividend paying industry leader I believe the sides are self explanatory and clearly illustrate the opportunity without a need for additional rhetoric on my part  However  to summarize what I believe this presentation shows is a company that has a small piece of a very large pie that is uniquely positioned due to its size  strength and scope to continue growing by capturing market share regardless of the growth prospects of the industry itself Summary and ConclusionsWhat I ve attempted to demonstrate regarding Sysco Corp specifically is a picture of an extremely high quality powerful franchise that is positioning itself for long term future growth  Currently  the company controls about 17    of the  225 billion North American food service distribution market  Since this industry is currently experiencing stress  it seems only logical that Sysco is best positioned among its peers to survive and prosper  On the other hand  many of its smaller local and regional competitors may not  For the past 40 years Sysco has been a successful participant in the industry s consolidation completing more than 150 acquisitions  Since the great recession  2008   Sysco has averaged about four acquisitions per year  But  now that their transformation program is well underway  that is rapidly changing  Sysco has already completed eight acquisitions in fiscal 2012 and anticipates closing on more than 10 before the end of June  I do not believe that their 4  6  underlying business growth guidance fully reflects acquisitions  This year s acquisitions alone should add more than 1  sales growth As I stated in my opening remarks I wrote this article with ulterior motives in mind  Based on what I see over the next couple of years  I do not expect to see a great deal of growth or perhaps even price appreciation with Sysco s share price  On the other hand  based on how the market has normally capitalized their shares I don t rule the prospects out  But most importantly  I do not believe there is a lot of downside from investing in this high quality blue chip either  The current yield is better than you can get on long term Treasury bonds  and I do expect Sysco to grow dividends in excess of earnings On the other hand  over the longer run I believe the prospects for growth will accelerate and perhaps even exceed the 6  to 8  current expectation  Over the longer run  I expect the trend towards eating out will continue  especially considering that more and more families are depending on two income earners  Therefore  there is no stay at home parent or spouse that is willing or even has the time to prepare the family meals But before I digress too much  the moral of the story is that this is an investment that I believe will attract the prudent investor with a long term time horizon  Furthermore  I believe the risk is low  the yield is high and the potential for future above average growth is high  It may not happen overnight  but I believe it s inevitable that it will eventually happen  At least I feel safe in saying that there is no company in the food service distribution industry that is better positioned than this blue chip Dividend Champion Aristocrat  However  it takes an investor mentality to appreciate and exploit the opportunities that this investment offers  Speculators may want to look elsewhere Disclosure   Long SYY at the time of writing Disclaimer  The opinions in this document are for informational and educational

136400,357915,SYY,High Yield Dividend Champion Portfolio For December,opinion,In December 2010  I created a screen hypothetical portfolio called the  High Yield Dividend Champion Portfolio   The screen is tracked publicly as a continuous hypothetical portfolio with a starting balance of  100 000 on   see the right hand column for a link to the spreadsheet   Like many of the screens  strategies  and portfolios I track and prefer  the High Yield Dividend Champion Portfolio uses a small number of historically relevant ideas to create a simple  yet powerful investment plan  As I    Some studies have shown that the  highest yielding  low payout stocks perform better over time than stocks with higher payouts and lower yields   The High Yield Dividend Champion Portfolio attempts to capture the best high yield  low payout stocks with a history of raising dividends  There are numerous ways to gauge the  best  high yield low payout stocks  The screening process for this portfolio starts with the  Dividend Champions  as compiled by   The list is comprised of stocks that have increased their dividend payout for at least 25 consecutive years We first rank the Dividend Champions based on yield   the highest 1 3 yielding stocks are kept and the rest are eliminated  With the remaining high yielding stocks we eliminate the half with the highest payout ratio  The remaining stocks are then assigned a rank based on the ratio of their dividend yield to payout ratio  the same as a trailing earnings price ratio  or the inverse of the trailing P E ratio  The top 10 stocks based on this ratio make the portfolio  Stocks will be sold at the re balance date  generally around the 5th of the month  when they drop out of the top 12  to limit turnover  and are replaced with the next highest rated stock  For December 6th there were three changes to the portfolio  The 651 shares in Questar Corp  STR  were sold at a loss of 2 74   463 shares in Sonoco Products  SON  at a 5 21  gain  and 356 shares in Sysco Corp   SYY  for a 1 21  gain  Three new positions were purchased  Chevron  CVX   Mercury General  MCY   and WGL Holdings  WGL   CVX yields 3 41  with a sub 30  payout ratio  MCY yields 5 89  with a 63  payout ratio and WGL yields 4 10  with a 59  payout ratio  The top 18 rated stocks based on this portfolio s criteria are listed below The equity curve of the portfolio is plotted below and since inception it is up 35 97   including dividends but excluding commissions and taxes  The SPDR S P 500 ETF  SPY  and iShares S P Growth Allocation ETF  AOR  are also shown for comparison A note regarding Eagle Financial Services  EFSI   The stock is a Dividend Champion but trades over the counter and has very low volume  Any entry exits in this stock should be treated with caution and limit orders are highly recommended Disclaimer  Stock Loon LLC  Scott s Investments and its author is not a financial adviser  Stock Loon LLC  Scott s Investments and its author does not offer recommendations or personal investment advice to any specific person for any particular purpose  Please consult your own investment adviser and do your own due diligence before making any investment decisions  Please read the full disclaimer at the bottom of ,2012-12-07,Scott's Investments,https://www.investing.com/analysis/high-yield-dividend-champion-portfolio-for-december-146560,146560
136401,357916,SYY,Everbody Eats  This Time It s Sysco,opinion,"Last week I bought ConAgra Foods  NYSE CAG  and put forth the case for it in this space titled Everybody Eats So  There is another food company that is looking attractive  Sysco Corporation  NYSE SYY  is perhaps the largest food distribution company on the planet  Look for their trucks on the road and you will see them everywhere  The stock has had a slow and steady grind higher after a long consolidation from 2010 to 2012  The Measured Move out of that Diamond consolidation was met on the spike in December and it consolidated for nearly 5 months after that  Now the Bollinger bands are opening higher on the weekly chart below and the MACD is crossed up and rising  joining the RSI in its bullish climb higher  Price is breaking to the upside and if you need a target higher  the 3 box reversal Point and figure carries a price objective to 60

136403,357918,SYY,Company Notes Digest  Retailers Share Mixed Sentiment Towards Economy,opinion,"The Macro Outlook
Retailers had mixed things to say about the economy 
Macy s says that at best the economic environment is improving very gradually
 our outlook for the fall season reflects our confident optimism tempered with the reality that many customers still are feeling the impact of an economic environment that at best is improving very gradually    Macy s Inc  NYSE M  
Fossil said the US market remains its biggest challenge
 Our biggest challenge remains our U S  business  where the retail environment is still challenging and where retailers continue to use promotions as a way to drive traffic    US 
Walmart sees the international consumer under pressure too
 The global economy remains challenged  which means the customer is also stretched  Price remains a critical factor in our customers  buying decisions    Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT 
Kate Spade complained that the environment is still very promotional
 We saw the landscape continue to remain promotional with increased activity over last year and key sale periods starting earlier than last year among retailers    Kate Spade   Co  NYSE KATE 
Retail is always promotional though
 I can t remember a time when it wasn t promotional  So  I don t see anything different in the second quarter or the fall season  This is a very promotional business  Our customer very much wants value and very much responds to promotions  So  I don t see a change happening there  But it s very promotional    M 
And Nordstrom doesn t think there s been any significant change in consumer behavior
 In terms of the health of the consumer  our trends have been pretty consistent  If you look at since the beginning of the year  we ve been in that 3  to 4  range  And while there has been some macro news in terms of the health of the consumer  I think the way the consumers behaving certainly in our space continues to be relatively consistent   Nordstrom Inc  NYSE JWN 
Most importantly  back to school started off very strong  maybe the funk was just seasonal after all  
 the end of the second quarter back to school was extremely strong at the start  We ll see as it goes through the season  but we feel very good about it    M 
 I would just say that the start to back to school as indicated from our July performance was exceptionally strong    Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS 
In Sysco s eyes  restaurants don t seem to be doing much better than retailers
 Our results reflect the impact of the slow and modest economic recovery in a food service industry that as a whole remains under pressure    Sysco Corporation  NYSE SYY 
Food inflation has been significant
 During our May earnings call we indicated that inflation jumped substantially at the end of March  That trend continued and we saw a meaningful increase in inflation throughout the quarter   SYY 
It s been especially severe in dairy
 This is by far the most difficult operating environment in the history of the company very high milk cost and resulting increases in retail prices created incremental volume softness in addition to increased pressure on our margins as pricing and retail was pressured by both price gap and price threshold considerations    Dean Foods Company  NYSE DF 
Most people are expecting the inflation to moderate  but so far it hasn t
 We haven t seen it yet  I think what we re saying is people that we all follow and just looking at some overview reports on commodities and that type of thing  and just the math of this thing as you get into the last third of next year we would expect it to subside some  But at this point it s still very comparable to what we ve seen in the last three or four months    SYY 
The fundamentals say that milk prices should come down  but so far they have not
 trying to prognosticate Class I at this point  all the data shows you that it should start to come down  All the fundamentals of the market say it should start to come down  But those fundamentals have been in place now for probably five to six months and we have not seen it come down    DF 
Restaurants will have to pass on food costs at some point  These are big increases
 Obviously they have to pass them along at some point  These are double digit increases  So I think they are selectively passing it along where they feel that they can support it in their business  I m sure they re also working their menus I think they re managing the portions  I think they re managing the mix of the menu and they re passing it along where they can    SYY 
However  it s hard to reconcile food cost inflation with the fact that Farmers are having an off year
 farm cash receipts which are forecast to be down somewhat from 2013  Assuming above trend yields  grain and soybean production levels are expected to be up in 2014  which is resulting in lower prices for those crops    Deere   Company  NYSE DE 
John Chambers sounds extremely negative on Cisco s business in emerging markets
 We saw the impact of economic and geopolitical challenges in China  Brazil  Russia  Argentina  Turkey and Thailand  and a number of emerging markets that many of our other peers are seeing Though the trends were looking better in Q2 and Q3 for emerging markets  the emerging countries lost momentum in Q4 Unfortunately  as we look out  we don t see emerging markets  growth returning for several quarters and believe it possibly could get worse    Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO 
Perhaps the Chinese consumer is doing better than Chinese industry though  Fossil and Estee Lauder both saw strong growth in China
 In China  sales grew 20  with strong growth in the retail channel  Already today  the addressable watch market in China is over 6 billion and forecasted to exceed 10 billion in just 4 years  We continue to invest in this very important market and see real potential to increase our market share over time in the mid tier price points    Fossil Group Inc  NASDAQ FOSL 
 in China  our sales climbed double digits  and we remained the largest prestige beauty company   Estee Lauder Companies Inc  NYSE EL 
India is the one emerging market that Chambers is positive on
 There are some bright spots for the first time in a while  I think Modi in India is going to turn around that country  You can see the enthusiasm  both the citizens and the businesses there  If I were betting on a single emerging market I d bet on India right now in a big way   CSCO 
Consumer
Consumers are demanding a lot from restauranteurs new experiences at lower prices
 Our customers are under a lot of pressure from the consumer to offer innovative experiences in food and presentations and to do it more and more cost effectively    SYY 
Consumers seem to be liking the ability to buy online pick up in store they even shop for more once they get there
 we have rolled out Buy Online Pickup in Store We haven t even marketed this capability yet  and we are already finding that many customers like this option  And once in the store  these customers are often buying other items as well    M 
Analysts are now starting to hypothesize that consumers are reverse showrooming
Analyst comment   I mean  some people are talking about customers targeting stuff online  and even if they don t buy it  buying it in the store  but then not spending as much time shopping   KSS 
Retailers are managing their inventories tightly
 What we discovered or what we experienced in the second quarter was that both with department stores and some of our boutiques  they were really focusing on managing their inventories tightly  And relative to our expectations  we saw some compression on sales because they were reducing their inventory level    FOSL 
It s interesting how retailers deemphasize long term growth in off price when the environment improves
 with respect to the off price  over the last year  what you ve heard us say is that our initial goal with off price was to seriously reduce the volume that we were going to sell through off price   FOSL 
 we re quite sensitive to the number of locations where the consumer can buy off price and that s what s driving that decision to guide the number of outlet doors down from our original targets    KATE 
Technology
The line between fashion and technology continues to blur
Fossil is partnering with Google for smart watches
 On the wearables front  we continue to develop opportunities for our brands to participate in the wearable technology trend  Our partnership with Google combines the functionality associated with the Android Wear platform and our ability to bring premium lifestyle branded watches to market our goal is to launch new product in 2015    FOSL 
Kate Spade is selling accessories at Apple stores
 It s important to note that sales of our Kate Spade New York accessories at Apple remains strong with performance up significantly this quarter    KATE 
Smart Jewelry too 
 There could even be some communication devices that have to do with jewelry  So it s not just a smart watch device  it s all types of wearable technology    FOSL 
Instagram might be the most important digital marketing platform for fashion
Kate Spade and Estee Lauder both highlighted their performance on Instagram
 This quarter our Instagram following was again our fastest growing online community    KATE 
 M A C also expanded its digital audience through successful social media channels  It became the largest beauty brand on Instagram  and increased its Facebook fans by 25  in fiscal 2014    Estee Lauder Companies Inc  NYSE EL 
Meanwhile  Walmart saw a negative comp in mobile phones because of a lack of innovation
 In wireless  we ve experienced recent comp declines due to a lack of innovation in phone technology and our delay in system upgrades needed to process new carrier installment plans    WMT 
Rackspace argues that mainstream companies want service with their cloud
 more and more of these mainstream cloud adopters realize that they need compelling service level agreements that actually align their desired business outcomes with their cloud providers  performance    Rackspace Hosting Inc  NYSE RAX 
Amazon does not appear to want to compete by providing a high level of service
 I think it s very counter to their culture  It s very counter to their model  They continue to say that  that s not the direction they are heading  It is very difficult to build a successful service culture  It s a very different economic model    RAX 
Rackspace talked some s t about IBM s cloud capability  did we mention that we are for sale  
 I will just add to that  which is  I think the opportunity for Rackspace is to become the IBM of the cloud  30 years ago  IBM was without a doubt the most trusted computing company in the world  And with the acquisition of SoftLayer  they are really going more the commodity rate  If you look at the most recent Magic Quadrant from Gartner  IBM didn t show up very well in the managed cloud segment  We really think that our high service model is really the new model for the cloud  And really  the IBM of the cloud is our opportunity and we don t think IBM is going to be the company  We don t think they are going to be the ones that are going to be taking that space and we think it s ours to have    RAX 
Materials  Industrials  Energy
It s too early to say whether this is just one bad year for farmers or if this is the start of a more prolonged downturn
 the answer to that question is what s going to happen with the crop that will get planted next year in terms of do you have yet a third year in a row of good growing conditions on a global basis or do you have a year where those yields moderate a bit due to weather whether that s in the U S  or some other region  I think it s just very premature to try to call whether this is a 12 month phenomenon or longer term    DE 
Demand is still strong  so a production shock could still move prices higher
 Although supplies appear to be adequate  global grain and oilseed demand remains strong  Unfavorable growing conditions in any key growing region of the world s coupled with the unknown impacts from geopolitical issues could lower production  reduce the stocks to use ratio and result in prices quickly moving higher   DE 
Balance sheets are better than they were the last time there was a downturn
 I think one thing I would point out is you mentioned balance sheet and certainly compared to the 1980 s it would be better today  but even compared to the 1990 s  late 1990s  I think if you look at the data you re in even better shape     
Miscellaneous Nuggets of Wisdom
Monitor your purchase for a long time before you buy it
 Trunk Club is terrific business and one that we ve been monitoring for some time we ve been super impressed with the five years that Trunk Club and their teams have been focused on the business on what they ve been able to accomplish    JWN 
Don t feel like you have to build every solution in house
 It s something we felt we could do but they had made tremendous progress  And one of the key elements in our business is speed  And we felt  given it would probably take a year or two for us to take a sizable portion of capital and some of our leadership team to get this business up and running  that we were best served  acquiring Trunk Club to get off and running ASAP    JWN 
You may have to pay up a little to get a great asset  because if you don t someone else will
 if we didn t do  someone else would and would take it bigger  Trunk Club in and of itself is on a tremendous growth rate  It s pretty clear where we can help them through things like inventory  supply chain  in store alterations  things like that  right off the bat that we can add fuel to their growth   JWN
