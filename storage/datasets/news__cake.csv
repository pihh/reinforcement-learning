113984,335499,CAKE,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Fed Releasing Meeting Minutes
Tomorrow the Federal Open Market Committee will release the minutes from its last rate setting meeting 
The minutes arrive at 2 00 PM ET  19 00 GMT   and the market will be looking for more detail on just how patient the Fed intends to be with its rate hike plan 
There will also be interest in any comments on the balance sheet 
The Fed is close to wrapping up its quantitative tightening program  Investing com s Darrell Delamaide wrote 
 First   the Fed  effectively ruled out any rate increases this year   Delamaide said   Now the message coming across is that the Fed won t be shrinking its balance sheet much more than it has already and will keep it at fairly elevated levels  
 It may even keep quantitative easing    purchasing bonds with money created out of thin air    as a new tool for monetary policy rather than just an emergency measure  
The market is pricing in rates staying on hold this year  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool 
2  Theresa May Parlays With the EU
U K  Prime Minister Theresa May is going to Brussels to try to minimize the pain of the United Kingdom s exit from the European Union 
Her office says it will be a significant meeting  European Union President Jean Claude Junker was openly skeptical much would come from the meeting  set for Wednesday evening 
Among the biggest concerns is whether the U K  and EU member Ireland can avoid a hard border stop  meaning goods won t be able to flow freely between Northern Ireland and Ireland 
The FTSE index was off 0 6  on Tuesday and is off 0 8  this week  That said  the index is up 6 7  this year

1  Fed minutes expected to cement dovish about face  U S  dollar on hold
The Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its Jan  30 policy meeting at 2 00 PM ET  19 00 GMT  Wednesday  Markets are expecting the details to cement the central bank s promise to be patient with further interest rate hikes 
More interesting for the market may be what the minutes reveal about the Fed s plans for reducing its balance sheet further 
 Quantitative tightening  which Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell likes to refer to as  balance sheet runoff   is no longer on autopilot   Investing com analyst Darrell Delamaide said 
The minutes are expected to confirm the dovish outlook  and that s keeping a lid on the U S  dollar ahead of the release  At 5 54 AM ET  11 54 GMT   the U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  fell ovenight and was largely unchanged 0 03  at 96 38 
2  Global stocks show mixed trade as U S  China talks persist
Global stocks were mixed on Wednesday with U S  futures leaning towards caution as U S  China trade talks continued in Washington 
U S  President Donald Trump said Tuesday that discussions were going well and suggested he was open to pushing off the deadline to complete negotiations  saying March 1 was not a  magical  date 
March 1 is the current deadline for the U S  to push tariffs on about  200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25  from the current 10  if a deal is not reached  A renewed round of talks began on Tuesday in Washington with higher level discussion scheduled for later this week 
 The overall feeling is that it is one step forward  three quarters of a step back at the moment  So positive momentum but still fragile    Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  s chief strategist Jim Reid said 
Trump s comments  coupled with positive results from retail giant Walmart  NYSE WMT   were enough to push Wall Street higher on Tuesday and send Asian shares to a four month high overnight 
European stocks also joined in with the pan European Stoxx 600 up 0 2  
After Tuesday s positive close  Wall Street adopted a more cautious stance with U S  futures largely flat  At 5 55 AM ET  10 55 GMT   the blue chip Dow futures slipped 21 points  or 0 08   S P 500 futures edged down 2 points  or 0 07   while the Nasdaq 100 futures were unchanged 
3  Earnings focus on consumers
With nearly 400 of the S P 500 firms having released earnings for the fourth quarter reporting period  the focus for Wednesday will shift to consumer oriented stocks 
Following a strong beat by Walmart a day earlier  some of the companies stepping up to bat are 
CVS Health  NYSE CVS   The consensus estimate of analysts polled by Investing com is for a profit of  2 09 a share on revenue of  54 6 billion  Shares fell 21  between their summer peak and December and are up 11  since 
Car rental company  Avis Budget  Group  NASDAQ CAR  is seen reporting earnings of 38 cents a share on revenue of  2 05 billion  according to estimates compiled by Investing com  The shares lost half their value between March and December  They re up a third from the December bottom 
 The Cheesecake Factory   NASDAQ CAKE   The restaurant chain is expected to report a profit of 62 cents a share on revenue of  592 9 million  The shares fell 31  between a July peak to December and are up 11  since 
4  Oil drops from 2019 highs as U S  output rears its head
Oil prices dropped on Wednesday  pulling back from 2019 highs  as attention shifted from OPEC led production cuts to worries over the surge in U S  output 
U S  crude oil futures fell 15 cents  or 0 27   to  56 30 by 5 56 AM ET  10 56 GMT   while Brent oil traded down 29 cents  or 0 44   to  66 16 
U S  crude output  which soared by more than 2 million barrels per day  bpd  in 2018 to a record 11 9 million bpd  is set to keep rising thanks to booming shale oil production  the Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday 
After oil hit its highest level since last November this week  traders have taken a breather amid fears that surging shale output could stop the market rebalancing

Thursday s report will also include the latest reading on U S  production 
5  U K  and EU to meet as Brexit impasse drags on
Not to be forgotten on the other side of the Atlantic  negotiations over the U K  s pending departure from the European Union drag on with few hopes for progress amid the current political impasse 
U K  Prime Minister Theresa May is scheduled to meet with EU Commission President Jean Claude Juncker later on Wednesday  Recent talks have yielded little progress since the British Parliament resoundingly defeated a divorce deal she had agreed to with the bloc back in November 
May s spokesperson dubbed the meeting to be a  significant  part of the process although Juncker remained skeptical when speaking of the planned encounter 
 There is not enough movement for me to be able to assume that it will be a productive discussion   he told reporters on Tuesday

114025,335540,CAKE,Should Value Investors Pick Cheesecake Factory  CAKE  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated   NASDAQ CAKE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cheesecake Factory has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 26  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 18 63  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Cheesecake Factory  current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 20 83  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 21  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Cheesecake Factory has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 19  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Cheesecake Factory  stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Cheesecake Factory has a P S ratio of about 0 82  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 36 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cheesecake Factory currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CAKE a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Cheesecake Factory is just 1 25  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 2 13  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 36  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 12 16  Clearly  CAKE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles   What About the Stock Overall Though Cheesecake Factory might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C  This gives CAKE a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter consensus estimate has fallen 1 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dipped 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated Price and Consensus    Despite this somewhat bearish trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above average performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCheesecake Factory is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a good industry rank  top 38  out of more than 250 industries  and a strong Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  However  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a

114036,335551,CAKE,High Costs To Affect Cheesecake Factory s  CAKE  Q1 Earnings,opinion,The Cheesecake Factory Inc    NASDAQ CAKE   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 financial numbers on Apr 25  after market close The company s aggressive sales building strategies and a sincere effort in expansion are expected to reflect in the to be reported quarter s revenues  However  despite the installation of a cost management system  high expenses from labor  pre opening and administration might have had dented margins  and in turn affected first quarter earnings A challenging operating environment has been affecting the company s performance of late and its shares have declined 14 7  in the past year  underperforming the  s gain of 10 8  Let s find out how the first quarter results will shape up Encouraging Top Line PictureEven though revenues declined year over year in 2017  Cheesecake Factory s commitment to boost sales encourages us  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the first quarter of 2018 is pegged at  582 1 million  indicating growth of 3 3  from the prior year quarter This expected increase in revenues is based on the company s heavy investments to improve guest experience  in turn stabilizing its sales trends starting from the fourth quarter of 2017  In order to boost comps  the company is focusing on improving its speed of service and training servers so that they render higher level of service  In addition to labor productivity  the company is majorly focusing on menu innovation and food efficiency Cheesecake Factory is preparing 50 menus under its Super Foods program  fresh from scratch in the restaurants  to increase consumer awareness of the brand  The company is also leveraging its brand power through the launch of products in the CPG channel  Also  the restaurant s technology enabled initiatives are doing well owing to positive feedback on its mobile payment app  CakePay  The company is also witnessing incremental sales from its delivery service  which is being rolled out nationwide  Presently  about 90  of Cheesecake Factory restaurants offer third party delivery Cheesecake Factory also continues to improve its to go business including online ordering capability  which could be in pilot by the end of the year  This is anticipated to be a major contributor to growth of the company s strong off premise sales channels  In 2017  the company s takeout business increased to 12  of sales The improved sales building strategies are also indicating comps growth in the to be reported quarter  The consensus estimate for comps at Cheesecake Factory restaurants for the first quarter of 2018 is growth of 0 8  against the prior quarter s comps decline of 0 9   The company expected comps to grow in the range of 0 5 1 5  in the quarter High Costs to Dent EarningsCheesecake Factory  like most other restaurant operators  is bearing the brunt of high costs associated with labor  pre opening  and other general and administrative expenses  As a result  the company s profits have been under pressure Total costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues increased 200 basis points  bps  year over year in 2017  The trend is expected to continue in the first quarter of 2018 as well Meanwhile  the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of 66 70 cents in the first quarter  whereas the

after the closing bell The company s expansion initiatives and other sales building efforts  including menu and digital innovations  are likely to have bolstered top line growth in the fourth quarter  Also  Cheesecake Factory has been trying to control costs and expand profit margins  which are likely to have aided earnings in the to be reported quarter However  shares of Cheesecake Factory have lost 2 2  over the past year  underperforming the  s rally of 14   The decline in share price can be attributable to the company s lower than expected earnings in two out of the trailing four quarters  the average miss being 7 6  Let us find out how the company s top and bottom lines will shape up in the to be reported quarter Sales Building Efforts to Aid Top Line GrowthIn the first three quarters of 2018  Cheesecake Factory s overall revenues grew 4 5  year over year  We believe that the upside trend in revenues is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter  Subsequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the fourth quarter is pegged at  594 5 million  reflecting a 4  increase from the year ago quarter This upside in revenues is stemming from the company s efforts to improve guest experience and drive traffic  In order to boost comps  it is focusing on improving the speed of service and training its servers so that they render a higher level of service  In addition to labor productivity  this restaurant is primarily focusing on menu innovation and digital improvements Cheesecake Factory s technology enabled initiatives are doing well with feedback on its mobile payment app  CakePay  being positive  In the third quarter of 2018  the company signed an exclusive national delivery partnership with DoorDash  It expects to reap benefits from these collaborative marketing opportunities  The company is also witnessing incremental sales from its delivery service  which continues to roll out nationwide Cheesecake Factory has been expanding in domestic as well as international markets  It is of late foraying into lucrative markets like the Middle East  North Africa  Central and Eastern Europe  Russia  Turkey  Mexico  Kuwait  Lebanon and Chile  Internationally  the company plans to open restaurants in Mexico in the first quarter of 2019  Overall  management believes that there is potential for 300 Cheesecake Factory locations in 2019  expecting to drive at least 3  unit growth Margin Expansion Efforts to Help Bottom LineCheesecake Factory is evaluating different approaches to limit costs  It installed a cost management system  with substantial capabilities across production  planning  and inventory management a few years ago to help analyze usage and waste  The company s portfolio management and diversification are expected to support restaurant level margins over time  The long term aim of management is to recapture the historical average adjusted operating margin of roughly 7 5   The company plans to achieve it by stabilizing formal margins and leveraging its bakery infrastructure  international and consumer packaged goods  revenue streams  and G A over time  Amid the current retail environment  such efforts to control costs would help improve margins We believe that these efforts have helped the company to achieve earnings growth in the to be reported quarter  Consequently  the consensus estimate pegs fourth quarter earnings at 61 cents  suggesting 15 1  growth from the year ago quarter Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a BeatCheesecake Factory does not have the right combination of two main

114062,335577,CAKE,Is Cheesecake Factory  CAKE  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated   NASDAQ CAKE    stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cheesecake Factory has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 8  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Cheesecake Factory s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail   Food   Restaurant industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 26 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Cheesecake Factory has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Cheesecake Factory stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Cheesecake Factory has a P S ratio of about 1  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  CAKE is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cheesecake Factory currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cheesecake Factory a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Cheesecake Factory is just 1 1  a level that is  lower than the industry average of 1 8  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  CAKE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Cheesecake Factory might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B  This gives CAKE a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen seven up and two down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 4 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated Price and Consensus   Despite this bullish trend  the stock just has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and that is why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCheesecake Factory is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 35  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick  Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 finest buy and hold tickers for the entirety of 2018 Last year s 2017 Zacks

114063,335578,CAKE,Will Soft Comps Hurt Noodles   Company  NDLS  In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Noodles   Company   NASDAQ NDLS   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2017 numbers on Mar 14  after market close 
The company has been bearing the brunt of soft consumer demand and declining comps for quite some time now  The challenging restaurant environment in expected to have affected the company s fourth quarter traffic and comps as well  Also  this fast casual restaurant chain s margins are expected to have been under pressure due to higher costs as well as expenses related to the implementation of strategic initiatives 
However  various sales building initiatives such as streamlining of menu and its innovation  introduction of new cooking procedures  effective marketing strategy  increased focus on the off premise business  along with investments in technology driven initiatives like digital ordering remain encouraging 
Notably  shares of Noodles   Company have rallied 95 8  in the past year outperforming the  s gain of 15 1  
Let s take a look at how the company s fourth quarter will shape up 
Revenues Likely to Remain Under Pressure
The grim sales scenario in the U S  restaurant space is affecting Noodles   Company s revenues of late  In the first nine months of 2017  the company s net revenues decreased 4  year over year due to closing down of units and declining comps  The negative trend is expected to have continued in the fourth quarter as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter s net revenues is pegged at  111 million  suggesting a 14 2  year over year decline 
Decreased demand and subsequent closing down of restaurants have widely affected the company s comps  In the first nine months of 2017  system wide comps declined 3   Keeping with the negative trend in comps  the consensus estimate for fourth quarter system wide comparable sales suggests a 2 8  fall 
Also  the consensus estimate projects company owned and franchised comps to decline 3  and 1 3   respectively  in the fourth quarter  Notably  in the first nine months of 2017  company owned comparable sales fell 3 4  and franchise comps were down 0 3  
Bottom Line Likely to Benefit From the Closure of Underperforming Restaurants
Noodles   Company has been undertaking the task of closing underperforming restaurants that had been consistently hampering its human and financial capital  We believe that the company s margins are likely to gain from such a move 
Subsequently  the consensus estimate predicts the loss of a penny in the fourth quarter  comparing much favorably with a loss of 4 cents incurred in the year ago quarter 
Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a Beat
Noodles   Company does not have the right combination of two main ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat 
Zacks ESP  The company has an Earnings ESP of 0 0   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

Melco ssurprise history has been impressive as the company beat estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive beat of 61 20   Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter s earnings is pegged at 23 cents  reflecting an increase of 76 9  over the prior year quarter  Also  revenues are expected to improve 11 1  year over year to  1 33 billion 
A look at the company s price performance also reveals that it outperformed the  over the last year  Shares gained a massive 68 9  compared with the industry s growth of 35 2  

 A Quick Recap of Q3 Performance
Melco s third quarter earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Both earnings and revenues grew significantly year over year  Top line improvement was primarily driven by higher rolling chip revenues at City of Dreams
What We Are Watching
Per Macau s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau   DICJ    gross gaming revenues  GGR  rose year over year in all the three months of the quarter  This  in turn  indicates that the casino hub is firmly on road to recovery  Notably  Macau s VIP s share of overall casino market in the fourth quarter was reportedly 56 2   We thus expect Melco s performance in the region to get a boost in the to be reported quarter 
Melco Resorts   Entertainment Limited Revenue  TTM 
   Increased focus on non gaming segments like rooms and food and beverages are further expected to drive the quarter s results  Notably  the company s large scale resorts provide distinctive lodging  entertainment and retail options  which appeals to a broader audience from around the region 
Additionally  Melco Resorts  cost control efforts including effective management of marketing expenses are likely to drive fourth quarter profits and margins  The addition of VIP tables at the company s Studio City property is also aiding it to deliver a broader product offering to a wider breadth of customers  This  in turn  is expected to lead to higher profits in the quarter 
The Philippines gaming industry is being supported by the country s robust economic growth and its expanding inbound tourism strategy  City of Dreams  Manila continues to deliver year on year growth across all gaming segments in the Philippines  Thus  Melco s Entertainment City property therein is poised to largely benefit from this growth 
However  stringent capital controls by the Chinese government and increased audits of the junket industry by DICJ in order to stop money laundering might have somewhat restricted gaming revenues in Macau  This may weigh on the company s quarterly results as well

114133,335648,CAKE,From A Roar To Caution  The S P 500 Tentatively Steps Toward 2017,opinion,"T2108 Status  64 5 T2107 Status  63 5 VIX Status  13 5General  Short term  Trading Call  cautiously bearishActive T2108 periods  Day  217 over 20   Day  37 over 30   Day  36 over 40   Day  34 over 50   Day  28 over 60   overperiod   Day  3 under 70   underperiod 
Commentary The S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   ended 2016 by following through on the bearish trading signals I identified in   Today s 0 5  loss came on slightly higher volume and on an additional push higher in the volatility index  the VIX  T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 50 day moving averages  DMAs  dropped to 64 5  
The S P 500  SPY  ended the year with a whimper as the Santa Claus rally delivered a rare  albeit minor  loss 


The volatility index  the VIX  pushed higher for the fifth straight day 
The PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  delivered an even more convincing loss on the day  The tech laden index s 0 9  drop confirmed the end of the previous  short  consolidation period 
The NASDAQ  QQQ  broke its primary uptrend at its 20DMA  A test of 50DMA support is now in play 
Note that both major indices broke through primary uptrends represented by their respective 20DMAs 
Interestingly  several other important signals held their ground right at the edge of additional bearish confirmations 
The iiShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  topped out three weeks ago  but it is still barely clinging to the bottom of its consolidation range  The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  managed to stay flat a day after finishing a reversal of its last breakout  The previous day  XLF also traded below its primary trend at the 20DMA for the first time since November 4th  The Australian dollar  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Australian Dollar  NYSE FXA   versus the Japanese yen  Guggenheim CurrencyShares Japanese Yen  NYSE FXY   marked a sixth day in a consolidation pattern that abruptly ended a sharp slide from the most recent high  AUD JPY s 50DMA is rushing upward to attempt a delivery of support 
The iShares Russell 2000  IWM  peaked on December 9th  but it is still clinging to the bottom of a consolidation range 


The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  looks toppy  but it still sits on the edge of a true breakdown 


Is this the pause that refreshes for AUD JPY or the calm before resuming the storm 
These collective signals set up the first week of 2017 as an extremely important test of buying interest 
Even the U S  dollar index  DXY0  is stepping into 2017 with a hint of caution  Post Fed the dollar printed two straight strong days to a new 14 year high  The dollar failed to make any further progress for two weeks  It ended 2016 with two days of selling that neatly reversed half its post Fed gain and a near erasure of the last breakout 

The U S  dollar suddenly looks very tentative as it closed the year right on its primary uptrend defined by its 20DMA 
There is a freshly interesting dichotomy between the low volatility and high beta components of the S P 500  The Powershares S P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio  NYSE SPLV  has held its ground since first selling off in the wake of the U S  Federal Reserve s latest pronouncements on monetary policy  SPLV is in a small consolidation pattern and is holding support at its 50 and 200DMAs  The Powershares S P 500 High Beta Portfolio  NYSE SPHB  last topped out on December 9th  The Fed slightly greased the skids  but the confirmation selling did not arrive until this week  As a reminder  the S P 500 generally tends to perform better when SPHB is rallying AND is out performing SPLV  The S P 500 generally tends to perform worse when SPHB is in decline and especially when it is under performing SPLV  The ratio of SPHB SPLV is currently in decline 

Sharp rallies in SPHB SPLV supported robust rallies in 2016  Are the tailwinds turning into headwinds now that the ratio is in decline again 
All things considered  I left my short term trading call at cautiously bearish 
I am ending another year of T2108 Updates with some brief follow ups 
Two months ago  I wrote  Awful Offerings  Acacia Communications and Twilio   I noted the poor market response to the companies after they each returned to the till to extract additional funds from the stock market  I held out earnings as an important to test to see whether the companies could reignite excitement in their respective stocks  Both companies failed to deliver  While both TWLO and ACIA experienced some bouts of interest after reporting earnings  both stocks closed 2016 at new post earnings lows  The two stocks also share precarious technicals with their respective 50DMAs carving out well defined and declining resistance levels 

Twilio Inc  NYSE TWLO  surged last week on Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  rumors  The buying quickly hit a brick wall at 50DMA resistance  I find it telling that all those gains have reversed and left TWLO at a new post earnings low 


Acacia Communications Inc  NASDAQ ACIA  has yet to give its downtrending 50DMA a test as volume dried up soon after November earnings  I find the lack of interest very telling 
Another chart that has my interest is Splunk Inc  NASDAQ SPLK   At the beginning of December  I noted how SPLNK s post earnings chart printed an ominous bearish pattern 

SPLK managed to bounce right back after that gap and crap  but it never generated much altitude above its 200DMA  SPLK closed the year at a new post earnings low that confirmed the second 200DMA breakdown 

Splunk  SPLK  confirmed a rounded topping pattern with a new post earnings low  Note that SPLK now sits right at its post Brexit low 
For one somewhat positive follow up I offer The Cheesecake Factory  NASDAQ CAKE   I have stalked this stock since   CAKE never did fall back to my preferred support level  and I should have jumped right into the pool after noticing the water was going to stay warm  Instead  I watched as CAKE soared to additional all time highs  A limit order I placed along the way for call options finally triggered on the last day of the year just as CAKE returned to that first post election all time high 

Cheesecake Factory  CAKE  gained as much as 19  post election  Like so many post election rocket ships  the ride came to an end on December 7th  Re entry for CAKE has been particularly sharp as it ended 2016 with a return to its first post election  and all time  high 
I made a rare exception from my short term trading call for CAKE  However  if the market starts 2017 with more confirmation of the current bearish signals  I doubt CAKE will be able to weather the storm with any kind of out performance 
Here is to a prosperous New Year no matter how and where the winds blow

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  increased 93 points  0 4   to 21 328  the S P 500 Index gained 11 points  0 5   to 2 440  and the NASDAQ Composite jumped 45 points  0 7   to 6 220  In moderately heavy volume  825 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 2 1 billion shares changed hands on the NASDAQ  WTI crude oil increased  0 38 to  46 46 per barrel and wholesale gasoline  was  0 01 higher at  1 50 per gallon  Elsewhere  the Bloomberg gold spot price increased  0 74 to  1 266 92 per ounce  and the dollar index  a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies  was 0 1  lower at 97 00

The Cheesecake Factory  NASDAQ CAKE  53  fell sharply after the restaurant reported that it expects Q2 same store sales to decline 1 0  year over year  y y   versus the FactSet expectation of a 1 7  gain  The company noted heightened volatility in week to week sales trends  indicative of uncertainty on the part of many consumers  as well as pockets of softness  notably in the East and Midwest 
The technology sector recovered somewhat from a rollover that led a two day slip in the equity markets from record high territory  Concerns have flared up about the rally in the group that has led the stock market run  The tech run likely won t go on forever nothing does but we don t see the unabashed enthusiasm for the group that would make us more concerned  and valuations aren t extended to the point that we believe investors should start to worry  That doesn t mean investors who have developed too large a position in tech relative to their risk tolerances shouldn t rebalance and take some profits  But we continue to see positive developments and believe the run in the tech sector still has further to go 
Producer price inflation mostly tops forecasts  small business optimism holds steady
The Producer Price Index  PPI  showed prices at the wholesale level in May were flat month over month  m m   matching the Bloomberg expectation and compared to April s unrevised 0 5  gain  The core rate  which excludes food and energy  was up 0 3   versus forecasts of a 0 1  advance and April s unrevised 0 4  increase  Y Y  the headline rate was 2 4  higher  above projections of a 2 3  increase  and the core PPI increased 2 1  last month  topping estimates of a 1 9  gain  In April  producer prices were 2 5  higher and up 1 9  for the headline and core rates  respectively 
The National Federation of Independent Business  NFIB  Small Business Optimism Index for May remained at April s unrevised 104 5 level  matching expectations 
Treasuries were mixed and little changed  with the yield on the 2 Year note increasing 1 basis point  bp  to 1 36   while the yields on the 10 Year note and the 30 Year bond decreased 1 bp to 2 21  and 2 86   respectively 
Recently  bond yields have rebounded somewhat from a bout of pressure that stemmed from heightened political uncertainty on both sides of the Atlantic  as well as some mixed economic data  Also  the two day Federal Open Market Committee s  FOMC  monetary policy meeting  which began today  is expected to yield a 25 bp increase to the target federal funds rate  However  the markets have grappled with the timing and frequency of further rate hikes and the likelihood that the Central Bank will begin the process of shrinking its huge balance sheet later this year 
Tomorrow s statement accompanying the decision  as well as updated economic projections and subsequent press conference by Chairwoman Janet Yellen  are poised to garner heavy scrutiny 
Before the FOMC concludes its meeting tomorrow  we will get some key May economic reports  with the Consumer Price Index expected to show core inflation was just shy of the Fed s target of 2 0  y y  along with retail sales  projected to continue to nudge higher m m  Weekly MBA mortgage applications will also be released  as well as April business inventories 
Modest growth  low inflation and a cautious Fed are combining to make things  just right  for investors  Additionally  the apparent improving global trade trend could help contribute to further stock market gains and support large cap outperformance  But the risk of a pullback and or sharp acceleration in volatility is elevated courtesy of both domestic and world political uncertainty  and the potential of a Fed misstep

114136,335651,CAKE,4 Reasons To Stay Away From Cheesecake Factory  CAKE  Now,opinion,The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated   NASDAQ CAKE   is one of the most recognized upscale casual restaurants chain operating in the U S  It taps all dining preferences from lunch and dinner day parts to the mid afternoon and late night day part Despite challenging economic conditions  the company has been expanding in the domestic as well as international markets  We believe that various strategic initiatives have boosted traffic volume and sales Nevertheless  over the past six months  Cheesecake Factory with a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  has lost 14 8   faring miserably against the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 8 7  Let s take a look at the factors that make the stock look unattractive at this point Earnings miss and downward revision in estimates  The company s lackluster bottom line performance in the last reported quarter disappointed investors  Its earnings of 72 cents missed estimates by 1 4   Sales in the quarter also missed the same by a slight margin Consequently  Cheesecake Factory has witnessed its current quarter earnings estimates decline by 10 5  over the past 60 days  on the back of seven downward revisions as against none upwards  The same for the current year have also gone down by 6 3  due to seven downward revisions versus none in the opposite direction Guidance cut  The company now expects fiscal second quarter 2017 comps to be down roughly 1  at Cheesecake Factory restaurants  after previously projecting an increase in the band of 1  to 2   In fact  this casual restaurants chain anticipates the lowered comps outlook to impact both margins and earnings per share  EPS  in the fiscal second quarter as well  Earlier  it had guided EPS in the range of 85 cents to 88 cents  for the quarter The company revealed that it has been witnessing heightened volatility in week to week sales trends  indicative of uncertainty on the part of many customers In fact  it particularly blamed weakness at its U S  restaurants in the East and Midwest for soggy sales  Unfavorable weather condition in these regions also reduced patio usage   a big draw for the chain  This  in turn  has more than offset positive comps experienced in key markets of California  Texas and Florida Notably  at its fiscal first quarter conference call the company had already slashed its fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS projection  Additionally  Cheesecake Factory had cut its comps guidance for the full year as well Industry headwinds  Over the past few quarters  the U S  restaurant space has not been too enticing  Despite economic growth  somewhat lower energy prices and higher income  consumers increased their spending only modestly on dining out  which resulted in low consumption over the past few quarters  This is because  along with wage growth  inflation is also on the rise  which translates to lower real income and in turn less disposable income  The situation has taken a worse turn  thanks to higher health care costs and tightened credit availability in the U S Moreover  as consumers demand high quality products at lower prices  it is pushing grocery stores to decrease their food prices in order to remain competitive  This is resulting in a bigger gap between food at home and food away from home indices Consequently  same store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment  Traffic too has been weak  In fact  the first quarter of 2017 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole  thereby continuing the somber mood  As a result  Cheesecake Factory s sales have come under pressure Rising costs putting pressure on margins  Of late  the company s profits have been under pressure owing to a rising wage rates scenario  Moreover  pre opening costs of outlets given the company s unit expansion plans  and expenses related to sales initiatives are adding to the costs and are likely to hurt profits  In fact  the company projects a year over year decline in operating margins in fiscal 2017 given the labor pressure and a little less favorable commodity environment  which in turn will lead to lower EPS It is also to be noted that the company has put up a historical  3 5 years  EPS growth of just 0 1   while the Zacks categorized Retail Restaurants industry has recorded a gain of 6 7   Looking at the projected figures we find that the company is expected to grow its EPS by just 1 3   while the industry average EPS growth expectation is 6 4

Commentary Financial markets took another  mixed  breather on Thursday  the sixth day of post election trading  The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   closed fractionally down  Wednesday November 16th marked the fifth trading day that the S P 500 has struggled just under its all time high  The NASDAQ  via PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   gained 0 6   the tech laden index is creeping ever closer to its all time high 

The S P 500  SPY  took a small breather just below resistance and all time highs 

The NASDAQ  QQQ  managed a second post election high in a row  The post election pressure on and rotation from tech is certainly easing 
Financials settled down for a second straight day  I am nearly jumping out my seat at the chance to load up on a dip in Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLF  

Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLF  cools down a bit as two days of high volume selling fail to reverse the last day of buying 
T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   took its own rest and closed essentially flat with the previous day  The volatility index  the VIX  managed to print a marginal gain as it clinged to lower uptrending support 

The volatility index  the VIX  is barely clinging to lower bound support 
I daresay the stock market is starting to settle into a comfort zone just as both the S P 500 and the NASDAQ re approach all time highs  The U S  Thanksgiving weekend is next week  After that  the Federal Reserve s December meeting will loom larger and larger  I see plenty of motivation for market participants to cool down until these catalysts reveal themselves 

Donald Trump s election victory helped push the odds of a December rate hike to near certainty 
I continue to marvel at some of the breathtaking moves in the stock market on individual stocks  Theme trades abound and thrive  In previous posts I completely passed over the restaurant dining stocks  The Cheesecake Factory  NASDAQ CAKE  is one of many in this sector that makes me salivate 
CAKE gapped up post earnings and then lingered in wait for a fresh catalyst  The election propelled CAKE to a new all time high  Sellers stepped in with force from there  the last 2 days of selling reversed the previous 2 days of gains  I am good buying into a third day of selling that takes CAKE back to its post election reaction  First  I will be looking to see whether Wednesday s low holds 

The Cheesecake Factory  CAKE  went parabolic post election so the current cool down is a welcome buying opportunity 

This monthly chart provides important long term perspective on CAKE  The chain is a winner and a survivor 
The latest theme stocks come from airlines  On Tuesday  November 15  2016  news went out that   Unfortunately  this news came in the middle of a 2 1 2 month run up  Indeed  Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL   for example  gapped up on the Buffett news and proceeded to sell off right back to the previous day s close  That kind of move tells me that DAL is closer to the end than the beginning of the current rally 
I post the following chart as an exmaple of how the technicals can provide traders clues on a change in sentiment  DAL sold off in early August on its release of July passenger revenue numbers  That low held all month and provided the launch pad for a 50DMA breakout in September  The change in sentiment was confirmed when DAL proceeded to break out above 200DMA resistance at the beginning of November  Incredibly  DAL has experiecned just two  very minor  losing days this month 

Sentiment on Delta Airlines  DAL  has taken a dramatically bullish turn 
I am really kicking myself on DAL  Back on August 2nd  this is what I had to say about the stock 

 Delta Airlines  DAL  ran into trouble with its July report on passenger revenue  I noticed that Delta claimed the numbers were exactly as they expected  So  the depths of the selling surprised me  if I were bullish  I might be looking to buy this dip  Instead  I am noting that the high volume selling confirmed 50DMA resistance  DAL is now down a whopping 28  year to date  With oil prices tumbling again  I have to resist the urge to think of the selling in DAL as a buying opportunity for now  On a technical basis  DAL is one to fade in a bearish market on any rallies up to the 50DMA  

If I had kept tabs on Delta  I would have turned bullish as my read on the market turned more bullish as well  What a lesson

proposal of expansive government spending  lesser financial regulation and increased prospects of tax cuts would boost economic growth as well as increase inflation and interest rates  In particular  the Fed in its latest testimony hinted at a sooner than expected rates hike  might be in December  given the U S  economy has been on a solid footing with an improving housing market  rising consumer prices and a more robust labor market  These should be enough for the economy to withstand an increase in interest rates  All these have set the stage for the rally in stocks for the coming weeks Food  Beverage   Transportation  Hot SpotsWhile many corners of the stock world will see a rally  food and beverage  and transportation stocks will likely take charge  According to the latest data from the American Farm Bureau Federation  the average cost of serving 10 people for Thanksgiving is expected to drop 24 cents from last year to  49 87 thanks to declining farm prices including the most happening food   turkey According to travel service provider AAA  thanksgiving holiday travel is expected to hit the levels not seen in nine years buoyed by lower gas prices  As many as 48 7 million Americans will travel through roads and skies this Thanksgiving holiday period  Nov 23 Nov 27   Out of these  43 5 million Americans will take long car trips  up 1 9  from last year   3 7 million will

Adjusted earnings of 61 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents by 13   Moreover  earnings increased nearly 30  year over year owing to higher revenues 
Revenues of  423 million exceeded the consensus mark of  416 million by 1 7   Also  it increased 6  year over year  The upside reflects higher international sales and better comps than the preceding quarter PAPA JOHNS INTL Price and Consensus   Behind the Headline Numbers

Domestic company owned restaurant sales were up 9 8   primarily due to a 5 1  increase in equivalent units and a 5 6  rise in comparable sales  Domestic franchise royalties and fees were up 8 7  driven by a 4 5  rise in comp sales and reduced levels of royalty incentives in 2016  Domestic commissary and other sales were up 0 9   The upside was driven by higher commissary sales  partially offset by lower pricing for certain commodities and higher online fee revenues for the online and mobile ordering business  These increases were partially offset by the prior year inclusion of approximately  1 3 million of FOCUS equipment sales to franchisees 
Comps at system wide North American restaurants were up 4 8   lower than the year ago comps growth of 5 5   but better than 0 1  in the last quarter

114221,335736,CAKE,As Amazon Rules Ecommerce  Traditional Retailers Are Left Reeling,opinion,"is it time to sample stocks in these two dog eat dog sectors 
Two of the roughest  most failure prone sectors in the stock market have always been and probably always will be restaurants and retail  Competition is brutal in both spaces  margins are usually slender  and bankruptcy always seems to be one poor management decision away 
I ve written about the slow motion  of the traditional retail sector fairly regularly over the last couple of   and with several large operators like Nordstrom s  NYSE JWN  and Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  posting surprisingly decent earnings lately  I thought it might be a good time to check back again  Could brick and mortar retail be on the brink a comeback 
Probably not 
Last week  job placement firm Challenger  Gray   Christmas reported that 43 600 retail jobs have been eliminated since January  One iconic chain after another  including Sears Holdings Corporation  NASDAQ SHLD   JC Penney Company Inc Holding  NYSE JCP   and Macy s Inc  NYSE M  have announced store closings  Teen retailers Pacific Sportswear and Aeropostale Inc  OTC AROPQ  filed for bankruptcy in April and May  respectively  while Sports Authority went under in March and closed all of its 460 stores by June  This creative destruction is likely to continue  According to Mark Cohen  the director of retail studies at Columbia University   the traditional retail industry in some respects is facing Armageddon  
The one two punch of ecommerce and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  has left most brick and mortar retailers reeling  Amazon reported 2015 revenues of  107 billion  and is expected to grow to  137 billion in 2016  Amazon s stock is up 13 percent year to date  2446 percent over the last ten years  and a stunning 50000 percent since its 1996 IPO  The only retailers left relatively unscathed in its wake are deep discount concepts TJ Maxx  Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST   and Dollar General Corporation  NYSE DG   These chains offer  treasure hunt  bargains that Amazon does not cannot offer   Some specialty firms like Louisiana based Pool Corp  which I mentioned a few months ago  are also faring well   Even with these few bright spots  for John Q Public  buying retail stocks  however inexpensive they appear  is an extremely risky and probably ill advised strategy 
Restaurants could be a different story  however  There is no Amazon equivalent devouring the sector  Also  restaurants are benefiting from a favorable secular tailwind as well managed chain operators continue to expand their marketshare  Many folks might feel a nostalgic fondness for mom and pop diners and other locally based eateries  but chains hire better people  train them better  buy food at lower prices and understand that good  consistent menu offerings are the key to financial success  While my fund does not own any restaurant stocks today  my reluctance is due to   not long term viability  Shake Shack  NYSE SHAK   Habit Restaurants Inc  NASDAQ HABT   Wingstop Inc  NASDAQ WING   Buffalo Wild Wings Inc  NASDAQ BWLD  and the still private Five Guys are all great concepts with great growth potential  I am less excited about The Cheesecake Factory  NASDAQ CAKE   they are great operators  but the food is mediocre   Noodles   C  NASDAQ NDLS   Potbelly Co  NASDAQ PBPB   and Del Friscos Restaurant Group  NASDAQ DFRG  
Personally  I am fascinated by restaurants  Maybe it s because performing due diligence on them is a lot more enjoyable than analyzing an obscure software or biotech company  I own 50 percent of a successful nine year old Cajun restaurant in Berkeley  California  I have also invested in other restaurants  with my own money  over the last two decades  Some have done quite well  Some have crashed and burned  Investing in restaurants can be fun  but nerve racking  because it doesn t take a Chipotle level scandal to bring on a sudden reversal  Consumers often simply tire of a concept  In recent weeks the 48 unit Fox   Hound  23 unit Champs  and larger chain Logan s Roadhouse have all filed for bankruptcy  Houston based Ignite restaurant group  which owns Joe s Crab Shack and Brick House Bar and Grill  is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy  as well 
Perhaps the most intriguing trend in retail and restaurants is the blending of the two  Chains like Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL  and Oxford Industries Inc  NYSE OXM  have profitable restaurants that help promote their larger apparel efforts  I recently bought 40 000 shares in Oxford Industries after visiting with its management  I believe its biggest brand  Tommy Bahama could grow at a double digit rate after disappointing first quarter results  The coconut shrimp on its menu are pretty tasty  too ",2016-08-23,Scott Fearon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-confessions-of-a-contrarian-investor-200149473,200149473

Last quarter  Cheesecake Factory posted a 13 33  positive earnings surprise  The company surpassed earnings estimates in all the last four quarters with an average surprise of 8 46  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement CHEESECAKE FACT Price and EPS Surprise
   Factors at Play
Cheesecake Factory s profits have been under strain owing to a rising wage rates scenario  Moreover  the company s unit expansion plans  pre opening costs of outlets and costs related to sales initiatives are hurting margins 
For the second quarter  Cheesecake Factory expects earnings per share between 69 cents and 72 cents 
Nonetheless  various initiatives to improve sales and traffic volumes coupled with innovation in menu should boost comps  With a solid start to 2016 and a moderate increase in prices  the company expects comps to remain flat or grow up to 1  in the second quarter In the second quarter  the company has rolled out several top line boosting initiatives which include an enhanced server training program and mobile payment app  CakePay  It has also increased its focus on home and office delivery through the induction of a pilot program of partnerships with third party providers in select locations 
Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cheesecake Factory is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP   The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at  1 41   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 70 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 71 cents    Zacks Rank  The Cheesecake Factory has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderHere are some restaurant companies to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter
