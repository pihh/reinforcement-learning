3679,225194,ALL,NMI Holdings  NMIH  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of NMI Holdings  NMIH   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 20 8  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  33 54 in the previous session  NMI Holdings has gained 79 2  since the start of the year compared to the 17 8  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 11  return for the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on November 6  2019  NMI Holdings reported EPS of  0 71 versus consensus estimate of  0 61 
For the current fiscal year  NMI Holdings is expected to post earnings of  2 51 per share on  365 86 million in revenues  This represents a 51 2  change in EPS on a 33 03  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 06 per share on  447 85 million in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 22 01  and 22 41   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
NMI Holdings may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
NMI Holdings has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 12 8X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 16 8X versus its peer group s average of 14X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  NMI Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if NMI Holdings meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though NMI Holdings shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does NMI Holdings Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of NMI Holdings have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including W R  Berkley  WRB   The Allstate  ALL   and The Hanover Insurance Group  THG   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
However  it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking  so it isn t all good news for NMI Holdings  Still  the fundamentals for NMI Holdings are promising  and it still has potential despite being at a 52 week high ",2019-11-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nmi-holdings-nmih-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200483918,200483918

146823,368339,ALL,Exclusive  Sears chairman submits new roughly  5 billion bid to save retailer   sources,news,By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector NEW YORK  Reuters    Sears Holdings Corp Chairman Eddie Lampert submitted a revised roughly  5 billion takeover bid for the company on Wednesday  people familiar with the matter said  boosting the chances that the U S  department store operator will escape liquidation  In a concession  Lampert agreed to assume tax and vendor bills Sears has incurred since filing for bankruptcy protection in October  the sources said  The billionaire s revised bid was submitted through an affiliate of his hedge fund  ESL Investments Inc  on Wednesday afternoon along with a  120 million deposit  the sources added   Lampert s previous bid  which Sears had rejected  was valued at  4 4 billion  The new bid  which Sears will consider during a Jan  14 bankruptcy auction  proposes assuming up to about  300 million of tax and merchandise expenses the 126 year old company has racked up since its Oct  15 bankruptcy filing  the sources said  The offer  which aims to preserve up to 50 000 jobs  also would assume up to roughly  350 million in additional Sears bankruptcy expenses  severance benefits for employees and other liabilities  one of the sources added  Sears employed about 68 000 people when it filed for bankruptcy   Ensuring Sears can pay its expenses  which include bills for legal and financial advisers and are known as administrative claims  was a main point of contention as the company negotiated the deal with Lampert   Lampert s previous bid had proposed acquiring 425 Sears stores   The sources asked not to be identified because the details of Lampert s new bid are not yet public   Sears and ESL declined to comment  Lampert s revised bid is the only one that envisions keeping Sears alive  albeit in a smaller form  and came after a last minute deal he reached with the retailer on Tuesday as the company was preparing to liquidate  Other offers submitted over the past several weeks were for pieces of Sears or liquidation proposals to close its doors   The breakthrough occurred hours before a scheduled bankruptcy court hearing on Tuesday  A Sears lawyer disclosed the agreement during the hearing  telling a judge it materialized after what he described as round the clock negotiations   The agreement required Lampert to make a  120 million deposit  more than  17 million of which he will forfeit to Sears creditors unless his bid prevails in next week s bankruptcy auction   Sears will now weigh Lampert s offer against a liquidation that would shut down the retail chain for good and put tens of thousands of people out of work  Sears has lined up a liquidator to sell off the chain s vast inventories of tools  appliances and store fixtures if necessary   Sears dates back to the late 1800s and eventually became known for its mail order catalogs  By the 1960s  it was the largest retailer in the world and a fixture in malls across the United States  selling everything from appliances to auto parts to toys   But the retailer failed to adapt to the modern era of online shopping and was overtaken by the likes of Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   which earlier this week became the world s most valuable company with a market capitalization of close to  800 billion   Sears in October became the latest retailer to be swept up in a wave of bankruptcies amid the modern competitive landscape and is now trying to avoid the fate of other chains that failed to survive their court filings  Toys  R  Us Inc and Bon Ton Stores Inc were unable to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings and forced to liquidate last year  Lampert formed the modern Sears through an  11 billion merger in 2005 that combined Sears Roebuck and Kmart  He envisioned returning the retailer to its glory days  when it owned the tallest building in the world  a radio station and Allstate  NYSE ALL  insurance   Critics  including some Sears creditors  contend he let Sears deteriorate even as he invested in the retailer and loaned it money   Lampert s current bid for Sears still faces hurdles that have been tabled for now but could eventually threaten his attempt to acquire the chain  His previous offers requested a legal release that would clear him from exposure to litigation over transactions he engaged in with Sears before it filed for bankruptcy protection   Unsecured creditors  including landlords and bondholders  have argued there are viable claims against Lampert regarding the deals  which Lampert maintains were proper  The transactions helped him become the company s largest creditor in addition to its biggest shareholder   Lampert has also proposed forgiving  1 3 billion of debt he holds in exchange for ownership of a restructured Sears  a bankruptcy maneuver known as a credit bid  Unsecured creditors have previously argued the move should not be allowed  U S  Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain plans to review the credit bid after next week s auction

146824,368340,ALL,New auto safety technology leaves insurers in the dark,news,"By Tina Bellon RUCKERSVILLE  Va   Reuters    Automakers are accelerating the rollout of technology designed to avoid crashes  but insurance companies are waving a caution flag at consumers eyeing discounts for buying collision avoiding brakes or automated cruise control  The global market for advanced driver assistance systems  known in the industry as ADAS  is expected to reach more than  67 billion by 2025  growing more than 10 percent each year  A group of 20 carmakers has pledged to outfit almost every new vehicle with forward collision warning and city speed automatic emergency braking by 2020   Government mandates to install technology such as collision avoiding automatic brake systems are driving the market  as is the promise of profits for these higher margin vehicles   Anybody that has been in a car with advanced safety solutions is not going to go back   Kevin Clark  chief executive of auto technology supplier Aptiv PLC told Reuters  The cost for advanced safety systems   automatic braking  lane keeping and automated cruise control   can be relatively low to the automaker  between  500 to  1 000 per vehicle  Clark said    The  manufacturer  can price for it and consumers will pay for it   he said   For a graphic  click  Aptiv expects to book more than  4 billion in new ADAS business this year   We have gone from five customers just a few years ago to I think we ll have north of 20 in a couple of years from now   Clark said   The insurance industry s perspective is different   Personal auto insurance  while traditionally a low margin business  provides the largest amount of liquidity to insurers  generating more than  244 billion in 2018 direct premiums in the United States alone  data by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners showed  Motor insurance is also seen as a way for insurance companies to cross sell other  more lucrative products to customers  According to Swiss Re AG  the world s largest auto reinsurer  and mapping company HERE  ADAS has the potential to reduce motor accident frequencies by up to 25   cutting global insurance premiums for fully ADAS equipped cars by  20 billion by 2020  But U S  insurers said they currently do not have sufficient data to validate auto industry promises of safety benefits from automated driving systems   They cite car manufacturers  reluctance to provide detailed information on models sold with those features  a lack of consistent standards  drivers  unpredictable use of the systems and higher repair costs    We re not going to go against the data and create any type of false discounts for the purposes of marketing at this point  We just want to make sure the rate is reflective of the risk that it brings   said Steve Armstrong  a vice president of Allstate  NYSE ALL  Corp s pricing department  one of America s largest insurers   Shantelle Thomas  also a vice president at Allstate s pricing department  said insurance rates will reflect benefits and costs of modern auto technology in the next five years  but will not necessarily be presented as discounts  The sentiment was echoed by other insurance providers   We re stuck in a murky in between   said Jennifer St  John  national auto claims leader at Westfield Insurance   ADAS have shown to provide real world benefits  but there really isn t a great deal of commonality in terms of what s out there   Insurers pointed to higher repair costs as a risk  Sensors and cameras central to automatic driving systems are mostly installed in a car s bumper or windshield  Research by AAA has shown repair costs for even minor collisions can double if such sensors are damaged    There s no such thing as a  300 bumper anymore  It s closer to  1 500 in repair costs nowadays   said Richard Lavey  executive vice president at The Hanover Insurance Group   State Farm in a statement said it did not offer discounts specific to advanced driver assistance systems and that future rates would be shaped by a variety of factors  including safety  regulation  underwriting  liability and repair costs  GEICO did not respond to requests for comment   DATA DESERT With new automated driving features being released on a rolling basis  insurers said it is difficult to keep up   Forward collision warning with automatic braking has been found to have one of the greatest safety benefits among various driver assistance systems  The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety concluded in a recent study that automatic braking could reduce front to rear crashes with injuries by 56   But most ADAS features are still sold as optional equipment  making it impossible for insurance companies to validate which features ultimately end up on a specific car  Insurers are reluctant to trust car buyers to correctly identify what technology their vehicle has on board   Advanced safety features not only differ in performance and description among different manufacturers  but even among models by the same automaker  according to research by IIHS and its UK equivalent Thatcham Research  which conduct road tests to evaluate safety tech performance   The only way you can adequately price is by getting more data to understand what a vehicle has and whether it makes a difference   said Matthew Avery  Thatcham s research director  That data is not sufficiently provided by manufactures who often cite proprietary and competitive reasons  said Tom Karol  general counsel of the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies  whose members insure more than 170 million U S  auto policyholders  Automakers and insurers said they are dealing with the data issues  General Motors Co  NYSE GM  has a team working on ADAS and insurance  according to Barry Engle  head of GM s North American operations  Engle said he expects with better information  the insurance industry would respond positively   To the extent that they are not  collectively we need to do a better job of communicating with one another   he said  Swiss Re is leading efforts to develop a global ADAS risk score and a mechanism allowing carmakers to supply data to Swiss Re  which in turn will recommend discounts to auto insurers    If we say these cars are safer  insurers are more prone to believe us as we take part of the risk  as a reinsurer for consumer facing auto policy writers  said Sebastiaan Bongers  Swiss Re s head of products and technology  Bongers believes reductions in accident frequency and severity will eventually offset higher repair costs  But he said lower premiums could result in temporary liquidity problems in the insurance sector in about ten years

146826,368342,ALL,Will Allstate  ALL  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Allstate  ALL   which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This insurer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 30  
For the most recent quarter  Allstate was expected to post earnings of  2 52 per share  but it reported  2 84 per share instead  representing a surprise of 12 70   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 48 per share  while it actually produced  2 18 per share  a surprise of 47 30  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Allstate lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Allstate has an Earnings ESP of  11 19  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 4  2020 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-allstate-all-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200497030,200497030
146827,368343,ALL,Allstate  ALL  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Allstate  ALL  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 12 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  151 6  
Revenues are expected to be  10 77 billion  up 3 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 93  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Allstate 
For Allstate  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 01  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Allstate will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Allstate would post earnings of  2 52 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 84  delivering a surprise of  12 70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

What s Next for Allstate 
While Allstate has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Notably  ExxonMobil has made 16 oil discoveries in offshore Guyana and estimates 750 000 barrels of oil production per day from the region by 2025 However  the company s downstream and chemical

the stock warrants a cautious stance   You can  Like all energy stocks  Chevron shares have struggled lately  but they have nevertheless done better than the peer group as whole  Driving this outperformance is Chevron s status as one of the best placed global integrated oil companies to achieve sustainable production ramp up America s No  2 energy company s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry  thanks to planned expansion in the lucrative Permian Basin  Chevron s substantial Permian holdings of 2 2 million net acres realized production growth of 154 MBOE d in

What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on October 29  2019  Allstate reported EPS of  2 84 versus consensus estimate of  2 52 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 19 91  
For the current fiscal year  Allstate is expected to post earnings of  10 02 per share on  36 4 billion in revenues  This represents a 24 16  change in EPS on a  10 56  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  10 23 per share on  38 02 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 2 04  and 4 46   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Allstate may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Allstate has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 11X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 11 3X versus its peer group s average of 14 2X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 32  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Allstate currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Allstate meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Allstate shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come ",2019-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allstate-all-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200485006,200485006
146846,368362,ALL,Should Value Investors Pick Allstate Corporation  ALL  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Allstate Corporation   NYSE ALL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Allstate Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 93  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 35  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Allstate Corporation s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 13 13  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 27  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Allstate Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 97  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Allstate Corporation s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Allstate Corporation has a P S ratio of about 0 86  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 35 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms     Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Allstate Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ALL a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Allstate Corporation is just 1 32  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 80  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 11 29  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 14 10  Clearly  ALL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Allstate Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B  This gives ALL a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and three lower  while the full year estimate has also seen seven upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has slipped 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 5 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below The Allstate Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAllstate Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 39  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment  estimates and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to Double Each was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar  which provides a great

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Allstate shares have added about 29  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 3  
What s Next for Allstate 
While Allstate has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Allstate was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

ALL is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that ALL is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/all-or-rnr-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200473939,200473939
146921,368437,ALL,Can Allstate  ALL  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Allstate  ALL   This company  which is in the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This insurer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 23 87  
For the last reported quarter  Allstate came out with earnings of  2 18 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 48 per share  representing a surprise of 47 30   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 29 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 30 per share  delivering a surprise of 0 44  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Allstate  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Allstate currently has an Earnings ESP of  4 42   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on October 29  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-allstate-all-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200474152,200474152

146947,368463,ALL,Should Value Investors Buy Allstate  ALL  Stock ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  we focus on our proven ranking system  which places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  to find winning stocks  But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies  so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value  growth  and momentum to find strong companies for our readers 
Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One company to watch right now is Allstate  ALL   ALL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and an A for Value  The stock has a Forward P E ratio of 10 76  This compares to its industry s average Forward P E of 24 77  Over the past year  ALL s Forward P E has been as high as 11 46 and as low as 8 42  with a median of 10 24 
ALL is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1 29  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  ALL s PEG compares to its industry s average PEG of 2 99  ALL s PEG has been as high as 1 38 and as low as 1 01  with a median of 1 23  all within the past year 
Value investors also love the P S ratio  which is calculated by simply dividing a stock s price with the company s sales  This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  so they are often considered a better performance indicator  ALL has a P S ratio of 0 84  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 14 
Finally  we should also recognize that ALL has a P CF ratio of 11 16  This metric takes into account a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 13 54  Over the past 52 weeks  ALL s P CF has been as high as 11 94 and as low as 6 08  with a median of 10 62 
These are only a few of the key metrics included in Allstate s strong Value grade  but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now  When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook  ALL looks like an impressive value stock at the moment ",2019-09-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-buy-allstate-all-stock-200468341,200468341
146948,368464,ALL,What Makes Allstate  ALL  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Allstate  ALL   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Allstate currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ALL that show why this insurer shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For ALL  shares are up 1 99  over the past week while the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 13  compares favorably with the industry s 4 45  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Allstate have risen 2 9   and are up 8 91  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 2 83  and 4 35   respectively 
Investors should also take note of ALL s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  ALL is averaging 1 519 241 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with ALL 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ALL s consensus estimate  increasing from  8 58 to  9 53 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that ALL is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Allstate on your short list ",2019-09-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-allstate-all-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now-200468317,200468317
146949,368465,ALL,ALL Vs  WRB  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Insurance   Property and Casualty stocks are likely familiar with Allstate  ALL  and W R  Berkley  WRB   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Right now  both Allstate and W R  Berkley are sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
ALL currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 34  while WRB has a forward P E of 25 39  We also note that ALL has a PEG ratio of 1 36  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  WRB currently has a PEG ratio of 2 82 
Another notable valuation metric for ALL is its P B ratio of 1 58  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  WRB has a P B of 2 21 
Based on these metrics and many more  ALL holds a Value grade of A  while WRB has a Value grade of C

Allstate  the second largest personal lines insurer in the U S   saw its revenues for the third quarter increase by 1  to  9 03 billion  due primarily to sharp reductions from catastrophic losses and higher rates among its auto insurance products  The company s total property liability net premium jumped by 4 2  to  8 1 billion driven by sharp increases in the Allstate brand premium  At the same time  Allstate s E Surance division saw its net written premium spike by 3 7   following major reductions in marketing expenses 
 The homeowners business continued to generate excellent results due to the repositioning of the business several years ago and low catastrophe losses in the third quarter of 2015   Allstate CEO Thomas Wilson said in a statement   Price increases approved for auto insurance for the first nine months of the year were double the average for the same periods of 2013 and 2014 as we work to lower the auto combined ratio  A reduction in underwriting expenses and a 10  increase in Allstate Financial operating income also benefited earnings  
In total  Allstate reported net earnings of  610 million for the three month period up 2  on a year over year basis from the  598 million it earned in the third quarter of 2014  Allstate also finished with per share earnings of 1 52  significantly above analysts  expectations of 1 31 for the period  During last year s third quarter  Allstate reported earnings per share of 1 39

146970,368486,ALL,In insurance Big Data could lower rates for optimistic tweeters,news,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi ZURICH  Reuters    When people take to Twitter to comment on the great evening they enjoyed with good food and wonderful friends  reducing their monthly insurance bill is probably the last thing on their mind  But such tweets could help insurers to price premiums for individuals  with research suggesting a direct link between positive posts and a reduced risk of heart disease  This could lead to future insurance cover based on  sentiment analysis   in which Big Data and artificial intelligence make predictive models ever more accurate   Swiss Re   S SRENH  says technological advances will cut the price of insurance protection and help individuals and firms make better decisions through programs that offer advice and incentivise improvements in areas such as health and driving  However  detractors fret that such developments could erode customers  privacy or lead to increasingly personalized pricing  undermining the basic principle of insurance   sharing risk  Social media monitoring is one of several advances insurers are examining to improve the pricing of policies  As part of its data push  Swiss Re  the world s second largest reinsurer  has invested in digi me  a startup aiming to let consumers store personal data culled across various social media channels and beyond and to exchange their data with businesses for personalized deals   In a relatively short period of time  maybe a few years  most of the major insurers will have integrated lessons from behavioral research   Swiss Re s head of digital analytics catalysts  Daniel Ryan  told Reuters   Undoubtedly  it will lead to a different interaction between insurer and policyholders   By highlighting  safe behaviors   insurers believe they can reduce claims by helping clients to lead healthier  safer lives  Programs such as Discovery s  J DSYJ  Vitality and Allstate s  N ALL  Drivewise are already putting these policies into practice  REWARDS AND PENALTIES The Vitality health and life insurance program assesses a customer s overall health based on factors from age and blood pressure to diet  exercise and self assessed happiness levels  It then establishes a personalized health improvement plan  tracking users  progress via purchases and wearable devices  Customers gain rewards for making healthier choices  from premium reductions to cash back on health food and discounts on travel bookings  Insurers like Allstate and Britain s Drive Like a Girl offer discounts to motorists who exhibit safe driving behavior after installing a  telematics  tracking device   which collects data on speed  abruptness of braking and time and frequency of use    in their cars   The focus of Drivewise is to give you feedback that can only help your driving and your rates   Allstate says of the program  Rates will never be raised    only reduced or maintained    based on the data  the U S  insurer says  But big data and artificial intelligence do not simply serve to identify  best users   While some insurers won t penalize customers for joining data programs  bad performers in others    those who drive more like a  boy racer  in the British telematics program  for example    will face rate hikes  And as data sharing programs become more ubiquitous  some groups worry that those who are unwilling or unable to make improvements in personal circumstances will ultimately lose out  In September  Britain s markets watchdog dropped plans for a formal market review of whether Big Data might make it harder or more expensive for some customers to buy car and home insurance  saying there was no evidence of that so far   nL8N1BX21Z  But in Germany  with its strong stance on data vigilance and privacy rights  consumer advocates are more reserved  The Federation of German Consumer Organisations  VZBV  sees risks from Big Data in personal insurance outweighing benefits  RISK By assessing individuals  risk more and more accurately  insurers could cherry pick the  good risk  from the bad  leading to increasingly differentiated pricing or coverage denial for some individuals   Such personalized developments would undo the traditional principle of solidarity at the core of insurance  which is designed to spread the financial burden of illness or misfortune between the fit and fortunate and those who face unexpected hurdles or higher medical bills later in life   If I calculate every individual s personal premiums and personal risk  I m no longer spreading risk out collectively   VZBV insurance expert Lars Gatschke said  Insurance could instead become an arbiter of social norms  penalizing individuals for snacking on junk food or taking too few steps  for example  irrespective of their particular circumstances  Gatschke said   On the one hand  there s more and more that can be done and more and more that can be recognized   said Patrick Maeder  finance expert at advisory firm PwC   But on the other hand it s also a matter of protecting the individual and recognizing that certain data is ultimately very personal  It comes down to striking the right balance   Swiss Re s Ryan saw  greater reliance on data sets based on consenting contributions by individuals  as the way forward  Many reinsurers like Swiss Re also focus on collective    as opposed to personalized    results in their business models  In a study cited by the Swiss group last month  researchers found Twitter data alone a more reliable predictor of heart disease than all standard health and socioeconomic measures combined  Geographic regions represented by particularly high use of negative emotion and expletive words corresponded to higher occurrences of fatal heart disease in those communities  Twitter monitoring remains outside Swiss Re s purview  executives said  It would first need rigorous ethical checks before the reinsurer would consider adding it to its underwriting scheme  Even so  as new inputs ranging from social media to call center recordings offer information that could be relevant in ways that individuals may not realize  Chief Executive Christian Mumenthaler saw reason to exercise personal judgment as well  
 I personally would be cautious what I publish on the internet   Mumenthaler has said ",2016-10-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/in-insurance-big-data-could-lower-rates-for-optimistic-tweeters-434085,434085

146973,368489,ALL,All You Need To Know About Allstate  ALL  Rating Upgrade To Strong Buy,opinion,"Allstate  ALL  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Allstate basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Allstate  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Allstate
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this insurer is expected to earn  9 53 per share  which is a change of 18 1  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Allstate  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 6  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Allstate to a Zacks Rank  1 positions it in the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-09-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/all-you-need-to-know-about-allstate-all-rating-upgrade-to-strong-buy-200465740,200465740

147005,368521,ALL,Analysts Estimate Allstate  ALL  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Allstate  ALL  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 58 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  16 8  
Revenues are expected to be  8 92 billion  down 11 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 08  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Allstate 
For Allstate  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  6 50  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Allstate will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Allstate would post earnings of  2 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 30  delivering a surprise of  0 44  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Allstate doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-allstate-all-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200443287,200443287

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Allstate  which belongs to the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry  posted revenues of  10 82 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18 90   This compares to year ago revenues of  10 12 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Allstate shares have added about 23 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for Allstate 
While Allstate has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Allstate was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 10 on  9 20 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  8 64 on  36 56 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  Allstate is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while American Financial Group has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell   This means that ALL s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
ALL currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 18  while AFG has a forward P E of 11 73  We also note that ALL has a PEG ratio of 1 34  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  AFG currently has a PEG ratio of 1 92 
Another notable valuation metric for ALL is its P B ratio of 1 53  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  AFG has a P B of 1 60 
These metrics  and several others  help ALL earn a Value grade of A  while AFG has been given a Value grade of C 
ALL is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that ALL is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-08-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/all-vs-afg-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200450736,200450736

Considering these trends  value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
In addition to the Zacks Rank  investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system  Of course  value investors will be most interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with  A  grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment

ALL is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1 34  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  ALL s industry currently sports an average PEG of 2 89  Over the past 52 weeks  ALL s PEG has been as high as 1 38 and as low as 1 01  with a median of 1 23 
Value investors also love the P S ratio  which is calculated by simply dividing a stock s price with the company s sales  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  ALL has a P S ratio of 0 8  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 12 
Finally  our model also underscores that ALL has a P CF ratio of 11 48  This metric takes into account a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook  This company s current P CF looks solid when compared to its industry s average P CF of 14 06  ALL s P CF has been as high as 11 94 and as low as 6 14  with a median of 10 47  all within the past year

Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Allstate in Focus
Headquartered in Northbrook  Allstate  ALL  is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 20 4  so far this year  The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 5 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 01   This compares to the Insurance   Property and Casualty industry s yield of 1 32  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 93  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 is up 8 7  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Allstate has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 13 27   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Allstate s current payout ratio is 27   This means it paid out 27  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
ALL is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 87 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 9 91  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  ALL is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-06-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allstate-all-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200435285,200435285

So  this combination indicates that Allstate will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Allstate would post earnings of  1 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 24  delivering a surprise of  22 77  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Allstate appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/allstate-all-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q1-release-200410154,200410154

147125,368641,ALL,This Is Why Allstate  ALL  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Allstate in Focus
Headquartered in Northbrook  Allstate  ALL  is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 13 76  so far this year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 46 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 13   In comparison  the Insurance   Property and Casualty industry s yield is 1 6   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 93  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 is up 8 7  from last year  Allstate has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 12 27   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Allstate s current payout ratio is 23   meaning it paid out 23  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for ALL for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  9 28 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 15 01  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  ALL presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-03-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-allstate-all-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200395165,200395165
147126,368642,ALL,Why Is Allstate  ALL  Up 1 1  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Allstate  ALL   Shares have added about 1 1  in that time frame  underperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Allstate due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Allstate Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates Allstate Corporation s fourth quarter 2018 earnings of  1 24 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22 8  but decreased 40 7  on a year over year basis The decrease was due to heavy catastrophe loss as well as a decline in revenues Revenues came in at  9 48 billion  outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 8   The top line was down 5 8  year over year due to a decline in net investment income In the quarter under review  total expenses increased 10 5  year over year to  9 84 billion on higher property and casualty insurance claims  and claims expense and operating costs The company incurred catastrophe loss of  963 million  which was 60 8  higher year over year Total policies in force as of Dec 31  2018 were 113 9 million  up 38 4  year over year Net investment income of  786 million declined 13 9  year over year due to lower fixed income and equity valuations Solid Segmental PerformanceProperty Liability insurance total revenues of  8 3 billion declined 3 9  year over year due to lower investment income  partly offset by increase in premium and other revenues Service Businesses  total revenues were  356 million  up 27  year over year  This upside was primarily driven by higher insurance premium  other revenues and net investment income Allstate Life s total revenues of  495 million increased 2 1  year over year  driven by growth in premiums and other revenues Allstate Benefits  total revenues remained almost unchanged at  292 million as the increase in premium and net investment income was almost offset by realized capital losses Allstate Annuities  revenues of  63 million fell from  375 million in the year ago quarter due to a decline in net investment income and high realized capital losses Share Buyback and DividendAllstate returned  614 million to its shareholders in common stock dividends and repurchased shares worth  2 2 billion in 2018 Capital Position  As of Dec 31  2018 Total shareholders  equity was  21 3 billion  down 5 5  year over year Total assets were  81 3 billion  up 1 9  year over year Long term debt of  6 45 billion increased 1 6  year over year Ratio of debt to equity was 30 3   up 210 basis points year over year Adjusted return on equity of 14 8  expanded 140 basis points year over year  
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates 
VGM Scores
At this time  Allstate has an average Growth Score of C  though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D  However  the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side  putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising  It comes with little surprise Allstate has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-03-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-allstate-all-up-11-since-last-earnings-report-200395517,200395517
147142,368658,ALL,What Makes Allstate  ALL  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Allstate  ALL   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Allstate is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Allstate  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Allstate
For the fiscal year ending December 2019  this insurer is expected to earn  9 24 per share  which is a change of 14 5  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Allstate  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Allstate to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-allstate-all-a-new-buy-stock-200385111,200385111

147156,368672,ALL,ALL Vs  WRB  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Insurance   Property and Casualty sector have probably already heard of Allstate  ALL  and W R  Berkley  WRB   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Allstate is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while W R  Berkley has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ALL likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than WRB has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
ALL currently has a forward P E ratio of 8 98  while WRB has a forward P E of 19 03  We also note that ALL has a PEG ratio of 1 08  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  WRB currently has a PEG ratio of 2 11 
Another notable valuation metric for ALL is its P B ratio of 1 33  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  WRB has a P B of 1 61 
These metrics  and several others  help ALL earn a Value grade of A  while WRB has been given a Value grade of C 
ALL has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than WRB  so it seems like value investors will conclude that ALL is the superior option right now ",2019-01-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/all-vs-wrb-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200373722,200373722
147158,368674,ALL,Is Allstate  ALL  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today 
One company value investors might notice is Allstate  ALL   ALL is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A  The stock is trading with a P E ratio of 9 03  which compares to its industry s average of 23 72  ALL s Forward P E has been as high as 13 42 and as low as 8 42  with a median of 10 74  all within the past year 
ALL is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1 08  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  ALL s PEG compares to its industry s average PEG of 2 80  Within the past year  ALL s PEG has been as high as 1 61 and as low as 1 01  with a median of 1 29 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  so they are often considered a better performance indicator  ALL has a P S ratio of 0 72  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 16 
Finally  we should also recognize that ALL has a P CF ratio of 6 65  This metric focuses on a firm s operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 6 96  ALL s P CF has been as high as 10 01 and as low as 6 18  with a median of 8 34  all within the past year 
These are only a few of the key metrics included in Allstate s strong Value grade  but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now  When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook  ALL looks like an impressive value stock at the moment ",2019-01-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-allstate-all-stock-undervalued-right-now-200374819,200374819
147159,368675,ALL,Earnings Preview  Allstate  ALL  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Allstate  ALL  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 01 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  51 7  
Revenues are expected to be  8 71 billion  down 10 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Allstate 
For Allstate  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 73  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Allstate will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Allstate would post earnings of  2 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 93  delivering a surprise of  11 06  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Allstate doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-allstate-all-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200380644,200380644

147227,368743,ALL,Will Higher Premiums Aid CNA Financial s  CNA  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,CNA Financial Corporation   NYSE CNA   is slated to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 30 before the market opens  In the fourth quarter 2017  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 28 05  Let s see  how things are shaping up for this announcement CNA Financial intensified focus on core competencies in commercial property casualty insurance by shedding reinsurance  personal automobile insurance  life insurance  and group health products as well as reinsuring asbestos and pollution liabilities to lower balance sheet risk CNA Financial continues to well manage its long term care book of business through product claim management thereby mitigating risk as well as effected rate increase CNA Financial is likely to report increased net premiums earned in the soon to be reported quarter  fueled by an increase in new business as well as a solid retention  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at  1 8 billion  reflecting a 7 7  rise from the prior year quarter Notably  the tax cut reducing the tax rate to 21  from 35   is likely to aid the companies  bottom line  boosting margins directly  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to be reported quarter is pegged at 90 cents per share  representing an increase of 3 4  on a year over year basis  CNA Financial is anticipated to witness net investment income growth in the yet be reported quarter  mainly owing to rising interest rates as well as increase in fixed income securities  Also  improved limited partnership returns are estimated to have contributed to this probable increase in investment income The company is likely to witness a considerable improvement in net written premiums  mainly fueled by higher premiums across its segments  namely Commercial and International The property and casualty  P C  insurer boasts an impressive track record of maintaining combined ratio at favorable levels in spite of a challenging operating environment  Improvement in combined ratio signifies superior underwriting discipline Being a P C insurer  CNA Financial has possibly incurred higher catastrophe loss due to unpredictable weather related events in the soon to be reported quarter  This in turn is expected to affect the company s underwriting profitability  hampering the insurer s overall performance to an extent Also  the company probably has suffered higher expenses  primarily due to increasing net incurred claims and benefits plus amortization of deferred acquisition costs  This rise in expenses is likely to restrict the operating margin expansion  hurting the company s overall profitability in turn CNA Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise     What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that CNA Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a bullish Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  CNA Financial has an Earnings ESP of  3 91   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 86 cents  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our  Zacks Rank  CNA Financial carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  a company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise  Thus  this combination leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive We caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate

Welcome to Episode  82 of the Value Investor Podcast
Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks   shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 
She has covered many topics on the podcast including whether or not value investors can buy growth stocks or IPOs and how to figure out the difference between a value stock and a value trap 
But there s another important category that value investors should be aware of  That s the stock that is stuck in no man s land 
What does that mean 
It s the stock that is neither a value stock nor is it a growth stock  Something is missing from the equation  It has no identity 
As a result  these stocks tend to underperform as both value and growth investors shun them 
What do these stocks look like 
Examples of Stocks in No Man s Land
1       Shake Shack   NYSE SHAK    despite the shares tumbling from their post IPO highs  still has a forward P E of 69  It s clearly not a value stock  But is there growth  Sure  it s planning on opening another 35 domestic stores in 2018  But same store sales fell 1 2  in 2017 even as it raised menu prices  Additionally  it expects same store sales to be flat in 2018   Verdict  It s an expensive stock that doesn t have a strong enough growth story 
2      Potbelly   NASDAQ PBPB    is a stock that has gone nowhere for several years  Over the last 2 years  shares of this sandwich chain have fallen 3 2  while the S P 500 was up about 40   Earnings are expected to fall 33  in 2017  But is it cheap  Not even close  It has a forward P E of 34  Verdict  Growth is lethargic  at best  and it s not a value stock 
It s easy for value investors to get stuck in these stocks because they appear to have value characteristics  as often the shares have sold off big 
But a stock plunge doesn t necessarily equal value 
Buying a Real Value and Growth Stock Instead
Tracey ran a screen looking for companies that had both value fundamentals AND double digit earnings growth 
In addition  she added the extra firepower of the Zacks Rank  screening only for Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks  which hopefully means rising earnings estimates 
The screen gave her a list of 56 companies 
Not too shabby 
3 Stocks with the Rare Combination of Growth and Value

147275,368791,ALL,Avoid AXIS Capital  Add These Top 3 P C Insurance Stocks,opinion,AXIS Capital Holdings Limited   NYSE AXS   has been witnessing downward estimate revisions of late  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised 0 2  downward in the last 60 days The stock carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  with an unimpressive  of D  Importantly  back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   comfortably outperform other stocks Shares of AXIS Capital have also underperformed the  in a year s time  The stock has lost 25 9  in contrast to the industry s 21 1  rally as well as the S P 500 index s gain of 21 7  AXIS Capital is set to report fourth quarter results on Feb 7   However  our proven model cannot conclusively show that the company is poised for an earnings beat this season  This is because the company carries a bearish Zacks Rank of 5  which lowers the predictive power of ESP and has an  of  4 27   We need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise Escalating expenses have been a constant concern for AXIS Capital  mainly on higher net loss and loss expenses  general and administrative expenses  higher acquisition costs as well as an increase in interest expense and financing costs  The company experienced a rise of nearly 37  in this metric in the first nine months of 2017  Moreover  the company s pre tax margin has been suffering over the past few years with the metric having contracted 100 basis points  bps  in the first nine months of 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016  Therefore  rising expenses are likely to restrict operating margin expansion  which in turn might hurt the company s overall growth This apart  the property and casualty  P C  insurers faced the biggest brunt of a massive catastrophe loss  having largely impacted the industry and qualifying 2017 as the costliest year in terms of weather related loss  In the first nine months of 2017  the company incurred such losses  amounting to about  700 million that was substantially wider than that of the same period in 2016  Further adding to the woes  the fourth quarter witnessed the Northern California wildfires resulting in catastrophe loss to dent the P C insurers  underwriting profitability  Hence as a P C insurer  AXIS Capital suffered a huge catastrophe loss  weighing heavily on the company s underwriting income and resulting in deteriorating the combined ratio Combined ratio in Insurance segment has been deteriorating since 2013 and in the first three quarters of 2017 the metric deteriorated 2110 bps   Return on equity  a measure of profitability  has been declining over the last few years  Return on equity in the first nine months was  10 3    declining from 10 8  in 2014 In view of the abovementioned catastrophe loss  insurers are likely to experience weak underwriting results  disrupting the overall performance  But there is a silver lining in this catastrophe cloud as insurers braved price hikes  having remained flat in the past several quarters due to a not so active catastrophe environment This apart  the gradual rise in interest rates has benefited the insurance industry  The Federal Reserve delivered its promise to raise the rates thrice in 2017 and has given investors enough hope of a repeat in 2018 Also  the recent tax cut  which reduced the tax rate to 21  from 35   is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a large extent  A lower tax rate would aid the companies  bottom line  boosting margins directly  Additionally  the tax cut is anticipated to make U S  insurers more competitive globally Choosing the StocksWhile AXIS Capital doesn t appear as an attractive pick right now  there are a few solid stocks in the same space promising greater returns  Also  these companies have outperformed the industry s rally in a year We have narrowed down

147276,368792,ALL,4 Momentum Stocks Powered By Driehaus Strategy,opinion,Gutsy investors with higher risk taking propensity could go for momentum stocks that can yield impressive returns  In this context  the Driehaus strategy could be used to select the best momentum stocks using the  buy high and sell higher  principle  The success of this investment approach helped Richard Driehaus secure a place in Barron s All Century Team The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10 year time frames  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  gains registered by the S P 500  Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with this insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus  philosophy It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term Screening Parameters In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of A or B  Our research shows that stocks with a  of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential   Zacks Rank equal to  1 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see     Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2   Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business   Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median  Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks   Last four quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5   Positive EPS surprise indicates potential   Positive   50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks  High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend   Momentum Score equal to or less than B  Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success These few parameters have narrowed down the universe of over 7 890 stocks

Allstate Corporation  NYSE ALL  has steadily risen since breaking out of consolidation following the 2016 elections  On closer inspection there have been three major runs in this trend with two broad consolidations  the second of which was the deepest  Elliott Wave enthusiasts will look at this and see an ending Wave V completed  and look for an A B C correction now  That could happen  And a move under 101 would be a big signal to play the short side  But for now the trend remains higher  Will it break for a 4th leg higher to 117 50 
The stock comes into the week consolidation again under resistance and above the 20 day SMA  The RSI has reset after being technically overbought while the MACD has also reset lower  The Bollinger Bands  are opening to the upside to allow another break to the upside  There is no resistance above 104  Support lower comes at 101 80 and 100 45 then 99 and 94 50  Short interest is low at 1 4   The company is expected to report earnings next on February 7th 
The options market shows the largest open interest at the 70 strike on the put side  an unlikely draw  On the call side open interest is focused from 100 to 105  and then some at 92 50 as well  It suggest about a  4 move by expiration or a range from 100 to 108  The February options  covering the earnings date  open in Monday  April options have the biggest open interest at the 100 call strike

147303,368819,ALL,Should Value Investors Consider Allstate  ALL  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Allstate Corporation   NYSE ALL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Allstate has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 4  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Allstate s current PE ratio somewhat above its midpoint  which is 12 2  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Allstate has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 8  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Allstate has a P S ratio of about 1 0  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is equal to the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years ALL is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Allstate currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ALL a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Allstate is just 2 0  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 2 6  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  ALL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Allstate might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C  This gives ALL a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen six estimates go lower in the past sixty days and one higher  while the full year estimate has seen five upward and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 19 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen about 6 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Allstate Corporation  The  Price and Consensus    This mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAllstate is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  top 44  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to

147349,368865,ALL,Allstate  ALL  Expects Cat Loss To Total  235M In April,opinion,"Property and casualty insurer The Allstate Corporation   NYSE ALL   expects to incur catastrophe loss of  235 million  pretax   153 million after tax   in Apr 2017 The loss may be traced back to 11 events caused last month  While these losses will cost  229 million  pretax  the company expects to incur  6 million of prior period adverse reserve development In the first quarter of 2017  the company incurred catastrophe losses from severe hailstorms of  781 million  which were down 6  year over year Shares of Allstate have been steadily rising on a year to date basis  generating a return of 14 3  compared with the Zacks Insurance  industry s gain of mere 0 05   The outperformance reflects  optimism over the stock from initiatives taken by the company such as  profit improvement plan in its auto business  which was suffering from high auto claims from past many quarters  efforts to diversify its business and product offering at a time when some of its business are facing friction   
As Allstate deals with property and casualty business  it is significantly exposed to catastrophic events  Given the continued occurrence of weather related events  catastrophe losses had surged to  2 35 billion in 2012 and  3 82 billion in 2011  radically exceeding  2 21 billion in 2010 and  2 07 billion in 2009  pushing up claims and benefits  expenses  and hurting cash flow 
In 2013  catastrophe losses declined year over year to  1 25 billion but increased again to  1 99 billion in 2014  In 2015  the company lost  1 72 billion on account of catastrophes and  2 6 billion in 2016 
Allstate is focusing on reducing losses through its catastrophe management strategy and reinsurance programs  while maintaining its underlying combined ratio  However  we cannot rule out the possibility of significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather incidents Catastrophe losses act as a catalyst in the insurance industry s pricing cycle  On the face of it  however  high catastrophe losses dent the industry s margins and cause a spike in the combined ratio which results in underwriting loss  In recent years  the industry amassed ample reserves owing to low catastrophe losses  which led to loose underwriting standards as insurers were compelled to lower their prices  This caused stiff competition and pricing woes in the industry 
Going by a Munich Re report  insured losses due to natural disasters in the United States totaled  23 8 billion in 2016  more than the  16 1 billion total for 2015 
So the rise in catastrophe losses came as a boon for the industry by denting capital and encouraging players to try out disciplined underwriting by hiking premium prices  This should ultimately lead to a hard insurance cycle Allstate carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks are Fidelity National Financial  Inc    NYSE FNF    ProAssurance Corp    NYSE PRA   and State National Companies  Inc    NASDAQ SNC    Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

147350,368866,ALL,Is Allstate Corporation A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put The Allstate Corporation   NYSE ALL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Allstate has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 65  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 50  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Allstate current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Insurance   Property and Casualty sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 31  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Allstate has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 37  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Allstate stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Allstate has a P S ratio of about 0 89  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 18 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  ALL is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Allstate currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Allstate a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  of Allstate comes in at 7 72  which is lower than the industry average of 9 93  Clearly  ALL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Allstate might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives ALL a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unimpressive  Both the current quarter and full year have seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has plunged 13 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Allstate Corporation  The  Price and Consensus
    Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Bottom LineAllstate is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 27  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Insurance   Property and Casualty industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2017-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-allstate-corporation-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200201615,200201615

147365,368881,ALL,How Will Bill O Reilly s Exit Affect 21st Century Fox  FOXA  Stock ,opinion,"On Wednesday  21st Century Fox   NASDAQ FOXA   officially announced that Bill O Reilly  host of American cable news juggernaut The O Reilly Factor  will not be returning to Fox News 
 After a thorough and careful review of the allegations  the Company and Bill O Reilly have agreed that Bill O Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel   21st Century Fox said in a statement 
The O Reilly Factor and its host have been staples in American cable news since 1996  redefining what it means to tell the news  For years  the show has been a huge revenue source for its network  Fox News  and especially its parent company  21st Century Fox 
That was certainly the case up until the  earlier this month that revealed O Reilly has been involved in at least five cases in which he or Fox News settled with women claiming sexual harassment or other inappropriate behavior  The publication said that in total  O Reilly and Fox News shelled out  13 million to settle these claims 
As a result   had either pulled their ads from The O Reilly Factor  though this could be a conservative figure  Mercedes Benz was the first company to pull its ads from the show  calling the allegations  disturbing given the importance of women in every aspect of our business   Other carmakers like Subaru  BMW   Hyundai  Mitsubishi  and Lexus quickly followed suit  Wayfair   NYSE W    Orkin  T  Rowe Price  Allstate   NYSE ALL    and a flurry of healthcare brands such as Advil  Sanofi  PA SASY   and Bayer  DE BAYGN  also pulled their respective ads 
Huge Ad Revenue
According to   The O Reilly Factor brought in roughly  110 8 million in advertising revenue last year  and from 2014 to 2016  the show generated  446 million in ad revenue  Compare that to ad revenue brought in by MSNBC s Rachel Maddow and her show  The Rachel Maddow Show  In 2016  Fox News  rival network s biggest star only managed to bring in  20 7 million 
Fox News makes up about 10  of 21st Century Fox s total revenue including roughly 25  of its operating income and this scandal will likely prove increasingly problematic for the Murdoch brothers  media empire  even though O Reilly is officially out    
The O Reilly Factor averaged 3 98 million viewers per episode during the first quarter of 2017  the most of any prime time cable news show  and  the consensus in the TV news industry is that losing O Reilly s program could drive down ratings for the entire Fox News prime time line up     Luckily for 21st Century Fox  the top two and three cable news shows in prime time are also on Fox News  Tucker Carlson Tonight with Tucker Carlson and Hannity with Sean Hannity 
O Reilly s Not the First
The harassment complaints are on top of separate allegations against Roger Ailes  Fox News  co founder  Last July  former Fox host Gretchen Carlson filed a lawsuit alleging that Ailes pressured her for sex and demoted her when she refused  the suit led to Ailes  ouster as chairman of the network and a  40 million severance package  and Carlson receiving  20 million to settle the charges 
Despite its supposed  zero tolerance  policy regarding sexual harassment  more allegations have piled up against both Ailes as well as O Reilly  and one has to wonder how long it will be before other aspects of 21st Century Fox s business will be affected by the internal crisis at Fox News  The company s impending  of British pay TV provider Sky is still in the works  and the Murdochs lost out on the deal five years ago because the company was entangled in a phone hacking scandal  It s likely James and Lachlan didn t want anything standing in their way this time around 
What s Next for Fox News 
Fox said that Tucker Carlson will take over O Reilly s 8 p m  timeslot  Tucker Carlson Tonight will then be replaced at 9 p m  by Fox s 5 p m  show  The Five  starting on Monday  The O Reilly Factor will continue for the remainder of the week 
But along with O Reilly  popular hosts Megyn Kelly and Greta Van Susteren are also gone since the turmoil began last summer  O Reilly helped Fox News topple CNN  owned by Time Warner   NYSE TWX    back in 2002 to become the cable news leader  staying at the top ratings wise ever since  Now  with three influential hosts gone  in addition to its formidable chairman  it ll be interesting to see what Fox News does in the near future  and how 21st Century Fox handles the likely loss in revenue and power within the media industry

MasterCard Send Platform will enable Allstate claimants to send or receive money through the quickest means possible during any emergency  QuickCard Pay is currently the only payment service that can access all U S  debit card  Non Mastercard debit cardholders  such as consumers of Visa Inc   NYSE V    and American Express Company   NYSE AXP   to name a few  are also eligible for this service 
We appreciate the company s commitment and focus to innovate in keeping with its customers  expectations  Previously  Allstate had launched fast Mobile e Payment to ensure same day payment with just an email address or mobile phone number  The company also remains updated in terms of digitization to better serve its claimants  Hence  we expect QuickCard Pay to further cement customers  faith on the company and add to its goodwill

If you had portfolio insurance in place then you have likely been sleeping well despite the strong moves lower  If you did not it is not too late to buy insurance for your portfolio  Not your typical portfolio insurance  buying put options  But buying this insurance company stock 


Allstate  NYSE ALL  moved off of a low made in January and ran up to  68 before finding resistance in April  Since then it has been consolidating in an ascending triangle pattern  With the Brexit pullback it dropped 3 75  but recovered over a 1 3 of that before the day was over  3 days later it is right back at the high 
The momentum indicators are looking good too  The RSI is running back higher after making a higher low  and the MACD is crossing up and about to go positive  Continued recovery in the broad market could see this move over that resistance at 68  This would give a target to 72 on the break of the triangle  Now that is one way to use insurance against mayhem

147537,369053,ALL,Talon Therapeutics Looks Undervalued Following FDA Approval,opinion,After the announcement of a three month delay of the FDA decision for Marqibo s New Drug Application  shares of Talon Therapeutics  OTC  TLON  initially suffered steep losses  These were reversed in the last couple of months as investors began to look forward to the FDA decision  now set for August 12th   supported by the announced start of a phase III confirmatory study  HALLMARQ  conducted under SPA As the FDA decision approaches once again  it seems that investors are even more optimistic about Marqibo s chances of success  The shares have recently hit a 52 week high of  1 75 apiece  and the company s market cap sits at  37 43 million Marqibo  vincristine sulfate liposomes injection  OPTISOME  is a treatment for the rare cancer known as Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  ALL  in patients that test negative for the Philadelphia Chromosome  ALL only affects about 4 000 new patients and year  with two thirds of cases being in younger children  As you would expect the low incidence of ALL grants Marqibo orphan drug designation and seven years of exclusivity on the drug market Competing drugs for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia include a large number of candidates  but two that are mentioned in an overview of the disease at the Mayo Clinic website are Novartis   NYSE NVS  Gleevec and Bristol Meyers   NYSE BMY  Sprycel  both of which are used for other types of cancer as well  Talon s Marqibo is special  however  since it was developed for use in older adults  aged 60 or older   This demographic has been difficult for conventional ALL therapies  which include radiation and chemotherapy which can cause complications quite easily in older patients In addition  the current line of ALL treatments is only approved for patients that have the Philadelphia chromosome positive form of the cancer  Marqibo targets patients with relapsed Ph  Even with the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee  ODAC  vote back in March 2012 of 7 4  with 2 abstained   which doesn t imply a very high chance of approval on August 12th  I think the severity of ALL and the ability for Marqibo to make a difference in Ph  patients should ultimately tip the balance in favor of approval  This seems to be the expectation of the market  which is sending shares of TLON rapidly higher as we wait for the decision on August 12th There are virtually no shares being shorted relative to the total number of floated shares  so new buyers may want to be cautious about chasing this rally too high for short term trading  Having said that  Marqibo is being developed for other treatments that could expand its revenue generating potential a lot more down the line  This includes front line treatment for aggressive non Hodgkin s Lymphoma and front line treatment for elderly patients with Ph  ,2012-08-13,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/talon-therapeutics-looks-undervalued-following-fda-approval-132708,132708
147538,369054,ALL,Frankenstorm Scares The Markets Closed,opinion,This could prove to be one the most interesting market weeks of the year  assuming the market ever opens  Talk about uncertainty  We can add  Frankenstorm  to the litany of other uncertainties such as the election and its impact on a functional Congress and the ongoing concerns in Europe  Middle East  China  and Japan  As we wrote yesterday  adding to the uncertainty is this week s spate of new economic numbers to add to last week s generally positive economic reports that included much better Durable Goods Orders  and improved New Home Sales  Initial jobless Claims  advance Q3 GDP  and Michigan Sentiment Of course  last week s market was quite negative over some high profile earnings shortfalls and several bleak forecasts  Large cap Value was the worst style cap  off 1 74   while Small cap Value was a surprising best of the worst at  0 64   Maybe it was because many small caps are not impacted by a weak Europe or a slowing China  Another surprise was Technology  leading the sectors at  0 25   probably recovering from some of its huge losses from the week before   Energy took its turn being the worst at  2 1   based on concern about global growth Monday  Personal Income was better than expected  and Personal Spending was even better  rising 0 8   rather than the expected increase of 0 6   Of course with the market closed  no one knows how it would have reacted  although Europe fell on global concerns as well as fear of the damage toll from Frankenstorm   Yesterday  Case Schiller was better than expected  as the housing market continues its slow recovery  Wednesday  we get the ADP employment report and Chicago PMI  Thursday  we get Initial Jobless Claims  Construction Spending  Auto and Truck Sales  Finally  on Friday we get the Payroll report  the monthly Unemployment Report  and Factory Orders   So by Friday  we will know much more about the final storm damage toll  and we ll have a host of new economic reports and corporate earnings reports  which despite the unpleasant ones  still have demonstrated almost the same percentages of earnings surprises as the past few quarters  albeit against lowered earnings  The disturbing note is the continued increase in revenue misses and negative forward guidance  In our opinion  the numbers of negatives have not been as bad as expected before the quarter started   If the majority of the large uncertainties settle on the positive side  it is likely the market will move sharply higher  probably surpassing September s high  If most settle on the negative side  expect a retest of 1375 in the S P 500 or worse  If the uncertainty remains  we expect the market to churn along aimlessly through the year s end  If the market opens today as expected  it is likely to be quite volatile in the first few hours it s best to be patient in your trades  The Fed has stated they will be ready to provide liquidity to the financial market as needed after trading resumes  Below are three stocks for your consideration   The ALLstate Corporation  ALL  reports earnings today after the market close  It s expected to report 606  gain over last year s quarter from  0 16 1 13  The majority of the analysts covering ALL have revised their earnings estimates upward in the last 30 days  bringing the average estimate up from  0 85  a 32  increase  While ALL does have significant exposure to the Eastern seaboard  it s worth considering buying it on a dip  Frankenstorm could prove to provide a good entry point   MetLife  Inc   MET  also reports earnings today of  1 28  up 15  from the  1 11 reported one year ago  Again  most of the analysts covering MET have revised their earnings estimates upward in the last 30 days  As it is the life insurance business  it won t likely see any negative reaction from the storm  And considering the strength of the Financial sector  MET looks like a good investment   United Therapeutics Corporation  UTHR  is expected to report earnings of  1 26  down  8 7  from  1 38 a year ago  UTHR took a 16  drop after the FDA rejected an oral version of their treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension  already in use in injectable forms  We think the sell off was over done  and considering UTHR s excellent forward EPS growth rates  5 year of 22   and the litany of diverse drugs it has in its pipeline  it might be a good time to pick up this high growth drug manufacturer   Disclosure   The author does not hold positions in any of the stocks mentioned in this article ,2012-10-31,David Brown,https://www.investing.com/analysis/frankenstorm-scares-the-markets-closed-141764,141764
