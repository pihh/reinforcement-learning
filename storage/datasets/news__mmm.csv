14726,236241,MMM,Dogs Of The Dow For 2020  Dividend Bargains Or Yield Traps ,opinion,"The New Year is here  which means it s once again time to revisit a contrarian  and income  investing tradition  The  Dogs of the Dow  
This simple yet famous dividend strategy involves buying the 10 highest yielders in the 30 component Dow Jones Industrial Average at the beginning of each year 
It s an income play  sure  but this strategy also has to do with value  The idea  Truly strong blue chip stocks rarely become  obsolete   so high yields often driven by lower prices in the prior year are just a signal that the stocks are oversold and due to bounce back 
It s a win win  in theory  Not only do you get higher than usual income on these blue chips  but you also get them at a good price  The combined income and value upside should make these total return juggernauts 






But theory didn t play out practice last year  as dog lovers left money on the table 
To be fair  it was a rare bit of underperformance for the Dogs  The Dogs have beaten the Dow on a total return basis since 2001  and last year snapped a four year winning streak for the ubiquitous dividend strategy 
But as I look at the 2020 Dogs  it s clear we need to be more discerning 






International Business Machines  NYSE IBM   for instance  hasn t been able to escape the  doghouse  for years  and for good reason  
A couple of months ago  the tech company announced its fifth consecutive quarter of revenue declines  Maybe it s trying to  reclaim the magic  from its 22 quarter sales fail that ended back in 2018 
This Is Not a Recipe for Success 






 Note  The red bars above indicate lower sales year over year  We are dividend investors  but we still require sales growth to fund our payouts over the long term  
Here are three better bets for Dow Dogs in 2020 
3M  NYSE MMM 
Dividend Yield  3 3 
The pain continued for industrial conglomerate 3M  NYSE MMM  in 2019 
Shares of 3M the maker of Post it Notes  Ace brand bandages  Scotch tape  Thinsulate insulation and numerous other commercial and consumer brands have lost almost a third of their value since early 2018  including a single digit loss in 2019 
A huge chunk of the issue has been a mix of global cyclicality weakening growth in China and other emerging markets has weighed heavily on demand for the multinational giant and further Chinese pain thanks to the country s trade war with the U S  Thus  analyst predictions for a small recovery in global growth  paired with the expected Jan  15 signing of a  Phase One  trade deal  should bode well for 3M  NYSE MMM  
Alas  this longtime Dividend Aristocrat has more problems on its plate 
  JPMorgan s Stephen Tusa didn t mince words when he called the company s business model  broken   He called into question billions of dollars spent on restructuring  deeming 3M s problem a  structural issue  that there is generally a higher cost to serve than many appreciate  now seems clear   And on top of that  the company faces mounting legal issues  and costs  over its  PFAS  chemicals  While it has set aside hundreds of millions to cover potential legal costs  some experts are estimating a price tag upward of  10 billion 
3M  NYSE MMM  might have a few bricks taken off its shoulders in 2019  but that s not enough reason to enthusiastically buy this troubled Dog of the Dow 
3M  NYSE MMM  Is Undergoing a Painful  Normalizing 






Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA 
Dividend Yield  3 1 
Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  was the worst performer in the Dow last year  at  11  including dividends  and in fact has been dead money since 2015 
It s Like You re Being Taxed Just to Hold Walgreens  WBA 






Much of the pain came on a 12  single day drop in April after the company reported what CEO Stefano Pessina called  the most difficult quarter we have had since the formation of Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA    Second quarter earnings fell short of expectations  and the company was forced to cut its full year outlook amid weak performance on numerous fronts 
Walgreens  situation is so tenuous that the company has been trying to entice KKR   Co   KKR  into executing a leveraged buyout to take the drugstore private  But analysts called shenanigans on the logistics of the deal  and in December  The Wall Street Journal reported that it had run into financing issues 
  so WBA s 3  plus payout looks attractive on that front  And Walgreens is trading at a dirt cheap 9 6 times forward earnings estimates  But given that profits are expected to decline this year  and the company is otherwise rudderless  investors  best hope of significant gains in 2020 would seem to be a buyout   one that looks less likely than it did a couple months ago 
Verizon  NYSE VZ 
Dividend Yield  4 0 
Verizon  NYSE VZ  is participating in one of the more exciting investing mega trends of the new decade  the roll out of 5G technology 
5G is the next generation of communications tech what many expect to usher in an explosion of the Internet of Things  and general connectivity with the world around us  And Verizon  NYSE VZ  is widely considered to be leading U S  telecoms  push to get that infrastructure up and running 
It sounds good  And for infrastructure REITs such as American Tower  NYSE AMT  and Crown Castle  NYSE CCI   and communications chipmakers such as Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   it is good  and should lead to tangible growth  But at least in 2020  the pros  expectations for Verizon  NYSE VZ  look no different than recent years  low single digit gains on the top and bottom lines 
That s also problematic given issues with its core business  MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett points out troubling signs including shrinking margins  slightly higher customer churn and even questions about whether Verizon  NYSE VZ  indeed has the best network 
Verizon  NYSE VZ  is a de facto utility  and it at least pays out cash like one  Its 4  yield is one of the most respectable among the 30 Dow stocks 
This Isn t Normal 






But note the chart above  I frequently discuss how  over time  but we have a situation in Verizon  NYSE VZ  where we might be due for the same process in reverse where VZ the stock  slows down  to its glacial dividend growth 
Even worse is the fact that Verizon s payout is growing as slowly as many Dividend Aristocrats  but the telecom only has a 13 year streak under its belt  That bodes poorly for future hikes  which I expect to be nominal 
We can do better than Verizon  NYSE VZ   In fact  we can triple or even quadruple the yields most investors bank from their lame blue chips by following my  perfect  income strategy 
 Perfect  Retirement Income   Start 2020 By Quadrupling Your Yield
The Dogs of the Dow feed into one of the most common mistakes that  first level  retirement investors  buying the overcrowded  overpriced blue chips that financial talking heads prop up as safe bets year in and year out 
But they re not safe  There s nothing  safe  about not making enough income to take care of your most basic needs 
 Safe  is being able to afford your home  your utilities and a high quality of life even if the stock market doesn t cooperate  And you can lock up that level of safety from the dividend rich stocks in my 
Nest eggs are being stretched paper thin because medical innovations are helping us live longer than ever before  meaning retirement accounts have to last far longer than they were ever intended to  But this is 2020  not 2000  10 year Treasuries don t pay 6 6  anymore   they pay 2 6   The 2  3  yields on most Dow stocks just won t cut it  either 
Instead  investors   especially those with more modest nest eggs   need roughly 3x to 4x the yield of the broader market  And those substantial income checks need to survive not just through 2021 or 2022  but literally decades down the road 
My Perfect Income Portfolio offers exactly that  In fact  several of my readers have emailed me to tell me this portfolio has literally doubled  tripled  or in a few cases actually quadrupled their annual income 
Also  this is a buy and hold portfolio  This isn t a crazy options tactic or a set of short term swing trades  It s just a set of under the radar  contrarian income plays that can quickly build your wealth without piling on the extra risk of gambling on newspapers and dying retailers 






Too good to be true  Look at this strategy s past 10 years of returns  and you ll see why I call it the  
What really makes this group of stocks stand out is that it s so much more than high headline yield  This portfolio checks off a bundle of vital retirement boxes 
It gives you a safe  secure  and steady income of  10s of thousand per year in cash not just  paper gains  It pays out more than enough to live on from dividends without drawing down your savings or assets You avoid overly complex  high risk investments that can wipe out decades of hard earned money in a matter of weeks or months You re not involved in any risky options  spread bets  or day trading It s simple to set up and simple to manage  That way you re not glued to your screen all day  Go out  Enjoy life  Your check ll be in the mail Don t lie awake anymore worrying about your yo yo ing net worth  Instead  let me teach you more about this incredible strategy  including its dominant track record  In fact  I ll even let you hear it from the mouths of other investors that have reaped market smashing gains from my research service

14728,236243,MMM,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Exxon Mobil  Verizon  Chevron  Pfizer And 3M,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  January 2  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Exxon Mobil Corporation   NYSE XOM    Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    Chevron Corporation   NYSE CVX    Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   and 3M Company   NYSE MMM   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog 5 Dogs of the Dow for 2020The year 2019 was exceptionally good for the Dow  with the blue chip index surging 20  or more  The index had registered several record highs  and is now on track to mark its best year since 2013  In fact  it steered past the coveted 28 000 mark for the first time in its 120 year history on Nov 15 The index gained traction from easy monetary policies as well as mostly positive economic data  defying fears of a recession that many investors had at the end of 2018  Needless to say  progress toward a January trade agreement between the United States and China  and the USMCA trade deal to replace NAFTA also helped the Dow walk away with some solid gains this year With the Dow doing so good  it surely has been a tough time for conservative investors to keep up  Particularly  those who applied the Dogs of the Dow strategy haven t had an encouraging year  After all  collectively the Dogs of the Dow have been able to gain around 14   less than what the overall blue chip index has done so far But the Dogs of the Dow strategy didn t produce returns as per expectations  This is simply because the strategy generally tends to focus on selecting the top 10 Dow components on the basis of the highest dividend yield at the beginning of the year  And we all know that dividend players tend to perform comparatively well when there is gyration in the market  which wasn t the case in 2019   Most importantly  the Dogs of the Dow strategy left out the strongest tech players this year like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   leading to underperformance This year  the iPhone maker benefited from momentum in its non iPhone businesses  particularly Services and Wearables  strong adoption of Apple Pay and growing Apple Music subscriber base  Needless to say  the company has done so good this year that its goal of  51 billion in services revenues is now very much within reach  Apple s service revenues had already grown to  46 29 billion  as of the third quarter When it comes to Microsoft  its new subscription model  Azure  and promising new products generated sizeable cash flows this year  To top it  Microsoft s gaming segment  including Xbox Live  Game Pass subscriptions and Mixer also helped the trillion dollar plus company gain traction  Notably  acquisitions like PlayFab and GitHub helped Microsoft expand its total addressable market Shares of Apple and Microsoft have jumped 84 9  and 55 2   respectively  over the past year  Have a look  But does this mean that the Dogs of the Dow are dead as we head toward 2020  The answer is certainly not  This is because market pundits believe that that there are quite a few reasons for the U S  stock market to not continue the double digit annual returns next year  This is primarily because the market currently seems to be overvalued  trading at around 19 times earnings  and thus doesn t have much room to run Also  the United States for most part of next year will face political uncertainty  eventually leading to gyrations in the stock market  But  it s not just political risks that should bother investors  Rapid increase in government borrowing along with threat of more taxes and stringent regulations may jeopardize the U S  stock market performance But Dogs of the Dow have large customer base  sustainable business model  and a long track of profitability and strong liquidity  which allows them to offer sizable yields on a regular basis  regardless of market direction  Thus  we present to you five top Dogs of the Dow that should benefit as we head into 2020 Exxon Mobil Corporationexplores for and produces crude oil and natural gas  It operates through Upstream  Downstream  and Chemical segments  Exxon Mobil has a dividend yield of 4 98   It has a five year average dividend yield of 3 78  The company  currently  has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Its expected earnings growth rate for the next quarter and year is 36 4  and 31 4

risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions Finally  please note that throughout today s presentation  we will be making references to certain non GAAP financial

Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Bruce  Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us  Our team executed well in the fourth quarter and delivered results that were in line with our expectations  Although we continue to face growth challenges in certain end markets  our focus on productivity and cost management help generate solid underlying margins and robust cash flow with a conversion rate of 186   We also continue to build  invest and transform for the long term success of 3M Earlier today  we issued a press release on the next big phase of our transformation journey  a new global operating model and streamlined organizational structure  which I will discuss in more detail  Today  I will also provide an update on our ongoing commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship including PFAS  Later in the call  I will come back to discuss our full year performance  including record cash flow and good progress on our strategic priorities  along with our outlook for 2020 where we expect to return to growth Please turn to Slide 5  where I will begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results  Organic growth companywide in the fourth quarter was minus 2 6  in line with our guidance  We continue to face softness in certain end markets  namely China  automotive and electronics  which impacted overall growth  We delivered adjusted earnings of  1 95 per share  which includes a  0 20 Q4 restructuring charge that I will discuss shortly  Excluding that charge  we delivered EPS of  2 15 at the high end of our guidance  Finally  we generated underlying margins of 20 7   which includes a 140 basis point impact from the Acelity acquisition  while reducing inventory levels by  115 million  Overall  I m pleased with our team s execution and our ongoing progress in driving operational improvements Please turn to Slide 6  I have talked to you often about the strength and vitality of the 3M value model  We have deep competitive advantages  unique technology platforms  advanced manufacturing  leading brands and global capabilities  all of which make 3M greater than the sum of our parts  At the same time  we constantly evolve and build on our foundation  which we are doing through our four strategic priorities including transformation  Over the last several years  we have been on a journey to transform how we serve our customers  how we work and how we compete  The deployment of our ERP system has enabled new standardized business processes  new service models and new digitalization capabilities across 3M In EMEA and Canada  where we are furthest along in our transformation  we are seeing enhanced customer service  improved margins  better use of data analytics and lower inventories  We are starting to see the same improvements in service  analytics and inventories in the US as well  which gives us continued confidence in our transformation journey  Importantly  our progress has enabled us to realign the company and further leverage our transformation capabilities  As you know  in April of last year  we moved from five to four business groups to better align around our customers and our four go to market models  This was the first step in our realignment  Since then  we have been working on reorganizing the entire company around our new business groups to take full advantage of our new capabilities On January 1  we implemented a new streamlined global operating model designed to improve growth and operational efficiency  In the new model  our business groups now have full responsibility for all facets of strategy  portfolio and resource prioritization across our entire global operations  Under the prior model  area and country teams had responsibility for setting priorities in their respective regions  part of a distinct international organization  Now  all of our international people report directly into the business groups and functions that they are part of  and there is no longer a separate international team  This new model has clear benefits to both 3M and our customers First  it will drive more accountability to our business groups to strengthen performance and serve both global and local customers  Second  it will enable stronger customer insights in order to drive more powerful innovation  Third  it will empower our people with more freedom to make decisions and increase speed and service to our customers  Fourth  it will make us more efficient and help us continue to drive margin expansion by reducing layers  streamlining structure and simplifying reporting lines  Finally  it will allow us to leverage similarities across markets  while maintaining the robust local capabilities and expertise that help differentiate 3M 3M has both experience and success operating in a global model such as this For several years  our electronics and auto OEM businesses have operated in a global model and we ve seen stronger customer alignment along with better service  innovation and efficiency  In addition to our new model  we also made changes in 2019 to the way we support our business groups  To optimize the customer experience in each of our go to market models  we consolidated manufacturing  supply chain and customer operations into a seamless end to end enterprise operations organization  This team plays a critical role in tailoring service and expertise to the needs of our customers and has been a key driver in enabling us to reduce inventory levels  We also brought together key capabilities around the world as part of a new global corporate affairs organization  in order to advance our brand and reputation and build on our history as one of the best places to work around the world As a result of these actions  today we are announcing a restructuring charge as we move quickly to our new alignment  The restructuring includes streamlining our organization by reducing approximately 1 500 positions  spanning all business groups  functions and geographies  On a pre tax basis  we took a restructuring charge of  134 million in Q4  and we expect annual pre tax savings of  110 million to  120 million  with  40 million to  50 million in 2020 In our new structure  we will also report geographic results under three areas  beginning in Q1 of 2020  the Americas  Europe Middle East Africa  and Asia Pacific  with the same level of detail and transparency as we always have  Ultimately  as I ve communicated to all 3M ers  this is a defining moment for our enterprise  We are modernizing how we run our business and building an organization for the future  And I am more confident than ever in our journey to transform into a more agile  more efficient and more competitive enterprise Please turn to Slide 7  Being a leader in sustainability and environmental stewardship is core to 3M and is a value that matters deeply to our employees  our stakeholders and to me personally  We started our groundbreaking Pollution Prevention Pays program more than 40 years ago  and we have continued to step up our leadership to address climate and environmental challenges  Last year we moved our St  Paul headquarters to 100  renewable electricity  while committing to move our entire global operations to renewable energy by 2015 3M also produces a broad range of solutions that help our customers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from our smog reducing roofing granules to our films that make homes  electronics and automobiles more energy efficient  From a governance perspective  we are also strengthening oversight of strategies related to sustainability  R D and commercialization In November  our Board established a science  technology and sustainability committee to ensure we are building on our strong innovation capabilities while advancing our already high standards for product and environmental stewardship  This commitment to sustainability includes stewardship of water  one of our most precious resources  As part of our responsibility  we are proactively managing PFAS  guided by the principles of sound science  corporate responsibility and transparency We are committed to being part of the solution to ensure communities have confidence in their water  This includes  addressing contamination at sites where we produced or disposed of PFAS  In addition  we will work with our customers and our other stakeholders in connection with other sites where PFAS concerns exist  Our efforts under these commitments led to a litigation related pre tax charge of  214 million in the fourth quarter  split roughly equally between the following two items First  we updated our assessment of environmental matters and litigation related to our manufacture and disposal of PFAS  which included expanding our evaluation to other 3M sites that may have used certain PFAS material  Second  we updated our assessment of customer related litigation based on ongoing settlement discussions  At the same time  we continue to work with the EPA and other authorities to ensure we are fulfilling our ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship As previously disclosed  in 2019  3M discovered and voluntarily informed the EPA and appropriate state authorities that discharges from our Decatur  Alabama facility may not have complied with permit requirements  We immediately idled the relevant processes and took steps to address these issues  In connection with our Decatur disclosures  3M received a grand jury subpoena from the US Attorney s Office for the Northern District of Alabama in late December  2019  and we are cooperating with this inquiry  In addition  in Q4 of 2019  as part of our compliance assessment of similar sites  we identified and also disclosed to the EPA and appropriate state authorities similar discharge issues at our Cordova  Illinois facility  We continue to support the EPA and the Alabama and Illinois state environmental authorities to help resolve these matters We have a strong cross functional team in place that is actively managing our environmental stewardship and PFAS  And moving forward  we will continue to update you as developments unfold  If you haven t already  I encourage you to visit our PFAS stewardship website  which can be found on our Investor Relations site under the heading About 3M That wraps up my opening remarks  I will come back to discuss our full year performance along with our 2020 guidance after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter  Nick Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Mike  and good morning everyone  I ll start on Slide 8  with a recap of our fourth quarter sales performance  Fourth quarter organic sales declined 2 6   Volumes were down 340 basis points  while selling prices were up 80 basis points  The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by 5 1 percentage points  while foreign currency translation was a 40 basis point headwind to sales  All in fourth quarter sales in US dollars grew 2 1  versus last year Looking at growth geographically  US organic growth declined 3   primarily due to declines in the Transportation and Electronics and Safety and Industrial businesses  Asia Pacific declined 3  in Q4 with Japan down 7   primarily due to a decline in our Electronics business  Organic growth was up 1  in China  This result is primarily due to last year s easier comparison  EMEA declined 3  while Latin America  Canada was flat Please turn to Slide 9 for the fourth quarter P L highlights  Companywide  fourth quarter sales were  8 1 billion with adjusted operating income of  1 5 billion  Adjusted operating margins were 19   which included a negative 170 basis point impact from restructuring  Considering this impact fourth quarter operating margins were right in line with our expectations On the right hand side of this slide  you see the components of our margin performance in the fourth quarter  Lower organic volumes and our continued efforts to reduce inventories to improve cash flow were both headwinds to margins year over year  Partially offsetting these headwinds were benefits from our Q2 restructuring actions  In total  these factors resulted in a 110 basis point reduction to margins versus last year s fourth quarter Acquisitions and divestitures combined reduced margins by 140 basis points mainly related to our acquisition of Acelity  Higher selling prices along with slightly lower raw material costs contributed 70 basis points to fourth quarter margins  And finally  foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by 10 basis points Let s now turn to Slide 10 for a closer look at earnings per share  Fourth quarter adjusted earnings were  1 95 per share  and as Mike noted included a  0 20 impact from our Q4 restructuring  which was not factored into our prior guidance  Accounting for this item  earnings were  2 15 per share  right in line with the high end of our guidance range Looking at the components of our year on year earnings performance  The net impact of organic growth  inventory reductions and other items I covered on the prior slide reduced fourth quarter per share earnings by  0 13  Acquisitions and divestitures combined  reduced fourth quarter earnings by  0 11 per share versus last year  primarily due to Acelity  Please note that this result includes the impacts of both financing and tax costs  Well early  Acelity is off to a good start as our team delivered results better than expected Turning to tax rate  Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 20 3  versus 20 5  last year  As noted with acquisitions  M A and restructuring categories in this table include their own year on year tax impacts with the remaining impact of  0 05 reflected in this line  And finally average diluted shares outstanding declined 1 7  versus Q4 last year  adding  0 03 to per share earnings Please turn to Slide 11 for a look at our cash flow performance  As Mike noted  we delivered another quarter of robust free cash flow with fourth quarter free cash flow of  1 8 billion  For the full year  free cash flow increased 10  to  5 4 billion as our teams delivered strong working capital management throughout 2019  Fourth quarter conversion was 186   which included a 27 percentage point benefit from the significant litigation related charges  Fourth quarter capital expenditures were  538 million  with the full year totaling  1 7 billion  Also during the fourth quarter we returned  1 billion to shareholders via dividends and gross share repurchases  And for the full year we returned  4 7 billion Please turn to Slide 12  where I will summarize the business group performance for Q4  I will start with our Safety and Industrial business  which declined 2 8  organically in the quarter  Our Personal Safety and Industrial Minerals businesses delivered mid single digit organic growth in the quarter  while the balance of the portfolio declined  Looking geographically  organic growth increased in Latin America  Canada while Asia Pacific  the US and EMEA each declined  Safety and Industrial s fourth quarter operating margins were 20 9   Overall  margins continued to be solid when considering negative organic growth  inventory reductions and restructuring impacts Moving to Transportation and Electronics  As expected  fourth quarter sales were down 5 9  organically compared to last year  impacted by end market softness worldwide  Our electronics related businesses showed sequential improvement  despite year over year being down mid single digits organically as demand remained soft in consumer electronics and factory automation end markets  Our automotive OEM business was down 5   a bit better than fourth quarter global car and light truck builds  which were down 6   Transportation and Electronics fourth quarter operating margins were 20 8   Similar to Safety and Industrial  margins were impacted by lower sales  inventory reductions and restructuring Turning to our Health Care business  Organic growth was flat year over year against last year s strong comparison  Growth was led by mid single digit increases in health information systems and food safety  Medical Solutions  our largest business was up slightly  while oral care declined low single digits in the quarter  Looking geographically  growth was led by Latin America  Canada and EMEA  while the US declined  Health Care fourth quarter operating margins were 21 3  impacted by nearly 8 percentage points from the combination of the MModal and Acelity acquisitions along with restructuring  Taking these factors into account  margins were up 100 basis points year over year Lastly  fourth quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was flat  Sales were led by mid single digit growth in home improvement and low single digit growth in home care  while stationery and office and consumer healthcare declined  Looking at Consumer geographically  Latin America  Canada grew mid single digits  The US was up nearly 1   while EMEA and Asia Pacific declined  Consumers operating margins were a strong 23 4   up 3 percentage points year over year driven by portfolio and footprint actions we have been executing in this business That wraps up our review of fourth quarter results  Please turn to Slide 13  and I ll hand it back over to Mike  Mike Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Nick  As I look at 2019  I m encouraged how our team responded to the challenges we faced in our end markets  Stepping up our execution  improving operations and driving strong cash flow as we move through the year  We finalized the restructuring we announced in April  effectively managed costs and reduced inventory levels by  370 million With respect to the full year numbers  organic growth companywide was minus 1 5   We posted adjusted earnings of  9 10 per share  which included a  0 21 benefit from the divestiture of our gas and flame detection business  We increased cash flow by 10  year over year to  5 4 billion  an all time high for our enterprise  while delivering a strong conversion rate of 118   Additionally  we posted a good return on invested capital of 18   including the impact of acquisitions  In 2019  we also returned  4 7 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases  And last year marked our sixty first consecutive year of dividend increases Please turn to Slide 14  Beyond financial results  I view 2019 as a fundamentally significant year for 3M  as we implemented major change to position us well for the future  Earlier I talked about how we are accelerating the pace of our transformation  And we also made significant progress on our other three priorities for long term growth and value creation  I ll make a few comments on each  starting with portfolio  The ongoing review and reshaping of our portfolio is critical to maximizing value across our company  Since 2012  we have moved from 40 businesses to 23  while completing more than 10 divestitures and 14 acquisitions In 2019  we continued to actively manage our portfolio with particular progress in strengthening our Health Care business  We acquired Acelity  which accelerates 3M as a leader in advanced wound care along with MModal s technology business  an ideal fit within our Health Information Systems business  The integration of Acelity is going well and the business is off to a good start  And MModal is outperforming our expectations for both growth and income  We also announced that we will divest our drug delivery business which will enable us to focus more resources on our core Health Care portfolio  Beyond our efforts in Health Care  last year we sold our gas and flame detection business and earlier this month  we finalized the sale of our ballistic protection business  Managing our portfolio is an ongoing process  and we will continue to act on opportunities to maximize value across 3M Our next priority is innovation  which is the heart of our enterprise  It differentiates 3M in the marketplace and supports organic growth and our long track record of delivering premium margins and return on invested capital  In 2019  we invested  3 6 billion in the combination of R D and capex  These investments enable us to invent unique products and solutions and then deliver them efficiently to our customers through our disruptive manufacturing process technologies  Yet  it is more than the breadth of our technology that sets us apart  It s also our ability to share  combine and apply our technologies across 3M businesses  Our adhesives for example are in cars and airplanes  electronics and medical tapes and in the products you are most familiar with such as Command Strips and Post it Notes  And as the needs of our customers evolve  we constantly develop new capabilities and applications to stay at the forefront of innovation Last year  we expanded our periodic table to 51 technology platforms  as we further refined our expertise in areas like meta materials  computer vision and advanced robotics  We also continue to see strong returns from investments in our priority growth platforms  which serve emerging and fast growing markets  For the full year these platforms grew 10  as we create differentiated solutions for customers around Health Care  Transportation  Safety and infrastructure  For example  automotive electrification grew 9  as we continue to drive good penetration with particular strength in automotive displays and lightweighting solutions  Going forward  we will continue to use 3M innovation to solve tough problems for our customers  improve people s lives and help create a more sustainable world Turning now to people and culture  which is foundational to each of our other priorities  In 2019  we took significant action to develop our people and invigorate our culture  And the transformation initiatives I discussed earlier are at the center of our efforts  Our transformation journey is as much a cultural change as it is a technology change  We are simplifying workflows  equipping our people with new systems and tools and empowering them with more autonomy to make faster decisions  Given the level of transformation within 3M  a key focus of our development is managing change  And I am pleased how our team is stepping up to embrace these changes At the same time we are deepening our commitment to 3M s core values including diversity and inclusion  60  of our top 100 leaders are diverse  One third of our corporate officers and board members are women  And we are doing more to integrate inclusion into our daily life  Of course  underpinning everything we do is our code of conduct  And last year 3M again was named one of the world s most ethical companies  Overall  I m pleased with the progress we ve made against each of our strategic priorities in 2019  And I am confident in how we are positioned heading into 2020 Please turn to Slide 15  As a result of our work  we are well positioned to return to growth in 2020  Our plan reflects our improved performance and an expectation for low but positive global macroeconomic growth  We anticipate organic growth of flat to 2   along with earnings of  9 30 to  9 75 per share  We expect another year of robust cash flow with a conversion rate of 95  to 105   Finally  we anticipate a strong return on invested capital of 18  to 21   In the appendix of our slide presentation  you will find additional details on our guidance  including a breakdown of our expectations for organic growth by business group and area Before turning to Q A  I have one additional announcement  Our Executive Vice President of International  Julie Bushman  has informed us of her intend to retire in April  Throughout her 36 years at 3M  Julie has been an exceptional leader and has created tremendous value for our company and our shareholders  Julie s leadership has been invaluable throughout her time leading our international team  including her role and working closely with me to lead the transformation announcements we discussed today  I thank Julie for her many years of service and many contributions That concludes our prepared remarks  and we will now take your questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research  Please proceed with your question Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystHey  good morning guys Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Scott Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystAs far as the    I mean there is some noise out there with this virus in China and stuff and you sell a fair amount of products into the benefit  but at the same time there some offsets and slower growth in China overall  but when you think about Mike the cadence of returning growth in 2020  is there a sense of when    is it 1Q  you start to get into some easier comps or is it more toward the back end of the year Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  Scott  I would start with the model for returning growth in 2020 is based on that that broader macro    that outlook for the broader macro  It also is looking at some of those key markets that we ve talked about that were challenges for us in 2019  China for example  one of the challenges in 2019  we see that in our model for 2020 returning to low to mid single digit growth for the total year  In both cases  I would say we see growth strengthening as we move through the year  So Q1  the positive growth for the overall enterprise in the middle range    middle of the overall guidance of the range  maybe a little slightly lower end of the guidance of the range And China in particular  before we got to the last couple of weeks with the Coronavirus really becoming the focus  we were looking at a sluggish start to China in first quarter really based on automotive and the build rates expected to be down mid single digits  and maybe even high single digits  And so it s    that was kind of our pacing  Now Coronavirus  it s kind of changing things as we go  And we re seeing    what you re seeing    we re seeing increased demand for our respiratory protection products and we re ramping up our production worldwide in China around the world to meet that demand  At the same time we re seeing what everybody else is seeing that there is businesses are shutting down  extending their shutdown beyond Lunar New Year  So we re really watching day to day what that s going to mean for our outlook for China  But I ll give you kind of the frame we had and then how we re kind of looking at it as we see the updates day by day Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  Mike  And just as a quick follow up  Will Acelity be accretive to your growth rate in 2020  Will that be above your guidance range in your view Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo  Scott  This is Nick  We    Acelity is of course incorporated in the guidance that we re giving there  Throughout the year most of its growth will be coming through what we report for acquisitions versus organic growth  But when we compare it to the underlying growth that was a revenue that was there before we acquired it  we see its growth as accretive to the overall 3M growth rate that we re projecting Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystOkay  Super helpful  Thanks  Good luck  guys Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Scott OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research  Please proceed with your question Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystThanks  good morning Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Nigel Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystHey  So just wanted to touch on the the additional PFAS charge here  I mean  I think I understand the Alabama and Illinois plant issues  but what s the trigger for the customer litigation charge  I mean there obviously has to be a trigger to get you to recognize that charge  Maybe just touch on    there s obviously about speculation about EPA regulation  Where do you stand on that issue Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So maybe I ll take the charge first  Nigel  We played out in the prepared remarks that there are two aspects to the charge  One is our ongoing commitment to resolve the issues where we manufacture and dispose the PFAS  The other part of the charge is related to really ongoing negotiations with customers  As part of our commitment is to do our part to help customers address the PFAS issues they face  and we ve got our negotiations and mediation as far enough along that we can identify what s probable and estimable around a group of customers  It s multiple customers  it does account for the Wolverine cases that we ve been    we ve talked about in the past  but it s multiple customers and really the next step of what we can understand is probable and estimable So then in working with    one of the commitments we did make in last fall is to work in support of the EPA as we move forward with their regulatory plan around PFAS  They ve got a    they ve laid out a plan to move forward  We are working to support that with our investment and research and understanding    helping the understanding of PFAS providing our data and really doing things like helping to provide a clearinghouse for all of the information and data around PFAS  And so we continue to be working in support of the EPA in our work on our resolving  our manufacturing disposal sites  and then also on moving the regulatory standards forward Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystThank you  And a quick follow on the 2020 guidance  On the cash flow the  5 3 billion to  6 billion of free cash flow  are you simply assuming delevering of the balance sheet in the bridge Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Nigel  we re not  As we end    ended  19  we had debt to EBITDA ratio of roughly    just a little over 2 5 times  We see that coming down probably about 50 basis points to be 2 times or just slightly over 2 times debt to EBITDA  So that that s part of our overall capital structure planning in 2020 Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  Thanks  Nick  Thanks  Mike OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed with your question Joseph Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks  Good morning everyone Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Joe Joseph Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey Mike  can you expand a little bit on the commentary on this    the new restructuring initiative that you have in place and how that differs from business transformation  fully recognizing that it sounds like you re streamlining the organization as well  But any additional color you can provide there would be helpful Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  And Joe  what I laid out is really the next phase of our transformation journey and it s taking advantage of everything that we ve done  Deploying the ERP  the ecosystem around it  the service models that we put in place  the capabilities  the technical capabilities to really manage our business  digitize a lot of what we do to manage our operations in our business processes and so it became clear that we could take full advantage of that with how we operate our businesses globally  And last spring  we announced moving from five to four businesses  at the time  it was looked like realignment of the company  but where does it go and this is really the next part of the story We aligned around our customers and our go to market models and with the launch    in the New Year of the new model  we are going to operate globally around those go to market models  And that includes how we operate our businesses everywhere around the world and includes taking advantage of the capabilities we ve put in place with business transformation in it  It also includes this really consolidation of our manufacturing supply chain and customer operations and the end to really optimize for those go to market model  So it s a significant change and really how we align the customers  how we bring our innovation to market  how we streamline and simplify 3M around the world  It s    it is taking advantage of business transformation  but it s really multiplying that impact as we move ahead Joseph Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  Thank you  And then maybe just my follow on  focused on the Transportation and Electronics segment  Clearly that s a segment that had a tough 2019  And I think that there is some optimism in 2020 that will potentially start to see a rebound  particularly in the electronics side of things  And so if we were to start to see better growth  what kind of operating leverage would you guys expect to see out of that business  And in your commentary Mike  earlier around positive organic growth in the first quarter  is this a segment that is also going to be positive in Q1 Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Joe  let me take that one  First of all from    to the second part of your question  Transportation and Electronics  we ve    for the year we ve guided that negative 2  to positive 2  organic growth  Our view right now as we see all four quarters in that range  Right now  and just to go a little off track  the Safety and Industrial business is the only one that we see a potential that that one would be below its range in the first quarter and then in the next three quarters within the range that we ve guided As far as leverage that we expect in Transportation and Electronics  this is one of the businesses where as we see us returning to growth in that that this would be accretive and would be adding to our leverage that we see that  A specific percentage  we typically don t put out  but it would be beneficial and we d see the margins  the accretive margins there very similar to what we see for the total company  that as we rebuild the revenue there that we would be seeing that maybe an extra 10  going to increasing the margin as that as the revenue improves there Joseph Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  Thank you both OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America  Please proceed with your question David Ridley Lane    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGood morning  This is David Ridley Lane on for Andrew Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  David David Ridley Lane    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGood morning  Can you provide details on how your core gross margin will trend in 2020 given the unusual inventory related effect in 2019 Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  The gross margins and our overall margins  but a part of    a big part of it will be our    through our gross margin improvement  We see overall operating margins improving 50 to 100 basis points in 2020  And in the first quarter  we expect them to be roughly flat prior to the impact of Acelity  Acelity we again    we    because that was not part of our base in the first quarter  we expect that will be a negative impact to our total company margins of about 100 basis points in the first quarter  and will impact Health Care s margins by 400 to 500 basis points in the first quarter  But the underlying margins in first quarter  excluding that we see roughly flat and then some expansion because our primary inventory reductions that we were executing were occurring in the second  third and fourth quarter  And as we move into that that range then we    that s when we expect to be seen margin expansion  particularly gross margin expansion in 2020 David Ridley Lane    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  And for the follow up  what are the sort of tailwinds do you see within Health Care  And do you see potential upside to the 2  to 4  organic guidance for the full year as you get to the second half of the year  Thank you Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  If you look at 2020 David  Health Care is going to be a leader for growth for us and and that is really on some of the strengths that we saw coming out of 2019  We see continued strength in health information systems and with the MModal addition being part of that in our food safety business  Our medical solutions business  we see that benefiting from the strong market    outlook for market growth in Health Care  And so we see  and I would say  continued strength in developing markets helping to lead that growth forward  So it s some of the areas that we saw strengths in 2019 and then some of the things that we ve been able to build upon with our acquisitions and leverage even stronger positions against a good macroeconomic outlook David Ridley Lane    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThank you very much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett  Please proceed with your question John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystThank you  Good morning  everyone Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey  John Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning John John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystGood morning guys  Nick can we start on the EPS roadmap  Slide 27  So you ve dialed in minus  0 25 for 2019 headwinds  I think it s    it s interesting  it s not a range  it s an exact precise number  What exactly is in that  for example  like our compensation headwind  so having to pay people more money is that in there  And anything you could say on that was there flex around it  what is going on there Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  John  there s two precise things in there which is why it s not a range  About one third of that is from gains we took in 2019 on disposal of certain property  certain assets we had  that I talked about it during our third quarter earnings call  The other two thirds of that John is coming from variable compensation with our results that we re delivering    delivered in 2019 our variable comp is below our planned variable comp level  and we ve built our plan for 2020 that we would be returning to planned variable comp and that s why we re calling that out as a 2019 headwind John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystAnd can I ask you  Nick  Why is that fixed  for instance  let s just say the economy got better as 2020 progressed  And you did much better than your zero to 2  core growth  does that variable number also not dial up or is it a kind of a fixed bonus  like why wouldn t the  0 25 possibly dial a little bit higher as a drag Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So in 2020  if we start to see our compensation being different than that then our normal practice would be that becomes part of productivity  So if we are paying more than our planned variable comp that would become a headwind to our productivity that we re projecting in 2020 John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystGot it  And then just as a follow up Nick  Can you remind us what s going on there Mike  what s going on in Europe  I had in my notes  I thought that you were sort of on deck to maybe downsize your European footprint  I think pro forma like about a third of production facilities with a lot of this happening in the back half of  19  where do we stand on that  I noticed that for instance  Europe on the core sequentially got worse  Was that actually    was that self inflicted because of this associated internal disruption or actions or is there something else just as it just macro in Europe  just where do we stand in Europe overall  and the runway even to your 20  plus margins that you talked about at the last analyst meeting Nick Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  John  thanks for asking that question  And there are several moving parts in there  First let me talk to the margin and then I ll talk to the growth  2019 was a very good year of progress for us with our operating income margins again expanding in Europe to approximately 19   very much along the trajectory that we were projecting that we would be on to be moving this to a 20  operating income margin by 2020  As part of that we ve been taking a number of action over the last few years  Some of them have been footprint actions and we are starting to see some of that benefit manifest in our 2019 results going forward into 2020  Also there has been some portfolio adjustments where there certain product lines where we ve been going through and prioritizing and deciding either to exit or to de prioritize and de resource  And as we look at our organic growth in 2019  as well as in particular asking about fourth quarter of 2019 that s been impacted  impacted by 50 to 100 basis points of organic growth by some of our what we have planned and done from a portfolio standpoint as part of our move to shift our portfolio in Europe Much of the rest has been macro of what we re seeing  plus a little bit right now what we re seeing in the fourth quarter is a comparison that we re going against fourth quarter last year in Europe  This was very much in the range we re expecting but macro  we re continuing to see auto builds down in Europe  and that that does impact our overall EMEA results John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystIf EMEA is up  do you think it hits your 20  target in 2020 or maybe even a little bit better Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  We see ourselves very much in line to be hitting that  Could be a little ahead  but I wouldn t get too far ahead on that  We see ourselves right in line to be hitting that John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystGot it  Thanks very much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets  Please proceed with your question Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThank you  Good morning  everyone Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi Deane Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHey Mike  I was hoping to circle back on the restructuring announcement today  and I wanted to put it in context with what we re seeing across the multi industry sector where a number of companies are pursuing simplification via larger spin out  bigger bolder moves versus kind of what I would characterize at 3M has been more surgical  Have you looked    as a result  you look more like an outlier in terms of your simplification approach  Is it    what s your response there  Is it really company specific  Are there opportunities to do something bigger  Is that might be another next phase  But if you could give us some color there that would be helpful Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Deane we    what I framed it up  as this is part of our transformation journey  And if you look back even back to the Investor Day in November of 2018  we laid out a plan for margin improvements over the coming years  And a big part of that was from transformation  So there was a plan by us to really keep moving forward in this  This announcement today is the next phase of that plan due to move forward with alignment around those four go to market models  our customers  better leverage all the business transformation investments we ve put in place  And we are optimizing as we go  We re building on the capabilities we put in place  You saw that in 2019 start to come through our EMEA and Canada results in terms of margins and service and inventory management improving there  and it was part of getting on top of inventory in North America too as we deployed the new capabilities  And so I wouldn t call it a    I wouldn t think of it as a one step in the middle of this is part of our transformation journey and so we ll continue to optimize off of this  This enables the charge that we took in Q4  enables us to move quickly to the alignment  get the full benefit of it as we go forward  It s really we think is going to be a important part of what positions us to deliver growth and better efficiency as we go through 2020 and beyond Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThat s helpful  And then just staying on the restructuring  the payback for 2019 did that  40 million to  50 million in savings just based upon the size of the restructuring that seems a slower payback  Does that have more to do with the timing of how you do these reductions Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Deane  that really is a function of this  As we move to streamline our operations there  not all of it is happening right away  there is parts of it that phased in over the course of the year and that s why it s only having a  40 million to  50 million impact  Some of it are minority position  part of that will come in the first half of the year  The vast majority of that  40 million to  50 million comes in the second half of the year Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  That s helpful  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse  Please proceed John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  good morning Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey John Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning John John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystWanted to talk about the price performance in the quarter and specific to the US  but happy if you want to broaden it out  As we think about the 1 7  price increase that s a higher number than we ve seen here in the past  Is that price because of innovation and sustainable or did you hold price and that was kind of impacting why the volume was down in the US Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerJohn  the price growth  first of all  let me expand it to the full year for US price growth  with that 1 7  that brings our full year price growth to 80 basis points  John  I think that s the more helpful number for you to look at and focus on  Often in a quarter to quarter basis  there s going to be  what is it comparing to in the quarter in the prior year  So I want overreact to the 1 7   Our view is the 80 basis points that we did in the US in total 2019 that s indicative of what we re doing  And to the first premise of your question  what we overall see in price growth is a function of the value we are creating  It s the innovation we have in our products and continuing to update the product lines in the products that we offer there and that is a big driver of that  but I wouldn t focus on the 1 7   I focus more on the full year  the 80 basis points John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot you  And then maybe coming at the flat to up 2  organic just a different way  If we think about 2019  particularly on the automotive side  you did have some impact from channel inventory destocking  I don t know if it s possible  have you thought about what the growth rate would look like just with the absence of those headwinds  And how much of that kind of flat to 2  is just a normalization versus the macro getting any better Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  John  the return to growth  the zero to 2  that is really reflecting both the macro and then I think a closer look at the markets that we ve been challenged with 2019  So  electronics  automotive  China and in 2019 as you noted  there was a impact from channel reactions  as I saw the decline in those markets they react and took out inventory  So part of the year over year in those markets comparison is going to be a more stable channel  We do see more balanced inventory in those channels  I would say  electronics  we re seeing the early signs of maybe some encouraging outlook in areas like semiconductor  fabrication and data centers  In automotive  the outlook for the year is  is still negative build rates  slightly negative  I think is the broader economic view  We were a little more conservative in that and a slower start to the year  but again I would say  our view is also has that idea of balanced inventory in the face of those outlooks John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi  Please proceed with your question Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystGood morning  guys Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Andy Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey Andy Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystMike  Can we go back to Health Care for a second  I know that you changed the reporting last year and put separation and purification  and that s in growth a little bit but I m sure recall it Health Care was supposed to be 2  to 4  grower in  19  put a little under 2  and the 4  to 6  due  23  So I know you re saying 2  to 4  for 2020  Is the impact on healthcare just been I guess unexpected cyclicality  Or have you sort of reassessed the long term growth of the business  And is there any sort of thought about accelerating portfolio optimization in that particular business beyond selling drug delivery Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Andy  I would say  as I highlighted in my speech  we have been focused with our portfolio actions on Health Care  As you mentioned drug delivery and the plan to divest that  adding Acelity  adding MModal into our health information systems  And if you go back to Q4  the growth    organic growth in Q4 was positive across most of the portfolio  It was led by mid single digit growth in health information systems and food safety  Medical solutions was up slightly in the quarter  Oral care declined in the low single digits  And so that was maybe the focus of the softer growth in Q4 We did see strong growth geographically in areas like China and other parts of the world  So that s kind of what we carry into 2020 and we see medical solutions improving  The market outlook there is strong and our position is strong  We see health informations  food safety continuing  We see separation and purification getting a little better  And so all of that together positions us in a stronger growth for the outlook for the total year Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystMike  that s helpful  And then Nick  just looking at the walk for 2020 again  do you still see that the potential for additional property sale  so there may be an element of conservatism in that item  And then you talked about a pretty wide range for this year in terms of productivity impacts from the zero to  0 25  It seems that s like a little higher than usual  Is productivity more depending on what organic growth is this year  And that s why it s a little hard to pin down in 2020 Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAndy  I just wanted to make sure you asked  where the potential for other property sales and if that s what you said  no  we re not anticipating anything of any material magnitude on gains or losses from property sales in 2020  In terms of the range that we have for productivity between zero and 25      0 25  that s might be a little wider than normal  And I think it does reflect as we re coming off a year where our margins were declining as we were having noticable drops in inventory as well as we re going through the transformation and the restructuring charges we ve called out and isolated the restructuring charges  but that s also a driver of our productivity and we re isolating that  and just the interplay of that adds a little more complexity for that  And we see the zero to  0 25 is like our best estimate right now  And of course we re going to be striving to be on the higher end of that  but it s where we are building our plans right now Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi    AnalystThanks for that Nick OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley  Please proceed with your question Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  Good morning guys Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Josh Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Josh Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystJust a follow up on Andy s question a little bit on productivity  maybe slightly a different way  I guess Nick  how does zero end up in the range  You mentioned kind of the under absorption and destocking issues  which I think caught you by surprise in the first quarter of last year  in particular on the volume drop  What would be the driver of the lower end of that range  Is it    if demand is better and like you said the incentive comp is a hit to productivity  Just trying to understand what the downside could be or what even drive the pressures to that Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerJosh  a couple of things  First of all  as would typically be the expectation if our growth is on the lower end of our range  I think that puts a little pressure to us on the lower end of the productivity range that we ve laid out here  and included in that productivity range there s positive things that we re doing such as where we re seeing where the utilization of our factories in comparison to 2019  But it s also    we re also facing into as we do every year wage inflation  so offsetting wage inflation is part of that  We also have other things that are impacted in there  For example  what we ve called out under other and other pension expense that hits the non offline is being flat year on year  Included in our productivity there is a between  0 06 and  0 07 headwind for increased pension expenses  that s part of that productivity number  So there is a negative headwind  there is headwinds we re facing and there as we face a zero to 25  Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  That s helpful  And then just on the demand outlook  I think clearly there is an expectation maybe a few months ago that we were on this kind of linear recovery and maybe a midyear bigger inflection in demand across the industrial universe  It seems like January has been a little slower for everyone  If you guys had a snap the line today versus some of the potential may be green shoots you could have been seeing 30 or 60 days ago  as anything seen pushed out or off track or is this just kind of a timing issue and we shouldn t read anything into January Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJosh  I think you laid it out  The way we looked at that low growth macroeconomic especially in industrial  industrial production index kind of view of that it was getting better as we went through the year  That s the way we built our outlook for the year  our plan  I would say the biggest change since that has been what s going on in China  And it s that will be the    have the biggest impact on how the first quarter plays out and then how we move further into the year  So I think that s the most important thing to be watching out Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  Appreciate the color  Thanks guys OperatorThank you  Our last question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays  Please proceed with your question Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystHi  good morning  Thanks for squeezing me in Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey  Julian Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystHi  Just a quick question  following up on inventories  I think Nick or Mike  you d said that you had a  370 million drawdown in 2019 overall  Maybe just help us understand what the margin impact of that drawdown was for the full year  19  And also  as you sit here today  do you view your channel inventories that your customers and partners as being fairly normal  Or is there a bit more to go of destock in Q1  And then  switching back to 3M itself on inventory  do you have that old medium term goal of a  500 million reduction  where do we stand on that Nicholas C  Gangestad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerJulian  several questions all at once  So first of all  on the  370 million of inventory reduction  our estimate that that s negatively impacted our operating margins or our gross margins in 2019 by 50 to 100 basis points  That s true both for the fourth quarter and also true for the full year about 50 to 100 basis points  And we see that flipping to be part    that s part of our guidance of the margin improvement in 2020 is having that headwind behind us As far as channel inventories  there s always some puts and takes  I d say we re seeing nothing abnormal right now with channel inventories  We have  of course  as we ve said throughout the year we ve seen some reductions in our inventory    channel held inventories  but right now  I d characterize it is fairly normal where we stand with inventories  And then we    in 2020 we do anticipate that we will bring down inventories a bit more  not    nothing on the magnitude of the  370 million that we did in 2019  but we expect we will be    we ll continue our progress of taking down our inventories slightly in 2020 As far as the guidance we had given prior of  500 million  We see the progress that we made in 2019 as most of that reduction getting us back to where we were when we first said that and some of that starting to make progress on that  500 million  We still see opportunities in the coming years for us to operate our supply chain even more efficiently and gather even more of that  500 million inventory reduction through our cash flow in the coming years  We ve made some progress in  19  we ll make more in  20 and we ll make more in  21 Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystThat s very helpful  Thank you OperatorThank you  That concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call  I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments Michael F  Roman    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerTo wrap up  In the fourth quarter  we leveraged the strengths of the 3M business model to navigate market conditions while delivering strong cash flow and solid margins  We also continue to make significant progress on our transformation journey with the rollout of our new operating model  We enter 2020 in a strong strategic and financial position poised to return to growth and deliver value for our customers and shareholders  Thank you for joining us Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  69 minutesCall participants Bruce Jermeland

globally in the past two months  Scientists are trying to develop non traditional vaccines  Authorities in China are struggling from the lack of adequate health facilities to treat the thousands affected The spread of the virus has been reported in countries like the United Arab Emirates and Germany  Per estimates  this new virus could cost the global economy  280 billion in just the first quarter of this year  Additionally  shortage in supply of medical aids like masks  gloves  goggles and facial shield is creating a sense of panic and endangering lives of medical workers Coronavirus Continues to SpreadCoronavirus has already claimed more than 900 lives  However  new cases outside Hubei have reduced and these show that the strict quarantine measures implemented by the Chinese authorities are yielding results Reports from the United Arab Emirates confirmed two more cases of the coronavirus on Feb 8 in one Chinese and one Filipino patient  On the same day  the U S  embassy in Beijing confirmed that a 60 year old American lady  diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan  passed away Meanwhile  cruise liner Diamond Princess now has 70 confirmed cases of coronavirus and Japanese authorities have anchored and quarantined the ship off the coast of Yokohama Additionally  new cases have been reported in Germany and South Korea  Singapore has reported a total of 40 cases and increased alert level N95 Respirator Mask in ShortageThough the number of new cases of coronavirus has declined beyond Wuhan borders  World Health Organization officials believe that coronavirus or novel coronavirus pneumonia  NCP  is much more contagious than severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS   Here s where infection control strategy comes into play As NCP is highly contagious  facemasks and N95 respirators may help to shield the wearer to an extent from liquid droplets and airborne particles  N95 respirators can block at least 95  of small particles  Hence  they are the most suitable medical grade masks in this case Per reports  Chinese officials are purchasing masks from companies that supply globally  which has led manufacturers to boost output  Evidently  Medicom Group  a

infected with coronavirus so far but an increase in the number of cases can strain the country s medical system Further  China is the dominant supplier of raw ingredients for penicillin  ibuprofen and aspirin  with imports affected due to coronavirus fears  Public health experts are closely watching reserves of vital medical supplies and medications Hence  given the current global health scenario  it is prudent that investors keep a close watch on these medical suppliers Cardinal Health  Inc    NYSE CAH   manufactures  sources and distributes medical  surgical  and laboratory products  The

This maker of Post it notes  industrial coatings and ceramics has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 6 15  
For the most recent quarter  3M was expected to post earnings of  2 47 per share  but it reported  2 58 per share instead  representing a surprise of 4 45   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 04 per share  while it actually produced  2 20 per share  a surprise of 7 84  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for 3M  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
3M has an Earnings ESP of  0 19  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-3m-mmm-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200496689,200496689

194037,415553,MMM,Key Global Macroeconomic Themes Set To Shape Markets In 2020 ,opinion,"Global Macroeconomic Themes to Track in 2020
As 2019 draws to an end  we are seeing some positive traction on two key risk themes that have kept the global markets on tenterhooks over the last couple of years  US China trade tensions and Brexit 
US China phase one trade deal has finally seen the light of the day  In UK  Conservatives have emerged victorious in the general elections and with a majority in the parliament  it would be easier for PM Johnson to deliver on his core campaign promise i e  to  Get Brexit Done   Unfortunately  given how complex both the underlying issues are  the way forward is likely to be convoluted and we expect developments on these themes to certainly drive the global risk sentiment in 2020 also  Below are the key themes to track in 2020 and our expectations under various scenarios 
2020 US Presidential Elections  A test of  Trumponomics 
The central plot for 2020  where we expect a lot of drama to unfold is the US presidential elections  The Democrats are pressing charges for impeachment with the House of Representatives likely to vote soon  18th December   Even if the president is impeached he may not be removed from office as that would require a two thirds majority in the Senate which at the moment is controlled by the Republicans  If the Democrats succeed in getting the allegations against the president to resonate with the voters  it would further lower Trump s approval ratings  President Trump on the other hand  would want to showcase the health of the US economy  pointing to unemployment rate which is at a multi decade low and stock indices which are at record highs as a testimony to his economic policies  Generally  no incumbent president has lost a re election bid with the economy doing well  Also  no president has won a re election bid with an approval rating below 50    Both these statistics cannot hold and it will be interesting to see which one gives way 
Any development which tilts the scales in favor of President Trump would be Dollar positive and risk positive and vice versa  The top three Democrat contenders  in order of their current chances  are Joe Biden  Bernie Sanders  and Elizabeth Warren  Markets would keenly follow who emerges on top to challenge Trump in the race to become the next US president  If Warren turns out to be the one then one can expect a massive sell off in US equities  bonds and the US dollar on account of her left leaning ideology which is not seen as being business and market friendly  
US China Trade Tensions  Patches of agreement  swathes of disagreement
The phase one US China trade deal is more like the tip of the iceberg  What we have got now seems like a temporary truce  Both sides were desperate to show some progress and closure to their constituents  While the deal may benefit a section of Trump s voter base and help him lift his approval ratings  more contentious issues continue to remain unresolved  Even the commitment on the part of China to purchase USD 40 50Bn of US farm goods seems too ambitious given that prior to the start of the trade war China had bought USD 24bn of US farm goods in 2017 and the most it has ever bought so far was USD 29Bn worth in 2013 
President Trump has said phase 2 negotiations would commence immediately but has not specified any timeline on the same  Phase 2 negotiations are expected to cover issues such as Chinese government subsidies to state owned enterprises  digital trade  data localization  cross border data flows and cyber intrusions  The extent of hardball president Trump plays in phase 2 would depend on the state of the economy and markets heading into the elections  his approval ratings and on who the Democrat challenger is  Just like in 2019 we expect a lot of comments and statements coming in from both sides  We expect some patches of an agreement but large swathes of disagreement 
Brexit  A tumultuous transition period lies ahead
With a majority  Conservatives will be able to push through the Withdrawal Agreement Bill  agreed by Boris Johnson with the EU  through the UK parliament  legally taking the UK out of the EU  Thereafter there shall be a short window of 11 months until 31st Dec 2020 by when the UK and EU would have to hammer out a trade deal that would establish the future trading relationship between them  This could be a tall order especially if UK wants to differ significantly from current EU standards and tariffs  The more closely aligned the UK is with European standards  the smoother the transition would be 
Given the health of the UK economy  there is a possibility the BoE could cut rates in Q2 after considering the progress made on future trading relations during the transition period

Health of the Chinese Economy  Dragon on its knees
The global engine of growth has been slowing  Deleveraging has taken its toll on the Chinese economy  China s auto sales have contracted in 17 out of the past 18 months  The third quarter GDP growth at 6  was the lowest in nearly three decades  Growth in Q4 is expected to slow down further  While the government has taken small steps to boost infrastructure growth  no large scale stimulus measures have been announced so far  The PBoC s response has also been measured  It has cut the loan prime rate by merely 5bps to 4 15  from 4 20   This indicates that China wants to tread cautiously  striking a balance between debt and growth  Considering that China has accounted for one third of global growth in recent years  lack of immediate revival in Chinese demand could keep global growth suppressed

The question on everybody s mind is whether we will see the low volatility environment of 2019 continue into 2020  The volatility in EUR USD and USD JPY is at or close to historic lows  This does not come as a surprise given that there is little policy divergence between major global central banks  the Fed  the ECB and the BoJ  All three are accommodative and stand ready to ease more if their respective economies worsen  All three are currently engaged in some kind of asset purchases  Though the Fed is doing more so to manage liquidity   For volatility to return we need policy divergence to reappear  Therefore it would be very important to track the incoming data  especially from the US and Eurozone  The Fed is better placed than the ECB  and the BoJ as the US economy is relatively stronger  The median dot plot indicates that the next action of the Fed could be a hike  though far ahead in 2021   The Fed is expected to pause and watch the effects of its midcycle policy adjustment play out  We expect the Fed to remain on hold through 2020  However  the pillar holding the US economy so far is consumption and if that falters we could be looking at an even more dovish Fed and that could be negative for the US dollar  We see EUR USD trading in 1 07 1 16 and USD JPY in 104 50 112 50 during 2020

194043,415559,MMM,FX Strategy  SEK Not Out Of The Woods Yet,opinion,"Further headwinds for the SEK despite December hike 
We stay long EUR SEK in the FX Trading Portfolio but raise stop to entry 
We reiterate our EUR SEK forecast  but stress that downside risks have increased 
Last week we recommended buying EUR SEK in anticipation of a dovish move from the Riksbank  see  here    Contrary to our expectations  the bank reiterated that the policy rate will most likely be raised to zero in December  The initial reaction was to send EUR SEK lower  but at the end of the day it was back to square one  the position s entry level  Overnight  EUR SEK has printed new post Riksbank highs  The substantial re pricing of the Riksbank that took place  from  9bp to  21bp for the December meeting  without follow through in EUR SEK illustrates the poor underlying SEK sentiment  not even the strong signal of leaving negative rates seems to convince investors of an imminent reversal in EUR SEK  Why  Lower  0   for longer is probably one reason  A murkier cyclical outlook another  Could a Riksbank risk premium be a third 
We see further headwinds for the SEK  but the immediate argument for the trade no longer applies  Therefore  to protect the position from losses  we raise the stop loss to 10 73  entry   whilst keeping our soft target of 11 00 
USD SEK still in the second quadrant 




Tighter monetary policy  Yes and no  The new rate path indicates that after having raised the repo rate to zero  the plan is to stay there for an extended period of time  While we would not rule out a positive threshold effect on the SEK at zero  we wonder if it is more than a marginal factor  Carry has been a clear headwind for the SEK  especially versus the USD  With a Riksbank hike all but priced in and with additional cuts priced in on the Fed  we think that USD SEK will still be a preferred long in the carry momentum space  In addition  the chance of additional hikes beyond zero looks even more remote with the new rate path  Since July the Riksbank has lowered the end point  Q3 22  of the repo rate by 82bp  from 0 90  to 0 08   53bp in September and an additional 29bp in October  




This shift makes sense given the deterioration of the macro and inflation outlook and shows that the policy has actually become more expansionary  However  the December hike is still hard to grasp  Especially  as the Riksbank s mantra has been and still is that the negative rate has served its purpose in terms of lifting inflation  From the central bank s perspective deviating from that strategy would be like shooting itself in the foot 
Murkier growth outlook  Yes  No doubt  Both globally and in Sweden  This is typically not an environment where one would build long positions in the pro cyclical  risk sensitive SEK  For example  the SEK together with the NOK has been the worst performer since PMIs started to drop last year and since the trade war started in Q1 18  The USD has been the outperformer  not only offering protection in risk off markets  a property it shares with the JPY and the CHF  but also offering positive carry and relatively healthy growth   a unique position in the FX space  Sweden has offered strong growth for many years  but not anymore  In the near term PMIs will be in focus  In Sweden  we saw a sharp drop last month  an accident waiting to happen given Germany  In October  we could see a correction higher  which in turn could lend temporary support to the SEK  The outlook for the industrial sector is still bleak though  we expect PMI to stay below 50 in coming months 




Riksbank risk premium on the SEK  Possibly  The Riksbank suddenly seems a bit uncomfortable with rates being negative and also with the risk that the depreciation of the SEK spins out of control  We agree that negative rates may have adverse effects on activity and banks  but this has not been official central bank policy until now  We also detect a new communication on the currency when it says a weaker SEK may have adverse effects on the economy  We agree to that too  but so far it has not been official policy either  If policy communication is incoherent and if policy implementation is seen as being procyclical even when the economy is slowing down and jobs are lost  investors may think twice before buying SEK  Further  should the Riksbank policy be considered as erratic and unreliable  which might be a potential fallout of the sudden shift in allegiance to negative rates  this should increase the  policy risk  of holding SEK and thus further reduce its already limited attractiveness 
Fiscal policy  We have argued that more expansionary fiscal policy is probably not only more effective in supporting growth and inflation  as monetary policy has emptied its toolbox  but also  at least in theory  something that could lend support to the SEK  However  so far authorities have been reluctant to go down that route  On the margin however  the new SNDO borrowing forecast with more bond net supply  taking into account Riksbank purchases  see here  could be seen as slightly positive for the SEK   this was the exact response to the SNDO announcement last week   but probably not a trigger for a trend reversal 
What does this mean for EUR SEK  Our 11 00 year end target was initially motivated by the assumption that the Riksbank would actually cut rates in February  Instead  we now look for a December hike  However  we still think that the Riksbank is too bullish on growth and too optimistic on inflation and as such we think that the pressure on the Riksbank  and the SEK  will not go away anytime soon  At the same time  we have to take into account potential threshold effects on the SEK of leaving negative rates  about which we are uncertain as of now  This will come into play in the coming quarter and thus potentially affect our 1 3M forecasts  although it is difficult to quantify the magnitude of said effects  Hence  on balance  we keep the profile for EUR SEK intact at 1M 10 90  3M  NYSE MMM  11 00  6M 11 20 and 12M 11 20  but would like to stress that the downside risks  especially on the 1 3M horizon  have increased on the back of the Riksbank s surprisingly hawkish rhetoric ",2019-10-30,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fx-strategy-sek-not-out-of-the-woods-yet-200479954,200479954

Danske Bank s market view in a nutshell





Inflation to remain below Riksbank s forecast





We expect inflation measured as CPIF and CPIF excl  Energy to print 1 5  y y and 1 7  y y  respectively  both 0 1 percentage points below the Riksbank s forecasts  According to our forecast  now extended to include 2021  neither of these measures will reach 2   The fact that these forecasts become  flat  in 2021 is just because we have repeated price forecasts for 2020 into 2021  This will eventually be changed as we get new information about  for instance  changes to taxes and charges 
The background is that   just as before   we expect wage cost pressures to be too low to generate a sustainable inflation path at 2   Recent demands from some labour unions are slightly higher than in the previous wage rounds  We find it  however  very unlikely that the upcoming wage round will result in higher deals this time as the labour market is deteriorating 





Even with some help from a weaker SEK  it will be tough for import prices to compensate for this  We assume  as usual  that energy prices  both electricity and car fuel  will be stable  albeit with clear seasonal variation  We have not  however  put in the potential impact from reduced electricity grid fees  which is calculated to be about 0 1 percentage points per year in 2020 2023 
All in all  our long term forecasts remain close to the historical average since 2000  CPIF 1 3   CPIF excl  Energy 1 4    Note that since 2010 the averages are even lower  CPIF 1 1  y y  CPIF excl  Energy 1 3  y y   That should clearly be closer to the expected values than Riksbank s forecasts 
Returning to the October forecast  this is a month with normally quite small price changes  This time  small price cuts primarily in recreation should be balanced by slightly higher food and electricity prices 
Data will be important after all
As we mentioned in a comment to the Riksbank minutes on Tuesday  there are some noticeable differences between the message in the press release after the policy announcement  24 October  and the discussion in the minutes  The press release and indeed Governor Ingves  press conference gave us the impression that there will be a rate hike to zero in December  no matter what 
A rate hike still appears to be the base case  maybe 75  probability  but it does not seem as clear cut as we thought  Jansson undoubtedly remains sceptical and Flod n and Skingsley could possibly flip  Data up to the December meeting will matter  A source of uncertainty is that one seat on the board is vacant  A new deputy governor will be announced shortly  probably 8 November   We do not know who it will be  as the process of appointing board members is a black box 
Next week  two sets of data are due for release  which under normal circumstances would have been very important  inflation and SCB s labour force survey  LFS   Last month  however  SCB told the market that the survey suffers from certain data collection problems  Unemployment was probably underestimated in 2018 and early 2019 but the steep increase in more recent months is probably overestimated  SCB plans to release October LFS data on 14 November but it cannot say whether the release will include revisions of old data  For this reason we see no point in trying to make a precise forecast of the October unemployment number 
Until SCB manages to present more accurate figures  one has to rely on other indicators  One option is to compare LFS unemployment data with the ones from PES  public employment service   However  it is necessary to keep in mind that the two agencies  definition of unemployment is different 
As illustrated in the chart below  PES unemployment never reached as low as LFS in the recent downturn  Secondly  PES confirms that unemployment started to pick up about a year ago but not as steeply as LFS numbers of late  The latest PES unemployment number is 7 1   rounded   We have also made an estimation of LFS unemployment with variables such as hours worked  various survey based indicators and PES unemployment as explanatory variables  Obviously the residuals have spiked lately  The predicted UNRseries  like PES  started to pick up around the turn of the year  The latest predicted value is 6 9   rounded   So  until SCB delivers fresh data we assume that a true  seasonally adjusted  unemployment rate is in the proximity of 7  rather than 7 4  according to the latest SCB release  If correct it would still be an  issue  for the Riksbank considering that its latest projection shows unemployment reaching 7  only by Q1 21 





SCB also has certain problems with employment data so what is happening there  Survey data provide some clues  PMI figures for October have just been released  The employment indices for both manufacturing and services dropped and are now on the low side of 50 





The composite PMI is not split up in sub indices so we have calculated a proxy composite employment index by estimating the   coefficients for manufacturing  0 28  and services  0 72  in the composite PMI headline index and then applying those coefficients to the employment sub indices to calculate a composite employment index  see chart   The October reading was 47 9  down from 51 9  suggesting that private sector employment is stagnating and possibly heading towards contraction  It can also be noted that the calculated composite employment PMI aligns quite well with the NIER private sector hiring plans indicator 
Quick comment on Debt Office figures
The Debt Office showed a budget surplus for October of SEK31 9bn versus a projected SEK30 2bn surplus  However  the interesting thing is that the Debt Office once again said that tax revenues came in lower than expected and this time around it explicitly pointed to larger withdrawals  corporates are able to deposit money at the Debt Office at zero  thereby avoiding negative deposit rates at banks   This is worth keeping an eye on  In the latest forecast  the Debt Office did not lower the budget projection for 2020 despite scaling down macro forecasts  The reason was that it lowered the assumption regarding withdrawals from the tax account by SEK20bn compared with the previous forecast  In other words  without this change  the budget balance would be SEK20bn lower in 2020  Our guess is that the Debt Office  like most other forecasters then  did not foresee any rate hikes from the Riksbank  Now  if the Riksbank does what it says and hikes to zero in December and that hike feeds through to banks  deposit rates  which seems a reasonable assumption   the incentive to keep cash at the Debt Office fades  If so  the borrowing requirement will rise and eventually the Debt Office may have to increase the issuance volumes of bonds more than currently planned 
Next week s events





Time to sell SGB10Y ASW   Take profit in long end relative flattener
In last week s RTM Sweden  we argued in favour of selling 10Y SGBs either versus swaps or against Bunds  as the market will have to absorb more risk in 2020 compared to previous years  However  we did not initiate a recommendation as we reasoned that the upcoming extensions would perhaps provide even more attractive entry levels 





Likely on the back of the upcoming index extensions  as SGB1047 and SGBi3102 get shorter than 1Y and are thus removed from bond indices   longer SGBs have performed remarkably well  even though we have yet to reach the actual index extensions  SGB 1053  Mar 2039  in particular has performed rapidly in recent weeks  The longest ASW spreads in SGBs are nearing historical lows  despite the recent announcement by the SNDO that issuance volumes are gradually being ramped up 





Looking at historical index extensions  there is a tendency for longer SGBs to perform ahead of the index extension and underperform thereafter  Below we have looked at the average changes on ASW and against Bunds around the previous index extensions larger than 0 4Y for government bonds since 2010  There seems to be a clear pattern to  buy the rumour  sell the fact   Hence  we recommend selling SGB1061 ASW at  56bp  with P L levels set to  46bp  62bp 
Moreover  in one of our previous recommendations we have been long SGB1053  March 2039  in a rather unusual combination  We had a relative flattener 10Y 20Y versus a 2Y 5Y steepener  as the latter segment was trading stretched relative to the 10Y 20Y segment  As SGB1053 traded cheap relative to swaps at the time  we substituted the swap leg for SGB1053s  Given the recent flattening of the long end in Sweden  likely a result of the upcoming index extension  we have reached our target level of  35bp and we hence close the recommendation with a 20bp profit 
Add to the Dec20 leg in Dec20 Dec21 SEK FRA steepener
As we argued in our Riksbank comment following the minutes  we see good risk reward in receiving the Dec20 SEK FRA  as the risk to the policy rate  once back to zero  seems more symmetric than we previously thought after the MPR  In the minutes  Ingves  Flod n and Skingsley all opened up for future rate cuts if needed and we also noted that no board members foresee a scenario with a protracted hiking cycle  Given that we foresee a sharper downturn during 2020 compared to the Riksbank forecasts  we find it reasonable for the market to start to price in a probability of a rate cut at some point  Hence  we choose to add more of the Dec20 FRA to the Dec20 Dec21 position  for a 2 1 ratio   with the steepening position still giving some cushion for a general move higher in rates  We enter the additional Dec20 FRA position at 16 5bp with relatively wide target levels at 0bp 25bp 
SEK rebound with Riksbank hike and global risk appetite
The Riksbank rate decision two weeks ago was more hawkish than expected  It led to a significant repricing of December  from  8bp to  22bp  and induced some head scratching in the FX market  There and then the interpretation was that the Riksbank wants to leave negative rates  regardless of what is actually happening in the economy  If rates were to be hiked to zero never again to be lowered into negative territory  this could be considered a pivotal factor for the carry hampered SEK  That is one possible interpretation  but is it the right one  The SEK has nevertheless strengthened these past couple of days 
The Minutes  however  sounded differently  Certainly some board members are into the thought of hiking rates to zero in December  but such a decision is seemingly more conditioned on data than what was conveyed by the original communication  We are leaning towards that the hike will indeed happen  However  perhaps more importantly  evidently zero is no lower bound  Should the outlook worsen  rates could be cut back to   0 25  once again  On top of that  the Riksbank could take  other actions   more QE    Monetary policy could go either way after the December meeting  One could even argue that any potential asymmetry is tilted downwards rather than upwards  since no board member sees the need for more rate hikes in the near term  post December   Instead  some board members expressed concerns about sliding inflation expectations and should they continue to slide or if the outcome of the upcoming wage round disappoints the door is still open for a cut 
The market reaction to the soft Minutes was initially quite muted  both in EUR SEK as well as in short rates were the RIBA curve currently prices  20bp in December and  1bp H2 2020  Since then  however  the SEK has strengthened  It is possible that the market is positioning itself for a hike  but given pricing the potential in the SEK should be rather limited  If  at some time  cuts are back on the table it should push EUR SEK higher 





It is also plausible that expectations of an end to negative rates in Sweden could trigger some SEK buying from foreign investors who for long have regarded the SEK as an undervalued prospective buy  without daring to take the leap  Historically  we have seen a rather strong covariation between foreign holdings of Swedish bonds and the SEK  see figure below   Following the Riksbank s decision to enter negative territory and launch the QE programme  foreign investors gradually disappeared from the Swedish market  Higher Swedish bond rates coupled with the prospect of an increased supply of bonds are factors that could stabilise  or even turn around  this trend  An USD based investor still has substantial carry working against him  but this is no longer the case for the EUR based investor  From a technical standpoint  EUR SEK 10 60 is an important level as is 200dma at 10 6278  If the cross breaks below those levels  the multi year trend of higher and higher lows is broken and the market may then aim for 10 50  Model funds trading on momentum could receive further signals to sell  regardless of how macro develops 





On that note  looking for it one could actually find some positive  or rather less negative  signs  e g  composite PMI and retail sales in the EZ  It is too early to tell whether this marks the turnaround in the EZ cyclical outlook  but it is not entirely far fetched for the market to fixate on these green shoots and if so the high beta SEK often comes out on top  see figure below   In addition  risk appetite amid  good news  regarding the trade talks has infused optimism to stock markets and has been a driver in FX  The SEK  NOK  CAD  AUD and NZD have been winners during last month s equity rally  whereas the JPY and CHF have underperformed  If this optimism prevails  the SEK could strengthen further 





To sum up  We still see both the Swedish and the global cyclical outlook as a headwind for the SEK  Additionally  we believe that the Riksbank will continue to have a hard time reaching the inflation target and that the SEK will continue to act as a valve  At the same time  we have revised our forecast on the Riksbank and we no longer see a rate cut in early 2020 but instead accepted that rates are likely to be raised in December  After the December hike  however  we deem it more likely that the next move will be a cut rather than a hike  which in time should be discounted in the SEK  On the other hand  global risks have subsided somewhat lately  Overall  we still believe there to be additional upside in EUR SEK  but the latest developments have pushed us to review the levels  Therefore  we choose to revise down our forecast profile by 20 figures over the whole horizon  1M 10 70  10 90   3M  NYSE MMM  10 80  11 00   6 12M 11 00  11 20

194045,415561,MMM,China  Trade War Versus 5G,opinion,"While the US China trade dispute is unlikely to be fully resolved next year  5G infrastructure and services will be a new growth engine for China s economy in 2020
Risks and opportunities in 2020
In 2020  we expect the risks associated with the trade war to be just as significant as the opportunities provided by 5G 
Trade war still the key risk
We believe that any trade agreement in November or December will be small  with most of the current tariffs likely to stay in force  Chinese exporters  and the related supply chains  will continue to be affected 
In 2020  there will still be a lot of uncertainty over the signing of trade deals and questions about whether these might be later overturned  by both sides 
The impact of the dispute so far has been significant  In the five months to September  China s exports showed negative yearly growth  The value of exports and imports declined by CNY566 billion in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same period of the previous year  This may look relatively small but that s just the trade value  manufacturing activity has not been counted  In the eight months to October  the manufacturing PMI fell below 50  signalling a contraction in the sector  This has been reflected in slower economic growth overall despite sizeable fiscal stimulus 
We believe the trade war situation will continue to pose a threat to exports and manufacturing activity in 2020 
5G is the biggest opportunity
That said  5G presents opportunities  Semiconductor sales have increased on a monthly basis since June 2019  and as we stated in our electronics report  we think this is due to 5G 
China is in the process of building 5G infrastructure in its home country and is exporting to other economies  too  which will likely be the growth engine for semiconductor sales 
There will be more than 130 000 5G base stations by the end 2019 to support the 5G network  It is estimated that China will have 170 million 5G subscribers by 2020  This only covers 12  of the 1 4 billion population  so we ll inevitably see more 5G stations being built 
Meanwhile  Chinese smartphone brands have already entered the 5G smartphone market  We expect most consumers in the big cities to upgrade their 4G phones to 5G  This means that 5G applications will probably surge  The market is already anticipating new smartphone games  new video streaming services and most importantly the  internet of things  
It is estimated that 5G will stimulate growth in China by 15 trillion yuan over the next five years  On average  it should contribute nearly 3  of nominal GDP each year  using the estimate of nominal GDP at 99 trillion yuan  
Big fiscal stimulus still needed 
For 2020  it is key that the government avoids piling up unnecessary debt after a surge in issuance in 2019 
As trade deals are unlikely to be fully completed  we believe that the central government will extend the tax and fee cuts for another year  which were worth around CNY2 trillion in 2019 
Most of the stimulus money for infrastructure projects came from the issuance of local government special bonds  For reference  the local government special bond quota for 2019 was 2 15 trillion yuan  Railway investments increased by 13 6  year on year on average in the first nine months of 2019 
Total fiscal stimulus is estimated to be in the range of CNY2 trillion to CNY3 trillion in 2020 
Will monetary policy go in tandem with fiscal stimulus 
The central bank seems to have been reluctant to flood the market with liquidity  seeking to avoid a repeat of 2009 when liquidity boosted speculation in various assets  including the real estate market 
As such  we think the PBoC will cut interest rates and the Reserve Requirement Ratio only when interbank rates are high  which could be measured by 3M  NYSE MMM  SHIBOR over 3  on a consistent basis  Thus we expect the bank to cut interest rates once  by five basis points  and the RRR twice  each by 0 5 percentage points  in 2020 
Where is the yuan heading 
Both China and the US seem to be more willing to work out a deal than we previously expected  Though we don t think the September tariffs will be rolled back in phase one of the trade deal  this could still happen as we move closer to the US presidential election  which would support the yuan 
Our revised forecasts on USD CNY are 7 00 and 6 85 for the end of 2019 and 2020  respectively  This strengthening is based on expectations of some progress in trade talks 
We would like to highlight that uncertainty about a trade deal is high and USD CNY is likely to remain volatile 
GDP forecast
We expect the Chinese government to call for GDP growth in 2020 of  around 6 0   when this is announced in March  Our forecast is for 5 9  growth next year  But this forecast depends a lot on the progress of trade talks

194053,415569,MMM,7 Reasons Why Yields Are Higher,opinion,"Since late August  global and European rates have risen markedly  While it is difficult to pinpoint a single trigger  a combination of factors ranging from less geopolitical risks to central banks on hold has contributed to the perfect storm for global bond markets  In this research note we present seven drivers behind the recent fixed income sell off 
Looking ahead  we see near term negative economic momentum being counterweighted by the more positive risk sentiment prevailing in global financial markets  Hence  the risk of a 100bp correction similar to the one seen in the spring of 2015 should not be neglected  However  if we were to see the same correction  we are less than half way in the current correction at the long end 

That said  we keep the view that weakness in global data  low inflation expectations  more Fed cuts and ECB QE will keep yields low  We have a  0 60  3M  NYSE MMM  target for 10Y bund yields     

Seven factors that triggered the recent bond sell off
1  ECB has been repriced
We have recently seen a pronounced change in market ECB pricing  Ahead of the ECB September meeting  the market was pricing that the 1M Eonia would drop below  0 70   Now the market has lifted pricing close to 20bp to just below  0 50   In particular  the important 1y1y point  which is most prone to changes in policy outlook  has moved higher  This is pivotal as there is still a very close correlation between the 1y1y rate and 10Y bund yields 





The repricing of ECB expectations reflects the better risk picture in respect of Brexit and the trade war  but it is certainly also a reflection of the divergent views in the governing council members  The comments after the September ECB  package  that were put forward by the hawks of the ECB underline that further easing from the ECB for the time being is unlikely  and that Lagarde might face strong opposition if she favours new stimuli 
We underline that we see little impact on OIS rates from the implementation of the tiering system that starts 30 October  However  it cannot be ruled out that the underperformance for German Schatz  2y bonds  versus swaps that is bigger than for bunds  10Y  and Buxl  30y  might reflect that the market expects a lower demand for short dated bonds as European bank treasuries next month can place c EUR800bn in excess liquidity at zero  It takes away a sizeable demand for especially deeply negative yielding short dated bonds 
2  Concerns that the ISIN limits will constrain PSPP purchases
The move higher in longer dated yields might also reflect some investors starting to lose faith over whether the ECB QE is in fact open ended and whether or not there is a  permanent  buyer in the market  despite the ECB s clear promise that QE will continue until shortly before policy rates are hiked  There is currently a lot of discussion of what the ECB will do if it  runs out of bonds  especially in core markets where the issuer limit might become a binding constraint as early as 2020 
We estimate that the ECB can buy bonds for example in Germany for 14 15 months before it reaches the 33  ISIN limit  In the Netherlands  the number of months might be as low as 7 8 months  The ECB has so far been reluctant to discuss the apparent issuer limit  It has only mentioned that higher bond supply will be a  helping hand  going forward  The latter we are quite doubtful about  given the continued focus on balanced budgets especially in Germany 
If the ECB decides to bend the capital key implementation further or lower the share of the PSPP programme in the APP programme  all else being equal  it would be negative for core markets  whereas periphery and credit markets potentially could benefit spread wise 





When the first round of QE was initiated in 2015 the market sold off rapidly as investors concluded that everything had now been  priced in   Importantly  the first QE was not an open ended programme compared to the current programme  However  if the market is uncertain whether the ECB is ready to do  whatever it takes  when the issuer limits almost inevitably become binding  the open ended nature of the programme might be questioned 
3  Trade war and Brexit concerns are falling
Brexit developments together with the  phase 1  agreement between China and the US have been important triggers for the move higher in yields and improved risk appetite  Events are now clearly pointing towards yet another Brexit extension  with Brexit unlikely to happen on 31 October  For more see our recent Brexit Monitor that we published this morning  There are still a lot of uncertainties in respect of the trade negotiations  but they seem to be moving in the right direction  In our Weekly China Letter from 18 October we revised the probability of a bigger deal to 50  from 40  
4  Pricing is no longer for lower rates and momentum has shifted
While we do not want to rely only on technical analysis  we find the concept interesting as a way to gauge momentum  Most recently  the RSI on Bunds is showing that Bunds are significantly oversold at a z score of  1  which is a stark contrast to the close to historic overbuying at more than  2 5 z score at the  darkest hour  in late August  Added to this we notice that the 50 day moving average has turned positive and 100d is close to joining it should the recent sell off continue  or even stabilise   With the turn of the risk sentiment  one should be cautious going against current momentum 
We do not believe economic fundamentals could explain the pace of the rally we saw earlier this summer  neither have we seen a shift in economic fundamentals that can justify the sell off now  From a risk   reward perspective  it is noteworthy that markets attach equal probability of a further sell off versus a rally based on the volatility skew  The payer skew is now virtually flat  compared to being negative for a few months  in a sign of higher probability for lower rates than higher rates  
Furthermore  we also note that part of the explanation of the raging rally this summer is to be found in hedging of long term liabilities from pension funds and other institutional agents  Most recently  such investors do not find themselves in need to engage in new receiver positions  Note that the 30y euro swap rate is now 40bp higher compared to the trough  but still 40bp lower compared to the July high 
5  Incipient signs of better economic data from China
The economic outlook is still looking weak in advanced economies  in particular the euro area   Germany  Emerging markets and in particular China seem to have reached a trough in the business cycle  China Weekly Letter  18 October  and are now heading higher supported by both fiscal and monetary stimulus  In the case of the euro area  manufacturing PMIs have continued their downtrend and signs of adverse spillovers to service sector activity have increased  see Euro Area Macro Monitor  2 October   so the recent sell off is not driven by the euro area economic fundamentals  Conversely  we have also argued that the decline in summer was not grounded in fundamental readings either  but was part of a loss in sentiment  see point four 
For European rates  the main risk factors to the growth outlook are still expected to be the external environment  and to a lesser degree the German business cycle  
6  Inflation expectations have rebounded
After a dramatic collapse in market based inflation expectations in the aftermath of the ECB September meeting  reaching record lows of 1 13   inflation expectations have somewhat rebounded to 1 21   5y5y inflation swap   However  with realised inflation at current low levels around 1  and projections not pointing upwards from stubbornly low levels  inflation expectations are not expected to rise markedly from here 
The ECB s survey of professional forecasters  which has an update due on Friday  will be important for the overall tone from the ECB in the near term monetary policy outlook  The recent reading from July indicated 1 74  inflation expectations in the  long term  
7  Financial risk appetite has improved
Global equities markets have performed since mid August when yields bottomed out  It is particularly noteworthy that cyclical stocks and banking stocks have performed  That global equity investors expect a better economic outlook  and see the rise in yields as sustainable  is reflected in the higher equity prices in general for European bank stocks 
That said  some of the cyclical currencies such as SEK have not done particularly well  We have also not seen any upside for copper and oil prices ",2019-10-24,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/7-reasons-why-yields-are-higher-200477219,200477219
194054,415570,MMM,3M  MMM  Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates,opinion,"3M  MMM  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 58 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 47 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 58 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4 45   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of Post it notes  industrial coatings and ceramics would post earnings of  2 04 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 20  delivering a surprise of 7 84  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
3M  which belongs to the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  posted revenues of  7 99 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 32   This compares to year ago revenues of  8 15 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
3M shares have lost about 11 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for 3M 
While 3M has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for 3M was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 26 on  7 88 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  9 18 on  32 06 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Diversified Operations is currently in the bottom 37  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3m-mmm-q3-earnings-beat-estimates-200477325,200477325
194056,415572,MMM,EUR SEK  Winter Is Coming,opinion,"FX trends do not die of old ageThe Riksbank will have to stand down   rate cut in February 2020EUR SEK forecast raised to 1M 10 90  3M  NYSE MMM  11 00  6M 11 20 and 12M 11 20SEK  Winter is coming
In  Reading the Markets Sweden  27 September  we pointed out the macro risks and the outlook for EUR SEK for the month of October   a challenging month for the krona   We proposed  1  that  it might prove fruitful to short SEK against EUR  USD  JPY and or AUD in the short term   2  that importers and other natural net buyers should act early in the month and  3  that exporters and other natural sellers might as well wait until the end of the month 
The seasonal pattern divulges that October is the worst month of the year for the SEK  the 5Y average is a 1 1  increase in EUR SEK and the cross has risen every year since 2012  with a minimum of  0 2  and a maximum of  2 7   see table later in this document   We argue that this seasonal pattern is due mostly to macroeconomics  At the time of writing  EUR SEK was up 1 2  since the turn of the month  see the chart below  




We previously emphasised that PMI was the first  very important  macro trigger in the month of October  given that we saw scope for a fall below 50  This decline is materialising but we confess to being surprised by the sheer force of the movement in FX   7 figures over the day and EUR SEK printing above 10 80  Since then  we have also seen a high of 10 93  Yesterday s CPIF at 1 3   in line with the RB s estimate but 0 1pp above consensus  yielded a somewhat bigger downside movement in EUR SEK than the historical pattern would suggest 
The next  very important  macro triggers are labour market statistics  due 17 October  and the Riksbank  RB  rate decision  due 24 October   As far as the labour market is concerned  we see scope for a positive rebound  which would mitigate the worst fears and provide further relief for the SEK  Nevertheless  we remain firm on our view that the downturn is  and will be  sharper than proposed by the RB  The labour market is deteriorating  there is a marked cyclical slowdown  which NIER now also forecasts   inflation is muted and expectations are falling  with external growth conditions worsening  as illustrated by the IMF s warnings of sizeable cuts in the global growth prospects and international central banks cutting rates  In our view  it would be very odd for the RB to hike rates in the aforementioned setting  Once again  we refer to NIER  which forecast unchanged rates until end 2022 
There are compelling arguments for the RB to remove its turn of the year hike as early as the October meeting  although the latest inflation outcome spot on forecast might lend the RB some support  although at this point it does not signal an upcoming cut  which is our base case   0 25p cut in February 2020   How would this effect the SEK  The SEK has weakened quite substantially since the latest RB meeting  KIX is 3  above its forecast 
Pricing in RIBA contracts has fluctuated wildly and is currently indicating  3bp at the end of this year  Should the RB turn dovish  we have a hard time believing that we will see rates increasing and the SEK rising  However  one might argue that EUR SEK has to some extent already considered this and if so  this might somewhat limit the movement in the cross 




However  we can easily imagine a more malign scenario  where the SEK crosses take out new highs  volatility surges and the SEK depreciation accelerates  We cannot rule this out should all hope of non negative rates fade and if talks of a global recession gain traction  with everything this would entail for Swedish exporters  investments and employment 
Should the SEK lose it completely and volatility surge  we have a hard time envisaging any interest to be contrarian   even if one considers the SEK substantially undervalued  In a scenario such as that outlined above  liquidity issues could also come into play and on their own enhance the upward movements in EUR SEK and USD SEK 
Is the RB worried by the developments in the SEK  The answer is yes and no  no because it  at least theoretically  spurs inflation and yes because it would not want to contribute to a veritable collapse in the SEK  As previously stated  KIX is 3  above the forecast and we cannot entirely dismiss the idea that the RB could point to this and the latest inflation print in order to stick to its hiking ambitions  In the minutes from July  Martin Flod n clearly expressed his concerns about the SEK depreciation  He argued that further depreciation would neither boost growth nor be a desirable means of bolstering inflation  We agree with Flod n on both these claims  However  in our opinion  it is not enough that Flod n  who for the record has consistently argued against the RB s plans for FX intervention  is standing up for the SEK  He needs to have more board members onboard  We find this implausible  as the RB would then be at risk of shooting itself in the foot  However  were it to do this  it would be a major game changer for the SEK 
However  the RB has an inflation target and our belief is that this will continue to dictate monetary policy for the time being  As long as the wanted inflationary pressure from the labour market and rising wages are missing  pressure will remain for the SEK to compensate via import prices in order to get inflation back to target  The rationality in this could be called into question  especially as pass through is seemingly rather muted 




However  this is the reality  inflation is not self sustaining  With this in mind  the base scenario for the SEK ought to encompass continual depreciation  as it always has been  regardless of the FX regime  Since the RB introduced negative rates  EUR SEK has on average risen almost 10 figures each quarter  right hand chart below  
We have been bearish on the SEK for quite some time  This has been a strategically sound stance as it turns out  Nevertheless  the weaker the SEK gets  the more important it is for us to scrutinise our arguments  As far as macro and the RB are concerned  i e  the cyclical factors  we see no sufficiently convincing arguments for any imminent turnaround  In terms of long term fundamentals and valuation  we would say that the SEK has probably weakened more than is justified  e g  both PPP and the in house MEVA model indicate a fundamental equilibrium in EUR SEK close to 10 00  This does not necessarily mean that the trend depreciation of the SEK has reached the end of the road  FX trends do not die of old age  It needs a trigger 




One such potential trigger could be if the Swedish government decides to pursue expansionary  truly expansionary  fiscal policy  boosting growth and inflation prospects and easing some of the RB s burden  Aaccording to textbook economics  such a policy mix should support the SEK  In our view  this will surely be discussed  For the time being  however  the interest from politicians is rather cool  We believe this is sure to change should the Swedish economy continued to deteriorate  At the same time  said deterioration is in itself SEK negative  Another potential trigger could be the Fed cutting rates to zero and thereby killing the carry argument for long USD short SEK  This could also spillover into lower EUR SEK given that the SEK has been the main loser in the carry game  We do not believe this to be probable but believe it is far from unlikely and hence worth watching  A third possible trigger would be some kind of intervention against an SEK weakening going overboard  Honestly though  we have a hard time seeing this happening  In this context  we would like to flag the review of the monetary policy framework and the RB act that is currently ongoing and due for release on 30 November at the latest  It is a possibility that the review will end up with the recommendation that the RB should not be allowed to intervene in FX markets  given that FX policy belongs to the government  However  once again  we have a hard time seeing anything that would hamper monetary policy  we do remember how the government pummelled the SNDO when it asked for an increased FX mandate  as this was not aligned with the RB s wishes 
Overall  we believe it is premature to abandon our bearish view on the SEK  We are well aware that SEK bashing is somewhat consensus now   and this warrants caution  Nevertheless  given that recent weeks  movements have exceeded our bullish EUR SEK forecast and given that we continue to see headwinds for the SEK in our baseline macro scenario where the growth outlook deteriorates domestically and abroad and where the RB cuts rates  we see scope for rolling and recalibrating our forecast  we raise our 1M forecast to 10 90  previously 10 70   3M  NYSE MMM  to 11 00  was 10 80   6M to 11 20  was 10 90  and 12M to 11 20  was 11 00   Our 6M estimate builds on our call for a RB cut in Q1 next year  In our view  USD SEK could very well breach 10 00 before year end ",2019-10-11,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eursek-winter-is-coming-200472571,200472571

194059,415575,MMM,Earnings Preview  3M  MMM  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"3M  MMM  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Post it notes  industrial coatings and ceramics is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 52 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 3  
Revenues are expected to be  8 10 billion  down 0 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 67  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for 3M 
For 3M  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 10  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that 3M will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that 3M would post earnings of  2 04 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 20  delivering a surprise of  7 84  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
3M doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-3m-mmm-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200474613,200474613

Danske Bank s market view in a nutshell





Riksbank to postpone repo path
Since the September Riksbank policy meeting  the markets  view on the next policy step has been wobbling to say the least from at one point pricing in more than a 15bp rate cut to currently 7bp hikes  see table  so what has happened in the meantime 





Firstly  on the global stage there has been some tentatively positive news regarding a partial trade deal between the USA and China  No actual agreement has been signed yet but the higher tariffs that were planned to come into effect in October have been postponed  At least this could be seen as a sign that both sides are anxious not to escalate the dispute  But nonetheless  tariffs are still planned   much of the positives are just hopes for a deal  Secondly  on the Brexit front  the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU has abated with a last minute deal between Britain and the EU  What remains is that it will have to pass the British Parliament  Thirdly  the very weak PMI readings seen in Germany for some time finally got company from the US with ISM dipping below the 50 threshold and as did the Swedish PMIs  both manufacturing and services   Now  it seems pretty clear that global manufacturing industry actually is in recession  The question now is rather whether it will rebound soon or pull private services sectors with it down  Riksbank has perceived the global weakness mainly as a risk to its forecast  but now it should have become more a fact 
Since the September meeting  the full Q2 GDP data has been released  printing 1 0   y y versus the advanced estimate of 1 4  y y going into the Riksbank s forecast  Riksbank s forecast for Q3 is 1 8   y y  In comparison our GDP tracker currently suggests a print of 1 4   y y  very close to our assumption in our most recent Nordic Outlook  Moreover  there is no doubt that the labour market is deteriorating even considering that the most recent LFS prints probably overstate the unemployment rate to some extent  Statistics Sweden says that the unemployment rate was probably understated earlier this year  the rise hence started earlier but has been slower than suggested by reported data  see more below   In our view that makes the deterioration in the labour market more credible  not looking like a  2008 2009 moment  but rather like the impact one would expect in a more normal economic downturn  Of course  reported unemployment at 7 3  on average for Q3 is clearly higher than the 6 8   in the Riksbank s current forecasts  but as mentioned  it is hard to draw any conclusions from that 





At the same time there is no relief in terms of the inflation outlook  To be sure  September CPIF inflation did print 1 3  y y  in line with the Riksbank s forecast  In the next two months we do expect a slight increase in line with the Riksbank but CPIF will remain well below the 2  target  A more worrying development for the Riksbank may be  however  that inflation expectations  in particular money market expectations  are de anchoring from the target on all horizons  Less so on 5y  but the shorter horizons have recent been close to 1 5  
In the background  the Fed and ECB have been easing policies  the opposite of RB s intentions  All in all  we expect the Riksbank to signal a delay of the intended next rate hike  We expect at least a verbal intervention stating the hike will come in February rather than December  most likely it will be accompanied by a shift in the repo rate path too 
Unemployment at  
On paper  September unemployment did not correct at all but held steady at 7 4   s a   But   and this is an important but   SCB says that it has identified some calculation problems  In short  unemployment was underestimated earlier this year   in practice unemployment started to move higher during spring 2019  but the very steep rise in more recent months is overestimated  For employment it is the other way around  Revised data will be published within a month  So the big picture is   as far as we understand   intact  the labour market is cooling off but right now we simply do not know at what pace  For the same reason we do not know the true rate of unemployment at this stage  It is an irony that SCB on its home page states  We provide society with statistics that can be trusted 





Statistics for hours worked do not appear to be to be affected to any significant degree according to SCB  Working hours peaked in December 2018 and have declined somewhat since then  At this stage  the survey based data showing a decline in hiring plans seems to be the only job market data that can be relied upon for the time being 
New Debt Office forecast
In the July forecast the DO projected a SEK121bn budget surplus this year turning to a SEK19bn deficit in 2020  Notice that the large surplus this year to a large extent is an accounting effect due to the fact the RB earlier this year decided not to re finance a maturing foreign currency loan 
The forecast was based on the assumption of a soft landing with GDP growing at 1 4  next year and a very modest rise in unemployment  see table below   Data since July suggest to us that revision risks are tilted to the downside for most variables  Of course the DO is also somewhat blinded by data problems at SCB but it appears probable that unemployment will be marked up and employment down  The latest forecast from the NIER might give an indication 
Monthly actual budget figures released after the forecast  June   September  show an accumulated surplus of SEK29 9bn  some SEK10bn below forecast  The below projection budget figures through September combined with lower macro assumptions are an indication that the budget projection for 2020 will be revised to a larger deficit  How much is of course a matter of guessing and  projected  deposits on tax accounts makes it even more uncertain  A guesstimate is that the 2020 budget forecast is lowered by SEK10 20bn 
Also  the DO will provide a first forecast for 2021  How they decide to distribute borrowing between different debt instruments also depends on how the DO sees state finances over the entire forecast horizon  Normally though  higher borrowing means a somewhat higher gross supply in nominal bonds 
Also look out for news regarding a green bond 





Events next week





Kommuninvest to open EUR benchmark programme
On 10 October  Kommuninvest announced its intention to include EUR benchmarks in its funding strategy  currently dominated by SEK and USD with some JPY   At the same time the borrowing forecast for 2019 was confirmed in the range of SEK120 140bn  with an expectation to end up at the higher end of the forecast  As issuance in EUR will come at the expense of other currencies  this decision should all else equal be positive for the SEK benchmarks long term  Assessing the near term impact on the SEK benchmark funding is a bit more difficult due to the lack of details  but some back of an envelope calculations might give some input 





As of 30 September  Kommuninvest issued in total SEK104bn YTD  of which SEK66bn has been issued in SEK  including SEK11 5bn in green bonds   Assuming a year end figure of SEK135bn  this gives a borrowing requirement of around SEK30bn left for Q4 in total  If we assume that the share of SEK issuance will be held constant  this requires issuance of SEK20bn  Compared to Q4 for previous years  this looks relatively high  If one instead assumes the share of SEK to be 50   which is in line with previous years  the target for SEK is basically reached already  This  however  implies that the amount will instead be borrowed in a foreign currency  which will also make it look relatively high  assuming USD only   Hence  a combination of SEK and foreign currency is probably the most likely funding mix for the remainder of 2019 
As the announcement lacked details  we do not yet know if the ambition is to enter the EUR market during 2019  or if it will be in 2020  However  we would assume that preparing for an inaugural EUR transaction takes some time in preparation  so our base case is that it is more likely to happen in 2020 rather than 2019  Given the conventions of the EUR market  our best guess is that Kommuninvest may issue in EUR 1 2 times per year for a transaction size of about EUR500m to EUR1bn in the 5 7 year area  This would be similar to the strategy used by Swedish covered bond issuers 
Although the decision to enter the EUR market should be positive for SEK benchmarks ceteris paribus  it is hard to assess exactly how large the direct impact on SEK funding will be near term  This is due to the fact that the impact on SEK funding will also  as described above  be a function of the USD volumes  Given the rather large difference in USD funding volume for 2018  SEK65 8bn  compared other years  around SEK30bn   the near term strategy on USD volumes can make a substantial difference  Hence  we remain a bit cautious on recommendations on the SEK benchmark curve until we have more details on the EUR funding strategy  and how it will impact the overall currency mix  If Kommuninvest were to announce an EUR transaction this year  however  we would view it as near term bullish for the SEK benchmarks  Given the short dated maturity of the loan portfolio to municipalities  about three years on average  and the long end nature of the EUR market  we expect that entering the EUR market would reduce the borrowing requirements in especially the longest SEK benchmark loans

SEK weaker on softer Riksbank
As outlined in last week s Reading the Markets   SEK  winter is coming  we foresee no imminent turnaround in the SEK s trendwise decline but instead believe that EUR SEK will breach 11 00 by year end on the basis of weak Swedish fundamentals and the Riksbank cutting rates back to  0 50 in February  Yesterday s labour market statistics constitute the last key input before next week s Riksbank meeting and taken at face value they entailed further headwinds for the Riksbank and hence also the SEK  However  as discussed above  and as reflected in how EUR SEK traded immediately after the data release  there seem to be some measurement errors  of as yet unknown magnitude  to be taken into account  Even though Statistics Sweden points out that the last couple of prints are likely to have overestimated the actual unemployment  they also acknowledge that it probably was the other way around earlier in the year  Thus  instead of the substantial spike in unemployment that we have witnessed in the last couple of months  the  true  profile might be less steep  but nevertheless indicative of increased unemployment  This would actually fit our macro view of Sweden better than the pattern we have seen in recent data  and as such constitutes no reason for us to change our narrative vis   vis the Riksbank and the SEK 
Thus  we still expect the Riksbank to formally address the weakening Swedish fundamentals and a postponement of the rate hike signalled for the turn of the year remains our base case  However  we acknowledge that the somewhat uncertain state of the labour market may provide the Riksbank a respite at the October meeting  in where it keeps its forecasts intact in order to buy some time  If so  the SEK might well strengthen temporarily  However  this might prove short lived as we believe the pressure will be right back on the Riksbank as inflation will continue to undershoot the target  growth will remain subdued and global uncertainties are set to linger 
On that last note  we saw the SEK strengthening yesterday on substantial  risk on  following Brexit related headlines  It may be too early to get overly excited about this  however  as Johnson still has to get the deal through the UK parliament  On top of this  other risk factors  trade war escalation etc   still remain  Should sentiment turn sour once again  the SEK could be in for more trouble 
Current pricing indicates a 6bp hike in December  which is overly aggressive from our perspective  recall that pricing indicated a 16 17bp cut before the September meeting  since when Swedish data has continued to deteriorate   In other words  we see scope for a substantial repricing should the Riksbank start to quiver  If it instead sticks to its current plan of a turn of the year hike  it is reasonable to assume that some extra bps should be added to the pricing  Support levels to keep an eye on are somewhere around 10 60 and 9 60  in EUR SEK and USD SEK respectively  With this being said  we think that risk reward favours the downside  upside  in terms of RB pricing  FX  and in 3M  NYSE MMM  we see an imminent risk that EUR SEK and USD SEK are set to break through 11 00 and 10 00 respectively 
Liquidity proxy sheds light on FX performance
We have argued that the SEK depreciation rests on more than one leg  including cyclical factors  Riksbank  growth and more  as well as fundamental  current account  productivity and more    see FX Strategy 11 October and FX Strategy 13 May  Carry has  as you know  been a strong theme where the USD is the big winner and the SEK appears to be a main loser  The chart below with carry against momentum illustrates this  The USD lies in the upper right corner together with the CAD which makes sense  whereas the SEK and the EUR lie in the lower left corner  However  carry  while important  is not the sole driver in FX  Neither the NOK nor the JPY fit into carry narrative  The NOK has performed as poorly as or even worse than the SEK despite offering almost as attractive carry as the USD nowadays  The JPY has performed as well or even better than the USD  despite Japanese rates being negative  Our guess is that at least part of the reason is liquidity  Investors tend to prefer relatively liquid currencies in a more uncertain market environment  the reason being that it could prove more costly to exit long positions in a relatively illiquid currency when everybody runs for the exit at the same time 
FX  carry explains a lot but not everything   is liquidity the missing link 






How to measure liquidity in currency markets  One approach is transaction data as reported in the BIS Triennal Central Bank survey  Here we learn that USD is extremely dominant  being a part of 88  of all transactions  always two legs   EUR  32   is second  JPY  17   is third and GBP  13   comes in fourth  Then we have AUD  7    CAD  5   and CHF  5    SEK  2 0   and NOK  1 8   are ranked 11th and 13th with a much lower transaction than G10 peers but at the same time much higher than most EM currencies 
Here we have opted for another approach  namely the buy sell spread measured in pips for different FX crosses with the USD as base  A tight spread indicates higher liquidity and a less tight spread is a proxy for a less liquid currency  What it measures more precisely is the cost of making a  faulty trade   that is first buying a currency to the buy price and then immediately selling the same currency to the sell price with the buy sell spread taken into account  We have used a normal spread  normal markets  with a normal amount  USD20mn  under European time zone  c 12 00 CEST   The rank for G10 is displayed in the chart below  The most liquid currency pair is  no surprise  EUR USD  Not far behind comes USD JPY  Then there is a small jump to USD CAD and GBP USD  Liquidity in SEK  NZD and NOK is six to seven times worse than for EUR USD  The interpretation is not that NOK and SEK are illiquid currencies  but rather that they are much less liquid on a relative basis  In this way we are able to better understand why JPY is in the upper left corner and NOK in the lower right corner in the carry momentum chart above

Further signs of slowdown
The recent NIER business and consumer confidence survey basically reiterates earlier surveys  In part  the interpretation depends on whether you focus on levels  which the RB currently does  or the direction of data  As an example  looking at the private business sector in total  the NIER on one hand states that businesses  views on current demand are still slightly better than the historical average  On the other hand  demand conditions have been on a downward trend over the last year 
Comparing manufacturing and services producers we see a similar pattern as in the EZ  Manufacturers  production plans are now about as downbeat as during the Euro crisis  Services producers are not there yet  but expectations of future demand for the firms  services in September were below the historical average for the ninth consecutive month 





Looking at hiring plans  the picture is the same  Private businesses say that staff numbers have been about unchanged in the latest few months and hiring plans for the next few months are roughly unchanged as well  Manufacturing is an exception  with hiring plans close to the lows in 2012  How does this match with employment data which say that the number of employed and working hours have started to decline  We think the answer lies in the municipal sector  Data suggest that employment in this particular sector  which of course isn t covered in the NIER survey  has dropped quite significantly of late and we suspect that this is explained by the fact that many local governments  unlike the central government  are under financial pressure  Notice that local governments are not allowed to run deficits  If deficits occur  corrective measures must be taken  by either raising taxes  or cutting costs 
Back to the survey  we also observed that consumers  expectations of unemployment over the next 12 months jumped to a six year high  Honestly speaking this might very well reflect the intense media coverage of worsening labour market conditions  Nonetheless  it is worth keeping an eye on in case of potential second round effects on big ticket spending 





Profit taken in SGBi 3109 BEI
On the back of our CPI projection  on 7 June we initiated a position in BEI tightener  buy SGB1058 vs SGBi3109   then trading at an elevated 179bp  Only last week we reached the initial profit level at 160bp and decided to lower the level to 150bp 
Looking at our near term CPI forecast  we are approaching a period where we foresee some upward correction  We expect CPI y y in September to decline only slightly from the current 1 44  y y to 1 3  y y  Thereafter we expect a correction  reaching 1 66  in January before turning down again  see chart below  





As a result we have decided to close the position    150bp with a profit of 29bp  for now  awaiting another opportunity to re enter at a later stage 
Loss taken in NDH5532  May 2021   receive SEK 1Y 1Y outright
During the week we have also reached our loss level in our position in NDH5532  May 2021     10bp  This feels somewhat ironic  as recent economic data if anything have supported our case for a repo rate cut  Also  the ECB and Federal Reserve have cut rates since the case was initiated on 29 August  Nevertheless  the market has interpreted the Riksbank as less dovish  and given the recent MPR  minutes and speeches the Riksbank have indeed sounded hawkish 
However  we regard this as a result of the Riksbank s communication policy  The policy states that Riksbank s board members should stick to the official message until the minutes have been released  But more importantly  the communication policy states that after the minutes have been released  a board member  shall not  however  anticipate their own or the Board s future decisions   So let s say a board member  following a bad set of data  are contemplating a rate cut at the next meeting  Given the constraints of the communication policy  our interpretation is that the board member in such cases cannot publicly state that they are about to change their mind  Thus  our conclusion is that the Riksbank might not actually be as hawkish as they currently sound 
So to balance up our more rate bearish trades  FRA DEC20 21 steepener  2Y 5Y swap steepener  we decide to add an outright receiving position in SEK 1Y 1Y  in addition to our spread position vs EUR in the same segment  As we reason above  not much is priced in on the RIksbank at the moment   2bp in cuts over the next 12 months    as the market remains torn between the weakening data and the still somewhat hawkish signals from the Riksbank  Thus  we feel that current levels   8 5bp  are attractive for establishing new outright receiving positions  We set the P L levels to  30bp  7bp 





October a challenging month for the krona
October has historically been a challenging period for the SEK  EUR SEK and USD SEK have had a strong tendency to trade higher during the month  For EUR SEK it has been a positive month  green in the chart below  every year since 2011  which was when the euro crisis weighed on the cross   Since 2002  EUR SEK has traded lower only in 2006 and 2011  red in the chart   That makes October the single most negative SEK period with an average change of  0 56  over the last 20 years and  1 26  over the last five years  The October pattern is similar for USD SEK  which also has risen every year since 2011  The average USD SEK performance over the last five years is  3 09   In terms of EUR USD May is the most USD bullish period  followed by October  JPY SEK has also had a strong tendency to rise in October  as has AUD SEK which is up every year since 2008  that is  10 years in a row  Most other SEK crosses show a more mixed pattern 





For those who want to base their investment decisions on this seasonal trading pattern  it seems like a good time to enter a short position in SEK vs EUR  USD  JPY or AUD 
Importers and other natural SEK sellers should act early in the month whereas exporters and natural SEK sellers are advised to wait until the end of the month 
But what is behind this strong seasonality  Our view is that it often can be explained by soft messages from the Riksbank  similar to what we have argued has been a key reason for the strong April seasonality  It was the case in 2014   15 figures on the Riksbank day   2015  2016   26 figures  and 2018  2015 was on the verge of ending on a positive note for the krona  but the Riksbank changed that  at the last minute  with its decision on 28 October 
Some years inflation disappointments have set the tone for October  Hence  we argue that macro triggers have often been the cause of SEK weakness in October 





Macro triggers in the coming month and what potential they may have for the SEK 
1 Oct  PMI industry has kept up better than expected in light of the collapse in Germany where PMI September printed 41 4  The latest Swedish print was 52 4  Here we would look out for a sharp drop  to below 50  Very important for EUR SEK 
3 Oct  PMI services  Watch out for contagion from the industry and the labour market alike  Somewhat important for the SEK 
3 Oct  Speech by Riksbank s Cecilia Skingsley  Very important for EUR SEK 
4 Oct  Speech by Riksbank s Per Jansson  Very important for EUR SEK 
8 Oct  Industrial data  Weak global cycle in for Sweden important markets  Trade war has had a negative impact on global trade  which in turn correlates well with industrial production in a small open economy as the Swedish one  Somewhat important for the SEK 
9 Oct  Prospera s monthly survey has already dropped below 2    2 year expectations was last 1 7    and risks falling further  This data is super important for the Riksbank and a worry for some Board members  Very important for the SEK 
10 Oct  Inflation data  Our forecast is preliminary 1 2 tenths below the Riksbank forecast  Very important for the SEK 
17 Oct  Labour market statistics  Surprisingly weak summer readings  Chance for correction in a positive direction  which may dampen the worst fears  However  our view is that the slowdown is and will be sharper than the Riksbank anticipates  Very important for the SEK 
24 Oct  Riksbank rate decision  As far as the Riksbank is data dependent it is hard to see how it will not waver in its call for Dec Feb hike  Very important for the SEK

194067,415583,MMM,FX Strategy   USD  What Will It Take To Halt Dollar Strength From Here ,opinion,"EUR USD at new lows and we stress downside risks to our 1M target of 1 10 Three factors to watch for USD strength to be halted  trade  Fed and  Europe  EUR USD to stay under pressure well into October but a turn still seen for 2020 USD strength continues USD strength continues  EUR USD dipped below 2019 lows and touched 1 0905 overnight on little significant news  This is testament to just how supportive the current environment remains for USD  We see at least three reasons for that  1  A Fed that still appears reactive rather than proactive 2  Continued worries over trade talks  3  Investors having second thoughts regarding Brexit risks which have otherwise been priced out lately In this week s  FX Forecast Update  Scandi fragility to rule well into autumn  24 September  we stressed that USD strength is set to persist near term but notably kept our 3M  NYSE MMM  EUR USD targets unchanged at 1 10  USD DKK  6 79  USD SEK  9 82  USD NOK  9 09   We do stress that a further dip in EUR USD is on the cards as the above mentioned factors are set to dominate into early October  technically  good support is seen in the cross at 1 0865 though  Further  global recession risks are set to linger for some time still as stressed in  A Deep Dive Into The Global Recession Risk  27 September  and support USD in broader terms Where does it end  Watch these three First  will U S  China trade talks set to resume in the week starting Oct  7 result in an interim deal  Market expectations seem rather downbeat and if progress is shown  it should provide some relief for EUR USD  We do stress that it will likely not be the start of a USD weakness trend in itself  as elevated tensions between the countries suggest that a  real  deal remains far away  The joker here is that the impeachment process against the U S  President could make Trump try to direct focus elsewhere  e g  towards landing a deal 
Second  will the Fed end its  America first  approach to policy at the Oct   30 Fed meeting  We expect the Fed to cut rates once more by 25bp  both in October and December  but also look for a more permanent fix to the latest money market turmoil  This should put short end U S  rates back on a declining path and may help resume the carry erosion in USD  In light of current Fed pricing  room remains to price more easing  markets see just one 25bp cut in Q4 while we still look for two 
Third  developments in Europe  or what is left of it  remain key still  The Oct  17 18 EU summit ahead of the Oct  19 deadline for the UK to ask for an extension will be integral in weighing Brexit risks  In our view  another extension is likely and when granted should hold a hand under EUR  and GBP of course   What about the eurozone  The ECB will sit on its hands for now  but if inflation expectations continue to edge lower  EUR support could resume  as it will leave the sense of deflation grabbing hold   after all 
In sum  do not fight USD strength near term  but we maintain that it will not last forever and still see EUR USD grinding higher as 2020 progress  12M target remains 1 15  ",2019-09-27,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fx-strategy--usd-what-will-it-take-to-halt-dollar-strength-from-here-200468622,200468622
194068,415584,MMM,Market Guide   Monetary Policy Easing Is Back,opinion,"Market overview
Market overview
Trade war  where are we now 
Since August  markets have turned more optimistic regarding the October trade talks between the U S  and China and USD CNH is back around 7 10  An interim deal could be within reach because both sides seem to have an interest in this  Such a deal could include China buying some agricultural goods again in return for a further delay in tariff rates  While a small interim deal is a possibility in October  a real break through is hard to envision at this stage 
Brexit  optimism can be fleeting
The GBP has strengthened recently due to Brexit optimism in terms of negotiations between the EU and the UK  However  from here  it may not take much of a change in politics to get a large negative impact on the GBP  We still expect the UK government to ask for an extension  and call a general election  causing the GBP to yet again come under  political and economic  pressure  Looking into 2020  we remain cautiously optimistic that the UK will not end with  no deal  
Oil market  Saudi oil fields attacked
In mid September  a drone attack on Saudi oil production facilities took place  which was at first estimated to cause a temporary loss of about 5  of the world s oil output  This is a huge amount of oil and the market responded with a 20  jump in the oil price  However  the oil price fell somewhat back again  as the damage from the attack was not as big as first thought  We also saw limited effects in other financial markets  e g  NOK did not move much even though it usually follows the oil price closely  However  the attack has increased attention on the geopolitical situation in the region 
Fed cut the policy rate further and we expect to see more
While the Fed cut the interest rate by 25bp again at the last FOMC meeting as expected  it made it very clear that its eyes are on  America first  when it comes to policy   and that it does not commit to further easing for now  Further easing from the Fed will indeed be a help to the weaker global economy  but  at this stage  easing will likely remain half hearted from a global point of view as the U S  economy is set to stay  too strong  for Fed to pre commit to easing monetary policy  However  we still expect four more rate cuts from Fed  which should eventually support a weaker USD  but in a weak global environment and without precommitting to further easing  USD strength persists 
ECB delivered a big package
In September  the ECB cut the deposit rate by 10bp to minus 0 50  and introduced a tiered deposit system  which allows banks to place some of their excess deposits with the ECB at zero interest rate  while the rest will have to be placed at minus 0 50   This system is introduced in order to cushion some of negative impact that negative interest rates have on banks  business model  and variants of this system are already known in Denmark  Switzerland and Japan  The ECB also restarted its QE program  where it will purchase EUR20bn month worth of bonds 
The QE program is  open ended   which means it in principle can run forever or at least until the ECB sees a firm improvement in inflation  expected  and realized  
USD   Fed remains hesitant to pre commit
The Fed has signalled that its October policy decision is largely contingent on developments in the trade war  global data and US inflation  While it has continued to refrain from pre committing to further cuts  we expect the Fed will eventually get ahead of the curve and push EUR USD higher 
Outlook for EUR USD
Trade war escalation  geopolitical tensions  a downturn in global manufacturing and slow monetary policy adjustments by the Fed and the ECB are factors weighing on the U S  and euro area  While the U S  economy still looks relatively stronger  we consider a period of stabilisation around current weaker levels as more likely than an imminent turnaround in either economy 
In our view  the September ECB meeting could turn out to have been a game changer for EUR USD  Even though the ECB cut its deposit rate less than expected and introduced a tiered deposit system  Draghi and co  came close to convincing markets of their commitment to easing with their strong forward guidance and an open ended QE programme  Over time  these actions may support higher inflation expectations which  when viewed in isolation  could weigh on EUR USD  The Fed cut rates again in September and we look for a 25bp rate cut during each of the next four meetings  which would eventually place the Fed ahead of the curve in terms of monetary easing  For now  however  the Fed remains unwilling to pre commit 





The possibility of more forceful Fed easing in the short term represents a notable upside risk to our forecast  Given the current 50 50 market pricing of a 25bp cut in October  the next releases of ISM and non farm payrolls will be even more important for EUR USD in the short term  Ultimately  strong forward guidance from the ECB will give some counterweight to a continuation of Fed rate cuts in the short term  Eventually  we expect the Fed will get ahead of the curve and push EUR USD higher  We therefore keep our forecasts unchanged at 1 10 in 1M and 3M  NYSE MMM   1 13 in 3M and 1 15 in 12M 
GBP   optimism to make way for uncertainty
A spout of autumn optimism has strengthened the GBP in recent weeks  with markets pricing a lower risk of a no deal Brexit  In our view  renewed political uncertainty remains around the corner and we therefore continue to expect EUR GBP to trade near 0 90  We anticipate further volatility in the run up to the 31 October Brexit deadline 
Outlook for EUR GBP
GBP weakened somewhat after Theresa May stepped down and Boris Johnson took office  with additional weakening stemming from a decline in domestic demand  Since August  however  the mood has turned around and markets now price a lower risk of a no deal Brexit with EUR GBP back to hovering around 0 88  We think that optimism will prove short lived  GDP expectations are currently running around 1   Although downside risk is prevalent in light of Brexit uncertainty  as of today the numbers out of UK remain decent 
The Bank of England continues to be quite passive  In practice  monetary policy is unlikely to change before either 1  we see a much stronger worsening in UK data  or 2  the completion of a dramatic  or peaceful  Brexit  after which policy may move in either direction 
In the run up to the Brexit deadline in October  EUR GBP will remain volatile  Our base case continues to be an extension of Brexit and a new election  We expect EUR GBP will settle around 0 90  In the case of a decent deal or cancellation of Brexit  we believe EUR GBP will move to around 0 85  In the case of no deal outcome  we look for EUR GBP approach but remain below 1 0  In terms of our EUR GBP forecasts  we keep these unchanged at 0 90 throughout the forecast horizon 





SEK   Riksbank challenged by economic outlook
A deteriorating economic outlook and disappointing inflation prints are challenging the Riksbank s plans for a year end rate hike  and increasing the prospects of a policy reversal 
Outlook for EUR SEK





GDP growth is slowing at a faster pace than the Riksbank expected  as an already weak preliminary Q2 was revised down to 1 0  y y  The global outlook seems to deteriorate by the day  not least on key export markets  In addition  the labour market has been a clear disappointment over the last couple of months  In our view  these developments will make it difficult for the Riksbank to deliver on its repo rate forecast  The economic slowdown is a headwind for the SEK 
In our view  the Riksbank will have to back down from its plan to raise rates around year end for the following reasons   i  inflation and inflation expectations are dropping   ii  GDP growth is lower   iii  the labour market is very weak and  iv  other central banks are cutting rates  Such an environment is more conducive to a policy reversal and rate cutting  As such  we look for a  25bp cut around February next year  Since pricing is close to flat  growing expectations of a cut will weigh on the SEK 
Based on the cyclical economic slowdown and a subdued inflation outlook that will continue to challenge the Riksbank  we stick to our bearish medium term view on the SEK  Moreover  the upcoming wage round will  in our view  not make it any easier for the Riksbank to achieve its target 
As such  we do not expect a rate hike by year end  but rather expect a policy reversal leading to a rate cut in Q1 20  The market is currently pricing in a flat repo rate path for the coming year  providing room for a SEK negative re pricing of the Riksbank in the coming months  Although SEK is likely to remain data dependent  we remain comfortable with an upward sloping medium term trajectory for EUR SEK and leave the forecast profile unchanged at 10 70 in 1M  10 80 in 3M  NYSE MMM   10 90 in 6M and 11 00 in 12M 





NOK   weakness persists despite NB rate hike
With its rate hike this month  Norges Bank remains the sole G10 central bank hiking policy rates  Relative rates continue to have little impact on EUR NOK movements  however  and we suspect a substantial change to the external environment is required for NOK weakness to abate 
Outlook for EUR NOK





Recent economic releases out of Norway confirmed that the mainland economy remains insulated against weaker global growth impulses  The reasons are  1  oil investments  2  building and construction  3  strong public demand  and 4  rising real disposable income stemming from rising employment  higher nominal wages and lower inflation  The latest Regional Network Survey indicated average mainland growth of 2 7  y y over the next 6M  While down from the previous signal of 3 1   it remains above peer growth and  importantly  above the economy s trend potential 
As expected  Norges Bank hiked policy rates by 25bp at the September meeting  which again highlighted NB s emphasis on domestics and a weak NOK  Notably  NB signalled that this was most likely the last hike in the hiking cycle  even if the rate path actually implied a 40  probability of another hike in 2020  As we are slightly more upbeat on the labour market and the mainland economy than NB  we project another hike in March 2020 





The disconnect between relative rates and the spot exchange rate remains firmly entrenched in Norway  While NB again beat market pricing in September and hiked policy rates for a fourth time in a year  both the trade and import weighted NOK are at weaker levels than a year ago  Indeed  the persistency of NOK weakness has been a key reason behind the Norwegian economy s outperformance  That said  we think a substantial change to the external environment  in terms of USD strength  China deleveraging and broad commodity performance  is required for persistent NOK strength  As we do not expect such a change in 2019  we raise our forecasts to 9 90 in 1M  10 00 in 3M  NYSE MMM   9 70 in 6M  but keep our 12M forecast at 9 50

Ahead of the high level trade talks between the U S  and China   media report that China is not willing to discuss its industrial policy or government subsidies   something which is very important to the U S  government  China believes that its hand has strengthened with Trump facing an impeachment process and with the US economy slowing  This highlights why there are still many obstacles for reaching a real deal  even if we get an interim deal this week  as we anticipate 
Portugal s socialist Prime Minister Antonio Costa won the general election gaining more seats  but fell short of an absolute majority 
With respect to Brexit  this is a crucial week   as the EU wants a solution by the end of the week if the EU leaders are to accept any deal at the EU summit on Oct 17 18  The UK government has said that it will  consider  publishing the full legal text of its proposal   something it has been reluctant to do so far   if it will be  helpful  for the negotiations  PM Johnson also seems willing to take the Brexit Delay Bill to the court in order to avoid asking for an extension  or at least be forced to do it  
Scandi
In Norway  the government presents its budget for 2020  We expect the fiscal policy proposals to be mildly expansionary  with the structural non oil deficit climbing from 7 7  this year to 7 9   i e  a fiscal stimulus of 0 2pp of GDP  This is marginally more than Norges Bank assumed in September  but not enough to impact on interest rate expectations 
Fixed income markets
The main event in the global bond markets this week will be the trade talks between China and the U S  by the end of the week  If we get a positive result from the trade talks  bond yields will most likely move higher in the short run  but there is still plenty of risk factors for the market and with inflation expectations grinding lower  a rise in yields is likely to be short lived  Furthermore  there is a large amount of reinvestments coming to the European government bond market in the coming weeks as shown in our government bond weekly 
In the European markets we will get more budget from the Eurozone governments as they have to send in their 2020 budgets by October 15  So far  there has been limited additional spending in the budgets so the probability of a significant increase in the government bond supply seems modest  The French budget proposal indicated an increase in the supply of just EUR5bn from 200 in 2019 to 205 in 2020  In our government bond weekly we have given a first estimate of the supply for 2020  and with the reopening of QE  the net supply from most core EU markets is going to be negative in 2020 
We will get more information on Japanese investors  appetite for European government bonds in the investor data from Japan expected to be released mid week  In Scandinavia focus will be on the budget from Norway and whether the expected issuance for 2020 will be increased from NOK 50bn  Furthermore  inflation data are coming from both Norway and Sweden 
FX markets
As for most other markets  the high level trade talks in Washington will be the deciding driver for FX markets this week  If they reach an interim deal the last months have shown that a relief rally in high beta currencies such as NOK  SEK  AUD and NZD can go for at least a week at the expense of especially the JPY  With the latest stabilisation in Chinese data such a rally might go on for longer as the downside risk to the global manufacturing sector seems diminished  see our Chinese Weekly Letter   Is the Chinese business cycle turning   If on the other hand the trade talks break down we would expect the opposite price action  which would leave the Scandies vulnerable 
For the NOK it s also an eventful week on the domestic data calendar with most notably the fiscal budget  today   inflation and monthly national accounts  That said  we still think the global environment left from any potential interim trade deal is far more important for where the NOK is headed short term  A trade deal combined with a potential inflation surprise could leave a good potential for the NOK this week  Meanwhile  if China and US cannot find a common footing the NOK is set to suffer regardless of domestic inflation  Today s fiscal budget is unlikely to move the NOK  History has shown that even big surprises have  wrongly  had close to no market impact 
Weak manufacturing data last week pushed EUR SEK beyond our 1M 10 70 target towards our 3M  NYSE MMM  10 80 target  This week s production data is likely to be on the soft side and the September inflation figures look set to undershoot the Riksbank forecast  Hence  we see a good chance that EUR SEK will drift even higher in the coming days ahead more clarity of the trade talks

194070,415586,MMM,U S  China Trade Talks Resume And Scandi Inflation Data,opinion,"Market movers today Today the 13th round of high level US China trade talks kick off in Washington and continues tomorrow  We still see a good chance of an interim deal after China yesterday said it was still ready to make such a deal despite the US blacklisting of Chinese companies  FT also reported that China would offer to buy 10 million tons of soy beans in return for the US taking coming tariff hikes off the table  We do not know exactly when statements will come out of the talks but a good guess is late Friday  European time  The main event in the Scandies is the inflation numbers for September from Sweden and Norway  Swedish inflation is set to be crucial for the Riksbank outlook  see more on page 2 The minutes from the recent ECB meeting are set to be interesting reading  Since the meeting there have been frictions within the Governing Council  which peaked with the resignation of ECB board member Sabine Lautenschl ger  Furthermore  we have seen conflicting comments in the media  in which Chief Economist Philip Lane said that he did not believe that the ECB had delivered a big package and that it could cut rates further The US releases core inflation numbers and weekly initial jobless claims  We expect core inflation to stay unchanged at 2 4  y y in line with consensus  Jobless claims are still at a low level around 220k  signalling a low rate of layoffs despite the slowing economy UK PM Boris Johnson is set to meet with his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar on Thursday  A deal looks increasingly unlikely and an extension beyond 31 October and a UK election are more likely Selected market news 
The FOMC minutes were a bit outdated after the weak ISM data and the mixed picture from the US jobs report that was released after the September meeting and thus the market reaction to the minutes was muted  The minutes showed that the FOMC committee remains very divided on the number of future cuts and  several  participants thought the Fed should clarify its intensions  so we could see change in the forward guidance language at the upcoming meeting  The Fed also discussed the liquidity conditions but we already know from Powell s recent comments that the Fed will make an announcement in October on  organic growth  in the balance sheet  We believe consumer confidence tomorrow and retail sales on Wednesday next week are going to be key for the Fed s decision on 30 October  when we expect another 25bp cut 
It is a mixed picture on the Asian equity markets this morning  while we are awaiting the trade talks between China and US  Interest rates rose yesterday on the back of some optimism that a partial deal could be reached  Asian government bond markets have followed the move with a modest rise in bond yields this morning

In Norway  the inflation figures have faded into the background now that everything is about whether or not growth is set to hold up  Higher capacity utilisation and higher wage growth mean that domestic inflation will be pushing up and a weaker krone probably spells higher imported inflation  Nor do there tend to be any major monthly variations in September  so we expect the core rate to be unchanged at 2 1   with the risk possibly slightly to the upside this time around 
In Sweden  we are spot on consensus on all three different inflation metrics  CPI  CPIF and CPIF ex energy   which is somewhere between 0 1 0 2pp below the Riksbank s forecasts  Singling out CPIF  our forecast is 1 17  versus the Riksbank s 1 32   Potential upside risks to our forecast are mainly related to food prices  whereas clothing prices might not rise to the full extent as our forecast dictates and hence the risks are quite balanced  Always a key input  we argue that today s reading is perhaps even more crucial than usual and that the Riksbank cannot afford inflation to fall short of its already quite moderate forecast  especially since inflation expectations continue their downward drift as evidenced by yesterday s Prospera report  Although overshadowed by the inflation data  the household consumption indicator is also worth mentioning  where we expect a meagre 1  increase y y

The European core government bond markets sold off yesterday given speculation about a trade deal between US and China  even though it is only going to be partial  The Italian USD bond auction was heavily oversubscribed and prices were tightened  The Italian debt office sold some USD7 5bn with an order book that was above 18bn  On top of this  the yield spreads on the bonds were tightened relative to government bonds 
Today  we have Ireland selling in its Green bond IRISH 10 31  We expect to see decent demand despite the risk of a hard Brexit  See more here 
FX markets
It is a crucial day for Scandi FX with a Norwegian  Swedish and Danish inflation hat trick  While the latter will not matter for EUR DKK  both the Norwegian and Swedish releases have the potential of shaking up markets  Starting with Norway  our call is in line with consensus and Norges Bank s projection but importantly we see topside risks to this call from imported inflation as illustrated by this chart  While global news on trade developments could dominate any surprise later in the day  there is a potential for a rebound in the NOK  especially early on in the session  For Sweden  we think even our call in line with consensus  but far below the Riksbank s forecast  could firm SEK bears  positions  leading to even more headwinds for the heavily battered krona 
Yesterday  EUR GBP initially went lower on news that the EU might encourage a temporary backstop arrangement  but optimism in GBP quickly faded  Today  the GDP estimate for August is due for release  As Bank of England is starting to turn dovish  a worse than expected outcome is likely to take EUR GBP higher  as it adds to the need for easing in an already weak economy  We think EUR GBP will continue to face upside risk in the coming month s  as Brexit  politics  the domestic and foreign economy remain major headwinds 
USD JPY has come down from nearly 108 5 to 107 4  as global commodities and US interest rates have tapered some of the optimism that was built over September  on trade and global macro  but news on the trade war is the key short term driver this week  as negotiations are ongoing   Though headlines are somewhat volatile  we think the US and China will be able to reach an interim but small deal  In light of that view  USD JPY could snap higher on an initial positive announcement on or before Monday morning  depending on when such is announced  We would tend to fade that move  as the global economy remains on the back foot and we do not expect that to materially change in the short term  which is also why we keep our 3M  NYSE MMM  forecast of 106 0

194071,415587,MMM,Reading The Markets Sweden   Oct  11  2019,opinion,"September job data are crucial 
Keep receive SEK 1Y1Y position despite the inflation print 
SEK   Winter is coming 





September job data are crucial
In our view  this week s job market data are probably of greater importance than the latest  September  inflation numbers  CPIF at 1 3  y y came in one tenth above our forecast but very much in line with the Riksbank projection  the same goes for CPIF excluding energy   CPIF inflation at 1 3  is low but a decline in inflation in the autumn is in line with the Riksbank s forecast  It may be that the coming months will be a little more interesting  as the Riksbank expects a relatively steep increase from October onward  Then again  a few tenths higher  or lower  inflation is probably not that important this juncture  Instead  we believe the headache relates to where the economy is heading 
We have seen a hefty and unexpected rise in unemployment over the past few months  Indeed  the steep rise made us look for a correction last month but this did not happen  instead unemployment picked up again  Comments by the Riksbank range from concern to various explanations for why data are not very reliable  The latter is a bit worrying to us  as several other job related data points confirm that the labour market is cooling off 
Having said this  we too have a feeling that unemployment data may be a bit exaggerated  We were wrong about a correction last month but we make another attempt this time around  Admittedly  putting down numbers is to some extent a matter of guessing 





Trend adjusted unemployment has accelerated of late and over the past three months it has risen by 0 15pp per month  something similar has not been seen since the financial crisis  This is one reason we assume that seasonally adjusted unemployment falls quite a lot this time  We have a few relatively recent examples of adjusted UNR dipping by up to 0 8pp m m  We assume a decline from 7 4  to 6 8   i e  0 6pp   With a standard seasonal factor for September of  0 5pp  we end up with an unadjusted unemployment rate of 6 3   If correct  adjusted unemployment for Q3 will be on average 7 1   note that figures for previous months may be revised  compared with the Riksbank s upward revised forecast of 6 8  
However  this figure represents only a starting point  The more interesting uncertainty is how the Riksbank now sees the outlook for the job market ahead and this in turn depends on the outlook for the economy as a whole  In this respect  we find the National Institute of Economic Research s newly released forecast more realistic than the Riksbank s September projection  and more in line with our own  





The NIER says the boom has ended  Resource utilisation is still above normal but on the back of sub par growth  the GDP gap closes next year  The unemployment forecast is revised up quite significantly with repercussions for wages  On the back of weaker labour market conditions  the NIER now holds the view that next year s wage agreements are not likely to deviate much from the ones met in 2017  This is a fundamentally different view from the one brought forward by the Riksbank so far 
Keep receive SEK 1Y1Y position despite the inflation print





The recommendation to receive SEK 1Y1Y outright has had a rocky ride since inception on 27 September  At that point  the market was pricing about 2bp of cuts and from the starting level at  8 5bp in the 1Y1Y  we have been trading it as low as  25bp  Following the surprisingly strong inflation print on Thursday  around 10bp of Riksbank cuts was erased and current market pricing reflects a flat repo rate over the next 12 months  with 1Y1Y trading around  10bp again  Thus  it has been a rocky couple of weeks and  in hindsight  our set target of  30bp might have been a bit aggressive  even though it was set from a more strategic perspective  Therefore  as things stand for the moment  with basically no probability of a cut being priced in  we keep the position  Although next week s unemployment data may show a rebound  see earlier in this document   we find it hard to see a market reaction where a hike is starting to be priced in to a material extent  In addition  we do not see either the CPI print or next week s unemployment data as reason to change our Riksbank call for a 25bp cut early next year  Hence  we continue to like the risk reward profile of receiving SEK 1Y1Y 
SEK  winter is coming
In Reading the Markets Sweden  27 September  we pointed out the macro risks and the outlook for EUR SEK for the month of October   a challenging month for the krona   We proposed  1 that it might prove fruitful to short SEK against EUR  USD  JPY and or AUD in the short term   2  that importers and other natural net buyers should act early in the month and  3  that exporters and other natural sellers might as well wait until the end of the month 
The seasonal pattern divulges that October is the worst month of the year for the SEK  the 5Y average is a 1 1  increase in EUR SEK and the cross has risen every year since 2012  with a minimum of  0 2  and a maximum of  2 7   see table later in this document   We argue that this seasonal pattern is due mostly to macroeconomics  At the time of writing  EUR SEK was up 1 2  since the turn of the month  see the chart below  





We previously emphasised that PMI was the first  very important  macro trigger in the month of October  given that we saw scope for a fall below 50  This decline is materialising but we confess to being surprised by the sheer force of the movement in FX   7 figures over the day and EUR SEK printing above 10 80  Since then  we have also seen a high of 10 93  Yesterday s CPIF at 1 3   in line with the Riksbank s estimate but 0 1pp above consensus  yielded a somewhat bigger downside movement in EUR SEK than the historical pattern would suggest 
The next  very important  macro triggers are labour market statistics  due 17 October  and the Riksbank rate decision  due 24 October   As far as the labour market is concerned  we see scope for a positive rebound  which would mitigate the worst fears and provide further relief for the SEK  Nevertheless  we remain firm on our view that the downturn is  and will be  sharper than proposed by the Riksbank  The labour market is deteriorating  there is a marked cyclical slowdown  which NIER now also forecasts   inflation is muted and expectations are falling  with external growth conditions worsening  as illustrated by the IMF s warnings of sizeable cuts in the global growth prospects and international central banks cutting rates  In our view  it would be very odd for the Riksbank to hike rates in the aforementioned setting  Once again  we refer to NIER  which forecast unchanged rates until end 2022 





There are compelling arguments for the Riksbank to remove its turn of the year hike as early as the October meeting  although the latest inflation outcome spot on forecast might lend the Riksbank some support  although at this point it does not signal an upcoming cut  which is our base case   0 25p cut in February 2020   How would this effect the SEK  The SEK has weakened quite substantially since the latest Riksbank meeting  KIX is 3  above its forecast  Pricing in RIBA contracts has fluctuated wildly and is currently indicating  3bp at the end of this year  Should the Riksbank turn dovish  we have a hard time believing that we will see rates increasing and the SEK strengthening  However  one might argue that EUR SEK has to some extent already considered this and if so  this might somewhat limit the movement in the cross 
However  we can easily imagine a more malign scenario  where the SEK crosses take out new highs  volatility surges and the SEK depreciation accelerates  We cannot rule this out should all hope of non negative rates fade and if talks of a global recession gain traction  with everything this would entail for Swedish exporters  investments and employment 
Should the SEK lose it completely and volatility surge  we have a hard time envisaging any interest to be contrarian   even if one considers the SEK substantially undervalued  In a scenario such as that outlined above  liquidity issues could also come into play and on their own enhance the upward movements in EUR SEK and USD SEK 
Is the Riksbank worried by the developments in the SEK  The answer is yes and no  no because it  at least theoretically  spurs inflation and yes because it would not want to contribute to a veritable collapse in the SEK  As previously stated  KIX is 3  above the forecast and we cannot entirely dismiss the idea that the Riksbank could point to this and the latest inflation print in order to stick to its hiking ambitions  In the minutes from July  Martin Flod n clearly expressed his concerns about the SEK depreciation  He argued that further depreciation would neither boost growth nor be a desirable means of bolstering inflation  We agree with Flod n on both these claims  However  in our opinion  it is not enough that Flod n  who for the record has consistently argued against the Riksbank s plans for FX intervention  is standing up for the SEK  He needs to have more board members onboard  We find this implausible  as the Riksbank would then be at risk of shooting itself in the foot  However  were it to do this  it would be a major game changer for the SEK 
However  the Riksbank has an inflation target and our belief is that this will continue to dictate monetary policy for the time being  As long as the wanted inflationary pressure from the labour market and rising wages are missing  pressure will remain for the SEK to compensate via import prices in order to get inflation back to target  The rationality in this could be called into question  especially as pass through is seemingly rather muted 





However  this is the reality  inflation is not self sustaining  With this in mind  the base scenario for the SEK ought to encompass continual depreciation  as it always has been  regardless of the FX regime  Since the Riksbank introduced negative rates  EUR SEK has on average risen almost 10 figures each quarter  right hand chart below  
We have been bearish on the SEK for quite some time  This has been a strategically sound stance as it turns out  Nevertheless  the weaker the SEK gets  the more important it is for us to scrutinise our arguments  As far as macro and the Riksbank are concerned  i e  the cyclical factors  we see no sufficiently convincing arguments for any imminent turnaround  In terms of long term fundamentals and valuation  we would say that the SEK has probably weakened more than is justified  e g  both PPP and the in house MEVA model indicate a fundamental equilibrium in EUR SEK close to 10 00  This does not necessarily mean that the trend depreciation of the SEK has reached the end of the road  FX trends do not die of old age  It needs a trigger 





One such potential trigger could be if the Swedish government decides to pursue expansionary  truly expansionary  fiscal policy  boosting growth and inflation prospects and easing some of the Riksbank s burden  Aaccording to textbook economics  such a policy mix should support the SEK  In our view  this will surely be discussed  For the time being  however  the interest from politicians is rather cool  We believe this is sure to change should the Swedish economy continued to deteriorate  At the same time  said deterioration is in itself SEK negative 
Another potential trigger could be the Fed cutting rates to zero and thereby killing the carry argument for long USD short SEK  This could also spillover into lower EUR SEK given that the SEK has been the main loser in the carry game  We do not believe this to be probable but believe it is far from unlikely and hence worth watching  A third possible trigger would be some kind of intervention against an SEK weakening going overboard 
Honestly though  we have a hard time seeing this happening  In this context  we would like to flag the review of the monetary policy framework and the Riksbank act that is currently ongoing and due for release on 30 November at the latest  It is a possibility that the review will end up with the recommendation that the Riksbank should not be allowed to intervene in FX markets  given that FX policy belongs to the government  However  once again  we have a hard time seeing anything that would hamper monetary policy  we do remember how the government pummelled the SNDO when it asked for an increased FX mandate  as this was not aligned with the Riksbank s wishes 
Overall  we believe it is premature to abandon our bearish view on the SEK  We are well aware that SEK bashing is somewhat consensus now   and this warrants caution 
Nevertheless  given that recent weeks  movements have exceeded our bullish EUR SEK forecast and given that we continue to see headwinds for the SEK in our baseline macro scenario where the growth outlook deteriorates domestically and abroad and where the Riksbank cuts rates  we see scope for rolling and recalibrating our forecast  we raise our 1M forecast to 10 90  previously 10 70   3M  NYSE MMM  to 11 00  was 10 80   6M to 11 20  was 10 90  and 12M to 11 20  was 11 00   Our 6M estimate builds on our call for a Riksbank cut in Q1 next year  In our view  USD SEK could very well breach 10 00 before year end

Political uncertainty in Spain and Italy  Italian government bonds came under pressure yesterday as former Italian Prime Minister Renzi resigned from PD  one of the coalition parties in the new government  Renzi is a supporter of the new government  but the timing is unfortunate as the government is looking to agree on a budget for 2020 
In Spain we are looking for another general election as the Socialist Prime Minister Sanchez cannot find a majority in Parliament  This would be the fourth general election in four years  The Socialists are ahead in the polls  but whether Sanchez will get enough votes to have a majority is uncertain  Market impact on the Spanish government bonds should be modest as there is significant consensus regarding the economic policy in Spain  We are already long Spain and Italy  but would use a widening of both spreads to core EU to buy more in both Spain and Italy 
The main event today is the FOMC meeting  where the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates  Furthermore  given the reverse repo auction yesterday in US Treasuries  the expectations of another round of QE are increasing  US Treasuries rallied from the long end of the curve yesterday and we expect more downward pressure on treasury yields to continue as the FOMC lowers policy rates

FX markets
In FX markets  today s key event will be the Fed meeting  Markets have been  risk on  as no deal Brexit risk has faded  trade talks have resumed and US data has been decent  Today  the risk is how the Fed will be perceived and how it will communicate around a fairly strong US domestic situation but a still fragile and weak global situation   as the market is well positioned for a 25bp cut  So rather  the battleground will be in the updated dot plot and forward guidance  where we see a risk of the Fed disappointing market expectations  of further rate cuts   That would bring the Fed in line with the  mid cycle adjustment  story but surely disappoint markets  which would push EUR USD back down  We could see a drop in the magnitude of 50pips  We see the risk as being largely that Fed will talk up broad USD  If that is the case  EUR SEK and EUR NOK could also go higher  notably SEK  see below   In the past one to two days  markets have moved slightly but still notably towards such a  hawkish Fed  scenario 
Tuesday proved an eventful day in the USD money market  Early on  the upward pressure on short term USD funding rates from Monday persisted amid tighter USD liquidity conditions  In FX markets  this was translated into downward pressure on EUR USD to around the 1 10 level  When the Fed funds fixing for Monday came out at 2 25   an 11bp rise on the day and right at the top of Fed s upper target band  the market quickly started speculating that New York Fed would need to take action and provide liquidity to the market  NY Fed promptly responded by announcing an overnight repo operation of up to USD75bn  in the end dealers took USD53bn   The move quickly eased upward pressure on short term USD rates and triggered a move higher in EUR USD up to around 1 1060 
In our view  the events today will prove a game changer for the short term USD money market including EUR USD FX forwards  The Fed s hand was forced yesterday and we should expect it to play an active role in providing liquidity to the market  in turn making it less likely that we will see tight USD liquidity conditions in the coming months  This could otherwise have resulted in wider 3M  NYSE MMM  LIBOR OIS and or 3M EURUSD XCCY basis  which we now view as less likely  In this regard  we would be surprised if the Fed does not roll over Tuesday s repo operation  next week it might even need to raise the limit   The Fed may also need to fast track plans of a standing repo facility and or open market operations to gradually increase the balance sheet as it lowers its key policy rate 
EUR SEK moved higher yesterday as Swedish unemployment continued to rise  The Riksbank minutes were somewhat hawkish and in our view the market seems to doubt that message   and rightly so  We would not be surprised to see EUR SEK firmly established above 10 70  which coincides with our 1M forecast

194076,415592,MMM,Fed Cut With No Quick Fix To Tight Liquidity Conditions,opinion,"Still no pre commitment to more easing
As expected  the Federal Reserve cut its target range by 25bp to 1 75 2 00   Not very surprisingly we had three dissenters with Rosengren and Esther calling for no cut  as they did in July  and Bullard calling for a more aggressive cut of 50bp  We have a clear division in the committee and the biggest number of dissenters since 2016   The Fed did not make any major changes to its statement but repeated its easing bias    will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion      The Fed still does not pre commit to more easing  but Powell did not reject more easing may come down the road either   As expected  Powell highlighted the main reason for this second cut was that trade uncertainty has risen and global growth has slowed further since July 
We have not changed our Fed call on the back of the meeting  i e  we expect a cut at each of the next four meetings  That said  given the division in the committee  an October cut may be a closer call than we thought  Markets also price in a 50  probability for a cut  Powell hinted that we should continue to monitor 1  political trade uncertainty  2  global data and 3  US inflation  We should of course also look at US growth but it seems like the first three factors have been the most important factors explaining the two cuts so far  as most FOMC members think the US economy is doing fine  This also means the outcome of US China trade negotiations in early October is important for the Fed s decision six weeks from now 
We continue to stress that nothing indicates a majority anytime soon would support a larger cut of  for example  50bp   which is also the Fed s normal approach to easing outside recessions  we need to see more deterioration in the labour market before this will change  
The curve 2 10y flattened almost 4bp to 4bp  as 2 and 10y yields moved in opposite directions  We will soon again be discussing the implications of an inverted US curve  Given our view that the Fed will continue to cut rates at the next meetings we still see downward pressure on the long end and we stick to our 10Y US treasury yield target for 2020 at 1  
No quick fix to tight liquidity conditions
Fed addressed the issue of upwards pressure on short term USD funding rates  including the past two days  elevated Fed Funds fixings  It decided to lower the interest on excess reserves 30bp to 1 80   which leaves it 5bp above the lower bound of Fed s target range  During the press conference  Powell faced several questions on the issue  He left the overall view  that Fed was surprised about the extent of the recent funding pressure  but that it expects it to be temporary  He furthermore stressed that Fed stands ready to provide liquidity if needed   most likely through temporary overnight repo operations  Finally  he let the market now that Fed will be looking into how it will manage the size of its balance sheet going forward   most likely in the coming six week intermeeting period 
The sum of Fed s actions and communication overall left the market disappointed   December 3M  NYSE MMM  USD FRA OIS rose around 3bp during the meeting as the market was looking for a more firm solution to current tight liquidity conditions 
The factors behind this week s funding pressure are not extraordinary and will return in December  The market seems to be growing concerned that Fed will be fine with a reactive approach to managing liquidity 
EUR USD dipped on hawkish Fed
USD rates moved higher on the FOMC meeting on lack of commitment to more rate cuts this year  Before the meeting  the market was pricing about a 50  probability of another 25bp cut in October and December respectively  In addition  USD rates were pushed higher by lack of actions from Fed to resolve pressure on short term USD funding rates  see section above   Consequently  EUR USD dropped some 40 50pips down to around 1 1020 as higher USD rates supported USD on broad basis  For now  we stick to our 3M forecast of 1 10 for EUR USD 
We still look for more rate cuts from Fed  which should eventually support a higher EUR USD   However  the easing package  and in particular strong forward guidance  from ECB last week does add some counterweight to more Fed easing  In the near term  there is room for the pair to trade lower if Fed actively attempts to steer the market away from expecting more rate cuts  but also for the pair to move higher if data weakens and the market starts to price more Fed cuts again

More bad  job  data
In the latest couple of weeks we ve had soft GDP for H1  a low CPIF print and terrible jobdata  In the meantime  market pricing of the Riksbank has been reduced from a 17 18bp cut over the next year  to about 5bp  Even after last week s ECB decision to lower the deposit rate and re start QE   with considerable objection from some board members one might add   the market is looking for something like another 15bp in cuts over the same timeframe  We find that combination interesting   see more below 





The latest batch of job market data cannot easily be dismissed  After a couple of months of sharply rising unemployment  we really thought it was time for a correction in August  That did not happen  instead unemployment jumped again  Data during summer are usually more uncertain  but that does not mean that the jobless rate always spikes  but simply that volatility is high  From that point of view  recent prints are noteworthy  The Riksbank hiked its unemployment projections only a couple of weeks ago  but even the new forecast appears to be obsolete 
Other labour market data do not look any better  Employment continued to drop  Total hours worked has come to a standstill in y y terms  The latter is worth monitoring because it could be a sign that GDP growth is coming close to a stand still too  Probably not in Q3 because GDP  q q  made a one off half a percentage point decline a year ago  But Q4 is definitely at risk  In any case  recent months  job data have taken us all by surprise 
It was no surprise then  that social partners made a story of this  but from different angles  Employers of course stress that bad signals mean that wage deals due to be agreed next year must be set at lower levels than the current one  2 1 2 2 percent   Unions do not deny that economic conditions are getting worse  but say that now is not the time to shift down wage growth because that would only shave demand further  Our impression is that next year s wage deals will not differ much   if at all   from the latest wage round 
Against this background  next week s data   especially the NIER business confidence survey   will be of great interest  Businesses  views on demand developments and hiring plans going forward deserve attention 





Swedish events next week





Time to receive SEK 1Y 1Y vs EUR
In our view  the Riksbank minutes from the September meeting were already somewhat obsolete at the time of their publication  as we have received crucial information since then  both in terms of central bank action  the extensive ECB measures  and domestic data  For the latter  the weak GDP numbers  with two consecutive quarters of near zero growth   another worrisome unemployment number in a row and disappointing inflation outcome stand out 
The RB minutes reveal a certain appetite for normalizing monetary policy  Ingves   the very expansionary monetary policy was never intended to last forever   Ohlsson   In Sweden  we can conduct our own monetary policy    but that remains contingent on the Swedish economy continuing to operate at a high capacity utilization 
As Gov  Ingves himself stated  both market pricing and the Riksbank cannot be right  and someone has to be wrong about the economic outlook  We suspect that the Riksbank is much too optimistic regarding the labour market and  by extension  for the inflation outlook  Still  the Riksbank s continued hawkishness has meant a reluctance to maintain a high probability of a rate cut 
The recent ECB meeting was more contentious than is normally the case for the consensusdriven organisation  The idea of increasing QE in particular met internal resistance 
However  we also note that the cut in the deposit rate was a modest 10 bps  and the downward pressure on Euribor was further constrained by the fact that the ECB chose to introduce a two tier system  Compared with where 3M  NYSE MMM  Euribor traded in June  the fixing is only down by less than 10bps  Going forward  it could be argued that the threshold for further stimulus is probably higher  Moreover  as the ECB obviously has some concerns regarding bank profitability  another cut in the deposit rate may not even be the preferred instrument if the ECB decides to stimulate further  At the same time  the OIS market prices around 15bps in cuts over the next year 





Over the last couple of weeks pricing on the RB has been reduced from 17 18 bps in cuts to currently some 5bps over the coming year  We believe it will take more for the ECB to meet market expectations than for the RB to postpone further rate hikes and move towards easing 
Thus  in our view  pricing for a RB cut is relatively modest  especially when compared with pricing on ECB  Moreover  we note that the upward pressure on 3M  NYSE MMM  Stibor has subsided  Predicting where Stibor is heading in the short run can be difficult  though we note that the significant drop  around  7 5bps  in the Swedish fixing has not affected the level in SEK 1Y 1Y 





Thus  we like receiving SEK 1Y 1Y vs EUR SWAP  3M  NYSE MMM     42 7bps  We set the P L levels to 25 57bps 
Will the Riksbank follow Norges Bank s lead  Don t count on it 
Norges Bank just announced its fourth hike since September 2018  and its third during 2019  The policy rate was raised to 1 50   which is to be considered respectable in the current market  It is not completely unreasonable to point towards Norges Bank s action and rhetorically ask oneself   hey  if they can move against ECB Fed and hike rates  then why shouldn t the Riksbank be able to do so as well  
A justifiable question  as it concerns two small open economies after all  Nevertheless  one would then overlook the fact that both the composition and the current state of the two economies differ markedly  Where Norway has a certain oil cushion against a global downturn  at least up until the price of oil falls markedly   Sweden instead relies heavily on a globally exposed manufacturing sector  In the meantime  Norges Bank remains successful in maintaining inflation above target  unemployment is near record lows and the growth prospects are still relatively fair  at least compared with the rest of Europe  Once again  the situation is completely different in Sweden  where the Riksbank has seen inflation sliding down towards 1   unemployment has taken an unexpected leap  albeit from low levels  but the rate of change is still rather remarkable  and growth is at a virtual standstill  0 1  q q during both Q1 and Q2  and has plunged to 1  y y  Nothing  short of the Riksbank disregarding economic fundamentals and plainly deciding that it wanted to leave negative territory  could in our view warrant a year end hike  which we see as very unlikely  we go for a cut in early 2020   Anyway  the fact that Norges Bank once again hiked rates should play no role whatsoever in the Riksbank s decision  as the states of the economies are simply too different to be comparable  Potential dips in EUR SEK following repricing in favour of the Riksbank s hiking ambitions that may emerge on the back of today s hike from Norges Bank should be taken with a pinch of salt  and could instead be used for an entry towards 11 00  our 12M target

194079,415595,MMM,FX Strategy  EUR GBP Don t Forget  Optimism Can Be Fleetin,opinion,"GBP has priced in a lot of Brexit optimism in terms of negotiations between the EU and the UK  However  from here  it may not take much of a change in politics to get a large  negative repricing of GBP  We recommend considering hedging at these levels with a strong spot  thus removing high risk 
GBP has rallied on optimism  but not much more
In the past month s   EUR GBP has moved lower from 0 93 and the key catalyst has been the notion that the EU and UK might resolve their issues  We ve seen a new low at 0 88  GBP DKK just shy of 8 50  as EU s Juncker was quoted saying that a deal could  maybe  be reached before the October deadline and GBP rallied accordingly  We view this re pricing since August as fair but unstable  rising expectations of a decent Brexit solution and or extension do indeed lower the probability of seeing an immediate increase in tariffs and a recession for the UK  see  What if  no deal Brexit scenario for EUR GBP  
Consider getting hedges in at these levelsFollowing the recent GBP rally  we stress that it will take only minimal negative news to substantially reprice GBP spot  Chart 1   In terms of possible outcomes  our cyclical fair value estimate for EUR GBP is 0 85  Chart 2  and a full no deal takes sterling close to  but below  1 0  But  even with an extension  we should not reprice all the way to cyclical fair value as an extension would be accompanied by an election and thus renewed political risk  In turn  this will put pressure on the weak economy which could move lower as uncertainty is extended  The result of an election is not clear either  but it does have the potential to add volatility back in to GBP  From an FX perspective  we observe that GBP can often be seemingly  irrational  in the pricing of realistic political outcomes versus headline driven news and be quite momentum driven  Thus  in October and ahead  we see scope for repricing risk in EUR GBP  when viewed from the stance of today s optimism  Our base case remains a Brexit extension will be needed once more  with the risk of a renewed drop in GBP being omnipresent  we target EUR GBP at 0 90 in 3M  NYSE MMM   In light of this  we consider the risk reward from locking in GBP income favourable at current levels ",2019-09-23,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fx-strategy-eurgbpdont-forget-optimism-can-be-fleetin-200466928,200466928

Asian stocks slid this morning as the China US trade war developments remain fragile and things on the news front continue to be volatile  After last Friday s sour sentiment in trade war developments  the Chinese media wrote that a cancelled visit to US farm states by China s delegations was not linked to trade discussions  The yen fell  US stock futures and crude advanced  while Japanese markets are closed for a holiday today 
Last Friday  the US Fed declared measures for easing concerns about financing Treasury purchases and to make more confident bidding at this week s auctions  The Fed will provide overnight repo operations from Monday until Friday  10 October  The first will be hold for up to USD75bn  and later for at least that amount 
The geopolitical environment in the Middle East remained shaky over the weekend  The US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview that the US is trying to avoid war with Iran  while the additional troops sent to the Gulf region are for  deterrence and defence   Pompeo added that that US President Donald Trump would take the necessary action if Iran failed to change its behaviour  Iran s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif declined to rule out a war after the US announced it sent more troops to Saudi Arabia 
In the UK  focus will be on Brexit developments as the economic data calendar is very light  A particular focus is the UK government s negotiations with the EU over a solution to the Irish backstop  which seems to be the main sticking point in striking a deal with the EU  EU Commission president Juncker expressed earlier some optimism that a deal could be reached before 31 October  while the Irish government sounded more cautious

Last Friday  S P lifted the rating on Spain from A  to A and the outlook was changed from positive to stable  S P cited the nation s balanced economic growth  imp roving budgetary position and prospects for continued fiscal consolidation  The upgrade was a surprise given the political stalemate in Spain and the upcoming 10 November election and the general slowdown in the European economy  DBRS also took action on Friday   changing the outlook to positive from stable on its A rating  We are long 10Y Spain vs France and expect some 5bp SPGB performance today in the 10Y segment

After back to back central bank meetings in recent weeks  focus in FX markets will turn to a reality check in the form of flash PMIs as to whether recent rate cuts   but limited hope for more to come across the board   will be enough to keep global growth afloat  As hinted by our quantitative macro models  there is clearly a risk of a further slowdown in activity near term 
More broadly  since August  markets have been pricing in an optimistic scenario for trade and Brexit and we have seen JPY weakness together with GBP and CNH strength  Over the past week  this optimism has been tested somewhat as trade talks got a smaller bump  On the back of Friday  s less flattering headline for trade talks  we saw CNH reverse back to 7 10 and USD JPY also crawled lower towards 107 50   not least supported by a less than  expected dovish Bank of Japan  Trade talk set to be in focus again near term

Focus will also stay on USD liquidity  last Friday  the New York Fed announced that it will continue temporary repo operations until 10 October  From Tuesday  it will be for at least USD75bn and it will also start offering at least USD30bn in 2W repo  The news should help calm USD funding markets further after last week s liquidity scare and in p articular calm the growing anxiety with respect to liquidity over the coming quarter turn next Monday  Front end EUR USD FX forward pips have normalised and 3M  NYSE MMM  USD FRA OIS narrowed on the news last Friday

Merritt had an eagle chip on the last that could have won it for him but could not convert it  He finished at 44 points 
The format  designed to reward aggressive play  gives eight points for an albatross  five for eagle  two for birdie  zero for par and subtracts a point for bogey and three for double bogeys or worse

194087,415603,MMM,Reading The Markets   Sweden  6 September 2019,opinion,"Are we back to 2011 
August inflation data
Hawkish Ingves may provide a selling opportunity in the SEK





Are we back to 2011 





We think the Riksbank took most of us by surprise by sticking to the view that it is appropriate to hike around the turn of the year  Instead  the new repo rate path is distinctly flatter than in July  The end point  Q3 22  is 53 basis points lower than in July  The revised repo rate path implies about 2 5 rate hikes  62bp  over a period of three years  What kind of monetary policy guidance is this  In our minds  it is not credible 
It is almost as though we are back in 2011  In September that year  the Riksbank flattened the repo rate path compared with the July forecast as global growth deteriorated but was nevertheless planning for hikes throughout 2012  Three months later  in December  after the ECB had started to ease  the Riksbank delivered the first of a series of cuts  see righthand chart above  
We simply cannot understand the rationale behind the sharp flattening of the repo rate path  It would have been more sensible to keep the steepness while postponing the path as the economy weakens  Still  in our view  this is a first step towards postponing rate hikes in coming meetings and eventually cutting the repo rate it in early 2020  Riksbank appears to take little notice of the implications of a weakening labour market  In particular  we find this statement fascinating    the rate of wage increases is expected to rise over the next few years  among other things because the wage bargaining round in 2020 will take place in a situation where the labour market has been strong and inflation close to 2 per cent for several years   We believe the opposite  In a deteriorating labour market  we would be surprised to see higher wage growth 





In many ways  the analysis presented in the monetary policy report is  in our view  weird  It acknowledges that the Fed has eased  and that the market expects more to come  and that the ECB has made clear the need for more stimulus  Growth forecasts for the eurozone and US are basically unchanged though  This  in turn  is because the central banks are easing policy  We guess this is one way to look at it 
Sweden is in a phase of slowdown but economic conditions remain strong  However  resource utilisation is set to normalise a bit more rapidly than we previously thought  The report acknowledges that the labour market looks somewhat weaker and the unemployment forecast has been revised up  The Swedish GDP forecast is not changed in any meaningful way 
Again  we have a hard time piecing together the different parts of this report  Maybe the Riksbank is buying time  as trade conflicts and Brexit could be resolved and maybe then things could look better  so why not wait  or maybe the policy decisions and forward guidance are a compromise  We would not be surprised if the views of hawks and doves were very divided this time around  Henry Ohlsson may well have argued again for hiking now  while Per Jansson might have made a case for the opposite  So  the way to reach a compromise was to keep the rate hike around the turn of the year intact but at the same time to flatten the curve 
Nonetheless  unless economic data  internationally and in Sweden  turn for the better  we find it hard to believe that the Riksbank will actually hike  Instead  we keep our call that a rate cut early in 2020 looks more probable 
August inflation data
The key driver for August inflation is a seasonally typical correction  downward  in airfares  with prices moving up sharply in June July and falling back in August  Food prices have gone up a lot this year  The July figure  2 1  m m  was by far the highest for at least 25 years  We assume a correction of  0 5  in August  This is in line with August 2018  so maybe there is a downside risk to this  Our CPIF estimate this time does not deviate from that of the Riksbank to an extent that is worth mentioning 





Events in Sweden





Hawkish Ingves may provide a selling opportunity in the SE





EUR SEK immediately fell from 10 74 to 10 66 but  at the time of writing  the cross has recovered to around 10 69  The message was not as soft as we and market had expected and thus the fall makes perfect sense  Fair value according to our short term model fell from around 10 70 to just above 10 60  Given that the money market swiftly removed 7bp of the 17bp of cuts until April next year  the net reaction so far in the FX market appears somewhat muted  One reason may be the substantial flattening of the rate path  which supports our view that the Riksbank will remain one of the softest central banks around the globe  Yesterday s decision may be viewed as relatively hawkish compared with an ECB measures next week and temporarily weigh on EUR SEK  We still think the next move is a cut and  as such  we continue to see EUR SEK as a buy on dips  keeping our 1M and 3M  NYSE MMM  targets at 10 70 and 10 80  Technically  there is strong support around the 10 60 area  For what it is worth  the Riksbank s new KIX forecast implies a stronger SEK ahead  However  in July  it expected KIX to rise near term  weaker SEK   now it expects KIX to fall  stronger SEK   Well  it got the SEK s first reaction right

After the jobs report and Fed Chair Powell speech on Friday the blackout period has now commenced ahead of next week s FOMC meeting  The market is about priced for a 25bp cut next week  while there is room to price faster pace of rate cuts at the upcoming meetings in our view  We see potential for a lower USD JPY as the market gradually pencils in more Fed cuts short term  Regarding EUR USD  focus this week will be on the ECB meeting

194089,415605,MMM,Bank Of Japan Preview  On Hold But Action Increasingly Likely,opinion,"We expect the BoJ to keep its  QQE with yield curve control  policy unchanged at the next monetary policy meeting ending on Thursday  19 September 
The economy is still going strong  which calls for patience considering the limited tools left at the BoJ s proposal  The global economy is the most important driver of deflationary pressures in Japan 
The VAT hike and global political uncertainty pose risks to the economy and upward pressure on the yen  The probability of further easing has risen 
USD JPY has moved up to 107s as expectations have been building for positive outcomes in global fiscal policy  monetary policy  US China relations and the global industrial cycle  We remain rather cautious of such pricing and expect USD JPY will continue to stay in a downward drift  We target 105 in 3M  NYSE MMM  and still see substantial potential for going below that target 
Strong economyThe state of the global economy and global monetary policy will be discussed heavily when the board members of the BoJ meet on Wednesday  On the one hand  Fed easing could add pressure on the BoJ to ease in order to avoid a further strengthening of the yen  On the other hand  easing abroad could give some relief to the global economy  which would ease the pressure on the  Japanese  manufacturing sector and on the safe haven yen  There is no doubt that the BoJ will follow market reactions to the Fed s decision on Wednesday closely Manufacturers have struggled but the sector PMI index has held up  hovering between 49 and 50 since the beginning of the year  Industrial production is down 1  yoy  a minimal contraction in a global perspective  However  the domestic economy has been solid and GDP growth has surprised on the upside in H1 with an average annual growth rate of 1   Like the Fed  the BoJ has to consider whether the good fortune could be turning  The nominal effective yen is up 8  yoy  which continues to add pressure on Japanese exporters by eroding competitiveness and it weighs heavily on prices of imported goods  So far  the deflationary pressure has not materialised  but it is likely to do so in coming months if the surge in the yen is not broken and global deflationary trends continue Signals from board members still indicate some patience
At the last policy meeting in end July  Kuroda mentioned the possibility of pre emptive easing and said    We will take policy action without hesitation  if necessary to avoid the risk of prices losing momentum    Since then and after the trade war intensified and the yen surged  we have seen three board members  including Kuroda  on the wires 
Goushi Kataoka  the board s super dove  gave a speech where he stressed that the need for additional easing is heightening   no surprise here  He also mentioned the side effects of further easing as something to watch for and he has not decided whether he is going to put a proposal to cut the short term rate to a vote  Hitoshi Suzuki  a former commercial banker who is probably the most hawkish in the nine member board  sees no need to ease further  He is afraid that if bank deposit rates effectively turn negative  it could hurt the economy by cooling consumer sentiment 
Kuroda has been quoted as saying that cutting rates further into the negative zone is always an option  He still stresses that the side effects of further easing must be assessed  According to  sources   BoJ policymakers are growing less confident about an early pickup in global growth and may be more open to debating additional easing  Overall  the nettakeaway from the communication over the past month does not indicate a strong sense of urgency  This indicates to us that the BoJ is still leaning towards a wait and see mode  but the board is likely to be more divided from now on  We could see the dovish deputy governor Wakatabe call for easing 
Still not the timeWe expect the BoJ to remain in wait and see mode  Japan s economy is in good shape  The unemployment rate actually hit its lowest level since 1992 in July and the labour market is historically tight  Even if this does not spur inflation currently  it is nonetheless the channel that the BoJ is counting on to make it happen  Potential policy action depends largely on the outlook for the global economy right now  Our base case is that we get a  muddling through  scenario for the global economy and high level trade talks between the US and China do not escalate tensions further  But there is a likely scenario where it will be more risk off in markets  In that case we will see further yen strengthening and the BoJ will have to respond in OctoberOn 1 October  the VAT hike is implemented  There is plenty of room for the economy to lose momentum if the global economy keeps souring  With limited tools left at the BoJ s proposal  we think the BoJ will remain patient  though  also considering how fiscal policy continues to be heavily expansionary  We could see a tweak to the forward guidance  This would be a  cheap  way of doing something and once again try to signal that the BoJ is ready to act  However  there is a risk that coming to the table while not really delivering anything will backfire  as markets might interpret it as a confirmation that the BoJ is indeed powerless to counter a further escalation of the global downturn The 10 year rate target is another way to adjust the policy stance  The 40 basis point range around the target has already been breached and Kuroda has signalled that it should not be taken too literally  The range could be widened  but this would only open the door for the market to test even lower levels  which is probably not an attractive outcome for the BoJ considering recent tapering in the 5 10 year segment in an attempt to steepen the curveUSD JPY to be driven by external conditions  not BoJ
Once upon a time  we did see USD JPY on a trend for higher levels  But that s long gone these days  What did work  however  was the combination of Abe   Kuroda back in 2012  15  when they managed to depress Japanese real yields by over 200bp 
But since 2015 16  the BoJ has not been willing to compress real rates further  Today  USD JPY is driven by US real rates  By extension  credit spreads and inflation expectations determine USD JPY in the short run  see chart  In our view  the BoJ will not be coming back to the table to change that significantly 
The BoJ may be shifting towards a discussion of easing and action may be coming closer  In practice  we view any adjustment as something along the lines of a one and done rather than the beginning of continued easing which would need to be priced in the currency  In turn  USD JPY would continue to be determined by global  rather than domestic  monetary conditions 
In our view  USD JPY is headed towards 105 or lower in the coming months  To change that view  we will need to see a substantial change in external conditions ",2019-09-13,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bank-of-japan-preview-on-hold-but-action-increasingly-likely-200464299,200464299
194090,415606,MMM,Reading The Markets Sweden   13 September 2019,opinion,"Riksbank minutes likely to show decision was a compromise


Unemployment   time for a correction 

Overview of current recommendations
Nordic market players turn bearish on the SEK   Danske survey





Riksbank minutes likely to show decision was a compromise
The Riksbank minutes are likely to show that there has been significant disagreement within the Executive Board about the shape of the repo rate forecast and that the surprising flattening of the path was the result of a compromise  Arguably  Per Jansson as the most dovish member has seen weakening global and domestic data  easing signals from both Fed and ECB and global bond yields plunging into negative this summer as signs that the next step for Riksbank is to postpone rate hikes or even prepare to cut rates again  At the opposite end we have Henry Ohlsson and Martin Flod n who have both been at the forefront of raising rates  Ohlsson has probably continued to argue that the economy and labour market is strong and inflation and inflation expectations close to target  Flod n may have been more concerned about the SEK weakness  We believe a middle way between an unchanged repo path and a postponed one was the flatter  The discussion should be put into the context that this week we saw all measures of August inflation being 0 2 p p  below forecast and Prospera s broad based quarterly inflation expectations falling again on all horizons 





Speaking of central banks  now the Riksbank is no longer in doubt what the ECB will do  The deposit rate has been cut by 10bp while keeping the door open for more  The press release says   expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels    QE has been re started by EUR20bn per month  more or less open ended  The ECB says that QE is to run for as long as necessary and to end shortly before they raise interest rates  We guess that could take a while  There is a reason behind all this  Growth is too poor and inflation stuck too low  Hard to believe that the Riksbank can stick to the  all looks pretty fine story  for long 
Unemployment   time for a correction 
Unemployment data for the last couple of months have been quite awful  On top of that data  other job market data confirm that labour market conditions are cooling down  Employment has turned down  overtime hours are dropping and vacancies are off their peak  According to PES  arbetsf rmedlingen  monthly statistics  several columns have decreased since August last year  New vacancies declined 22 4   y y  remaining vacancies and applicants who got employed decreased 13 7  and 17 8  y y respectively  However  vacancies are still at quite a high level 
Having said that  one should also keep in mind that summer months are volatile and subject to uncertainty  In seasonally adjusted terms  unemployment has spiked from 6  in April to 7 1  in July  Honestly speaking  this looks somewhat exaggerated  Therefore we would guess that it is time for a correction  Given the fact that seasonally adjusted numbers are very volatile  a forecast is really a matter of informed guessing  Nevertheless we are looking for a decline in unemployment  s a   from 7 1  to 6 8  but would not be too surprised to see a somewhat bigger correction  On the back of this  we are looking for a drop in unadjusted unemployment from 6 9  to 6 3   A smaller   or no   correction downwards in unemployment would really be astonishing 





Overview of current recommendations
Last week s Riksbank decision  where it kept its forecast of a rate hike by year end  obviously hit our recommendation to go outright long in 2Y covered bonds  However  after the poor inflation expectations and inflation data we feel that the case for a rate cut next year is still very much alive  Our inflation forecast is substantially lower than the Riksbank s  and low inflation will in turn likely lower inflation expectations further  The next quarterly Prospera inflation survey will be released on 11 December  about a week before the Riksbank s December decision  If our inflation forecast proves correct  both inflation and inflation expectations should make it difficult for the Riksbank to hike  but rather increase pressure to ease policy  Add to this the worrying signs from the labour market described earlier  Currently  the market is pricing about 7bp of Riksbank cuts over the next 12 months  about 10bp less than before the Riksbank meeting  We find that too little  and consider the risk reward for the 2Y covered bonds segment attractive 
Nordic market players turn bearish on the SEK   Danske survey
Yesterday we published the quarterly FX Thermometer  This time we asked our Nordic client base whether Norges Bank will hike this year and whether the next move from the Riksbank is a hike or a cut  Clients also gave their three month  9 December  forecasts on EUR SEK  EUR NOK and EUR USD 
Main takeaways
Norges Bank  A majority of the respondents in our survey thinks that Norges Bank will decide to raise rates before year end  55  expect a hike versus 45  for no hike  While it is not far from a 50 50 call it still suggests a higher degree of conviction among Nordic market players that rates will be raised compared to market pricing which indicates some 40  probability for a hike in 2019  Danske Bank expects 25bp already next week 
Riksbank  Nordic investors and corporates have no clear view as to whether the next move from the Riksbank is a hike or a cut  50  of respondents lean towards what is communicated by Mr Ingves and 50  share our view that the next move is a cut  Comparing this with market pricing which indicates  8bp by April 2020  our clients are more hawkish  Here we note some interesting differences between countries  60  of Swedish and 86  of Norwegian clients expect a hike  whereas 80  of Finnish clients expect that the next move from the Riksbank is a cut  Hence  Danske Bank finds itself in the Finnish camp  expecting a 25bp rate cut in February 2020 
EUR SEK  For the first time ever in the history of the FX Thermometer and after 23 consecutive quarters of projecting a lower EUR SEK  most often with a poor outcome   Nordic market players expect a weaker SEK this time  The average 3M  NYSE MMM  forecast is 10 71  which is 0 6  higher than current 10 65  Both Swedish  10 71  and Finnish respondents  10 75  have a bearish view on the SEK  whereas Norwegians expect that EUR SEK will drop  10 51   Danske Bank sees EUR SEK at 10 80 in 3M ",2019-09-13,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reading-the-markets-sweden--13-september-2019-200464302,200464302

Selected market news 
The ECB cut the deposit rate by 10bp to  50bp  leaving the MRO and MLF unchanged  while also linking it to the inflation outlook  In addition  the ECB restarted QE by EUR20bn month with an open end  which was a strong commitment  but a very vocal call from Draghi indicated a need for fiscal policies to take the stage now  Given the much clouded environment and need to gauge the market impact of the tiered deposit system on money market rates  we do not expect the ECB to change policy rates in our horizon at the current juncture  However  if further monetary easing is needed  it would come via a rate cut and not further QE 
The short end of the EUR money market curve suffered markedly on the publication of the details of the tiered deposit system  which potentially could mitigate part of the effect of the rate cut  while the longer end of the yield curve is broadly unchanged on the day  EUR USD initially sold off on the open ended QE announcement  but bounced back after details of the tiered deposit system was announced 
Following the rate cut from ECB  Danmarks Nationalbank announced a 10bp cut in its key policy rate  the rate of interest on certificates of deposit  to minus 0 75   It left the current account rate and the lending rate unchanged at 0 00  and 0 05   respectively  Danmarks Nationalbank also kept banks  current account limit unchanged 
In the midst of the ECB meeting  rumours surfaced that US had discussed offering China an interim trade deal that would delay and roll back some tariffs in return for concessions on the issue of intellectual property rights and purchases of agricultural goods  The White House later denied  OPEC  announced that it will put more pressure on members not complying with output cuts in response to concerns of a growing supply surplus in the oil market  Finally  US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin dismissed the rumour from earlier in the week that US mulls an easing of sanctions on Iran 
Fixed income markets
A very dramatic day in the European fixed income markets on the back of the ECB meeting  Looking beyond the near future  ECB and Draghi are sending strong message that rates are  low for a very long  time as well as an open ended QE  such that the ECB could be stuck with a QE programme  for infinity  as market participants describe it  This is very dovish  However  the market reaction to the tiering was very hawkish with plenty of speculation of banks expected to close  the carry trade   where they had borrowed money from ECB and bought short dated bonds 
Furthermore  the discussion on whether it would be the  average rate of the deposits   which is some  26bp or the marginal rate of the deposit  which is  50bp  that would determine the front end  it was clearly the  average rate   Hence  yesterday s move from ECB is actually working more like a rate hike  Hence  the combination of an expected closing of the  carry trade  and the  average rate  turned the bullish flattener into a bearish flattener in core  and semi core EU government bonds 
What do we believe in  We think that the ECB was very dovish  and we stick with our long positions in the periphery versus core and semi core  long Italy versus Germany France  long Spain vs  France   We still like being long Buxl spreads even though the size of the QE is not as big as expected 
If inflation expectations do not continue to rise there is risk of more flattening from the long end  However  we do not really believe that  the carry trade  argument for the rise in the front end yields as Italian and Spanish banks holdings of Italian and Spanish government bonds has not increased  and in Spain has actually decreased  Furthermore  looking at the  free flow  in German government bonds based on ECB data it does not seem that German bank treasuries have stocked up on German government bonds either  In Denmark the rise in yields rates takes some of the prepayment risk in 2  bonds  as the price of 0 5  30Y callables declined yesterday  However  the decline was modest relative to e g  the decline in the Bund future  If we enter into a period where 0 5  30Y callables are NOT the preferred alternative for the borrowers  then the prepayment risk is declining  and solid carry will be supportive for the callable mortgages

The ECB meeting proved a roller coaster ride for EUR USD   as it usually is when the ECB changes interest rates  The pair initially jumped as the ECB cut only 10bp  but sold off immediately afterwards on the open ended QE programme and strong forward guidance  During the press conference  the market got cold feet as ECB President Draghi sidestepped questions about QE details and addressed negative side effects  Finally  when tiering details were published EUR USD rallied back above the levels from before the meeting  In the short term  the combination of the rate cut and tiering could cause volatility in the short term EUR money market  which could spill over to EUR USD  Over the medium term  we think that the ECB regained some credibility today with its strong forward guidance  which makes EUR a more two sided bet  We keep our forecast on 1 3M of 1 10  The Fed meets next week  where we look for a 25bp cut in line with market expectations  but likely no strong pre commitment to further easing  which will could weigh on EUR USD 
The decision by Danmarks Nationalbank  DN  to cut its key policy rate 10bp  see front page  could start to put renewed upward pressure on EUR DKK  When the dust settles  there is a good chance that the rate cut by DN will have bigger impact on DKK rates than the rate cut by ECB will have on EUR rates  due to the introduction of a tiered deposit system in the euro area  That in turn would lead to a wider discount on EUR DKK in FX forwards  which could push EUR DKK higher  There could be scope for a return to the levels seen in Q2 where a 3M  NYSE MMM  EUR DKK FX forward traded close to minus 0 25  and EUR DKK spot close to 7 4700 
In Scandies  despite no releases in Norway  yesterday marked a very eventful day for NOK with the ECB announcement  tiering details revelation  rumours of a trade deal and subsequent denial and an oil price mirroring USD  Overall  the day weakened our call for a tactically lower EUR NOK over the coming week as higher EUR rates lifted the broad EUR  We do  however  still pencil in a Norges Bank rate hike next Thursday to add support to the heavily tested NOK  There was relatively small gyrations in EUR SEK on the ECB meeting  Pressure on the Riksbank to respond to global central banks and in particular the ECB is one of the headwinds for the SEK going forward  Today s second Q2 GDP release is a potential market mover if we see significant revisions  In our quarterly FX survey  Danske s FX Thermometer  it is notable that the Nordic client base  for the first time  has turned bearish on the SEK  A majority expect Norges Bank will raise rates this year while the average forecaster stays bullish on the NOK

194098,415614,MMM,Focus On The FOMC Minutes Ahead Of The Federal Reserve Conference In Jackson Hole,opinion,"Market movers today 

The main data release today is the  FOMC minutes from the July meeting  which we get tonight  A lot has happened since the last meeting so the minutes may seem hawkish in the current context 


Today  PM Boris Johnson is meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel to  among other things  discuss Brexit  In his letter Monday  Johnson made it clear that the backstop needs to be removed for the withdrawal deal to pass the House of Commons but the EU has repeatedly rejected this  as it sees it as a necessary insurance policy to avoid a hard border  The swift refusal yesterday led to a depreciation of GBP 


In Scandi  we get Norwegian unemployment and Danish employment figures  The Danish figures will reveal whether the latest slowdown in employment growth is due to the economy reaching full employment or due to the global slowdown beginning to take its toll on the Danish economy 

Selected market news 
It has been a mixed session in the Asian equity markets this morning  while we wait for more clarity on a number of political events such as the trade war between the US and China  Brexit and the recent political uncertainty in Italy  On top of this we have the global monetary outlook where central banks are expected to ease 
US Treasuries rallied modestly yesterday as US equities declined  but we are still some 5 6bp above the lows seen earlier in August 
Yesterday  Italian PM Conte resigned on the back of Vice PM Salvini calling for a vote of confidence on the government  Italian government bonds rallied as the market expects a new coalition of a more pro business and pro EU government  However  it is now in the hands of the Italian President to explore the possibility of a new government or whether to call for a general election 
US President Trump continues to call for more rate cuts and thus there will be focus on the FOMC minutes tonight and Fed President Powell s speech at the conference in Jackson Hole on Friday  President Trump has cancelled his trip to Denmark as the Danish PM Frederiksen refused to sell Greenland

We get labour market data from Denmark and Norway  Norway publishes unemployment for June  Unemployment is expected to be unchanged from May  In Denmark  employment data for June are released 
Fixed income markets
European government bond yields decline as European equity markets again suffer  Hence  bond yields follow US Treasuries down  The political situation in Italy is challenging after PM Conte resigned yesterday  and we are looking at a potentially volatile trading day in Italian government bonds 
Today  we have auctions in Denmark and Germany  Germany is launching a new 30Y Benchmark DBR 0  08 50  This is the first time ever for Germany to issue a 30Y bond with a coupon of 0   The German Debt Agency will sell to EUR 2bn at the auction today 
We expect it will be priced 3 4bp above DBR 1 25  08 48  Given the low yields and the liquidity in the secondary market demand at the auction is likely to be modest  We recommend buying the new 30Y versus swaps as the trade has positive carry and the ASWspread is very tight ahead of the expected reopening of QE 
In Denmark the Debt Office will tap in the DGB 0 25   22and DGB 0 5   29  We expect to see solid demand for the 10Y benchmark as it is the bond with the least amount of negative carry among Danish government bonds see more in our preview 
FX markets
Among the Scandies  EUR DKK continues to inch lower and reached the lowest level since last year around 7 4560 yesterday  We think the drop is most likely due to positioning ahead September s ECB meeting  as expectations rise of aggressive ECB easing  so has the chance that Danmarks Nationalbank will not fully match ECB s easing package  which would send EUR DKK lower  Also  yesterday  at the same time as af Jochnick reiterated the Riksbank s official view on the SEK   the krona expected to strengthen    USD SEK took out a fresh new 17 year high  briefly trading above 9 73  highest since mid 2002  before falling back towards 9 70 once again  Current sentiment is like poison for the procyclical SEK  with flight from risk and seemingly ever increasing uncertainties regarding the global economic outlook   not to mention the still attractive USD vs SEK carry  which we argue has played a big part in the trend wise incline of USD SEK as of late  As we forecast an even stronger USD in the short term  and in due time expect the Riksbank to abandon their hopes of reaching zero  it is not hard to envisage an even higher USD SEK in the short term  Our 3M  NYSE MMM  forecast currently stands at 9 82 
In majors  focus on FOMC minutes due to release ahead of Powell speaking on Friday at Jackson Hole  but it is more likely to be the latter that can make us wiser on whether we are in for a series of cuts  While we might end there   we look for five more cuts from Fed by early 2020  see also Presentation  Five more cuts from the Fed  chart pack    it is probably too early for Fed to commit to it which could keep USD strength in place for now

194100,415616,MMM,Risk Underperforms As Trade War Goes From Bad To Worse,opinion,"Market movers today Markets will watch out for further trade war escalation and  tit for tat  headlines  after China on Friday announced tariff hikes on US imports and President answered in kind In Europe focus is on the German Ifo index for August  Last week s PMI figures finally signalled some stabilization  but the ZEW survey gave a different signal  We think the battered German economy is not yet out of the woods  see  here   and hence look for a further deterioration in today s Ifo expectations and current situation assessment on the back of ongoing geopolitical uncertainties In the US  preliminary capex orders in July are due  which will be interesting in the light of the ongoing manufacturing slowdown and trade war uncertainty  It seems that many companies are reluctant to invest in the current environment Selected market news The US China trade war went from bad to worse to an unprecedented level on Friday with a tit for tat escalation of imposing tariffs from either side of the front  On Friday afternoon  China announced countermeasures to Trump s 10  tariffs on USD300bn of Chinese goods  Beijing will add 5 10  tariffs on USD75bn of US imports on 1 September and 15 December  see China weekly letter  here    Trump responded violently  The president  ordered  US companies to find an alternative to China  and said that he would respond to China s tariffs in the afternoon  US time   After US markets closed  Trump announced that he would raise tariffs by 5  on all US imports from China  which amount to around USD550bn  The US will raise tariffs on USD250bn of Chinese imports to 30  from 25  on 1 October  The 10  tariffs on USD300bn of Chinese imports will be raised to 15  on 1 September and 15 December  With the latest tit for tat escalation  it s nearly impossible to say how the end game of the trade war will play out  Near term  we should watch out for  a  China s response to Friday s tariffs  b  China s countermeasure to the blacklisting of Huawei and its affiliates  which Beijing says that it will announce soon  c  information about trade talks set to take place in September  and d  signs that China considers imposing restrictions on exports of rare earth metals  We expect that China will respond to the US s blacklisting of Huawei and Friday s tariffs  See also  Harr s view  Lower equities  higher volatility on trade war escalation  
In Powell s much awaited Jackson Hole address he did not pre commit to more easing as expected  which in other words means an unchanged Fed narrative  He repeated the easing bias through  will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion   We believe that in particular Powell addressed two very important items  1  the worsening trade war  Powell referred to the period since the July FOMC meeting as  eventful   2  the global economy has shown more weakness since the July FOMC meeting 
The Asian session points to another risk off mood to dominate financial markets after the escalating trade war with equities down around 2  US 10Y touched 1 48   which has not been seen since late 2016 
Fixed income markets
The trade war between the US and China continues to dominate global financial markets and the yield on 10Y Treasuries fell some 12bp from the peak on Friday on the expectation of more easing from the Federal Reserve  and both China and US adding tariffs on each other s imported goods  However  we have seen limited impact on the 10Y BTPS Bund spread which is now below 200bp despite the political uncertainty in Italy and the bleak prospects for the Italian economy in case of a full blown trade war 
This week  there are 2Y and 10Y auctions in Germany and Italy sells a 2Y 0  bond on Tuesday and traditional BTPS on Thursday  We expect that the Italian Tesoro will launch a new 7Y bond on Thursday as they have done for the past four years  Furthermore  we expect that Finland will  open  the new issuance  season  in the European government bond market with a syndicated deal this week  The Finnish State Treasury has traditionally been the first one to come to the market in Q3 and this year is no different  We expect it to be a 5Y benchmark  See more in our Government bond weekly 
In Scandi markets both Norway and Sweden will tap sale in government bonds  Sweden will do a 7 year benchmark and 10Y benchmark  Norway will announce today which bond they are going to issue 
FX markets
Fed hawks did their best talking up US rates and USD last week  but it all turned around Friday after Fed chair Powell s Jackson Hole speech and the escalation of the trade war 
USD rates and USD JPY are now trading close to mid August lows and even EUR USD bounced on the news even though the pair has been less receptive to trade and or US monetary policy news lately  Development on Friday means that markets will be on its toes this week before key US data releases  ISM and NFP  next week  We stress that we still see potential for USD JPY to undershoot our 3M  NYSE MMM  forecast of 1 05 
In Scandi FX  especially the NOK suffered from the further  tit for tat  trade war escalation on Friday as risk assets came under pressure returning EUR NOK to the 10 00 level  This illustrates the important point that domestic releases are far less important in driving the NOK now relative to the global risk environment  We expect this to also be the case this week  That said  this week will finish off with a range of important Norwegian numbers  GDP  retails sales  NAV  which  however  are more likely to drive front end NOK rates 
Our expectation is that the numbers will come out to the strong side of markets  expectations and hence increase market expectations of a September rate hike from Norges Bank  All else equal  this should drive a stronger NOK  but we emphasize the global environment is far more important at this stage

Danske Bank s market view in a nutshell






Heading towards a rate cut
Our updated Riksbank call is that the RB brings the policy rate back to  50bp  presumably in February  even though the timing could be affected  for instance  by how the Brexit story unfolds 
Over summer it has become increasingly apparent that Sweden s economy is shifting down a gear  Certainly an export oriented economy as Sweden is affected by the prolonged economic underperformance in Europe and elsewhere  But that s not the full story  Private businesses  capital expenditure has weakened and the Services sector s confidence is clearly lower  Perhaps most importantly  we have seen a rather abrupt cool off in the labour market 





The latest batch of confidence data  NIER business and consumer confidence surveys  just released only confirms the picture  The overall economic tendency indicator dropped to 94 9  lowest since summer 2013   Softness is relatively widespread  but perhaps a bit more pronounced in manufacturing where production plans are down to a six year low  Looking at all private business sectors  NIER says that employment appears to have levelled out and production plans don t point to any improvement going forward  In the meantime  consumers expect unemployment to rise over the coming 12 months 





As far as inflation is concerned  the latest couple of readings have been marginally higher than the RB forecast  however the current forecast s  like Danske Bank s  projection points to declining inflation numbers going forward  Under different circumstances the RB might have been able to look through a period of low inflation  relying on high resource utilization and relatively healthy growth  This now is becoming increasingly difficult 
In addition  inflation expectations have turned down  If lower inflation expectations among social partners should feed through to wage expectations  the result would be fatal to hopes of higher wage deals next year 
In the meantime  an unresolved US China trade dispute and a hard Brexit  events that hitherto have been treated as risks and not numerically incorporated in forecasts  are gradually shifting towards working assumptions  As late as in July the RB described global growth as relatively healthy  That view seems quite out of touch considering that leading foreign central banks already have or plan to hit the accelerator because of a global slow down 
As for the September meeting  we see it as very reasonable that the RB postpone the plan to hike around the turn of the year  Our long held view has been that they will continue to kick the can down the road and keep the policy rate unchanged at  0 25bp throughout 2020  Given ongoing global slowdown  political turmoil  policy actions by the ECB and Fed and clear signs of an economic slow down in Sweden  we think that probabilities have shifted as far as monetary policy is concerned 
In summary  Our updated Riksbank call is that the RB brings the policy rate back to  50bp  presumably in February  even though the timing could be affected  for instance  by how the Brexit story unfolds 
Go outright long in 2Y covered bonds
Given our call for a Riksbank cut  a rather clean way to play this is to go outright long in short dated covered bonds  as the 2Y covered bond segment trade is well correlated to the repo rate  Currently  the spread is trading in the low end of the historic range  but that is likely due to the market pricing in some 15bp of repo rate cuts from the Riksbank over the next 12 months  Given our forecast of a Riksbank cut of 25bp  we do think there should be potential for some 10 15bp more in the segment  We recommend to go outright long in the 2Y segment  buying NDH5532  May 2021  at  22bp with a P L target  37bp  10bp  Carry is  0 2bp over 3 months 





We have earlier recommended to be long shorter covered bonds against swaps and against government bonds  These recommendations are close to their profit targets  and we choose to close them down in favour of our recommendation above  We take a 5 5bp profit in the SWH189  Dec 2020  vs SGB1047  Dec 2020   which we close at 44bp  For the SHYP1585  Dec 2021  ASW we also think that the fixing  which currently looks to be on the high side  is an additional reason for profit taking  We close the position at  1bp  with a profit of 8bp 
Hunt for yield to support long end covered bonds
Swedish covered bond issuers have been front loading issuance volumes during 2019  where especially the months January to April saw a historically high monthly pace  Based on our estimate of c SEK415bn in issuance for the full year  which we have revised somewhat higher than before  the monthly pace of issuance should slow to about SEK25bn per month for the remaining months  This is on the low side compared with previous years for the period September to December  We expect this  in combination with about SEK40bn maturing in September  SHYP1582 and SCBC140   which will likely result in some reinvestment flows  to be supportive for covered bond spreads during the coming months 
A more important factor supportive for covered bonds is the ongoing hunt for yield  Despite volatility being high for the last couple of weeks  covered bonds have fared relatively well  We expect the hunt for yield to continue  especially in light of more central bank stimulus  which obviously will be supportive for covered bonds in general  Apart from the short end recommendation  where we base our reasoning on a Riksbank cut  we continue to prefer the longest benchmark covered bonds  The curve slope is almost perfectly linear  but we expect that investors will prefer a better yield pick up further out on the curve  We note that the share of SEK covered bonds trading with a positive yield has shrunk significantly during 2019 and we think that this is a quite important factor  especially for real money investors  We recommend being long SHYP1594  Sep 2028  vs SGB1060  May 2028  at 87bp with P L target 70bp 100bp  Carry Roll is 2 3bp over 3 months 











Steepen 2Y 5Y on the SEK swap curve
We have previously recommended a FRA DEC20 vs DEC21 steepener  An alternative trade on the swap curve that has historically been well correlated to this segment of the FRA curve is a 2Y 5Y SEK swap steepener  see chart below  We find it difficult to make a case why this segment of the swap curve would come to invert as it is difficult to see a sustained cutting cycle 





2Y 5Y swap curve steepness highly correlated with the 6th 10th FRA curve steepness
Moreover  the fact that there is room in a higher probability of a rate cut and possibly some downward pressure on fixings could support the SEK short end  which has underperformed substantially relative to EUR 





Also  we note that the risk premium in the 2Y 5Y SEK curve relative to EUR that has been present for a long time has practically disappeared  In our view  pricing on the 5Y point on the SEK curves appears stretched 
The risk premium in 2Y 5Y SEK relative to EUR has practically disappeared





We note that the 2Y 5Y slope of the swap curve tends to generally correlate nicely with the 1Y change in Swedish PMI  see chart below  On top of the observation we made above that it is difficult to see an extended rate cutting cycle  one can add that the current slope of the swap curve would be consistent with PMI close to 40  latest print  52 for July  
2Y 5Y swap curve slope not in line with move in PMI





Thus  we recommend a 2Y 5Y swap steepener as an alternative to a DEC20 vs DEC21 steepener on the FRA curve  We set the P L levels to 17bp  8bp 
Longer Swedish BEI levels continue to trade at very challenging levels
Long dated SEK real rates have underperformed somewhat from the record low levels relative to Germany seen earlier  This has benefitted our recommendation to sell SGBi3104  Dec 2028  vs DBRi2030  However  the correction in break even spreads has been smaller as nominal SGBs have also underperformed nominal German rates 





The 10Y BEI box vs Germany trades at a whopping 95 bps  As we  and the Riksbank  expect the yoy headline rate of inflation to come down substantially in the months ahead  we think that this pricing will be hard to sustain  We believe that a key reason why Swedish BEIs have remained so resilient is the fact the headline yoy inflation rate has been high 











Moreover  we note that the usual premium in survey based expectations relative to traded BEI spreads has more or less disappeared  In themselves  survey based expectations are on a clear downward trend that is likely to continue as expectations tend to be adaptive to the actual inflation rate 
Scarcity is obviously an issue in SEK linkers on the back of low supply and continued Riksbank QE  However  we note that this is not fully reflected in the repo market where linkers trade some 15 20 bps cheaper relative to nominal bonds 
Given the recent underperformance in Swedish real rates relative to German rates and the fact that the BEI box has been less affected  we close our recommendation to sell SGBi3104 vs DBRi2030 and instead open a recommendation to go for a tighter 10Y BEI spread in Sweden relative to Germany  i e  in practice adding the nominal legs   We set the P L levels to 65bp 110bp 
Bearish SEK call intact   EUR SEK is aiming for 11 00
We see no reason to abandon our long held strategically negative view on the SEK  Our arguments have been a softer domestic growth outlook  which is now accompanied with a global downturn that tends to weigh on pro cyclical currencies like the SEK  a deteriorating inflation picture  which would get even worse in the short term if the SEK started to appreciate as predicted by e g  the Riksbank  messy financial markets due to trade war and Brexit which foster flows into safe havens  and in particular  the pressure on the RB to postpone plans to raise rates  hence locking a large part of the Swedish yield curve in negative territory 
The fact that we now change our call to a 25bp rate cut  bolsters our view that EUR SEK is aiming for 11 00  We see no reason to raise revise our targets  10 80 in 3M  NYSE MMM  and 11 00 in 12M   not least since the market is already pricing in a decent chance for a rate cut  9bp 2019 and an additional 6bp in 2020  





If the RB next week  5 September  lowers its rate path indicating the next hike will come much later  without pencilling in cuts in the path   there should be a positive reaction in EUR SEK   a first dovish step rather than a promise never to cut rates  However  should the RB turn a deaf ear to what is happening around it  we could get a significant correction lower in EUR SEK  since the immediate interpretation would be that the RB is not matching the substantial package expected from the ECB on 12 September  In such a scenario  interesting opportunities to sell the SEK could emerge in the following weeks ",2019-08-30,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reading-the-swedish-markets-august-30-2019-200460174,200460174

194108,415624,MMM,FX Update  Fed Failed  USD Strength Set To Prove More Persistent,opinion,"NOK  The outlook for a stronger NOK suffered a clear blow last week  as the less committed easing message from the Fed s Jerome Powell has paved the way for more persistent USD strength  In our view  a strong USD and weak global cycle are likely to keep industrial metals and oil prices under pressure longer than we previously expected  This in turn constitutes an extended headwind for commodity FX and high beta currencies in general  including NOK  On the back of this  we lift our front end forecasts to 9 80 in 1M  from 9 60  and 9 65 in 3M   9 50   We still expect Norges Bank to add further carry attractiveness to the NOK by hiking rates in September  Indeed as long as growth remains above trend  the NOK is simply too weak for the central bank to reach its inflation target  see  FX Strategy   Why is the NOK so weak    28 May    However  global drivers remain the primary determinants and with the latest developments  we acknowledge reduced NOK potential in the medium to long term too  We forecast EUR NOK at 9 60 in 6M  9 50  and 9 50 in 12M  9 30  
EUR SEK  We stick to our bearish medium term view on the SEK based on a cyclical economic slowdown  domestically and abroad  and a subdued inflation outlook that we believe will re challenge the Riksbank  the upcoming wage round will  in our view  not make it any easier to achieve its target   Global uncertainties and the sudden re escalation of the trade war have weighed on the SEK recently and may continue to do for some time  However  next week s Swedish inflation data may prompt a small correction lower in EUR SEK as our forecast is above that of the Riksbank  We remain comfortable with an upward sloping medium term trajectory for EUR SEK and make only small adjustments to our forecast profile  we raise 1M to 10 70  previously 10 50   3M to 10 80  was 10 70   6M to 10 90  was 10 80  and 12M to 11 00  was 10 90  

EUR DKK  We see a case for Danmarks Nationalbank not fully tracking an ECB rate cut in September  This would reduce the negative carry on short EUR DKK positions and send EUR DKK lower  We forecast EUR DKK at 7 4630 in 1M  7 4575 in 3M  7 4550 in 6M and 7 4550 in 12M 
EUR USD  The lack of a forceful response from the Fed to a weakening economy and lacklustre inflation expectations was a blow to our view of a short term bounce in EUR USD  In our view  a shallow rate cut cycle from the Fed would keep EUR USD range bound in 3M  around 1 10  revised down from 1 15   in 6 12M  we still look for a higher EUR USD towards 1 13 in 6M  revised down from 1 17  and 1 15 in 12M  revised down from 1 17  on the erosion of USD carry  valuation  an improved outlook for the global economy and the odds of a trade deal 
EUR GBP  In the run up to the Brexit deadline at end October  we expect EUR GBP to remain volatile and maybe more so than we previously thought likely  Financial markets are taking Boris Johnson s direct approach literally and  in the run up to October  this could mean EUR GBP will drift higher  Ultimately  we believe EUR GBP could go as high as 0 97  previously  we were thinking 0 91   Our base case continues to be a much  much less dramatic outcome at the end of October  We expect EUR GBP to settle at 0 89 0 91 on the back of an extension and or snap election  In the case of a decent deal or cancellation of Brexit  we believe EUR GBP will turn towards 0 83 0 86  Although the outcome is anybody s guess  we believe it will improve after October 
USD CNY   Due to the recent escalation of the trade war  we have lifted our USD CNY forecast to 7 05 in 1M  6 95   7 10 in 3M  7 0  and 7 20 in 6M and 12M  We see a rising probability that the US and China will not reach a trade deal before the US election in November 2020 and that Donald Trump will raise tariffs further on imports from China worth USD300bn to 25  

NZD USD and AUD USD are set to be low  for longer  In New Zealand  leading indicators have shifted further down and now track annual GDP growth around 1 5   in contrast to RBNZ s projection of 2 5 3 0   Inflation prints have been slightly better but remain below target and the committee is likely to judge that downside risks to its inflation target remain in place given the global growth outlook  In Australia  housing market activity indicators are showing a tentative stabilisation but recent retail sales are showing consumption is weakening to a multi year low  Both central banks are actively easing monetary policy in light of these developments 
The recent slightly hawkish comments from the Fed and re escalation of the US China trade war put both economies at risk and currency markets have been extremely speedy in pricing towards new multi year lows  from what had previously been a positive outlook  Hence  since a month ago  the risk has shifted from upside to slight downside once again  We think the upcoming 1 6M outlook is worse than it appeared in June and July and we revise our expectations accordingly  while a more positive scenario in 12M puts a bottom in for the crosses  We revise AUD USD to 0 67 in 1M  previously 0 70   0 67 in 3M  previously 0 71   0 70 in 6M  previously 0 715  and 0 70 in 12M  previously 0 715   Correspondingly  we set NZD USD at 0 645 in 1M  previously 0 67   0 645 in 3M  previously 0 675  and 0 67  previously 0 68  in 6M and 12M  Nonetheless  these crosses are extremely sensitive to small changes in the perception of future Fed and trade policy and news on this front would materially and swiftly change spot pricing as well as the outlook  To see a rise to the highs of 2016 18  we would need to see a strong pickup in global activity  this remains very tentative though 
USD RUB  RUB continues to follow global risk sentiment  while the recent US sanctions did not have a significant impact on the Russian currency as Russia s local debt remains out of scope  In early August 2019  US President Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions on Russia  It was the second round of sanctions by the US administration  The US banned loans or other assistance to Russia by international financial institutions and prohibited most loans from American banks to Russia s government  We slightly increase our 1M forecast to 65 60  up from 65 40  and revise our forecast down for 3M to 66 00  6M to 67 00 and 12M to 68 00  down from 67 00  68 00 and 69 00 respectively  
EUR PLN  The ECB s softening stance and the renewed trade dispute between China and the US sent EUR PLN higher  We believe US China trade tensions are likely to continue into 2020  which  in our view  would send the pair higher  the PLN has been relatively immune to the risk off periods lately   As a result  we see a slight case for EUR PLN to edge higher on a short term basis to 4 32  previously 4 28  in 1M but then as the Fed delivers on the cutting side in September  we see the pair going down to 4 25 in 3M  4 23 in 6M and 4 23 in 12M 
USD TRY  The TRY is stabilising on a global turn to monetary easing  while quick monetary easing by the TCMB limits the TRY s attractiveness in carry trades  However  domestic risk is still there  Because of global monetary relief  we adjust our USD TRY outlook enhancing that the fragile domestic and geopolitical environment is still in place  Large FX debt redemptions by the Turkish private sector and more rate cuts later in 2019 are set to weigh on the TRY in 2019 and 2020  Thus  we remain bearish on the TRY in the long term  expecting the USD TRY to reach the following levels  5 60 in 1M  5 70 in 3M  5 90 in 6M and 6 00 in 12M  previously 5 70 in 1M  5 90 in 3M  5 90 in 6M and 6 20 in 12M  
Oil  We expect oil prices to recover over the rest of 2019  We forecast Brent will average USD70 bbl in Q3 and USD75 bbl in Q4  In our view  OPEC  cuts  a stabilisation of the global macro economy and eventually a weaker USD will underpin oil prices 
EUR NOK   Reduced Potential For Dtronger NOK
Growth  Back in June  the historically reliable Regional Network Survey indicated accelerating H2 mainland growth prospects of more than 3  y y  Meanwhile  the past month s data releases have been on the weak side of expectations  Manufacturing sector surveys now suggest somewhat weaker growth ahead  as the impact of a slowing global industrial cycle seems increasingly to counter the positive domestic impulses from petroleum industries and oil investments  In addition  the fall in unemployment has slowed but this is at least partially due to rising bottleneck problems  Overall  however  we still expect above trend growth in the year ahead driven by oil investments and consumption 

Monetary policy  As expected  Norges Bank hiked the key policy rate by 25bp to 1 25  at the June monetary policy meeting  Meanwhile  as importantly  it clearly signalled that it intends to hike rates again as soon as September  with an additional high likelihood of another rate hike in 2020  While domestic releases have recently been somewhat on the soft side of expectations  we still expect Norges Bank to firm its September signal at the forthcoming interim August meeting  In addition  our base case remains two additional rate hikes in 2020 
Flows  Foreign banks  proxy for speculative flows  have been net selling NOK over the past few weeks amid resurfacing trade war concerns and global risk off  Overall  we regard NOK positioning to be neutral 

Valuation  From a long term perspective  the NOK seems fundamentally undervalued  Our PPP model has 8 85 as  fair   A model incorporating relative productivity also suggests NOK potential after the year long period of internal devaluation and NOK weakness 

Risks  The biggest risk factors to our call are continued outperformance of the USD and a Fed not hiking rates while global growth remains weak  We could also be wrong in our above trend call on Norwegian growth  In addition  any a breakdown in US  China trade negotiations would be NOK negative 

Conclusion  The outlook for a stronger NOK suffered a clear blow last week as the less committed easing message from the Fed s Powell has paved the way for more persistent USD strength  In our view  a strong USD and a weak global cycle is likely to keep industrial metals and oil prices under pressure longer than we previously expected  This in turn constitutes an extended headwind for commodity FX and high beta currencies in general  including NOK  On the back of this  we lift our front end forecasts to 9 80 in 1M  from 9 60  and 9 65 in 3M  9 50  
We still expect Norges Bank to add further carry attractiveness to the NOK by hiking rates in September  Indeed  as long as growth remains above trend the NOK is simply too weak for the central bank to reach its inflation target  see FX Strategy   Why is the NOK so weak   28 May   However  global drivers remain the primary determinants and with the latest developments  we acknowledge reduced NOK potential in the medium to long term  We forecast EUR NOK at 9 60 in 6M  9 50  and 9 50 in 12M  9 30  
EUR SEK   Still On The Increase
Growth  The second quarter GDP figure was a blow to the Riksbank  though in line with our estimate at 1 4  y y   0 1  q q   It also fell short of market consensus and as such sent EUR SEK sharply higher  In our view  domestic demand is an increasing headwind to growth and the SEK  Unfortunately  the global economic slowdown on the back of an escalating trade war is of no help either 
Monetary policy  Despite soft messages and lingering cuts from the Fed and the ECB  the Riksbank stubbornly maintained its hiking bias in July  which in turn lent some support to the SEK  However  we think it is only a matter of time  September October  before the Riksbank decides to postpone the next hike well into next year in an environment where both the Fed and the ECB have started to ease  Moreover  the growth outlook is likely to disappoint the Riksbank along with inflation  and wages   Hence  we expect no hike this year and probably not next year either  which would leave the policy rate in negative territory for longer  In our view  this will continue to weigh on the SEK especially versus the USD 
Flows  The significant rate gap versus the US has held back commercial and investors  demand for the SEK and fuelled carry trades where SEK has been the funding currency  A more risk averse environment coupled with a smaller rate differential may lead to some unwinding of long USD SEK positions  That said  the USD still stands out as the most attractive carry currency in the G10 space  Valuation  Fundamental factors can to some extent explain the recent years  real  depreciation of the SEK  although we would argue that ultra easy monetary policy is the main culprit behind the weakening  see FX Strategy   Hardships for the SEK  13 May  

Risks  A pronounced risk off environment has the potential to send the SEK down the drain  beyond 11 00 versus the EUR and beyond 10 00 versus the USD   though partially balanced by the scaling back of carry positions 

Conclusion  We stick to our bearish medium term view on the SEK based on a cyclical economic slowdown  domestically and abroad  and a subdued inflation outlook that we expect to re challenge the Riksbank  in our view  the upcoming wage round will not make it any easier to achieve its target   Global uncertainties and the sudden re escalation of the trade war have weighed on the krona recently and may continue to do so for some time  However  next week s Swedish inflation data may prompt a small correction lower in EUR SEK as our forecast is above that of the Riksbank  We remain comfortable with an upward sloping medium term trajectory for EUR SEK and make only small adjustments to the forecast profile  we raise 1M to 10 70  10 50   3M to 10 80  10 70   6M to 10 90  10 80  and 12M to 11 00  10 90

Selected Market News 
The weakening of risk appetite continued yesterday and major US indices ended the day lower by 3 3 5   It is the biggest one day drop so far in 2019 and the VIX volatility index surged more than 20  to 24 6   the highest level since the December sell off last year  The market is increasingly pricing in that the trade war will have long term consequences  Yesterday  10Y US break evens fell to 1 60   the lowest since 2016  Basically the market is telling the Fed that it is behind the curve and that rate cuts will not be able to push up long term inflation meaningfully  The lower break even level and the risk off sentiment have pushed 10Y US treasury yields down by more than 12bp to 1 72   10Y US treasury yields have now dropped more than 30bp in three trading days 
The recent escalation in the trade war pushed USD CNY above the psychological level of 7 0 on Monday and market participants are increasingly discussing if China is using the currency in the trade war  Trump has little doubt about it when he tweets and overnight the US Treasury officially named China a currency manipulator  The move came outside the normal semi annual updates  The labelling is primarily symbolic given the new tariffs already in place  but the move is certainly yet another escalation of the trade war and markets reacted negatively to the move 
However  importantly  the People s Bank of China did not let the yuan weaken further overnight and USD CNY stabilised slightly above 7 this morning  China has been selling yuan denominated bills and the mid point for onshore trading was set a stronger level than expected this morning  The stronger yuan level has helped stabilise US equity futures 
Officially  the Chinese central bank says the weakening on Monday reflects market moves in light of the protectionist measures from the US  We argue that China will not pull the currency weapon as it could  1  backfire as capital outflow could accelerate   2  China wants to be a reliable economic power in the global economy and  3  China will see a significant setback in its intention of moving towards a market based currency  It does not mean that the CNY cannot weaken further  as we expect  In our view market flows point to a move towards 7 20 in 6M time  For more see this  research update

US government bonds continue to decline and 10Y yields are now back to the level before Trump was elected president in 2016 on the back of the escalation of the trade war between US and China  Today  the US Treasury is selling some USD38bn of 3Y bonds and given the expectations for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve  we expect to see solid demand 
When we look at the European government bond market it is a more mixed picture  with the core EU curves steepening from the short end  while the periphery curves flattened from the long end  Italy is underperforming the core and the other peripheral markets on the back of the political noise from Italy  but this is expected to be short lived 
In the Danish mortgage bond market the prepayments for the October term were a recordhigh DKK185bn  Despite the significant prepayment wave  the low coupon 30Y Danish mortgages are doing fine and the market has limited issues with absorbing the solid amount of 1  30Y callables  but pressure is on the high coupon bonds such as the 2  callables  The big reinvestment need is supporting the 1  30Y callables and the opening of a 0 5  30Y callable mortgage bond is putting pressure on the high coupon callable  However  with the 1  30yr callables closed for issuance  the issuance will move to the 1  30Y IO callables  while we wait for the 30Y 0 5  to increase in price 
FX MarketsPoor risk sentiment amid an escalating trade war and poor macro data  read second quarter GDP  have weighed heavily on the SEK recently  with EUR SEK up 2 5  since the 25 July trough at 10 49  Next technical resistance is seen at 10 80 and 10 85  both local highs from May   At the same time RSI has reached stretched levels  which may suggest a pause  Next week s CPI data may be a positive  albeit temporary  relief for the krona as our forecast is above the Riksbank s  Today s production data are very volatile on a monthly basis and should thus be taken with a grain of salt  but may nonetheless have some market impact  More generally  we stick to our bullish medium term view on EUR SEK 

We have revised lower our EUR USD forecast to 1 10 in 1M and 3M  and 1 13 in 6M and 1 15 in 12M as we have become less convinced that the Fed will get ahead of the curve in the short term in terms of easing monetary policy and weakening the USD  Furthermore  we expect further JPY strength and now forecast USD JPY to fall to 105 in 3M   see more in FX Forecast Update  5 August 2019  In addition  note that we now forecast a move in USD CNY to 7 20 in 6M and 12M  However  we do not expect China to turn to devaluation as a weapon in the trade war  see FX Strategy USD CNY breaks 7 but devaluation is not on the cards  5 August 2019

194111,415627,MMM,Italian Government Close To An End  Salvini Calling For Vote Of Confidence,opinion,"Market movers today In terms of economic data releases  it is another quiet day today  In the UK  the monthly GPD indicator for June  and hence the full estimate of Q2 GDP  is released at 10 30 CEST  which is expected to show that GDP growth has slowed in Q2 compared to Q1  as the original Brexit stockpiling effect is no longer artificially boosting GDP growth 
In the Scandies  we have a couple of interesting releases  In Sweden  we could see a rebound in the household consumption indicator for June  given the fact that retail sales rebounded sharply  In Norway  we expect a further slowdown in core inflation to 2 2  in July  For more see overleaf 
Selected market news The coherence of the governing Italian coalition of League Five Star went from bad to worse yesterday evening  as Salvini followed up on recent days  comments and called for a parliamentary vote of confidence  which  if resulting in Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte losing the ballot  could lead to swift elections to be held already in October  Based on opinion polls  Salvini and the League would be set for almost 40  of the popular vote  whereas the Five Star movement has plummeted in polls to just above 15  down from 32  at the general elections in March 2018  However  Salvini cannot himself summon the parliament  which is currently in recess  and even if Conte loses the ballot  it will be the president deciding whether new general elections will be held  or instead trying to arrange for an alternative governing coalition  Salvini s comments put BTPs under pressure already yesterday and we expect more of the same today  even though the Salvini announcement actually removes uncertainty from the market 
Japanese GDP figures covering Q2 showed that the economy grew at an annualised rate of 1 8  compared to Bloomberg consensus of just 0 5   Q1 growth figures were also revised up to 2 8  from 2 2   Net exports fell for a seventh straight month  as private consumption and investments have kept the economy on course this year  However  the outlook for private spending is gloomy due to a sales tax hike taking effect from October  and given that no solution seems in sight regarding the trade war  see  US China Trade  Three trade war scenarios    no deal  now our baseline    GDP forecasts for 2019 are at just 0 7

Scandi markets
In Norway  core inflation has slowed for the past three months due to base effects  but it was still above the 2  target at 2 4  y y in June  As food prices pushed up core inflation more than usual in July last year  we expect a further slowdown to 2 2  in July  That would be somewhat lower than estimated by Norges Bank in June  2 4   
In Sweden today we could see a rebound in the household consumption indicator for June  given the fact that retail sales bounced sharply  there is a fairly strong  although not perfect  y y correlation between the two   This figure feeds into the Q2 GDP estimates  where   somewhat surprisingly   household consumption was the only factor that added positively to growth q q in the preliminary release 
Fixed income markets
Bunds came under temporary pressure and the German curve steepened 10 30y  as Reuters broke a story that the German government is ready to make a fiscal U turn and break the budget rule and spend money on climate measures  However  the German Finance Ministry rejected the story later in the day and we also note that the German mainstream media did not mention anything in the evening news  Bottom line is that significant fiscal easing in Germany is probably not imminent  However  the news gave us some important insight into market sentiment  The sudden move higher in yields and steepening of the curve indicate that the market is now sensitive to  yields up  news and that Bund positioning might be stretched  10y Bunds ended the day a modest 2bp higher at  0 56  
Italy is up for review by Fitch tonight  BBB negative   Given the political and economic outlook  the risk of a downgrade is not trivial  However  given the significant drop in Italian funding costs  we stick to the view that rating and outlook will be kept unchanged once again

FX markets
A sudden headline suggesting that Germany could be contemplating fiscal easing briefly shook FX markets yesterday  EUR shot higher across the board on the back of a move higher in German yields  but the market quickly reversed the move as the story lacked firm details  Nevertheless  the story is out there and will be one to watch over the coming weeks 
In general  FX markets are stabilising after negative risk sentiment has set the tone since last week s FOMC meeting notably with a stronger JPY and weaker Scandies  While it is difficult to see what could trigger a rebound in the short term  it would likely take more bad news  e g  further escalation of trade tensions and or deterioration in global macro data to extend risk off trades further 
More specifically  EUR NOK close to 10 00 level continues to attract attention  While it is an extreme high level from a historical perspective  it is not necessarily a high level measured against the current global headwinds  Hence  the oil price measured in NOK terms is now at the lowest level since the beginning of the year  down 10  the past week and 20  since the peak in April  i e  the NOK might have weakened significantly  but not enough to keep pace with oil falling into bear market

194112,415628,MMM,Yield Outlook  Rates And Yields Yet To Bottom,opinion,"The past few weeks in the financial markets have been quite hectic  with yields dipping even deeper amid equity market sell offs  The benchmark 10Y Bund yield is now running close to  0 6  and the German bond curve is trading in sub zero territory across the board  Germany can now borrow funds for a 30 year term at negative rates 
We see further room for lower yields and now expect the benchmark Bund yield to fall to  0 70  within the next three months on a combination of a weakening economic cycle  low risk appetite due to the trade war  the ECB easing policy and investors struggling to avoid negative rates  We expect the 10Y US Treasury yield to fall to 1 40  from currently 1 60  
While we have become accustomed to low and falling  fluctuating  volatility in fixed income markets in recent years  the large uncertainty about the economy  risk appetite and monetary policy indicates we could see even bigger fluctuations for the remainder of 2019  10Y Bund yields could be trading in a range of minus 0 8  to minus 0 2  on a 6M horizon 
Note also that the fall in yields has caused the yield curve to flatten significantly  The 2Y 10Y EUR swap curve has flattened by more than 20bp over the past month and the long end  10Y 30Y curve  by more than 10bp to around 0 45   Yield curves typically flatten when the markets expect the economy to weaken going forward  not least  if markets are not confident that central banks will be able to put the economy back on a growth track or stoke inflation via rate cuts 
Several reasons for fall in long yields and curve flattening
First  central banks are once again easing their monetary policies  At its July policy meeting  the ECB hinted that a stimuli package might be announced at the September meeting  We expect the ECB will  cut rates by 20bp to minus 0 60   restart its QE programme  deliver stronger forward guidance  promising to keep rates low or lower for an extended period of time   and introduce a tiered deposit system  The latter measure would be intended to alleviate the problem banks face when having to place large amounts of surplus liquid funds at minus 0 60  while not being able to charge negative rates on retail customers  deposit accounts  We would anticipate the ECB being more aggressive than the market expects 
The US Federal Reserve has already announced a rate cut  and while Governor Powell was very cautious about promising a series of rate cuts  the market is currently pricing for at least three rate cuts over the next 12 months  We expect that initially the Fed will announce rate cuts in September and December  Weakened key indicators  such as lower inflation forecasts and  not least  the trade war will be decisive factors 
Second  the hunt for positive yield is set to intensify by the day  For several years  we have been talking about investors turning to longer maturities or to lower grade credit in return for more interest  In fact  the growing proportion of European bonds with a negative coupon has accelerated this flow of funds in recent months  The main objective now  however  is not to get a higher rate of interest but rather to pursue a best case scenario of avoiding negative interest or in the worst case to minimise the effect of negative interest  We expect the anticipated resumption of ECB asset purchases to merely reinforce this trend 





Third  risk appetite is low due to the trade war  One of the reasons the ECB and the Fed are again talking about easing policy is the concern that the US China trade war will have economic repercussions  The latest tweets from President Trump that tariffs on Chinese goods will be raised and that China is manipulating its currency have escalated the situation and increased the pressure on global equities  forcing investors to turn to safe haven bonds  Fears of a hard Brexit are having a similar effect 
Fourth  the global economy is under pressure and inflation forecasts are low  In particular  manufacturing companies are reporting slower order intakes and declining output  There is a real possibility that the German economy contracted in the second quarter  as industrial output fell by 5 2  y y in June  In addition  the market is losing faith that the ECB and the Fed are able to ignite inflation  Long term inflation forecasts from both the market and forecasters are trending downwards 
Low yields for a very long time
On 13 June  we published the research note Global Research  Euro area rates to stay very low for very long  In this report  we looked at the factors that have driven the neutral real rate of interest lower in Europe and discussed the consequences for long nominal interest rates  We concluded that current yields are not particularly low  and as we have previously argued elsewhere  the market is unlikely to speculate in rate hikes from the ECB for the next three or four years 
With low inflation expectations and a negative neutral real interest rate  current short and long yields are  in reality  not particularly low  In other words  there is no longer a gravitational or normalising force that would tend to pull yields higher over time 
This does not mean that yields cannot rise again  For example  an improving economy would point to higher yields through higher inflation expectations if risk appetite improves or if the US and China succeed in putting an end to the trade war 
However  there is no longer a trend inevitably pulling yields higher over time  and right now the economic cycle  in fact  points to lower yields rather than higher yields  Also  we are increasingly concerned that the trade war could dominate for a long time to come and that the US and China will not reach a solution   not even a truce 
Further room for lower yields
On balance  we expect 10Y Bund and Treasury yields to fall further to minus 0 70  and 1 40   respectively  in coming months  with risks on the downside  Risk appetite is set to be the primary determinant of yield levels on a 12M horizon  Risk appetite is currently low due to the trade conflict  and while we expect it to improve slightly over the next 12 months  yields are not likely to increase significantly and we definitely do not expect a change to an upward sloping trend in yields  After all  one swallow does not make a summer  We expect to publish the next issue of Yield Outlook in September 
Forecasts






Eurozone forecasts
The eurozone economy currently looks weak with Germany especially under pressure  and it is likely that the German economy contracted in Q1  Concerns about a trade war are weighing on confidence in the manufacturing sector 
We expect the ECB to deliver a big package at the September meeting  comprised of a rate cut of 20bp  a new QE programme  stronger forward guidance and a tiered rate system to shield banks from the negative rates  10Y bund yields are set to trade even more into negative over the next three months  We see yields marginally higher on a 12M horizon 


















US forecasts
After the Fed cut its target range in July  we still expect two more cuts before New Year  in September and December   Weaker economic data  subdued inflation and trade uncertainty mean the benefits of easing are greater than the costs  The Fed did not promise to cut more  and is more ad hoc or data dependent in its reaction function than previously  See our FOMC review research paper from August 1 
We expect the Fed s cuts and a continuing shaky risk appetite to push US treasury yields a new leg lower and we have lowered our 3M  NYSE MMM  target to 1 40  


















UK forecasts
We expect the Bank of England to stay on hold due to a combination of high uncertainty over Brexit  weaker economic data  both in the UK and globally  and because other major central banks are easing 
Long gilt yields are likely to track German yields closely 


















Denmark forecasts
We expect the Danmarks Nationalbank to lower its policy rate by  only  10bp to  0 75  in September  hence 10bp less than the ECB  which we expect to slash rates by 20bp  The slightly weak DKK is the main reason 
We forecast a new drop in 10Y yields  It should trigger a new wave of refinancing in the autumn and the average duration in the mortgage bond market could drop as it did in Q2  which then triggered demand for DKK government bonds and helped tighten the spread vs Germany 


















Sweden forecasts
Business confidence indicators have deteriorated  especially in manufacturing  GDP for Q2 dropped by 0 1 percent q q with weakness seen in net exports and private investment  Employment has declined for two consecutive quarters  In the meantime  inflation has held up close to two percent  reflecting higher energy prices and in some cases the lagged effects of the SEK weakness  We expect inflation to drop back below 2 percent during the fall 
With the Fed and the ECB in reverse and the domestic cool off  we do not see a case for another rate hike over the next 12 months  The market  Riba  is pricing in 7bp of cut before the year end  but currently we do not see a convincing case for a rate cut either 


















Norway forecasts
The Norwegian economy continues to grow above potential driven by higher oil  construction and public investment  Core inflation was down slightly in June  but at 2 3  it is still running above the 2  target  A weak NOK and higher wage growth continue to feed through 
We expect another rate hike from Norges Bank in 2019  September   At its June meeting  Norges Bank signalled a September rate hike  as the global slowdown had failed to dampen domestic growth sufficiently and the exchange rate was weaker than expected despite higher rate differentials ",2019-08-09,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/yield-outlook-rates-and-yields-yet-to-bottom-200453511,200453511

U S  leader in helmets and body armour
Avon is buying the assets of 3M s ballistic protection business including the Ceradyne brand helmets and body armour activity  The acquisition is in line with one of the group s strategic goals of creating value through targeted acquisitions to complement the existing product portfolio and add growth opportunities  It has strong positions with the U S  Department of Defense  DOD  supported by excellent R D capabilities  It has just started fielding the low rate initial production  LRIP  volumes of helmets and body armour for the US DOD Soldier Protection System  SPS  programme  which should provide growth as it moves into full production  Of its  85 4m of revenues in 2018  93  are for U S  customers  so Avon Protection sees further potential from leveraging its international sales network 
Compelling financial case
Subject to approvals the deal should complete in Avon s Q220  The business generates EBIT margins of around 10  currently  Avon management believes it can generate  5m of annual cost synergies by FY21 for an upfront cost of  10m  which should leave ROIC in double digits and well ahead of WACC  creating shareholder value  The initial consideration is being funded from cash resources and an increased three year revolving credit facility  RCF  of  85m  Group net debt to EBITDA is expected to not exceed 1 0x 
Valuation  Significant EPS enhancement expected
We maintain our estimates at present  in line with the trading comment  as we do not incorporate acquisitions into our estimates until a deal completes  However  we would expect an enhancement to earnings in the region of 20  in a full year post cost synergies  As the acquisition and business case is executed  we would expect Avon s valuation to respond accordingly 
Business description
Avon Rubber designs  develops and manufactures products in the protection  70  of 2018 sales  and dairy  30   sectors  Its major contracts are with national security organisations such as the US DOD  Over 70  of 2018 sales were from the US

Ballistic Helmets   lightweight and customisable for military and law enforcement customers
Body Armour Plates   with both ceramic and composite solutions
Flat Armour   helicopter and rotary wing protections systems for side and seat protection






The company supplies the Advanced Combat Helmet  ACH  and Enhanced Combat Helmet  ECH  for the US Armed Forces  Its excellent product development has provided the next generation Integrated Head Protection System  IHPS  for the SPS programme  which has just commenced the sole sourced LRIP  The contracts for full rate production  FRP  are expected to be awarded by 2021  the transition to which should organically grow revenues 
In body armour  the business is the sole source LRIP supplier of Vital Torso Protection  VTP  body armour under the SPS programme  Together with two other suppliers  an FRP contract worth a combined maximum of  704m over four years has been awarded  Deliveries are expected to commence in late 2020  further boosting organic growth in both 2020 and 2021 
Opportunity to generate both cost and revenue synergies
Management believes there are  5m of costs to be extracted as the back office and central head office operations of the new business are transitioned to and integrated with Avon s systems  The company is expecting one off costs of  10m to achieve these benefits by FY21 
In its business case value creation is not contingent on sales synergies  but there is clear potential for these to be achieved as well  At present most of the US sales go to the DOD  around 90  of the total  meaning only around 3  of sales go to law enforcement agencies  Avon Protection clearly believes it has the potential to extend penetration of the law enforcement and other domestic US markets  In addition  only 7  of sales went to overseas markets  and with Avon Protection s international sales network there is clearly potential for that to increase subject to any export licence restrictions 
The transformational increase in scale of Avon Protection should also further enhance its overall reputation and brand around the globe  hopefully providing additional leads in both domestic and export markets 
Financial metrics appear compelling
Avon is paying an initial  91m subject to normal closing adjustments  for gross assets of  45 2m that generated FY18 revenues of  85 4m  EBITDA of  10 8m and PBT of  3 3m  Subject to the award of pending tenders for legacy products  a maximum of a further  25m would become payable  but we expect any awards to enhance the business case  The deal is subject to CFIUS and other U S  regulatory approvals  but given the complementary nature of the product ranges and Avon s existing U S  presence  we do not see these as potential obstacles to completion  which is expected in fiscal Q220 
Avon has substantial cash resource and has renewed and increased its three year RCF to  85m  These resources will be used to pay for the deal  adding around  1 0 1 5m per year of interest  peaking in the year of acquisition  The deal is immediately EPS enhancing and adding  5m of cost savings will make it value creating in FY21  further enhanced by organic development from the SPS programme 





Management expects the activity to have cash conversion consistent with the existing business  which is itself highly cash generative  Net debt to EBITDA is expected to be below 1 0x when the deal completes and  assuming all goes to plan  management expects to be in a net cash position by the end of FY21 ",2019-08-09,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/avon-rubber-purchase-of-3ms-ballistic-protection-business-200453524,200453524
194114,415630,MMM,Danske Daily   Political Uncertainty,opinion,"Market movers today In the euro area  the main focus is on the German Zew  We expect the Zew to decline further and hence continue to point to a gloomy outlook in the uncertain global environment and the escalation of trade war In the UK  the labour market report for June is due out  The growth rates in wages and employment have been fairly high despite rather weak economic momentum  The question is whether this can continue or the labour market will start to show signs of moderation In the US  CPI core is being released  We expect it rose  0 2  m m in July  which translates into an unchanged annual inflation rate at 2 1  y y Overnight in China we get a batch of releases including industrial production  retail sales and fixed asset investments  In line with consensus  we expect the data still to paint a soft picture of the Chinese economy  but not a hard landing  Retail sales growth moved sharply higher but we expect it to have fallen back to around 8 8   in July Selected market news 
Political uncertainty in Europe  Asia and Latin America clouded financial markets yesterday and overnight  Negative risk sentiment is prevailing  with equity markets in the US and Asia down over 1   bond yields trading close to record low levels and the yen continuing to appreciate 
The Argentinian market made headlines yesterday as its asset prices and currency collapsed following President Mauricio Macri s defeat in the weekend s primary elections  Even though the market has corrected some  the Argentinian peso is still down some 16  compared to Friday s close  while its stock market lost close to 40  of its value yesterday 
In Italy  the Senate has yet to agree on the date for a no confidence vote on Prime Minister Conte s government  The latest reports suggest that a decision is likely to be made tonight and that the vote could take place on Tuesday next week  The Italian CDS has risen closer to the high level seen last May  but is still trading at some distance from the levels seen last year 
At a regular press conference overnight  Hong Kong s Chief Executive Carrie Lam  when faced with questions about the recent development in protests and demonstrations  said   It would take a very long time to restore Hong Kong   She further urged everyone to set aside prejudice  In the Chinese state media  speculation has begun about whether China would intervene if the situation in Hong Kong does not improve 
Fixed income markets
Risk appetite remains under pressure as markets focus not only on the ongoing trade war  but also developments in Italy  Hong Kong and the looming problems in Argentina  where the CDS is spiking after the primary elections showed low support for market friendly Prime Minister Macri  10Y US treasury yields dropped as low as 1 64  and 30Y yields dropped to 2 12    a year low and close to the all time low of 2 08   We can expect 10Y Germany to break firmly below  0 60  today 
That said  BTPs saw some support yesterday after Fitch confirmed the rating on Friday and as the higher yields  especially in the short end of the curve  attracted investors  We like the 1Y BOTs  which are still trading above zero

If Norges Bank comes out slightly on the hawkish side compared with market pricing on Thursday  we could see some temporary support for the NOK  However  the market would be likely to fade such a move  as Norwegian economic fundamentals and monetary policy matter less in the current weak global risk environment  Until we see further clarity on the outlook for the global economy  trade war  etc  we prefer to stay on the sidelines in EUR NOK  See more in Norges Bank Preview Global turmoil calls for vaguer rhetoric 
Due to a previously overlooked measurement technicality  we have decided to revise our inflation forecast downwards  We now see CPIF at 1 5   previously 1 6    Our new lower call limits the potential downside in EUR SEK  as we are now only slightly above consensus at 1 4   albeit we could still see the SEK strengthening somewhat should we get it right 
In the majors  on a news less Monday  USD JPY reached new lows yesterday close to the 105 00 level  Even though the past couple of days have been relatively uneventful for the majors  the market still seems to have a bias for adding to  risk off  trades  This sentiment in FX markets is also visible in the latest IMM positioning data  which shows that the market has added speculative long JPY positions  Note further that pressure is increasing on the Bank of Japan to respond to the recent slide in 10Y yields below the lower bound of its target range of minus 0 20   We are close to our 3M  NYSE MMM  and 6M forecast for USD JPY of 105  but stress that there is room for an undershooting of these levels if risk sentiment deteriorates further  e g  on the back of weaker data or a further escalation of the trade war 
The Argentinian peso tumbled yesterday following the severe loss by the market friendly president Mauricio Macri to the leftish opposition candidate Alberto Fernandez in the primary elections on Sunday  which comes ahead of the presidential elections in October 
The USD ARS increased by 16  as investors fear the commitment of Mr Fernandez to the ongoing IMF programme would be significantly weaker  raising the prospect of a default on Argentinian debt if he becomes president in October  Near term  the central bank is likely to step in and support the ARS  Mr Fernandez has stressed that he supports the broad parameters of the IMF programme  but uncertainty has increased  which will keep the pressure on the ARS

194115,415631,MMM,The Fed To Cut More Despite Strong Retail Sales,opinion,"Market movers today This morning we have updated our Fed view and now expect the Fed to cut by 25bp at each of the next five meetings taking the target range to 0 75 1 00  at the March meeting   We do not anticipate the Fed will pre commit to more easing but that it will stick to its current ad hoc approach  If the Fed really wants to reflate the economy and markets  it may need to commit more to easing and or cut more and faster eventually  For more details including the impact on FX and Fixed Income please see the full analysis here   FOMC research   New Fed call  Five more from Fed   16 August We have a very light data calendar today in terms of economic data releases  Hence focus will be on central bank signals and political signals  not least after ECB s Oli Rehn s comments yesterday  see below  In the US   University of Michigan s survey of consumer confidence will be in focus in particular after yesterday s strong retail sales number  The US consumer is one of the key forces holding up US growth amid weak investment growth Selected market news Yesterday  ECB GC member Olli Rehn was interviewed to the WSJ  paywall  that the ECB was preparing a  very strong package    He further said that  it s often better to overshoot than undershoot    Rehn is among the most dovish ECB members  and his recent proposals called for a revisit of the inflation mandate back in March this year  We find the interview very interesting  however  at current the juncture  we do see a risk of ECB not being able to over deliver compared to the very dovish market pricing  expectations   Markets are currently pricing 18bp cut for the September meeting  2bp lower than prior to the story   We expect ECB to announce a 20bp depo rate cut  alongside 12months of 45 60bn month QE  tiering system and extension of forward guidance at the 12 September ECB meeting   see  ECB Research   New ECB call  rate cut and restart of QE   18 June 
US data yesterday were strong  not least US retail sales  control group  which rose 1 0  in July suggesting private consumption remains a strong growth driver in Q3  We also believe the fundamentals for continued private consumption growth are strong with e g  high consumer confidence and solid real wage growth  Both the Philly Fed and Empire PMI manufacturing indices signal a rebound in ISM manufacturing in August  It may seem odd that the Fed is easing while economic data is strong but the Fed will be concerned whether data will continue to stay strong without further easing  see bullet 1 above  
Yesterday  Norges Bank kept rates unchanged as expected and repeated the tightening bias from June  That said  global turmoil has increased uncertainty about rates going forward  We keep our call for a slightly above 50  probability of a September hike  In our view  NOK will continue to trade on global risk sentiment  For more details please see  Norges Bank Review  Keeping the tightening bias  but increasing downside risk    15 August 
Scandi markets
A quiet day without any important data releases  For our take on yesterday s Norges Bank meeting  please see Norges Bank Review  Keeping the tightening bias  but increasing downside risk 
Fixed income markets
The dovish comments from ECB s Rehn boosted the peripheral markets  where the curves continued to bull flatten and sent Bund and Buxl spread into a free fall despite the risk that a new QE programme may buy a lot German government bonds  We doubt that the ECB will deviate too much from the capital key if they reintroduce QE programme 
There are no major news or key economic releases on the agenda today  and we do expect to see some stabilisation in the spread between core EU and the periphery  Hence  we expect a quiet session today  However  the downward pressure on spreads is expected to continue as investors  ignore  e g  political uncertainty in Italy 
The large decline in bond yields and swap rates have a significant effect on the Danish mortgage bond market  where 1  30Y callables are closed for issuance and the new benchmark is 0 5  30Y callables  If yields stay low  it would trigger a solid rise in the prepayments of the 2  30Y callables  Given the lack of alternatives with positive yield we believe that there will be a strong demand for 0 5  30Y callables 
We have changed our Fed call and now expect five more Fed cuts  The big question is whether the Fed is capable of re steepening the curve 2s10s after it inverted Wednesday 
Normally  the US curve steepens as the Fed starts to ease monetary policy  as it creates optimism and pushes inflation expectations higher  However  we are in doubt whether this will be the case to the same degree this time  though we do forecast a positive yield curve 2s10s on a 6  and 12 month horizon  We have decided to lower our 10Y Treasury yield forecast to 1 30   3M  NYSE MMM    1 00   6M  and 1 20   12M   For more see FOMC research   New Fed call  Five more from Fed  16 August

Yesterday  despite recent global woes  Norges Bank signalled another policy rate hike this year even if the central bank did acknowledge the rising global risks  In the end  the message came across largely as expected and did not really move EUR NOK  We stick to our view that a September hike is the more likely outcome as a hike will likely be warranted by still healthy domestic conditions  However  EUR NOK should stay supported around the current level close to 10 short term by continued negative global economic and risk sentiment  EUR SEK was volatile around the Norway announcement but is back in the 10 70 area 
In majors  the stronger than expected US retail sales failed to provide relief to risk sentiment  and USD JPY is still trading with a heavy tone as global bond yields are making new lows and commodity prices remain under pressure  another test of 105 should be on the cards  Yesterday  dovish comments from ECB s Rehn regarding September s easing move took EUR USD lower towards 1 11 after the pair had otherwise been surprisingly steady this week  A move to 1 10 is likely for EUR USD short term  On a 6 12M horizon we do stress  however  that EUR USD is likely to edge higher yet again as we are likely to see a Fed that moves more aggressively on easing than its recent hesitant approach points to  cf  our new Fed call  FOMC research   New Fed call  Five more from Fed

194116,415632,MMM,CSL Or MMM  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Diversified Operations stocks have likely encountered both Carlisle  CSL  and 3M  MMM   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Carlisle has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while 3M has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CSL likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than MMM has recently  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
CSL currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 35  while MMM has a forward P E of 17 40  We also note that CSL has a PEG ratio of 1 16  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  MMM currently has a PEG ratio of 1 83 
Another notable valuation metric for CSL is its P B ratio of 3 09  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  MMM has a P B of 9 16 
These metrics  and several others  help CSL earn a Value grade of B  while MMM has been given a Value grade of C 
CSL is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that CSL is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-08-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/csl-or-mmm-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200456302,200456302
194122,415638,MMM,DeChambeau shoots career best 62 to grab lead in Minnesota,news," Reuters    Bryson DeChambeau fired a PGA Tour career best round of nine under par 62 on Friday to take a two stroke lead into the weekend at the inaugural 3M  NYSE MMM  Open 
The 25 year old American bagged nine birdies to vault up the leaderboard and was 14 under after 36 bogey free holes at the TPC Twin Cities course in Minnesota 
 Whenever I can roll in a couple putts in from 20 feet or more  that gives you a lot of confidence with the game   the world number eight said after his 62 tied the course record 
 And then when you re striking it well and driving it where you re looking  that s very positive  You kind of get into a rhythm  into a zone  and it feels good  
Canada s Adam Hadwin came through back to back bogeys early in his round with a strong showing on the back nine to add a 66 to the 64 he shot in the first round 
The 31 year old is 12 under for the tournament  two back of DeChambeau and in sole possession of second place 
Americans Scott Piercy  Sam Saunders  Brian Harman and Sam Burns were tied for third at 10 under 
DeChambeau  who is playing the course for the first time  said that going into the tournament he thought his current score would be good enough to walk away as a winner 
 When I got onto the course I thought 15 or 14 would be the number for the week but I ve got to re evaluate that now   said the former U S  Amateur champion  who is hunting for his sixth career PGA Tour title 
The shot of the day belonged to Charles Howell III  whose approach from 80 yards at the par four seventh sailed over the flag before rolling back into the hole for his second eagle in a round of 66 
Howell  who was grouped with DeChambeau and Keegan Bradley  finished the day in a tie for 11th at eight under

194123,415639,MMM,Golf  Young gun Wolff s 62 gives him share of lead in Minnesota,news," Reuters    Matthew Wolff shot the best round of his young career on the PGA Tour on Saturday  firing a nine under par 62 to move into a share of the lead with Collin Morikawa and Bryson DeChambeau at the inaugural 3M  NYSE MMM  Open 
The 20 year old Wolff mixed 10 birdies with a bogey in just his fourth start on the PGA Tour to sit atop the leaderboard alongside his compatriots at 15 under after three rounds at the TPC Twin Cities course in Minnesota 
Wolff  who won this year s U S  college championship  said playing freely was the key to his success so far at the tournament 
 The last couple weeks I felt like I was being a little too strategic   he said after tying the course record also matched by DeChambeau in the second round 
 In college I just kind of let it rip so when I came out here I told my caddie that s what we re going to do this week   he said 
 We re just going to send it and it has been working out  
Wolff was on 59 watch after sinking his seventh birdie of the day on the par four 10th but failed to convert a makeable birdie putt at 16 and followed that up with a bogey on 17 to put the milestone out of reach 
Fellow Californian young gun Morikawa fired a seven under 64 in his sixth start on Tour and has shown poise beyond his 22 years through three solid rounds 
 My game throughout my entire life of playing golf has been staying really steady and sticking to my game plan   he said 
 I have a smooth tempo  If I can stay like that tomorrow it should be pretty exciting  
Overnight leader DeChambeau cooled off after Friday s 62  making just two birdies and his first bogey of the tournament on 13 for a round of one under 
DeChambeau s birdie at the 18th hole moved him into a share of the lead and give the five time PGA Tour event winner some momentum heading into the final round after an otherwise lacklustre performance

ECB
The ECB is ready to deliver rate cuts and launch QE2 and all options appear on the table for the September meeting  The initial reaction saw the euro spike higher on the dovish hold  but that did not last as the groundwork was put in place for a strong dovish signal for the upcoming meetings  The ECB decision went as expected  though some traders were disappointed they didn t cut today  The tweaks to forward guidance that rates could go lower and the formation of committees to look at all the tool box options  including tiering  increasing its size  and widen composition of new asset purchases  The Draghi press conference is expected to be dovish  as we could see this be his last memorable presser  Draghi looks like he will continue on with his mantra from seven years ago that he will do whatever it takes to save the eurozone 

Oil
Oil prices are still benefiting from yesterday s bullish EIA report  practically matching the API report we saw on Tuesday  The strong draw of nearly 11 million barrels mostly came from the Gulf of Mexico  which was dealing with the aftermath of Tropical Storm Barry  US production saw its biggest drop since October 2017  but it is expected to rebound strongly next week 
The demand part of the energy equation got another negative headlines as Germany s business climate fell to the lowest level since February 2010  Further global economic data weakness may have limited effects on crude demand as the next round of easing from the ECB  along with the Fed s shift to an easing cycle  will help the bolster the economy 

Gold
The ECB s signal for fresh stimulus along with growing expectations the Fed is about to unleash a series of rate cuts is going to provide gold with solid demand for the rest of the year  Even if we see stocks continue to the climb into uncharted territory  the yellow metal seems ready to shine brighter 

Bitcoin

194134,415650,MMM,Analysts Estimate 3M  MMM  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"3M  MMM  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Post it notes  industrial coatings and ceramics is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 04 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  21 2  
Revenues are expected to be  8 02 billion  down 4 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 91  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for 3M 
For 3M  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that 3M will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that 3M would post earnings of  2 50 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 23  delivering a surprise of  10 80  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
3M doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-3m-mmm-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200441407,200441407
194135,415651,MMM,FOMC Preview  Starting By Cutting 25bp ,opinion,"25bp or 50bp 
When the Federal Reserve meets next week  the question is more about the size of the rate cut and not about whether to cut at all  at least if one looks at market pricing  We remain in the camp expecting the Fed to cut its target range by 25bp on Wednesday  While investors got very excited on Friday by NY Fed Chair John Williams  NYSE WMB   seemingly dovish comments and at some point priced in a higher probability of a 50bp cut than a 25bp cut  it was very striking to us that a NY Fed spokesperson rejected the idea that Williams  comments were about what the Fed will should do at the upcoming meeting  This  combined with  ber dove St Louis Fed president Bullard s view that a 25bp cut should be sufficient initially  means that we stick to our call that the Fed is more likely to cut by 25bp than 50bp  Markets have priced in an approximately 20  probability of a 50bp cut  Consensus among economists is for a 25bp cut but a few are calling for 50bp 

Despite the US economic surprise index having rebounded slightly in July and the fact that the US expansion is now the longest on record   we stick to our view that the cost of not easing monetary policy is greater than easing too much or too early   as inflation remains on the low side and the uncertainty surrounding the macro outlook has increased  We think the Fed will repeat both arguments in the statement and that the Fed will repeat that it  will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion   It is one of the  smaller  meetings without updated projections  so the focus is on the rate announcement  statement and Powell s press conference  We continue to believe the Fed will cut twice more during the autumn  September and December   in line with current Fed pricing  

Despite both the Fed and the ECB being about to ease  we think in the end Fed easing will be more forceful and the Fed ECB monetary policy divergence should pave the way for a higher EUR USD over the coming 6M   We forecast EUR USD at 1 14 in 1M and 1 15 in 3M  NYSE MMM   We forecast EUR USD at 1 17 in 6M and 1 17 in 12M  The Fed initiating an easing cycle would do most of the lifting for 1 3M  while for 3 6M a US China trade deal should weaken the USD

Danske Bank s market view in a nutshell

Riksbank  wait  see and hope
As late as April  the Riksbank decided to postpone the next rate hike and flatten the repo path  The timing of the second hike was described as late this year or early next year  presumably December or February   so is it time for a new shift 
The result of this weekend s talks on trade between the American and Chinese presidents could play some role but the tremendous shift in policy guidance by other central banks is the big piece of new information  They have announced the following changes 

ECB  At the April Riksbank meeting  the guidance was  rate unchanged at least through 2019   Since then the ECB has  1  extended its guidance to  at least through the first half of 2020 and later  2  opened up the way for a rate cut and possibly other measures 
Fed  The available  dots  pointed to no rate changes this year and one hike in 2020  Median dots now suggest a possible rate cut this year and no change in 2020 
Bank of England  Governor Mark Carney recently underlined that risks of a no deal Brexit have intensified and in the event of a no deal exit  lower rates are more likely than the opposite 

Market pricing has shifted quite significantly  Up to end 2020  the market is pricing in total Fed cuts of around 100bp  ECB cuts of around 15bp and Bank of England cuts of 10bp  etc   see table below   Therefore  in our view  it is reasonable to believe that the forecast for international policy rates  weighted average of Fed  ECB  Bank of Norway and Bank of England   see chart  will be lowered significantly 

At the same time  domestic data do not necessarily warrant another softening of the policy stance as such  First quarter GDP at 2 1  y y was a good bit above expectations  although  in our opinion  the details revealed a much less upbeat picture  with domestic demand stagnating and the GDP number held up by a rather unconvincing jump in services exports 
However  inflation has largely been in line with forecasts and the new  favourite  core measure  a median of a set of core inflation measures  is also at 2   In the meantime  the latest quarterly Prospera inflation survey stayed close to 2   although this is a notch lower than in the previous survey 

There is also evidence of an ongoing deceleration of growth  The latest confidence surveys show that consumers remain rather downbeat  business conditions in services are slightly below normal and manufacturers are well off peaks  Job market data have been mixed  or more precisely volatile  but the overall picture is that unemployment has been flat for about a year  while the steady rise in employment that has been going on since 2010 appears to have stopped 

On the back of this  it would be odd to pretend that nothing has happened  However  it would not be the Riksbank s style to announce a bigger policy shifty at this time  An elegant way would be for the Riksbank to drop the first part of the phrase  next hike late this year or early 2020   a sort of verbal postponement  In the meantime  the Riksbank can sit back and see what other central banks actually do and how data unfold  Will it hike in 2020  We do not think so 
Protect more bullish positions with a 2Y 5Y steepener
Some of our trading recommendations have a bullish tilt  such as our short position in the SGBi3109  May 2025  breakeven  This fits well with our main view of rates continuing to be under downward pressure over coming months  although the potential for lower rates looks to us more exhausted  At the same time  to reduce daily portfolio volatility  we like adding a more bearish trade to our list of recommendations 
We see the downside in the 5Y point as very limited  The 2 5Y slope trades at a historically stretched level  currently c 17bp   which we have not seen with a repo rate anywhere near current levels  The previous time we saw similar levels was in 2012  when 3M  NYSE MMM  Stibor was c 2   We do not believe the 2Y 5Y segment will invert given that it is difficult to see a sustained easing cycle with the current repo rate  which makes the potential outcomes for the position somewhat asymmetric 

Moreover  the SEK yield curve convexity has now basically caught up with levels in EUR  In our view  it is difficult to make a case that levels should be lower in SEK  as the mediumterm outlook is still better for the Riksbank than it is for the ECB  given more robust fundamentals  substantially higher inflation  lower unemployment  

With current stretched levels  we think that the 5Y point would be very exposed if rates were to rebound  Therefore  we recommend adding a 2Y 5Y SEK swap steepener as a complement to our more bullish trade recommendations 
Play the flat SEK curve relative EUR by paying 2Y2Y spread
Since the Riksbank s April meeting  we note that the 2Y2Y spread versus EUR has tightened  Surely  the decision was dovish relative to market expectations  with a lowered repo rate path in combination with the announcement of SEK45bn in QE reinvestments  Given this  the initial reaction to tighten the SEK against EUR made sense but since the initial reaction  the spread has continued to tighten  Explanations could be that the Swedish curve was more aggressively priced in terms of Riksbank hikes and that the recent shifts from the ECB and Fed have resulted in faded market expectations of the Riksbank  However  given the developments since April  we struggle to justify this move continuing much further from here 

Swedish data has been surprisingly good  with  for example  both CPI for May and Q1 GDP beating market expectations  We expect both of these measures to slow down later this year but here and now we expect the Riksbank to lean on these numbers in the decision next week  see above  and we believe that we would need to see a sharp deterioration in hard data for the Riksbank to consider rate cuts seriously  Thus  we believe the Riksbank is unlikely to match the ECB s dovishness  As we said above  the Swedish economy seems to us set to be more robust than that of the eurozone over the medium term  Mario Draghi s speech in Sintra strongly signalled that further ECB easing is on the way and our colleagues in Copenhagen updated their call and now see a 20bp cut in September in combination with a tiering system  extended forward guidance and a restart of QE 
Given the relative flattening of the Swedish curve  partly explained by the Riksbank December 2018 hike  the negative carry and roll in paying SEK versus EUR have evaporated and for the 2Y2Y spread  it is now basically flat  Hence  given a flat curve in SEK relative to EUR in combination with our views on the Riksbank and ECB  we see good risk reward in paying 2Y2Y SEK against EUR here  We enter the trade at  30bp  with P L targets set at  45bp  20bp 
Updated levels on LFH519 ASW  Sep 2026  vs SHYP1588 ASW  Mar 2024 
Our recommendation to buy LFH519 ASW  Sep 2026  versus SHYP1588 ASW  Mar 2024  has now reached our initial profit target of  15bp  However  we believe there may be some juice left in the trade  as the hunt for yield continues to intensify  From an historical perspective  the ASW curve for covered bonds is not particularly flat between 5Y and 7Y  Hence  we keep the trade on and move our P L levels by 5bp to  10bp  31bp 

Are the Beatles giving SEK buyers a message ahead of the Riksbank 
 Oh I get by with a little help from friends  Mm I get high with a little help from my friends   these lyrics by John Lennon Paul McCartney hit our minds when Norges Bank went against the stream and not only pushed the NOK higher but also  after some consideration  sent the SEK to higher levels  If Norges Bank can  the Riksbank can too  right  Well  we do not think so  The lyrics continue   What do I do when my love is away   Does it worry you to be alone    How do I feel by the end of the day   Are you sad because you re on your own     This sums up our view  at the end of the day  the SEK is on its own  in the hands of the Riksbank 

To be honest  Norges Bank should be of minor importance for the Riksbank next week  Instead  the Riksbank will probably pay much more attention to what is happening at the major central banks  First  the U turn by the ECB  confirmed by Mr Draghi in Sintra last week  and  second  the Fed indicating rate cuts  A significant repricing has taken place  from  2bp in 2019 before the Riksbank s April meeting to  15bp today for the ECB and from  20bp then to  73bp today for the Fed  This should affect the Riksbank  Meanwhile  the US 10 year has fallen 50bp to 2 0  in a short period of time  which may have caused some investors to trim their carry positions  Another factor that has possibly contributed to recent days  SEK appreciation is positive rebalancing flows among Swedish investors  given that the value of the foreign bond and equity portfolio has gone up 
Hence  we believe it is likely the Riksbank will not only remove the hike probability for 2019 but also delay the next hike by one or two quarters  Would such a decision be bearish for the SEK when the money market is already indicating cuts  We think so  Markets seem to drag central banks in one direction  as for the ECB and Fed over recent months and the Riksbank over recent years  One should interpret postponing the hikes now as taking a first dovish step  rather than clashing with expectations   especially if one agrees with our inflation outlook  We think the Riksbank will come across as dovish  which should weigh on the SEK  push EUR SEK higher   One may argue that the upside potential is somewhat limited by already soft pricing  However  if contrary to our expectations  the Riksbank leaves the repo rate path intact  there could be a relatively big sell off in EUR SEK  Therefore  the downside risk in EUR SEK if we are wrong should be bigger than the upside risk if we are right 
In April  the Riksbank surprised us all by lowering the rate path  which sent EUR SEK 10 figures higher on the same day  then another 10 figures after a week and then yet another 10 figures after two weeks  While we expect it to lower the rate path next week  pricing expectations were very different   15bp for 2019 back then versus  4bp now  which suggests a less aggressive reaction this time  Our impression is that the currency market underestimates the potential in EUR SEK in relation to the rate decision  The option market is currently pricing that day as more or less a normal day with an intra day move of 4 5 figures  This is clearly lower than an average Riksbank day  though  Let uss have a look 


In 2018  the high low spread on Riksbank days was 12 figures on average  The three times the Riksbank lowered its rate path  the intraday move was also 12 figures  In 2017  the average intraday move on Riksbank day was 8 figures but on those days when the Riksbank cut its repo rate path  the intraday move was a bit higher at 10 figures  In 2016  the high low was 12 figures on an average Riksbank day but a considerable 20 figures the two times the bank cut its rate path  The  web charts  above show how the EUR SEK close developed five days before and after the rate announcement  with EUR SEK set to 100 the day before the announcement  They also show what decisions were made and the high low spread on the Riksbank day 
In all  there is no single year in our sample where EUR SEK on average has moved as little as the option market is pricing for next week  i e  4 5 figures  Overall  the high  low has been 11 figures and counting only the times when the Riksbank lowered its rate path  seven out of 20  the high low is 15 figures  In this perspective  it looks attractive to buy volatility over the Riksbank day  with or without a directional view

Scott s shares have been on a tear in 2019  up over 60  YTD  massively outpacing the fertilizer industry   which is basically flat on the year  Most great business have built some kind of moat around themselves  As an economic concept  it s known as  barriers to entry    meaning that competitors can t easily enter the market Sometimes those barriers are natural  The most obvious example is the utility business   where the initial investment in infrastructure is generally so insurmountable that state and local governments generally regulate pricing behavior to ensure that citizens have access to gas and electricity at reasonable rates More often  the barriers are created by the business themselves  Pharmaceutical companies spend a great deal of time and money applying for and litigating the infringement of patent protection on their intellectual property  They ve developed unique compounds and or processes which the government then grants them the exclusive right to sell in the market  and they use that exclusive right to command a premium price for a set amount of time The barriers could also reside in the minds of consumers themselves  Companies develop products and services that customers get used to  come to trust and continue to buy even in the face of lower priced competition  It s most commonly called  branding  Branding is the most tenuous type of barrier because customers can be very fickle  Also  as new generations become the next wave of consumers  not only do they tend not to respect the brands of the past  they often actively shun them as old news This is exactly the predicament in which security firm ADT Inc  currently finds itself Security   especially home security   used to be a gravy train for a handful of household name companies  Because the equipment had to be installed by a professional and then connected to a monitoring system  usually through phone lines   ADT was able to sell the equipment and then sign the customer up for monitoring services manned by humans for a monthly fee  It was a great business model   money up front and then annuity like cash flows The internet has put a serious dent in that model You can now purchase an entire security system online  have it shipped to your home  install it yourself and monitor it  including live and recorded video  through a variety of means  including on a smartphone  You can also subscribe to professional monitoring services if you so desire This model is much more appealing to the millennial generation who tend to be tech savvy and also leery of subscription plans  They also like that you can pick up the equipment and take it with you when you move Additional content Legal Cannabis Faces Competition from Black Market  3 Stocks to LeadThe recent legalization of marijuana in several states in the US has had many people eager to invest in the emerging sector  The fast growing industry has led to several legal dispensaries sprouting up throughout the states in which they are sanctioned in  Many people assumed with the legalization of cannabis that the illegal distribution of the drug would disintegrate but that has not been the case  As the legal marijuana business has grown substantially in recent years  so has the unlicensed dispensaries  In California  early projections estimated that cannabis tax receipts would reach  1 billion for 2018 but fell short with only  345 million collected last year The black market dispensaries are cited as a major reason estimates fell short for the industry  Cameron Wald  executive vice president of Project Cannabis  stated that illegal dispensaries can sell the same product for 40  less than licensed dispensaries  The unlicensed dispensaries don t pay taxes or permit fees to the cities they operate in  which allows them to undercut their legal competitors Cannabis industry attorney David Welch believes penalties enforced on the illegal businesses are too low to dissuade their operators to shut down because the profits they see outweigh the sanctions  Penalties are usually listed as misdemeanors  which usually just ends up being a fine that incentivizes the owners to reopen the store  The Los Angeles Police Department estimates there to be around 259 illegal dispensaries operating within the city while there are only 186 licensed dispensaries Untapped Market ShareMany people see the continued legalization of marijuana as an opportunity to become a part of the next booming industry  The reality of the situation is that the legalization of the drug has failed to successfully eliminate the illegal distribution of it  While the industry is currently struggling to meet its potential  the underlying opportunity remains According to New Frontier Data  there is an estimated  70 billion in illegal sales nationally  which is 7X the size of the legal market  The current legal cannabis industry is only capturing a fraction of the market  If states like California can solve the black market problem by either issuing harsher sanctions on illegal dispensaries or lowering taxes so legal dispensaries can compete  then it would bode well for the cannabis industry Stocks That Can Catapult the IndustryWith all of this in mind  some companies still have the potential to capture a much larger share of the cannabis market  catapulting them into one of hottest industries everyone wants to be part of  Let s take a look at three companies that can help the legal cannabis industry take the next step Innovative Industrial Properties is a red hot REIT that is planning to buy buildings and lease them to growers of medicinal marijuana  The real estate investment trust is focused on the acquisition and management of industrial properties that are leased to experienced state licensed operators for medical use cannabis facilities  IIPR is currently listed as a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has had an unbelievable year so far  The stock has skyrocketed 176 1  year to date  and is looking to carry on the momentum into the second half of the year  The REIT increased its earnings by 42 11  and its revenue by 42 65  compared to the previous quarter  IIPR has been able to surge to new heights this year and investors looking to get into the cannabis craze should strongly consider them The Scotts Miracle Gro is diving into marijuana production by investing in businesses that sell fertilizers  soil  and other accessories to pot growers  The company also invested in hydroponics  a method of growing that allows producers to grow cannabis indoors  Scots Miracle Gro is currently sitting at a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   and has also had a tremendous year  The stock is up 62 4  on the year  leaving the broader fertilizers market in the rear view mirror  Consensus Estimates are calling for a bottom line leap of 18 67  with a top line jump of 4 39  next quarter  Looking ahead to the company s full year outlook  estimates are projecting earnings to increase 16 71  with revenue spiking 12 89  to  3 01 billion  SMG is subsidizing the production of legal marijuana  and its strong first half performance paired with its second half outlook can attract investors looking to be a part of the emerging market GW Pharmaceuticals focuses on discovering and developing cannabis based prescription medicines  The company s lead product  Sativex  is used for the treatment of MS symptoms  chemotherapy pains  and neuropathic pain  GW Pharmaceuticals is currently listed as a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has provided substantial returns for its shareholders this year  The pharmaceutical company has seen a surge of 76 7  year to date and holds the potential to continue this growth The company currently isn t profitable  but our Consensus Estimates are projecting substantial year over year growth  Our estimates are forecasting the company s earnings to increase 89 68  to go along with a revenue surge of 1 731 50  for the current quarter  In addition  revenue is projected to hit  218 50 million this year  which would be a year over year increase of 1 188 60   GWPH is a stock expected to grow substantially in the near future  making it a sound pick for investors looking to include the budding marijuana market in their portfolio The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular

194144,415660,MMM,Wall Street Celebrates Rising Stock Prices As More Companies Close,opinion,"How long can the stock market possibly stay completely disconnected from economic reality 
On Monday  the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 27 points  but that was good enough to push it to yet another new all time record high  Investors have been absolutely thrilled by the extremely impressive bull run that we have witnessed so far in 2019  but there is no way that this is sustainable  Wall Street may be celebrating for the moment  but meanwhile  all of the hard economic numbers are telling us that we have now entered a new economic slowdown  Just like in 2008  it appears to be inevitable that the party on Wall Street is about to hit a brick wall  but nobody should be surprised when it happens  Everywhere around us there are signs of economic trouble  and right now companies are literally shutting down all over America 
For example  just take a look at what is happening to the trucking industry  I recently warned about the trucking  bloodbath  that was unfolding  and over the past week  it has greatly accelerated 
On the 12th of July  we learned that trucking giant LME had abruptly shut down  The following comes from Zero Hedge 
Less than truckload carrier LME has reportedly  suddenly and abruptly  shut down its operations  according to FreightWaves 
The company is a regional carrier based in Minnesota that operated throughout the Midwest  The company had terminals in 30 locations across the U S  and through interline agreements services all of North America  It also worked with major companies like 3M  NYSE MMM   John Deere and Toro 
The company reportedly included  over 600 men and women  and has been listed as having 382 power units and 1 228 trailers  with 424 truck drivers 
Then today we learned that Timmerman Starlite Trucking suddenly shut down without any notice 
40 year old California trucking outlet Timmerman Starlite Trucking  Inc  is the latest victim in the  trucking apocalypse  and announced that it would be shutting down effective immediately  according to FreightWaves 
30 employees are expected to lose their jobs as a result  The company is based in a mid sized city about 100 miles east of San Francisco and had a fleet of 30 trucks  150 trailers and 28 drivers 
The company s owner cited  a tough freight market and environmental regulations  as reasons for the shut down  The company announced the shutdown on its Facebook  NASDAQ FB  page 
Of course those two trucking companies are definitely not the only victims of this  bloodbath   According to Business Insider  ALA Trucking  Williams  NYSE WMB  Trucking  Falcon Transport and New England Motor Freight have also completely ceased operations in 2019 
If the U S  economy really was  booming   this would not be happening 
Meanwhile  major retailers continue to fall like dominoes  Charming Charlie is headed for bankruptcy and will be closing all of their stores 
Fashion accessory retailer Charming Charlie will close all its stores after going bankrupt for the second time in less than two years  More than 3 000 full  and part time employees could lose their jobs 
Charming Charlie Holdings Inc  filed for Chapter 11 protection in Delaware with plans for going out of business sales at about 261 stores  according to court documents  The chain expects the liquidation to take about two months 
In addition  we just learned that Fred s will be shuttering another 129 stores as it desperately attempts to stay alive 
Troubled discount merchandiser Fred s has announced another round of store closures 
The chain will shutter 129 stores  leaving it with about 80 locations  USA Today reported  Going out of business sales have already begun 
Not too long ago  I went to a going out of business sale at a local store that was closing down  and it was definitely depressing  At one time the shelves had been packed full of products  but by the time I got there people were clawing through the small handfuls of deeply discounted merchandise that still remained 
Sadly  such scenes are being repeated over and over again all around the country  In fact  things are already so bad that even Manhattan retailing legend Barneys is likely headed for bankruptcy 
Barneys may be on the cusp of filing for bankruptcy protection as the luxury Manhattan retailer contends with high rents and shoppers going online  according to two media reports 
Reuters  citing unnamed sources  reported Saturday that Barneys has tapped law firm Kirkland   Ellis LLP and is weighing a potential bankruptcy filing among other options that could occur in the coming weeks 
The all time record for store closings in a single year was set in 2017 when 8 139 stores shut down 
According to a brand new report that was just released  we are on pace to absolutely shatter that old record 
In fact  Coresight says that the number of store closings in the U S  could hit 12 000 by the end of this year 
The  going out of business  sales and liquidation of other brands is expected to continue  Coresight estimates closures could reach 12 000 by the end of the year  the report said 
In The Beginning Of The End  I painted a picture of a future in which America s communities would be littered by boarded up stores that had been abandoned by major retailers 
Now it is happening right in front of our eyes 
Everything that is taking place in the  real economy  makes perfect sense  and unfortunately our economic problems are likely to accelerate significantly in the months ahead 
What doesn t make sense is what we are witnessing on Wall Street 
There is no way that stock prices should be rising like this  but financial bubbles don t typically follow rational patterns 
Instead  they usually just keep going until something comes along to end them 
And considering everything that is going on in the world right now  that  something  could definitely arrive sooner rather than later ",2019-07-16,Michael T. Snyder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/as-wall-street-celebrates-rising-stock-prices-companies-are-literally-shutting-200439979,200439979

194149,415665,MMM,The Fed Set To Continue The Global Easing Bias,opinion,"Market movers today 
Following ECB President Mario Draghi s hint at future easing yesterday  it is today the Fed s turn to turn more dovish  At the FOMC meeting tonight we look for the Fed to open the door for a rate cut in July and a total of 75bp cuts in H2  see  FOMC Preview   Cutting like it is the 90s    11 June 2019   Lower inflation expectations  trade war uncertainty and signs of a manufacturing recession point to the need for a lower Fed funds rate  Comparing the current Fed funds rate with measures of the neutral rate also suggests that monetary policy is not too tight  The Fed meeting will include new projections  dot plot  
On the data front we get UK inflation data where consensus looks for a further decline in the core inflation rate to 1 7  y y in May from 1 8  y y in April  Core inflation has been trending lower since the peak at 2 7  in early 2018 
In Scandi focus turns to Swedish key figures on economic and consumer confidence as well as unemployment  Sweden s NIER also publishes new forecasts 
Selected market news 
It was a fairly volatile trading session in global bond and stock markets  US treasuries initially rallied from the opening following Draghi s dovish comments signalling further ECB easing  but erased most of the gains later in the day  as news broke from both U S  and China administrations that Trump and Xi will meet once again at the upcoming G 20 meeting in Japan next week regarding the ongoing trade war  Thus  10Y US treasuries ended the day 3 5bp lower covering an 8bp intraday range  US curves flattened 2s10s to 20bp as the short end was held close to unchanged  A total of 63bp worth of cuts is currently priced by the end of this year 
Equities  on the other hand  merely extended gains from earlier in the day following the renewed trade talk optimism  S P ended the day 0 97  per cent higher  while in Asia Hong Kong shares  Hang Seng  is currently up 2 4  
Oil prices rose 2   brent crude up USD 1 3 per bbl   as OPEC and its allies are nearing on a date for its next meeting regarding oil production cuts  Vienna July 1 2   This ends a one month dispute regarding time and place for the upcoming meeting and finally some good news for oil  which has seen prices drop USD 10 per bbl  since late May  The oil price is set to remain highly volatile on the back of the current conflict in the Gulf of Oman and volatility indices have surged to the highest level in five months 
Japanese 10y bond yields fell 2bp to  15bp ahead of the BoJ tomorrow and are thus currently trading close to the lower bound of the target range of  20bp  The Yen initially slid on the trade optimism  but quickly erased the deficit  We currently target a stronger JPY  see  FX Strategy   USD JPY Accept defeat  105 is easily within range   
Finally  Swedish house prices  Valuegard HOX Index  rose 0 7  m m and 1 8  y y 
Scandi
Valueguard home prices  May  just released  show that prices continue to recover slightly  Flats were up 0 6  mom and single family homes rose 0 7   Later this morning we get June NIER business and consumer confidence data  Last month consumer confidence dropped to a six year low  manufacturing confidence is moderating too  but is still at decent levels 
Fixed income markets
On the back of Draghi s speech yesterday  we have changed our call for the ECB outlook  We now expect the ECB to cut rates by 20bp  introduce a tiering system  present an extended forward guidance  and restart QE in a combined package  We expect the ECB to open for further easing at the July meeting and announcement in September  alongside new staff projections  We acknowledge a risk of an earlier announcement should market and economic sentiment suffer further 
We expect that the struggle to avoid negative yields will intensify  It points to even flatter curves 10s30s  Periphery in general will benefit directly from a new QE programme 
Hence  we do not expect the usual textbook curve steepening  Curve steepening views could alternatively be expressed by paying in e g  5y5y EUR inflation swap  more negative real rates  though it already jumped some 9bp last night  In respect of 10Y Bund yields we target a new drop to  0 45   For more see New ECB call 
The busy central week continues today with the important June FOMC meeting  We expect the Fed to open the door for rate cuts  We expect cuts in July  September and December  Even though the US market is clearly priced for rate cuts  the  official  confirmation tonight should push US treasury yields a new leg lower 
Denmark will tap the DGB 11 29 and the DGB 11 39 today  For more see Auction preview  We have closed our long position where we bought 10Y DGBs versus 10Y Bunds 
However  we have not become negative on Danish government bonds  we are just taking a  wait and see  stance with the potential supply of 1  30Y callables in the coming month   which could be even higher now   as well as possible upward revision of the supply of DGBs in 2019 as the public finances so far have not been as good as expected 
FX markets
EUR USD dropped yesterday as ECB finally acknowledged the market s call for monetary easing  We see a case for the euphoria calming down again as the market recalls how it was left disappointed when ECB last announced rate cuts and QE in December 2015 and March 2016  i e  we are not bound for a bigger move lower in EUR USD after ECB s dovish shift  Rather we see a case for EUR USD to rebound today on a dovish Fed signalling it is ready to cut rates from July  In the end  we look for the Fed to ease more aggressively than the ECB and push EUR USD higher  We forecast 1 15 in 3M  NYSE MMM  
With ECB rate cuts on the table it is time to consider how Danmarks Nationalbank  DN  would respond and how EUR DKK would react  We see a case for DN to deliver only a 10bp rate cut if the ECB cuts by 20bp in September  That in turn would push FX forwards higher and EUR DKK spot lower  See more in Flash Comment Denmark 
We are now one day from the Norges Bank  NB  meeting  With both the ECB and the FOMC likely to ease policy in the coming months the big question is whether NB is able to stand alone as the sole G10 central bank hiking rates  In short  we think yes  Norway is much less of a traditional open economy than e g  Sweden and last week s Regional Network Survey indicated accelerating     mainland growth prospects across most sectors despite much weaker global growth prospects  The reason  Rebounding global petroleum industries  a weak currency  substantial rise in oil investments and large infrastructure investments  As a result NB will have to balance A  a slowly overheating economy set to operate at above trend potential in the coming 6 12M against B  elevated international risk factors  We think emphasis once again will be on the former and we expect both a NB 25bp rate hike tomorrow and a firm maintenance of the central bank s tightening bias  This is in stark contrast to rates markets that price tomorrow s hike as the last in the cycle 
A dovish Draghi sent EURUSD lower and initially weighed on EURSEK  However  the market seems to realize that further ECB easing will make it more difficult for the Riksbank to move ahead  limiting the downside in EURSEK for now  We are not at all surprised to find EUR SEK going bid at the end of the day  Come autumn Swedish fundamentals  in particular inflation  will add headwind for the Riksbank and the krona  Today a speech by  ber dove Per Jansson  12 00  and NIER data will set the stage

Rate your central bank  Clients were asked to rate how their central banks have conducted monetary policy in the past years on a scale of 1 to 5  where 1 is   Really bad  and 5 is   Excellent    Swedish clients are clearly dissatisfied with the Riksbank  The vast majority rated the bank as either   Bad   44   or   Really bad   31    The Riksbank  got an overall rating of 2 0   Notably  the strong discontent is widely spread across sectors  and applies to importers  exporters and financial institutions  Norwegian clients are much more satisfied with how their central bank has conducted monetary policy  Norges Bank got an average rating of 3 6   where 37  rated it as   Okay  and 63  as  Good    The ECB got an overall rating of 3 3   which shows that Finnish clients are almost as happy with their central bank as the Norwegians are  where 83  rated the bank as either  Okay  or  Good    No client gave their central bank the highest rating   Excellent    Hence  Norges Bank is ranked number one  the ECB is ranked number two and the Riksbank is way behind and ranked number three in terms of how it has conducted monetary policy in the past couple of years  The results are summarised in the charts below 

Should the Fed cut this year  While the market is pricing in c 60bp of rate cuts this year  only a slim majority of 52  consider it wise   and this is a normative question   that the Fed should go ahead and cut rates  Norwegians are a bit more hawkish on the Fed than the Nordic average is  as only 37  think that the Fed should cut 

Do you expect a Riksbank hike this year  17  of the respondents expect a hike this year  in March  that number was 57   while a few even expected two hikes back then   Hence  there has been a clear shift in only a few months  which is not unreasonable given the Riksbank s dovish message in April  when rate hikes were delayed  Danske Bank does not expect any hikes this year 

EUR SEK  Clients have become less bullish on the SEK  although they still forecast a lower EUR SEK  at 10 60  This is the smallest  0 5   projected SEK appreciation in three years  see SEK bullish consensus on the next page  Finnish clients stand out  expecting the krona to weaken in 3M  NYSE MMM   Danske Bank sees EUR SEK at 10 80 in 3M 

EUR NOK  Bloomberg consensus is still expecting a stronger NOK  where clients on average see a 1 5  drop in EUR NOK  to 9 65  Norwegians are only slightly more bullish on the NOK than the rest  Danske Bank sees EUR NOK at 9 60 in 3M 

EUR USD  For the third consecutive quarter  clients are bullish on EUR USD  The median forecast is 1 1336  a 1  appreciation of the euro in 3M  Here  we find a strong home bias  where Finnish clients are more bullish on the EUR than non Finnish clients  The median Finn has EUR USD at 1 1452  2  higher  Danske Bank is even more bullish  seeing the cross at 1 15 in 3M

194151,415667,MMM,FOMC Review   Fed As Dovish It Could Be Without Cutting Rates Already,opinion,"Key takeaways

As growth has moderated  inflation expectations have fallen and uncertainties have increased  the Fed now says it  will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion  
We stick to our view that the Fed will cut rates in July by 25bp and deliver a total of 75bp of rate cuts in the second half of 2019  July  September and December   The trade war is an important risk to our outlook in both directions 
After two days of dovish central banks  we still see a strong case for a higher EUR USD and lower USD JPY as the Fed is set to ease more than other central banks 

Several important dovish changes to the FOMC statement
Overall  the Fed was as dovish as it could be without cutting rates at its meeting  In line with our view  there were several important dovish changes to the statement  Most importantly  the Fed removed the wording that it was  patient  and now said   the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion   which we believe  as outlined in our preview  is a strong easing signal  To the dovish side was also that the committee was divided on whether to signal cuts outright this year or not  see chart to the right   The Fed also lowered its longer run dot  the Fed s estimate of the neutral rate  where monetary policy is neither easy nor tight   which means the current monetary policy stance is tighter than it thought three months ago  see chart below  


In the statement  the Fed also recognised that economic growth is now  moderate   versus  solid  in May   that market based inflation expectations have  declined  and that  uncertainties  to the outlook  have increased   which is a new element to the statement   The latter is mostly  but not only  a reference to the ongoing trade war with China 

Trade uncertainty the key risk to our Fed outlook
Listening to Fed Chair Powell during the press conference  we also think he was dovish  While he highlighted the Fed wants more information before delivering  he hinted that data needed to improve and  trade  uncertainty needed to fade to really change the rate path outlook  Another interesting thing was that he said the Fed has not yet discussed whether rate cuts should be 25bp or 50bp  That said  it also seems clear to us that the Fed is not in panic mode and any rate cuts should be seen as insurance cuts  not recession cuts 
We stick to our view that the Fed will cut rates in July by 25bp and deliver a total of 75bp of rate cuts in the second half of 2019  July  September and December   The trade war is an important risk to our outlook in both directions  Also  notice that Powell mentioned at the press conference that the Fed may change the balance sheet runoff plan if it ends up cutting rates 
FX  Fed paves the way for more USD weakness
EUR USD tested 1 1250 and USD JPY tested 108 levels on a dovish Fed  which justified the dovish pricing heading into the meeting  USD rates fell sharply  where the market is now about fully priced for a July rate cut  Fed Chair Powell stressed that the Fed is monitoring trade talks and needs to see more weak data to pull the trigger  It means that the upcoming G20 meeting  along with upcoming key data releases  i e  PMIs  ISM  non farm payrolls etc   will be particularly important for the pricing of upcoming Fed meetings and hence for the direction of the USD  We do not see data turning around for the better and see the risk of no breakthrough in the trade talks before the next Fed meeting  which should pave the way for a continued trend lower in the USD 
After two days of dovish central banks  we still see a strong case for a higher EUR USD and lower USD JPY as the Fed is set to ease more than other central banks  We continue to look for EUR USD to rise to 1 15 in 3M  NYSE MMM   although we note that despite large movements in rate markets  EUR USD has so far had a difficult time breaking out of its long held range close to 1 12

The key event today will be the Norges Bank meeting  where both consensus and ourselves are looking for a 25bp rate hike  see page 2 and  Norges Bank Preview   hiking and signalling further tightening   17 June 2019 
The Bank of England also meets  but in our view  the bank is firmly on hold  It is one of the small meetings without an updated inflation report or a press conference so we don t expect much change in the bank s message  The UK also releases May retail sales 
A two day EU summit starts today  where the main focus will be on potential clarity on the front runners for the EU Commission presidency  ECB presidency other EU top positions  We will also monitor if the EC will formally open an EDP against Italy  On the data front  we expect Euro area consumer confidence for June to stay unchanged 
The US Philly Fed survey and initial jobless claims will add to indications of how much the US economy is slowing  The PMI and Empire indices have pointed to weakness 
Selected market news 
Risk sentiment was benign yesterday as the market digested the dovish ECB message from Tuesday and was waiting for the end of the Fed meeting in the evening  The risk rally continued after the Fed meeting  Overall  the Fed was as dovish as it could be without cutting rates at its meeting  In line with our view  there were several important dovish changes to the statement  Most importantly  the Fed removed the wording that it was  patient   and now said it  will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion   while also saying that uncertainties have increased  Also dovish was that the FOMC was divided on whether to signal cuts outright this year or not  8 signalling cuts  8 on hold and 1 hike   We stick to our view that the Fed will cut rates in July by 25bp and deliver a total of 75bp of rate cuts in H2 19  Jul  Sep  Dec   The trade war is an important risk to our outlook in both directions  For more details  see our  FOMC review  Fed as dovish it could be without cutting rates already  
The ECB comments on Tuesday satisfied markets so far  as the blockbuster measure  ECB credibility measures  5y5y is 12bp higher than prior to the speech  however  a  Reuters story suggested that the message from Draghi is not consensus in the GC 
Oil traded in a relatively tight range of around 62USD bbl  with some volatility  The Brent price dropped on the back of news that OPEC  finally agreed to meet  1 2 July   as the countries must decide on the new output level  Brent spiked above USD62 bbl on a drop in US crude stocks 
As expected  the BoJ kept its QQE with yield curve control and its forward guidance unchanged at a meeting ending overnight with a 7 2 vote  The BoJ kept its assessment of the economy but it is more concerned about downside risks from overseas economies 
The NIER June confidence survey showed business confidence dropping in all sectors  consumer confidence bounced back slightly  The overall indicator is at its lowest since 2013  Price expectations are down to stable  most notably lower expectations in durable goods 
Scandi markets
Norway  We expect Norges Bank to raise the policy rate by 25bp to 1 25  today  in line with consensus  The new rate path needs to balance increasing domestic upside risks against higher global downside risks  Until the global deterioration starts to affect the domestic economy  or the NOK appreciates significantly  Norges Bnak needs to continue the normalisation of rates  Hence  we expect the rate path to be largely unchanged through to summer 2020 and indicate a very high probability of a further hike this year  Further out  the rate path will point to a slower normalisation process compared to the March report 
Fixed income markets
A dovish Federal Reserve sent bond yields lower  driven from the short end  where 2Y Treasury yields fell some 16bp  while 10Y yields fell some 7bp  The message from the Federal Reserve was as soft as it could be without cutting rates  The market is also pricing cuts of 50bp  We stick to our view that the Federal Reserve will cut by 75bp in 2019 
In Europe  fixed income markets bounced back yesterday  but with the positive reaction in the US market  Europe should open in positive territory  where we expect the periphery will gain the most 
In Scandinavia  all eyes are on Norges Bank and whether it will hike or not in the coming months  We still expect a rate hike of 25bp and that is more to come  See more here 
FX markets
EUR USD tested the 1 1250 level on a dovish Fed  which justified the dovish pricing heading into the meeting  Fed Chair Powell stressed that the Fed is monitoring the trade talks and needs to see more weak data to pull the trigger  It means that the upcoming G20 meeting  along with upcoming key data releases  i e  PMIs  ISM  non farm payrolls etc   will be particularly important for the pricing of upcoming Fed meetings and hence for the direction of the USD  We do not see data turning around for the better and see a risk of no breakthrough in trade talks before the next Fed meeting  which means that there is still upside potential for EUR USD  After two days of dovish central banks  we still see a strong case for a higher EUR USD as the Fed is set to ease more than the ECB  We keep still look for EUR USD to rise to 1 15 in 3M  NYSE MMM   although we note that despite large movements in rate markets  EUR USD has so far had a difficult time breaking out of its long held range close to 1 12 
USD JPY crossed 108 into 107 territory as Mr  Powell is leaning against the poor cyclical backdrop  We extrapolate  data is likely to continue showing that a cyclical slowdown is still with us but we expect to meet it by adjusting US yields and the dollar  appropriately  This is exactly what global macro needs to avoid a more gloomy path  Our 3M forecast is 107 but there s clearly downside risk to wards  105  as highlighted here 
In the Scandies  it s a significant session for the NOK  While Norges Bank is widely expected to hike policy rates by 25bp  there s a large discrepancy between analyst and rates markets  expectations for the rate path and forward guidance  The latter expect today s hike to be the last in the cycle whereas analysts including ourselves expect Olsen and Co to signal yet another hike this year and close to another one in 2020  If we are right in our call  see above   we see potential for a move lower in EUR NOK  especially if NB signals a 100  probability of another 2019 hike  as this makes the September meeting  live   Also  the aftermath of yesterday s FOMC meeting will be important given the NOK s high sensitivity to the global environment including US inflation expectations  Overall  we expect a strong NOK session 
EUR SEK   Higher than expected unemployment and weak survey data from the NIER had EUR SEK drifting slightly upwards during the day  For today  the NB rate decision is likely to set the tone for the Scandies in general  As for the Riksbank  yesterday we published the latest issue of our FX Thermometer  where we  among other things  asked the respondents to rate their respective central banks and a steep 75  rated the Riksbank s performance as  Bad  or even  Really bad   This is a clear signal of discontent from Swedish investors 
EUR GBP went lower by 0 4  to 0 887  a fairly large move and contrarian to the past month s momentum  UK inflation came in slightly weaker than expected but the GBP nonetheless rallied in the late session  ahead of the FOMC meeting  We think the cross will move higher over the summer  targeting 0 9  as UK data is still deteriorating after a strong Q1  Nonetheless  a dovish FOMC makes it less likely that we should target 0 91  Part of a potential BoE reaction to weak domestic data is now being handled by Fed loosening global financial conditions

Global equity markets had a good day yesterday  with indices rising across the globe  In the US  the Dow Jones index rose 0 9   the S P recorded all time highs and the European Eurostoxx 50 rose 0 4   The global central banks changing their tune and the upcoming meeting at the G20 between Trump and Xi are all supporting risk sentiment  At the same time  global bond yields continue to fall  The 10Y treasury yield flirted with the 2  psychological threshold as Bund yields fell to  32bp 
As widely expected  Norges Bank  NB  raised policy rates by 25bp  taking the sight deposit rate from 1 00  to 1 25   The rate path was adjusted marginally upwards at the short end and marginally downwards at the long end  The message is clearly hawkish  as a strong domestic business cycle suggests a further frontloading of monetary tightening despite elevated international uncertainty at present  We expect NB to hike the sight deposit rate again by another 25bp at the 19 September meeting 
The Bank of England meeting was rather uneventful yesterday  The BoE mirrored the recent central bank communication about the increased downside risks  although it noted that the  perceived likelihood of no deal Brexit has risen   The FX was weaker on an emphasis on downside risks even if the moderate tightening bias was maintained 
The selection of the new UK prime minister after PM May announced she was stepping down has entered the final stage  The c 160 000 members of the Conservative Party will have to vote between the favourite Boris Johnson and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt for who will head the UK as the new PM and lead the UK through the final stage of the Brexit process

Talk over the EU top posts ended overnight with an agreement to discuss the matter again next week  As expected  there does not seem to be a consensus for any candidate  This is a set back to the EPP and Manfred Weber as he has often been mentioned as the frontrunner 
Yesterday  the media reported that the telephone conversation between the US s Trump and China s Xi was at the request of Trump  which indicates that he is interested in getting trade talks going again  It raises the odds that the meeting will result in another ceasefire and renewed talks  But China has been very clear that it has  red lines  in the trade talks that Trump will have to accept these to get a deal  Talks could also be complicated by the US attack on Huawei and potential upcoming sanctions related to Xinjiang internment camps that the US is preparing  see  SCMP  
Fixed income markets
The rally in risk continues and the S P500 hit an all time high last night  as the BoJ yesterday morning joined in on what almost looks like a coordinated action to save the global economy by major central banks  It is noteworthy that BoJ Governor Kuroda seems to be quite flexible if 10Y JGB yields drop below the  20bp lower yield target bound  Lower JGB yields will intensify the Japanese buying spree in the EGB market and  for example  in the Danish callable market going forward  Despite the risk rally  10Y US treasury yields stayed close to 2   Note that US yields moved higher after the European close 
The European curves continued to flatten except in Italy  which saw some profit taking after the Treasury announced a debt exchange  We believe the EGB and EUR swap curves will continue to flatten 2s10s  Yesterday  we argued to do a 2s10s flattener in DKK swaps instead of EUR swaps  For more see FI Strategy Position for a flatter 2 10s DKK swap curve  20 June 2019

FX markets
This week has brought as much clarification on what themes FX markets are set to trade on going into Q3 as we could have hoped  The ECB has entered a state of high alertness and we think it will need to deliver an easing package in September  The Fed finally confirmed that it is going from merely on hold to outright easing  The Fed s determination to fade the USD carry lure and deliver reflation is crucial for FX markets as it contrasts markedly with the very limited options a range of other   mainly European   central banks are left with  Notably  we expect to see USD weakness versus currencies where central banks are constrained on easing options such as the EUR  CHF  JPY  or outright hiking such as the NOK  and or hold USD debt such as emerging market FX  Specifically on the NOK  yesterday s Norges Bank meeting also confirmed that Olsen and Co put more emphasis on strong domestics than international uncertainty and lower global yields  That supported a very strong session for the NOK  we favour more upside in Q3  see Norges Bank Review  Hike and tightening bias maintained  September hike due 
USD JPY crossed 107 35 due to a combination of dovish Fed and slight geopolitical concerns on US Iran relations  The dominant theme  we think  will be a continued downward adjustment of US real rates to support global growth   but also strengthen the JPY  Hence  we continue to forecast 107 on a 3M  NYSE MMM  horizon but clearly see downside risk towards 105 if more Fed adjustment is needed to turn global growth around  At the Bank of Japan s meeting  the signal was quite muted  In the bigger picture  BoJ passiveness might be an acceptable strategy as broad dollar weakness could very well also lift global inflation expectations  We think the BoJ could start to contemplate a reaction if USD JPY moves into a range of 100 105 and the downward pressure on inflation becomes stronger but such a scenario is still rather hypothetical

194154,415670,MMM,Market Guide   Fed To The Rescue ,opinion,"Fed helps restore global confidence by signalling rate cuts
Leading indicators for global growth have been declining for over a year  US capacity utilisation has been falling since December and inflation expectations have been falling since May  This indicates policy action is required from central banks 
In the bigger picture  we have been in this situation before  In the 90s  the Tequila and Asian crises did not evolve into something too bad for the global economy  In past years we have seen a similar slowdown several times  which was turned around by central banks acting accordingly 
Central banks in Europe  emerging markets and now the US Fed are clearly taking steps towards easing in recent weeks  History suggests this can turn the global economy around if they stay committed and given time  but we have yet to see the actual turnaround 
For now  what seems to be playing out in FX is a  battle of easing   We think broad USD will weaken as a result  against Latin America  EUR and Scandies  not least versus NOK  
In Europe  SEK  NOK and GBP are also getting some help versus EUR through Fed action  Although GBP and SEK could weaken a bit more versus EUR  the expected weakening is less than what it otherwise would have been  In the coming quarters  the Fed reaction and USD moves are becoming very important for all major crosses both versus USD but also crosses against EUR 
Trade war fears and Fed repricing
Trump increased his pressure on China with tariffs moving from 10  to 25  on USD200bn worth of Chinese goods in May and worsened the tension with new threats of additional measures if Xi Jinping failed to meet him during the G20 meeting in late June   We do not expect a deal until H2 19  as we probably need to see more pain on both sides before they are willing to resume the serious trade talks  US growth seems to have peaked  inflation expectations and actual inflation are low and trade uncertainty may start weighing on the economy  Without more easing  it also increases the likelihood of sub trend growth or perhaps even a forthcoming recession  We have changed our call to the Fed cutting by 75bp by year end  with the first cut already in July  We still have a constructive US macro outlook  but we believe the risks are greater by not easing at all than easing too much or too early  If the Fed cuts rates  it is unlikely to be a  one and done  cut  at least seen from a historical perspective  as the Fed usually follows a cut by lowering the rate further 
Oil   crashing to USD60 bbl
The oil price collapsed towards the end of May before finding support at USD60 bbl  The risk off in the oil market came on the back of new threats from Trump towards Mexico and fears over further escalations in the US China trade war  The balance in the market still looks tight  On the supply side OPEC  is implementing the output cuts agreed upon in December 2018 and is discussing a possible extension from June  Venezuelan production is in freefall  Libyan output is at risk following an insurgence and the waivers on Iranian sanctions have expired  On the demand side  the macro backdrop remains relatively weak as the macroeconomic data and global trade growth prospects have been weak  Risk assessment remains with any further rise in tensions between the US and Iran posing upside risks and a further escalation of the US China trade war posing downside risks to the oil price  OPEC will meet early July to discuss extension of current cuts and adjustments to production to mitigate the effects of Iran  Libya and Venezuela  We see Brent on average at USD75 bbl in Q3 and USD80 bbl in Q4 
USD   Fed is now fighting for broad dollar weakness
The Fed has clearly signalled forthcoming easing and we expect a 25bp rate cut in July and an additional two rate cuts before year end  This will contribute to sending the USD weaker as the carry attractiveness of the USD diminishes  Emerging Markets  FX also stands to gain from this move 
Outlook for EUR USD
The Fed is now clearly saying it will lower rates to keep the record long expansion going and mitigate the ongoing weak global growth numbers 
We do not expect global data to turn around for the better and see little risk of an end to the trade war anytime soon  Fed should hence stay dovish and pave the way for a continued trend higher in EUR USD  However  a trade deal would also be USD negative 
A trade deal and a  decent Brexit  would be positive for the Eurozone and could pave the way for positive surprises later in the year  as a lot of negativity is priced in on the euro political side  The ECB is trying to talk down EUR USD but we expect these efforts to have only secondary effect 
External balances  as measured by relative current account balances  hint at EUR USD upside medium term but as history suggests  a deficit is sustainable for prolonged periods  notably for a world reserve currency such as the USD  The USD remains generally overvalued on most measures and our MEVA and PPP estimates for EUR USD are in the 1 20s 
ECB easing in the form of rate cuts  QE and or further deterioration of the trade war are important downside risks to our forecast  In our view  the Fed has blinked and rate cuts are coming from July  The Fed ECB monetary policy divergence should pave the way for a higher EUR USD over the coming six months  as Fed is likely to be more dovish than the ECB  On 1  3M  NYSE MMM   Fed initiating an easing cycle will do most of the lifting  while on 3  6M a US China trade deal should weaken USD  We see EURUSD at 1 14  1 15  1 17 and 1 17 in respectively 1M  3M  6M and 12M 



GBP   to remain a range play
Theresa May stepped down in June as PM and the Conservative party is in the process of finding a new leader  Boris Johnson remains the favourite  We expect EUR GBP to trade near 0 90 over the summer but the risk of moving towards 0 91 has clearly diminished  Fed easing will do the heavy lifting that might otherwise have needed to be done by Bank of England 
Outlook for EUR GBP
EUR GBP has gone substantially higher after the breakdown in cross party talks that also led Theresa May to step down  We expect non Brexit drivers to weaken the GBP slightly over the summer  as weak macro data is starting to take EUR GBP higher 
Bank of England does not seem in a hurry to raise rates in the current environment with UK leading indicators suggesting a slowdown  inflation and wages under control  weakness in Europe and prolonged Brexit uncertainty  This was again confirmed at the June meeting 
A dovish FOMC makes it less likely that we should think about targeting a large move higher into the 0 90s  Part of a potential BoE reaction to weak UK data is now being handled by the Fed loosening global financial conditions  There is a large Brexit premium  about 5   which  if unwound  would strengthen the GBP substantially 
The GBP remains fundamentally undervalued  our PPP estimate is 0 76 but the no deal Brexit risk makes a correction towards such very improbable  In terms of capital flows  foreign investors  appetite for UK assets may rebound when we get some Brexit clarification but we are not seeing that yet 
In turn  we forecast EUR GBP at 0 90 over the summer  The likely range of outcomes is 0 86   0 91  The upper end of 0 91 is less likely as the Fed is set to do some of the lifting that might otherwise need to happen via BoE 



SEK   still difficult to turn bullish
As the major central banks in the world soften  the case for the Riksbank to keep its relatively optimistic outlook is deteriorating by the day 
Outlook for EUR SEK
Even though the two latest GDP prints exceeded consensus expectations  we would still argue that underlying Swedish growth has been weak  The reason is that the releases were boosted by net exports  which have counterbalanced the weak domestic demand  There is a clear risk that consumer spending and investments will remain weak throughout the year and thus we maintain our call for sub trend Swedish growth during 2019 
The inflation outlook remains a challenge  which probably will force the Riksbank to postpone planned rate hikes  Moreover  as international central banks soften  the scope for the Riksbank to keep its relatively upbeat rhetoric is shrinking by the day  We do not expect any major policy revisions at the July meeting  If anything  there might be a dovish shift with regard to market communication 
The sizeable rate gap versus the USD has held back commercial and investors  demand for the SEK and fuelled carry trades where the SEK has been the funding currency  As the Fed enters an easing cycle  these flows may abate  which in turn could support the SEK  providing downside risk to our EUR SEK forecast 
As international central banks soften  the scope for the Riksbank to keep its relatively upbeat rhetoric is shrinking by the day  That said  we do not expect any major policy revisions at the July meeting  A pronounced global risk off environment could send the SEK down the drain  though partially balanced by investors scaling back carry positions  Significant Fed cuts  more than we pencil in  may send USD SEK  and EUR SEK  lower than suggested by our forecasts  We see EUR SEK at 10 70  10 80  10 90 and 11 00 in respectively 1M  3M  6M and 12M 



NOK   Norges Bank is the sole hawk in town
Norges Bank remains the sole G10 central bank hiking policy rates  So far  the relative rates  impact on the NOK has been limited but we expect this to change as the NOK increasingly becomes attractive for foreign investors amid strong domestic growth 
Outlook for EUR NOK
As expected  Norges Bank hiked policy rates by 25bp at the June meeting  Meanwhile  more importantly the central bank maintained its clear tightening bias by signalling roughly two hikes over the coming year with the next one due already in September  This leaves Norges Bank as the sole G10 central bank hiking rates  So far  the relative rates  impact on the NOK has been muted but we expect this to change as the carry in the NOK catches up alternatives in AUD  NZD and CAD 
The important Regional Network Survey indicated growth in coming quarters of around 0 8  q q  which is above trend potential and suggests that domestic wage pressures will continue to rise  This  in turn  has implications for inflation  as it means there now is less room for higher imported inflation   and hence a weaker NOK   if Norges Bank is to fulfil its 2  inflation target  As long as the growth outlook remains healthy  we believe this underpins the need for higher short term rates 
The NOK has suffered from foreign selling amid the escalating US China trade war  lower oil prices and falling global inflation expectations  The decoupling from relative rates has been very pronounced over the past year and while a slowing China and the existence of more attractive commodity carry alternatives can partly explain NOK weakness  we still think the fundamental NOK backdrop is key to remember  As long as the global economy does not fall into a recession  global petroleum industries do not collapse and Norwegian competitiveness does not erode  the NOK would have to strengthen for Norges Bank to fulfil its inflation target

In the US  markets will keep a close eye on a range of FOMC speeches  including from Chairman Powell  Focus will centre in particular on any indications of whether the size of the first cut will be 50bp or  just  25bp 
On an otherwise quiet day in terms of data releases  market sentiment will continue to be driven by any headlines related to the Trump Xi meeting at the G20 summit in Japan at the end of the week  see more  here   
Selected market news 
US Trade Representative Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin spoke on Monday with China s Vice Premier Minister Liu He on the phone as the two countries are preparing for the G20 meeting  where US President Trump and China s President Xi Jinping are set to meet   likely on 29 June   in hopes that trade talks will be resumed 
The US has put sanctions on Iran s supreme leader Khamenei and eight other senior officials as tensions between the US and Iran continue to grow  In return  Iran reported that the diplomatic path with Washington is closed forever  Meanwhile  oil prices are trading lower  with Brent crude falling below USD65 bbl  In our view  the latest escalation of the conflict and the new round of sanctions are less important to the oil market since Iran s oil production is already very low 
The Fed s Kaplan warned in a written comment yesterday that monetary stimulus would contribute to building up excess imbalances that would be difficult to manage  His view stands in contrast to that of other Fed officials  e g  the Fed s Kashkari who on Friday said he advocated for a 50bp cut at last week s FOMC meeting  and to market pricing looking for a 25 50bp cut at the upcoming July FOMC meeting 
The monthly manufacturing activity index from the Dallas Fed dropped to minus 12 1 from minus 5 3  while consensus was expecting an increase  Along with weak German Ifo business confidence figures  this confirmed the relatively weak reading of the world economy as seen in Friday s PMIs 
Fixed income markets
10Y US treasury yields dropped 4bp last night to 2 02  as Dallas Fed manufacturing came in at a three year low and as equities ended the day with small losses after a positive opening  In Europe  we saw further support to Spain and Portugal and 10Y PGB dropped to 0 52  after the mild sell off the day before  In our view it is only a matter of time before 10Y drops below 50bp 
10Y BTP ended the day marginally higher ahead of a busy Italian supply week that kicks off today with taps in the 2y CTZ and the 10Y  2028  and 20Y  2041  linkers  On Thursday  the Tesoro is set to tap up to EUR6bn in the 6Y Floater and in the 5y and 10y BTPs  That said  BTPs started out on the strong side after the FT reported that the Commission would not trigger a formal Excessive Deficit Procedure at today s meeting 
Today  there are several FOMC speeches scheduled including Powell s at 19 00 CEST  The market will be looking for clues ahead of the July FOMC  where the discussion is whether the cut will be 25bp or 50bp  More than 104bp of cumulative cuts are priced in the market over the next 12 months  We will also keep an eye on 5y5y EUR inflation  which edged 3bp lower yesterday to 1 27  after the Draghi rally last week from 1 12  
FX markets
In the Scandies  the NOK rally from last week has faded somewhat  which we  amongst other things  ascribe to lower oil prices  In the coming sessions  we will evaluate momentum and technicals as structural liquidity is set to improve at the beginning of July  Historically  this has been a headwind for the NOK  We do believe  however  in another leg higher from a potential trade truce following this week s G20 meeting  as this would counter such negatives   especially if USD weakness continues 
In the majors  USD weakness has grabbed hold  Weak German Ifo business sentiment and hawkish comments from the Fed s Kaplan did not stop EUR USD from breaking the 1 14 level yesterday  Today  the market will scrutinise Fed Chairman Powell s speech  The market is assigning a two thirds chance of a 25bp cut and a one third chance of a 50bp cut when the Fed meets in July  That is a bit on the dovish side in our view  which opens up for a temporary setback in EUR USD on the way towards our 3M  NYSE MMM  forecast of 1 15  Further  USD CHF continues to decline  highlighting the relative starting point of the Fed vs the SNB in terms of scope for policy easing  clearly greater for the former   Relatedly  we stress that a further drop in EUR CHF towards 1 10 is where the SNB might try to step in but whether it will be effective in stemming further franc strength near term is questionable in our view

In the US  it will be interesting to see whether core capex orders for May show the same signs of weakness as PMIs as of late 
We also get a first glimpse of how German consumer sentiment has started into Q3 on an otherwise quiet day on the European data front ahead of tomorrow s and Friday s inflation figures 
A range of Bank of England MPC members  including Governor Carney  will testify before the UK Parliament Treasury Committee 
The EIA will publish its weekly oil inventories report today  The market will likely be on the lookout for at large drop in crude stocks after API yesterday reported a 7 6mb drop in crude stocks last week 
In Scandinavia  Norwegian unemployment data and Danish retail sales will be in focus 
Selected market news 
The range of Fed speeches yesterday resulted in slightly higher short term USD rates and a stronger USD  In particular  the market took note of comments from St  Louis Fed s Bullard  who argued for an insurance cut  but that 50bp would be overdone  Fed Chair Powell reiterated his message from the previous FOMC meeting  while adding that it is important not to overreact in the short term 
According to a Senior US administration official  US President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could agree to restart trade talks when they likely meet this weekend at the G20 meeting in Japan 
In Denmark  the Social Democrats have reached an agreement with their three coalition parties to form a one party government 
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept rates unchanged yesterday  but signalled that a further reduction in interest rates may be needed due to both slowing global and domestic growth 
Oil prices rose late yesterday  with Brent crude jumping above USD66 bbl  The market reacted to the news that API reported a 7 6mb drop in crude stocks last week  Oil inventories also dropped in May  when the market took it as a signal of weaker demand  However  the market reaction to these numbers suggests the market may now be more concerned about tighter supply 
Scandi markets
In Scandinavia  we have Norwegian unemployment data and Danish retail sale  A majority in parliament has agreed to support a Social Democratic minority government after the election three weeks ago  There are no major changes to economic policy in the agreement 
Fixed income markets
FOMC Chairman Powell reiterated the need for rate cuts yesterday and confirmed the statements from last week s FOMC meeting  Other members of the Federal Reserve were more precise in their views  as one was calling for a 50bp cut this year and another thought a safety cut of 25bp was enough  The comments were made in interviews yesterday  However  the comments had limited impact on US equities and US Treasuries  10Y Treasuries closed below 2  in yesterday s trade 
Today  we have only some less important key figures released in the Eurozone  with the main focus on German consumer sentiment  Hence  the market is likely to remain rangebound with 10Y Bunds range trading around  030bp to  35bp  The risk is skewed to the downside 
In Scandinavia  we have Norwegian unemployment data as the main data release  but the impact on the Norwegian market is likely to be limited  The Norwegian krone has lost momentum after the hike from Norges Bank last week  but the 10Y NGB Bund spread is close to 180bp  which has been the peak this year 
FX markets
EUR USD faced a reality check of Fed pricing yesterday when the Fed s Bullard argued that a 50bp rate cut would be overdone and Powell failed to commit to easing  Comments from the two sent EUR USD temporarily lower as USD rates shot higher  There is still some time to go before the 31 July FOMC meeting and more data and speeches to come  which means the market will likely continue to be in a limbo over whether to price a 50bp cut or not at the July meeting  In turn  EUR USD should stay range bound close to 1 14 near term before eventually rising to 1 15 in 3M  NYSE MMM  as the Fed starts easing  Notably  there is still room for further reversal of short EUR USD positions  Technically  the market will keep an eye on the 1 1448 top from 20 March 
In the Scandies  the external environment weighed on the NOK yesterday  Further  significant NOK SEK selling weighed on the cross in a move difficult to explain from fundamentals or the news flow  In FX Trading Portfolio   Update on NOK FX trades we argue that the strategic outlook still favours more NOK strength but that the near term outlook is more tricky via notably the loss in momentum and next week s improvement in structural liquidity  This suggests a more cautious EUR NOK stance near term 
EUR SEK broke below 10 60 yesterday on the back of the hawkish move by Norges Bank  We would be cautious in jumping on the bandwagon for that particular reason though  for the Riksbank  next week a hawkish Norges Bank is of less importance than the dovish shifts from the Fed and ECB  Meanwhile  the SEK may also be supported by transitory monthend rebalancing needs  On a more global front  USD SEK is heavy too amid broad based USD weakness  this is arguably carry related  and the upcoming G20 meeting should be pivotal

EUR SEK  As we expected  the SEK recovered from the mid May high above 10 80 and EUR SEK is now close to our 1M target at 10 70  The inflation outlook remains a challenge  which  in our view  will probably force the Riksbank to postpone planned rate hikes  As international central banks soften  the scope for the Riksbank to keep its relatively upbeat rhetoric is shrinking by the day  This said  we do not expect any major policy revisions in the July meeting  On balance  we keep our forecast profile intact at 10 70  1M   10 80  3M   10 90  6M  and 11 00  12M   A pronounced global risk off environment has potential to send the SEK down the drain  but this effect is partially balanced by investors scaling back carry positions as SEK has clearly become a funding currency these days 
EUR DKK  In our view  weak equity markets  an unresolved trade war and a large discount in FX forwards are likely to keep EUR DKK elevated over coming months  at 7 4670 in 1M and 7 4630 in 3M  revised up from 7 4590   On a 6 12M horizon  we expect the parties to strike a trade deal and the global macroeconomic backdrop to strengthen  which  in turn  we expect to send EUR DKK back below the central rate   7 4590 in 6M and 7 4550 in 12M 
EUR USD  In our view  the Fed has blinked and rate cuts are coming from July  At the same time  the ECB lacks answers on what to do about the risk of a de anchoring of inflation expectations  The Fed ECB monetary policy divergence should pave the way for a higher EUR USD over the coming 6M  We forecast EUR USD at 1 14 in 1M and 1 15  revised up from 1 13  in 3M  We forecast EUR USD at 1 17  revised up from 1 15  in 6M and 1 17  unchanged  in 12M  The Fed initiating an easing cycle would do most of the lifting in 1 3M  while a US China trade deal should weaken the USD in 3 6M 
EUR GBP  We believe markets will downplay the risk of a no deal Brexit as a driver for GBP in the month s  ahead  Instead  we expect slightly weaker UK data  global sentiment and the ECB to drivers for taking EUR GBP higher  In turn  we have revised our expectations for the GBP to a weaker path and forecast EUR GBP at 0 90  trading in a range of 0 86  if Brexit related news improve  to 0 91  much weaker data and or by pricing a higher probability of no deal Brexit  in the coming months

In Sweden  inflation figures for May are set to be released at 9 30 CEST  We expect CPIF to be 0 1  m m and 1 9  y y  which is 0 1 0 2pp below the Riksbank s forecast  As falling electricity prices should cancel out rising car fuel prices and as mortgage rates are essentially unchanged  focus will be on the behaviour of CPIF Ex Energy  we expect 0 1  1 5    There are seldom big price swings in May  with the exception of international airline tickets and charter packages  These tend to move in opposite directions and hence balance each other out  which is also our base case  However  we do see downside risks as charter prices may surprise on the downside and actually decline instead of going up  This could potentially pull inflation down by 0 2pp and hence inflation may end up 0 3 0 4pp below the Riksbank s forecast  The risk is skewed to the downside  so if inflation surprises to the downside  we would expect the yield spread between the EU and Sweden to tighten

EUR USD has been more responsive to US data releases of late  This is likely due to the high uncertainty about Fed policy heading into next week s FOMC meeting  The release of retail sales and industrial production today could therefore be market movers  We think the risk is tilted towards slightly stronger readings  which would be EUR USD negative  Regardless  we are confident the Fed will cut rates in July  which should pave the way for a move in EUR USD towards 1 17 in 6M 
USD JPY is consolidating around 108 but we believe the trend continues to be down in the coming months towards around 107  US inflation expectations remain on a downtrend but yields are more stable for now  We view it as unlikely that the Fed would invite in a tightening via real rates and the upcoming FOMC meeting could very well be the next catalyst for a stronger JPY as the BoJ remains firmly side lined

Over the weekend  ECB Vice President De Guindos underlined that inflation expectations have not been derailed  but that the ECB is ready to act if inflation gets de anchored  If Draghi repeats the message that the ECB is not concerned about inflation expectations we could see further flattening of the curve and a risk off move  It is also noteworthy that Novotny over the weekend discussed a more flexible ECB inflation mandate

FX markets
In the majors  EUR USD rose when ECB failed to satisfy a dovish priced market two weeks ago  ECB needs a weaker EUR and Draghi could try to right the market  when he opens the annual Sintra conference today  or more likely tomorrow morning in his introductory remarks  At this stage we do not think words will be able to move EUR USD   the market is looking for actions  On this regard  the FOMC meeting Wednesday will be the more important monetary policy event for EUR USD this week as we look for Fed to prepare the market for a July cut  In turn this should pave the way for EUR USD to move to 1 15 in 3M  NYSE MMM  and outperform FX forwards 
In the Scandies we enter a key week for the NOK  On Thursday  we expect Norges Bank to not only hike rates by 25bp but also signal a continued hiking bias by lowering the rate path only moderately  That said  the global environment of trade uncertainty  disappointing growth and falling inflation expectations have been strong headwinds for the NOK recently creating a historically large rate decoupling to NOK FX  In that light  Wednesday s FOMC meeting could be as important for the NOK as the Norges Bank meeting itself  From a risk reward perspective we still favour more AUD NOK and USD NOK downside 
After the inflation surprise on Friday  EUR SEK dropped some six figures over the day  which is by and large as one would expect given the magnitude of the deviation  A re test of the 10 60 support cannot be ruled out  of course  but the SEK may face some headwinds in the weeks to come  especially if the Riksbank strikes a dovish tone at the July meeting

194161,415677,MMM,USD JPY   Accept Defeat  105 Is Easily Within Reach,opinion,"Leading indicators have been declining for over a year  US capacity utilisation has been falling since December  Commodities and inflation expectations have been falling since May  The net asset class behaviour and macro data are strongly telling us external conditions are too tight and need to be adjusted to avoid more gloomy outcomes 
The most likely response is solidly placed with a change in Fed policy  but trade war resolution and  Chinese  fiscal easing are non central options  The required adjustment of US real yields could easily take USD JPY to 105  or lower  over 3M  NYSE MMM  
This becomes the second time the Fed has failed in keeping real yields above zero and is a direct result of Chinese deleveraging  a continued too tight policy stance  a negative shock from the ongoing trade war and fading US fiscal impulse 
An adjustment in the coming month s  of 20 50bp in US real yields could easily take USD JPY to wards  105  Upside risk in USD JPY seems limited  110  say   as global reflation would limit the relative delta in inflation adjusted yields  BoJ is heavily sidelined and cheap talk is not enough to avoid a lower USD JPY 


A very direct consequence of downside to global demand  continued weak stimulus from China and a Fed behind the curve is to accept the Fed will need to take real yields back below zero  USD JPY is a fairly clean way of expressing such a view  but other central banks at the ZLB and with low credibility stand to face appreciation  If we do not get a trade deal and magically see better PMIs  Chart 1   that appears unlikely   105 becomes our base case 

1  The USD JPY is driven by a narrowing real rate differential
Once upon a time  we did see USD JPY on trend for higher levels  But that s long gone these days  Chart 3   What did work  however  was the combination of Abe   Kuroda back in 2012 15  when they managed to depress Japanese real yields by over 200bp  Chart 2   But since 2015 16  the BoJ has not been willing to compress real rates further  Today  USD JPY is driven by US real rates and we believe the BoJ will not be coming back to the table 

2  China is the reason but Fed is the fix  Real yields going below zero
We view the rocketing off in US real yields in the past years is the outlier  rather than the new normal  Chinese deleveraging is a significantly underappreciated and disinflationary force and central banks have not offset it  Rather  inflation and growth have run in mini cycles since China started to lower its growth target  but the trend is of major global headwinds  The US  and global  economy was running hot in the past few years but is now cooling 
We believe monetary policy will be the adjustment factor  An adjustment could come via traditional Chinese easing  Chart 5   but it remains our base case that it will do only the absolute necessary and that is not enough to give a year long impulse to demand 
Chart 4 shows the cross plot of USD JPY and US 10yr real rates for the period since 2016  where the BoJ has been inactive as a driver  To equilibrate global macro  real yields are shifting lower and the US still has some adjustment to do  We believe USD JPY can easily go to 105 with this in itself  as reflected in the middle box of the chart  The tail risk is a scenario where global growth slowdown accelerates and a new negative demand shock creates the need for much  much stronger Fed reaction  It is likely only in this tail risk recession scenario that USD JPY will go below 100  There is an off chance of a Japanspecific deflationary shock to take the cross lower  but we have a low probability of such 

3  Conclusion  Risk picture favours much  much lower USD JPY
Global sentiment is a key driver in the cross  Chart 6  as risk off  commodities  inflation expectations and falling US rates run together to take USD JPY lower via real rates  Our 3M forecast is 107  At the moment  global macro continues to weaken and central banks have only just started to address the issue  which creates significant downside risk to this view 

An adjustment in the coming month s  of US real yields could easily take USD JPY to wards  105 while upside risk in USD JPY seems limited  110  say   This becomes the second time the Fed has failed in keeping real yields above zero and is a direct result of too tight external conditions for global demand  An adjustment of macro tailwinds is needed  It could come from an external source but we think it will be the Fed  By extension  we see a substantial risk that USD JPY will end up trading lower than the current 3M forecast ",2019-06-17,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/usdjpy--accept-defeat-105-is-easily-within-reach-200432065,200432065

Two weeks ago  the market bought EUR USD as Fed officials hinted rate cuts could be coming and the ECB revealed a reluctance to follow the Fed down the road of monetary easing  Today  Draghi will get a second chance to talk down the EUR when he speaks at Sintra  He will have to come up big  i e  signal rate cuts and or that QE is coming  to convince the market to sell EUR USD before the Fed likely makes a dovish shift tomorrow  It is crunch time for the ECB and the Fed and we stick to our call for EUR USD to rise to 1 15 in 3M  NYSE MMM  as the Fed is set to  out ease  the ECB 
EUR GBP is moving towards 0 90  in line with our expectations  Macro surprises continue to be slightly negative versus the euro area and the global backdrop likely favours a dose of dovishness from the BoE that the ECB will not match  A near term key event will be how the ECB handles itself at Sintra  We think the bar for surprises is high and continue to expect the EUR leg to push EUR GBP higher 
Leading indicators have been declining for over a year  US capacity utilisation has been falling since December  Commodities and inflation expectations have been falling since May  The net asset class behaviour and macro data are strongly telling us external conditions are too tight and need to be adjusted to avoid more gloomy outcomes  The most likely response is solidly placed with a change in Fed policy  The required adjustment of US real yields could easily take USD JPY to 105  or lower  over 3M

194163,415679,MMM,New ECB Call   Rate Cut And Restart Of QE,opinion,"On the back of Draghi s speech in  Sintra this morning and Benoit Coeur  s interview in the  Financial Times yesterday  we change our call for the ECB outlook  We now expect ECB to cut rates by 20bp  introduce a tiering system  extended forward guidance  and restart QE in a package which could come already in September 
In ECB perspective  nose diving inflation expectations and a higher probability of looming risks will materialise has caused a change in the change in call 
When and how  not if 
At the annual ECB conference in Sintra  Portugal  Draghi gave another seminal speech  similar to 2017  However  this time  Draghi opened the door wide open to new easing where he was specific that  coming weeks   the Governing Council will deliberate how our instruments can be adapted commensurate to the severity of the risk to price stability   Importantly  there has been a huge change from ECB in past 12 days since the last GC meeting as ECB will now act if there is no improvement in the in the economic outlook  so that inflation to target is threatened which compares to ECB acting if downside risks materialise 

Therefore  the question now remains when and how ECB will stimulate and not about if the will stimulate the market   As ECB will debate this over the next weeks it s difficult to call exactly what the measures will entail  annex has a list of possibilities   Draghi has previously shown a preference to deploy multiple measures at the same time and we expect ECB to come with a three part package  rate cut  tiering and QE restart 
The market impact and most prominently  the market inflation based inflation expectations has been very benign to the ECB  The 5y5y has surged from record lows of 1 13  to 1 21  in a sign of credibility in the ECB s new measures  However  the level is still very low and still far from ECB s target so the ECB has to deliver and come with a big package to satisfy markets  
We expect ECB to open for further easing in the July meeting  and announcement in September  alongside new staff projections  but also acknowledge a risk to earlier announcement should market and economic sentiment suffer 
A Bloomberg source story just now suggested ECB to favour a rate cut as the primary tool  
Potential timeline of coming meetings

Rate cut
Today Draghi said that  We remain able to enhance our forward guidance by adjusting its bias  from current at  present levels   and  further cuts in policy interest rates and mitigating measures to contain any side effects remain part of our tools   Consequently  we expect ECB to include  at present or lower  levels in the July meeting  but only cut rates in September as part of a package together with restart of QE  As the Sintra piece entails a sense of urgency and bold statements  we a 20bp cut in the deposit rate and the MRO rate and 25bp in the lending rate  to the new rates being  60bp   20bp and 0  respectively  That said  there are naturally a wide range of options of ECB possibility to cut  however we do expect a rate cut of at least 10bp and no more than 20bp  Should ECB  only  come with a 10bp cut in September  we expect a further rate cut later this year as well  Markets are currently pricing a 10bp curve in September 
At the same time  we expect a tiering system announced in a format where banks can now deposit up to 40  of the reserve requirements at the MRO  from current 1   and 60  at the deposit rate  ECB has previously expressed concern with the banks  profitability and if their concern continues  the weighted average deposit rate should not decline from current  39bp  1  at MRO and 99  at deposit rate   That can be achieved by multiple combinations  We currently favour 60  at MRO and 40  at depo  but all options are on the table  see also table below   See also tiering in GBW from 29 March 2019 for further discussion of tiering system 
QE restart
Just similar to Coeur  yesterday and the ECB press conference 12 days ago  Draghi emphasised the considerable headroom that ECB still have on the APP and reiterated the ECJ ruling to buy bonds proportionally  As we already discussed  a lift of the ISIN and issuer limits seems a formality as  the limits we establish on our tools are specific to the contingencies we face   Consequently  our baseline is that ECB will restart QE for the 12 months at a monthly pace of 45 60bn   month 
A conservative update of the ISIN limits to 50   taking into account the already ECB PSPP holdings indicate approx  ECB 1 8trl primarily in the govie space  That means that if ECB would purchase with EUR40bn per month they would have room for 45months and 60bn per month gives 30months  i e  plenty of room for ECB to implement QE 
The struggle to avoid negative yields to intensify
Further easing from the ECB points to more of the same  Investors will once again be forced further out on the curve in respect of both duration and credit to avoid the negative yields  It points to even flatter curve 10s30s as core and semi core 10Y yields are now trading in negative or close to negative 

In Government Bonds Weekly from June 7  we recommended to enter a 10 20y flattener in France  It basically  reflects this view  QE will benefit France and the Japanese investor that likes France will be forced out on the curve to get at positive yield 
Periphery in general will benefit directly from a new QE programme given their relative high debt levels and not least  high  yield levels  In periphery  we have been in strong favour of Spain relative to Italy given since the political uncertainty in Italy  However  it might be time to go long Italy even as BTP s have already rallied strongly  There is little else to buy for investors 

In Yield Outlook 10Y Bund Yields stuck in negative territory that we published June 17 we had a 3M  NYSE MMM  forecast for 10Y Bund Yields at  0 35   We now lower that target to  0 45  
Do not expect a text book steepening of the curve
Normally  we would expect a steepening of the curve 2 10y when the central bank opens the door for rate cuts  However  this text book reaction is less likely this time due to the struggle to avoid negative yields and the expectations that a new QE programme will be introduced  However  there are still some mitigating factors for the flattening trade and that is if we see a pick up in market inflation expectations  Today  5y5y inflation expectations have jumped 6bp to 1 21  
But we doubt that inflation expectations will rise any significantly  Further easing from ECB will support the recovery in the Euro zone  but it is hardly a silver bullet Furthermore  the neutral real rate is still very low in the Euro zone and likely falling  We estimate it around  1  in Research Global  Euro area rate to stay very low for very long from June 13  In other words the neutral nominal depo rate is probably only slightly above zero

194171,415687,MMM,Oil Higher On Feclining U S  Stocks  But Trade War Worries Linger,opinion,"Thursday May 30  Five things the markets are talking about
Euro equities are trading a tad higher along with U S futures following a mixed session in Asia overnight as investors continue to assess all the warning signals for global growth amid the latest trade developments 
This Thursday  China has ramped up trade rhetoric aimed at Washington  Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanhui indicated that provoking trade disputes is  naked economic terrorism  and that they  opposed a trade war but are not afraid of a trade war  
U S Treasury yields are steady but do trade atop of their two year low yields  The much watched yield gap between U S 3 month T Bills and 10 s is sending a warning signal of impending recession now that it slid to a 12 year low yesterday 
Note  It s a Bank holiday  Ascension Day  in Switzerland  Germany and France and market volumes are expected to be lower 
In FX  the  big  dollar continues to trade near its five month high  while the EUR and GBP are steady 
Crude prices have had a difficult week as Sino U S trade tensions reached the highest levels with China lining up their response to the additional tariffs from the U S  Oil prices have been dragged down by growing expectations that OPEC  may fail to agree upon when to meet next  and more importantly if they can agree on continuing productions  while filling the void from sanctioned stricken countries

1  Stocks mixed results
In Japan  the Nikkei share average closed at a 3 1 2 month low overnight  on growing anxiety that the Sino U S trade dispute will be prolonged and damaging to the economy  The Nikkei fell  0 29   its lowest close since mid February  while the broader Topix also slipped  0 29  
Down under  Aussie shares closed lower  led by commodity firms and weighed by fresh exchanges in the Sino U S  trade war that has hurt global investor appetite  The S P ASX 200 index finished  0 7  lower  The benchmark has lost  2  since it scaled a decade high last week  In S  Korea  the Kospi index rebounded from its  1 3  fall in the previous session to close higher on Thursday  The index ended up  0 77  higher 
In China  equities remained under pressure as trade war fears heightened after Beijing stepped up its rhetoric against Washington  The blue chip CSI300 index fell  0 6   while the Shanghai Composite Index lost  0 3   In Hong Kong  stocks hit a four month closing low as trade woes gather sentiment  The Hang Seng index ended down  0 4   its lowest closing level since January 24  while the China Enterprises Index closed up  0 6

2  Oil higher on declining U S stocks  but trade war worries linger
Oil prices are small better bid after U S inventory reports showed a bigger than expected decline in crude stocks  although concerns that the Sino U S trade war will trigger a global economic downturn is capping gains 
Brent crude futures are at   69 85 per barrel  up  40c  or  0 6   from yesterday s close  Brent fell nearly  1  on Wednesday  U S West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures are up  48c  or  0 8   at   59 29 a barrel 
API data yesterday showed that U S  crude inventories fell by  5 3M  NYSE MMM  barrels in the week to May 24 to  474 4M barrels  Expect dealers to take directional clues from today s official data from the EIA release  10 00 am ET  
Ex U S  oil prices remain supported by output cuts from OPEC  as well as falling supplies from Iran  Data this week showed that Iranian May crude exports dropped to less than half of April levels at around  400K bpd  Crude exports remain Iran s main source of income 
Market consensus still believes that OPEC  cuts will be extended in a meeting to be held either late June or early July  especially since Saudi Arabia wants to prevent oil prices from falling back to levels seen seven months ago when Brent slumped to   50 per barrel  Since OPEC  started withholding supply in January  oil prices have risen by about  30  
For the crude  bears   concerns that the trade dispute between the U S and China will trigger a global economic downturn and a slowdown in fuel consumption is capping any significent gains for now 
Ahead of the U S open  gold prices have fallen to one week low overnight as sovereign bonds have rallied and the  big  dollar trades atop a five month high  offsetting support for the  yellow  metal from an increasingly bitter Sino U S trade dispute  Spot gold is down  0 3  at   1 275 59 per ounce  while U S gold futures have edged  0 5  lower to   1 274 70 an ounce 

3  Sovereign yields edge a tad higher
As month end approaches  investors seem content to square up some positions  German Bund yields have climbed for the first time in four days having hit record lows 
Despite the Ascension Day holiday in many countries in Europe  the 10 year Bund yield continues to trade rather close to its all time lows of  0 20  as global growth fears prevail  Currently  the 10 year Bund yield trades at  0 156   up about  1 5 bps 
Elsewhere in Europe  the wide spread level between 10 year Italian BTP s and German Bund yields continues to reflect the pending clash with the E U over Italy s budget deficit  With both Italian deputy prime minister Salvini and the E U eager to honor their respective mandates  has caused the spread to widen in recent days  albeit still way off levels which repeatedly triggered reconciliation nine months ago  The 10 year BTP Bund spread trades at  281 bps 
Note  Money Markets are now pricing in roughly two U S rate cuts by the Fed at the start of next year and the European Central Bank  ECB  is set to turn on its  money taps  again next month as trade worries weigh on the global economy 
Stateside  the yield on 10 year Treasuries has increased  2 bps to  2 28   the largest climb in more than a week  while the yield on two year notes also rose  2 bps to  2 13  

4  Dollar trades at five month highs
As we head to the U S open the WSJ Dollar Index  which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies  is flat  however  the  big  dollar continues to trade at its five month highs outright

5  China puts U S soy purchases on hold as tariff war escalates
According to a Bloomberg report this morning  China  the world s largest soybean buyer  has put purchases of American supplies on hold after the trade war between Washington and Beijing escalated 
It s believed that state grain buyers  have not received any further orders to continue with the so called goodwill buying and don t expect that to happen given the lack of agreement in trade negotiations  
U S Government data indicates China bought about  13M metric tons of U S soybeans after the countries agreed to a truce in December  in a move that showed goodwill toward getting the trade dispute resolved 
However  in February U S Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said that China had pledged to buy an additional  10M tons of soy   it s believed those purchases have now stopped

194172,415688,MMM,Sweden  Upward Pressure On 3M Fixing Is Abating,opinion,"Close payer position in 1Y swap  P L  0bp  and close long position in SGB1047  Dec 2020  ASW  P L   9 5bp  
We have argued that  in the wake of the FSA s LCR proposal published in March  3M  NYSE MMM  Stibor would be under upward pressure around the June IMM  On top of the usual halfyear turn  we argued that large volumes of covered bond redemptions would put pressure on SEK LCR ratios and lead to strong demand for the weekly Riksbank certificates 
This has materialised to some extent  For two weeks in a row  Riksbank certificates were oversubscribed  Since the low in early May  3M Stibor has increased by some 7bp 
However  we note that Riksbank certificates were not fully subscribed this week and EURSEK FX forwards have moved significantly lower  It appears that the market does not expect the current liquidity squeeze to last into July and is perhaps already positioning for this 
Moreover  last week  we saw the Riksbank offer a lower amount of Riksbank certificates than can be explained by redemptions coupon payments  thereby increasing short term excess liquidity available in the market  The Riksbank taking a more active role in the money market is something new and could perhaps limit future upside risks for 3M Stibor 

We have previously recommended paying the 1Y swap  partly to benefit from higher fixings but also given that Riksbank pricing was extremely muted  Admittedly  we do not expect the Riksbank to be able to deliver in the end but  at least rhetorically  the Riksbank remains committed to a tightening cycle  However  with a rapidly deteriorating global trading environment  it looks increasingly difficult to price in higher rate hike probabilities in the short end 
Thus  we see good reasons to close our recommendation to pay the 1Y swap at the same level we took on the position 
In addition  our recommendation to buy SGB1047  Dec 2020  could be somewhat under pressure if fixings start moving lower once again  Moreover  we expected SGB1047 to benefit from the current futures roll from June to September contracts  which is nearing the end  Consequently  we choose to close this recommendation  initiated on 21 March  as well  with a 9 5bp profit ",2019-06-05,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sweden-upward-pressure-on-3m-fixing-is-abating-200428536,200428536

194174,415690,MMM,EUR CHF   A Lab For Effects Of Central Bank Inaction,opinion,"The Swiss National Bank  SNB  today effectively kept its policy measures unchanged amid a technical adjustment of its target interest rate 
We see a real risk that the market will test the SNB s willingness to pursue its inflation target given its constrained toolbox and let EUR CHF test 1 11 again 
More broadly  SNB could prove an interesting lab for what happens in the FX sphere when a central bank risks its credibility by inaction 


This morning the SNB effectively kept an unchanged policy stance despite a technical adjustment of its target policy rate  It kept key rates at  0 75  and the vital currency statement was left little changed  Following recent dovish messages from a range of central banks   notably the Fed   and upward pressure on the effective CHF  the SNB might have opted to strengthen its willingness to curb CHF strength but it did not  the statement simply reiterated that CHF is  highly valued  and that intervention is an option  Thus  there was no reinforcement of ability or will on behalf of the SNB to curb CHF strength  the SNB has not intervened on a wider scale since abandoning the floor early in 2015  Chart 1   It upped the conditional inflation forecast a little near term but revised it lower for 2021  With Swiss CPI growth hovering at a mere 0 6  y y  it leaves us with a central bank that can only really count on currency weakness to re establish credibility on its inflation target  In this respect  it was a little relevant sideshow that the SNB introduced a new policy target rate   the so called SNB policy rate  The shift in target has been underway for a while given the uncertainty regarding the future of Libor rates and the new SNB policy rate is currently set equal to the rate of sight deposits  at which banks place excess liquidity  at  0 75   Henceforth  the SNB aims to keep the SARON rate close to its new target rate  which is close to the previously targeted 3M  NYSE MMM  Libor  Chart 2  

On a broader note  we now expect the Fed to fade seriously the USD carry momentum by delivering three cuts in H2  which is likely to put USD on a weakening path near term  not least vis   vis a range of European currencies including CHF  see FX Forecast Update   Fed blink puts USD on weakening path  13 June  While for an extended period ECB easing has been the key SNB headache  this is unlikely to go away any time soon   Fed cuts are now set to add to that pain  In our view  these are likely to go hand in hand with dire risk sentiment  as the global macro picture is set to stay fragile into H2  and we have not even mentioned Italy debt risks yet   Together  we believe this will make it very difficult for the SNB to steer CHF weaker unless Thomas Jordan and company show their hand  i e  intervention comes into play  In our view  there is a good chance that EUR CHF will test year lows near term  However  should the market start to eye 1 10  we believe the SNB is likely to step in  Will it be enough  In the end  it depends on the relative belief in the market of the ability of the ECB versus the SNB to bring inflation back to target  Both have bad records on this but the ECB has proved its creativity when it comes to unconventional policies  while the SNB revealed its distaste for balance sheet expansion in 2015  This suggests asymmetric  downside  risks to our 1 3M target of 1 12  How the SNB and CHF play it out near term could prove important lessons for the ECB and EUR if Mario Draghi and company stick to the status quo on policy ",2019-06-14,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eurchf--a-lab-for-effects-of-central-bank-inaction-200431501,200431501

194180,415696,MMM,Danske Daily   Japanese Economy Defies Trade War Pull ,opinion,"Market movers today 
We start the week in a quiet fashion on the data front and even the US China trade war might be entering a quiet phase after the recent round of escalation  The next thing to look for is any news on more Chinese stimulus and more specific information regarding when the next round of talks in Beijing will take place  While things may have calmed down for now  we still see a risk of another flare up later as the two sides seem far from each other on the last critical bits of the deal  More financial stress is needed  in our view  to get enough pressure to reach a deal  For more on this  see also  China Weekly Letter   China strikes defiant tone  recovery postponed   16 May 2019 
Later this week  markets will keep an eye on the PMI readings out on both sides of the Atlantic to gauge what is next for the global economy after the new trade spat  In the UK  the EU elections  which start on Thursday  could inflict a heavy defeat on the Conservative Party and increase pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May to resign 
Selected market news 
Asian stocks are up this morning  helped by election wins for incumbents in India and Australia and better than expected Japanese GDP figures  Defying gloomy survey readings that had pointed to a slowdown  the Japanese economy expanded by an annualised 2 1  in Q1  However the details suggest that consumer demand has remained soft and in light of slowing demand from China and ASEAN countries due to the trade war  we remain cautious on the outlook for Japan 
Elsewhere  politics continues to dominate the news flow  After cross party talks with Labour collapsed last week  the GBP hit its weakest level since February  Over the weekend  embattled PM Theresa May promised to make a  bold offer  and set out a  new and improved  Brexit deal as she tries to pass her EU withdrawal treaty at the fourth attempt in early June  Although the new offer is said to include improvements on workers  rights  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is widely quoted as being sceptical of any deal passing and hence a June agreement is already facing headwinds  On previous occasions the GBP would rally mildly on the news of a change in the impasse and this could very well happen again in the coming week  However  overall  we remain sceptical  as we see only a slim likelihood of the bill passing  after pressure on politicians to find a way forward has eased following the Brexit deadline extension

Fixed income markets
There are limited key economic data releases today  This morning  Japanese GDP data for Q1 was released  which surprised on the upside  as the economy grew 2 1  rather than contracted 0 2  q q  annualised   This was a surprise and may ease the pressure on the BoJ and the upcoming introduction of another sales tax  The reaction to 10Y Japanese government bonds was modest  as yields rose only 1bp this morning  We have seen a modest rise in government bond yields this morning in the Asian region  as governments in Australia and India won  or are expected to win  general elections and thus ease some of the geopolitical pressure 
However  the market will continue to focus on the trade dispute between the US and China  where negative sentiment has pushed yields lower  and with the 2y2y EUR inflation swap rate moving towards 1   there is room for a further decline in yields 
In the European government bond market  there is a positive net cash flow that needs to be reinvested  as shown in our GBW  new 20Y Dutch green bond  See more here Government Bonds Weekly   We recommend paying 9m3m EONIA and a new 20Y Dutch green bond  we also discuss ECB pricing and argue that the pricing is too benign given the stability of the Eonia fixing  We doubt that the ECB will cut rates and recommend paying Eonia 9M3M forward  We are also still cautious in buying Italy even though the 2Y 5Y curve is quite steep and 5Y looks attractive  In terms of issuance  the focus is on the new 20Y Green bond from the Netherlands  We expect it to be priced in line with non green Dutch government bonds  Investors in the French  Belgian and Irish green government bonds have so far been unwilling to pay up for the Green label 
FX markets
EUR USD will look ahead to Thursday s release of May s flash PMIs  We look for a slightly bigger rebound in the Eurozone manufacturing PMI than consensus  which should break the negative trend seen since last summer of EUR USD plummeting on disappointing flash Eurozone PMIs  In the bigger picture  a US China trade deal is not in the cards before late Q3 and a recovery in Chinese PMIs not due before Q4  These are important prerequisites for a sustained uptick in EUR USD  We forecast EUR USD at 1 12 in 1M  1 13 in 3M  NYSE MMM  and then rising to 1 15 in 6M 
Also for the Scandies  risk sentiment derived from the cocktail of Eurozone data  trade negotiations and central bank communication will prove pivotal in a relatively thin week on the domestic data front  Highlights of the week will be Norwegian LFS data and a couple of Riksbank speeches that will likely be scrutinised for new information  That said  we have just learned that the Riksbank has reverted to its old habit of poor verbal guidance between meetings  Ironically  transparency is the theme of a speech by Mr Ingves on Thursday

194181,415697,MMM,Large U S  Firms Lay Off Workers Despite Booming Economy,opinion,"If the U S  economy is  booming  and very bright days are ahead  then why are many large U S  corporations laying off thousands of workers  Layoffs are starting to come fast and furious now  and this is happening even though the coming recession has not even officially started yet  Of course many are convinced that we are actually in a recession at this moment  In fact  according to John William of shadowstats com if the government was actually using honest numbers they would show that we have been in a recession for quite some time  But the narrative that the mainstream media keeps feeding us is that the U S  economy is  doing well  and that the outlook for the future is positive  Well  if that is true then why are big companies laying off so many workers right now 
Let s start by talking about Ford Motor Company  NYSE F   On Monday  they announced that they will be laying off approximately 7 000 workers 

Ford Motor said Monday that it is laying off about 7 000 managers and other salaried employees  about 10  of its white collar workforce across the globe  as part of a restructuring plan designed to save the No  2 automaker  600 million annually 
The cuts  some of which were previously announced by the company  will be completed by August  Ford CEO Jim Hackett said in an email to employees Monday 

If the U S  economy was about to take off like a rocket  this move doesn t make any sense at all 
But if we are headed into a recession  this move makes perfect sense 
Another large firm that is laying off thousands of workers is Nestle 

Nestle SA s U S  unit will dismiss about 4 000 workers as it stops delivering frozen pizza and ice cream directly to stores and transitions to a warehouse model that s becoming an industry standard for Big Food companies looking to trim costs 

And we also recently learned that 3M  NYSE MMM  is planning to get rid of about 2 000 workers 

3M plans to cut 2 000 globally as part of a restructuring due to a slower than expected 2019 
The maker of Post it notes  industrial coatings and ceramics said Thursday that the move is expected to save about  225 million to  250 million a year  The St  Paul Minnesota based company anticipates a pretax charge of about  150 million  or 20 cents per share  this year 

Did you catch that part about these layoffs being due to  a slower than expected 2019  
Unfortunately  things are slow for a lot of companies out there these days 
Another company that is dumping a large number of workers is MGM Resorts 

MGM Resorts International MGM   2 09  plans to cut about 1 000 positions by the end of the current quarter amid a cost cutting and operational overhaul that calls for fewer managers across its properties 
That figure includes some 254 positions that the company moved to eliminate last week 

In addition  Dressbarn just announced that all of their stores will be closing 

Dressbarn is closing all of its stores 
The women s retailer announced Monday  plans to commence a wind down of its retail operations  including the eventual closure of its approximately 650 stores  

I am not sure how many employees they have per store  but even if it is just a handful we are talking about the loss of thousands of jobs 
The U S  economy has been slowing down for months  and now the complete breakdown of trade talks with China threatens to plunge us into a prolonged trade war  As I noted in another article  a couple of different studies have concluded that an extended trade war could literally cost our economy millions of lost jobs 
And once the job losses start rolling  they can really get out of hand very quickly  We saw this in 2008  and it is just a matter of time until we see it happen again 
On Sunday  a reader sent me an article about a factory closing that was happening in her neck of the woods in Pennsylvania  One worker that was laid off said that the closure of the facility  was the final kick in the gut  

Robert and Brooks Gronlund  owners of Wood Mode Inc   wrote a text to workers Friday  saying they  are extremely appreciative  of the employees  contributions and commitments  The company owners then confirmed all of them were terminated  as were their benefits 
 It was the final kick in the gut   Michele Sanders  a 22 year employee of the company  said Saturday 
The privately owned company in Kreamer  which produced custom wood cabinets  shut its doors Monday  leaving nearly 1 000 people without jobs  The abrupt closure of the plant stunned workers and community leaders 

So now almost 1 000 people do not have a way to support themselves and their families 
Kreamer is a very small town  According to Wikipedia  only 773 people live within the city limits  and so obviously there are not a lot of employment opportunities in the town 
And if those workers are anything like the rest of the U S  population  most of them were probably living paycheck to paycheck ",2019-05-21,Michael T. Snyder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/even-before-the-recession-has-officially-begun-some-large-us-firms-are-laying-200423270,200423270

In the UK  European elections kick off today  Normally  the elections would not be a major market mover but  given Brexit  it is more interesting this time  not least because the Conservative Party is likely to suffer a heavy defeat and Nigel Farage s new Brexit party may be the biggest party of all  In our view  it is likely this would increase pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May to resign  Furthermore  CPI inflation for April is also on the agenda 
In the US  markets will keep an eye on the FOMC minutes from the May meeting set to be released later in the day  As the Fed has clearly communicated that it expects to be on hold for some time  focus will likely be mainly on the reasoning behind the surprise cut in the Interest on Excess Reserves  IOER

Global financial markets are watching every little aspect of the renewed trade dispute between the US and China  which currently shows no sign of ending  Yesterday  US equity markets saw some relief on the back of a decision from the Trump administration to issue a licence that will allow US companies to keep doing business with Huawei for the next three months in a bid to contain the fallout from the export restrictions on the Chinese telecoms equipment maker  However  recovery in Asian equity markets fizzled out following news that the Trump administration is considering curtailing the flow of American technology to China s top makers of surveillance gear 
In the UK  Prime Minister Theresa May yesterday proposed to give Parliament a vote on whether to call another referendum to ratify Britain s divorce from the EU conditional on MPs backing her overall withdrawal bill first  However  the proposal seemed to have little effect in winning over sceptics  with prominent Brexiteers  such as conservative MP Boris Johnson and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn  and May s Northern Irish allies condemning her proposal  Indeed  consensus is increasingly shifting towards a scenario where either Brexiteer Boris Johnson or Labour s Corbyn is set to take the UK through some form of Brexit and both are seen by markets as pound negative  In reality  we will not have more certainty before May steps down and domestic politics is reshuffled  Either candidate may indeed show to be more pragmatic but for now a bit more pound volatility has been introduced

There was a decent rally in the periphery yesterday after some turbulent days with underperformance in Italy in particular  The main driver of the spread tightening was a general improvement in risk sentiment  where equities rallied as well  The geopolitical uncertainty is still very visible in the market but comments overnight from China indicate that they are ready to  continue talks  with the US  Part of the underperformance in the core EU was also related to the EUR5 9bn issuance of a new 20Y Dutch green bond  This had to be  digested  by the market even though there was solid demand for it with a bid tocover of 3 5 
We are still a bit reluctant to enter the long end of Italy ahead of the EU parliamentary elections  and recommend for those investors that can buy Italy to stay in the front end  We still prefer Spain and Portugal even though spreads are tight and 10Y Spain is again trading below 1  on the outright level

There was not much of a warm welcome from the GBP on the back of PM May s improved deal  presented yesterday  The GBP has been trading increasingly weakly as the consensus call is shifting towards a scenario where either Brexiteer Boris Johnson or Labour s Jeremy Corbyn is set to take the UK through some form of Brexit and both are seen by markets as pound negative  In reality  we will not have more certainty before May steps down and domestic politics is reshuffled  Either candidate may indeed show to be more pragmatic but for now a bit more pound volatility has been introduced 
In FX Strategy   Policy inaction keeping a lid on EUR USD  we stress that EUR USD is in the hands of policy makers  The current policy inaction will keep EUR USD in the current range  while it creates downside risks to our 1M and 3M  NYSE MMM  forecasts of 1 12 and 1 13 if it further deteriorates risk sentiment  If policy makers in the US and China step up and manage a trade deal and or ease monetary policy it would create the foundation for a higher EUR USD  This is not a story for the short term  though 
We have long argued a bullish strategic view on the NOK from relative growth  rates  oil and fundamental valuation  Recently  that view has been challenged by the escalating trade war  global economic data falling short of expectations and a dovish Riksbank triggering broader based Scandi weakness  While we still look for a lower EUR NOK  an alternative way of playing a stronger NOK is via the AUD  For more information see FX Trading Portfolio   short AUD NOK  the global trend favours NOK  not AUD 
Challenging times for the TRY are not even close to being over  When the Turkish central bank cut the TRY rate by 150bp to 24  in the swap market yesterday  the TRY fell immediately  High rates in Turkey have already caused contraction in economic activity and the state continues to face a trade off  whether to keep the TRY and banking sector stable and inflation under control or try to revive the economy ",2019-05-22,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danske-daily--mays-new-brexit-proposal-fails-to-win-over-sceptics-200423745,200423745

VGM Scores
At this time  3M has an average Growth Score of C  though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F  However  the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side  putting it in the middle 20  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  It s no surprise 3M has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-05-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-3m-mmm-down-129-since-last-earnings-report-200425057,200425057
194184,415700,MMM,Moving Average Crossover Alert  3M Company,opinion,"3M Company   NYSE MMM   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for MMM broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 12 7  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for MMM stock 
If that wasn t enough  MMM isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  4 estimates have been reduced  while none has moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So  either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for MMM  You can see

194189,415705,MMM,Oil Mixed As Sino U S Trade War Drags On Prices  Gold Higher,opinion,"Tuesday  May 7  Five things the markets are talking about 
Global equities were mixed overnight as a slew of trade headlines continued to batter markets  U S Treasury yields have managed to back up a tad while the U S dollar confines itself to  non volatile  trading range against G10 currency pairs 
Nevertheless  investor sentiment remains tenuous as President Trump s latest threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods this Friday from  10 to  25  has certainly shocked financial markets and fueled worries that this week s trade talks may be derailed  China s Vice Premier Liu He has indicated that he and a delegation would still visit the U S for trade talks on May 9 and 10 
Down under  the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  left rates on hold  defying expectations it could become the first G10 central bank to enter an easing cycle  The emphasis now shifts to Reserve Bank of New Zealand  RBNZ  later this evening  10 00 pm EDT   The market is pricing in a roughly a  50  chance of one  If it happens  expect the NZD to pullback towards its seven month lows of NZ   0 6425 
On tap  China releases trade data this evening  and the U S  does so on Thursday  South Africa holds national elections tomorrow while China reports on inflation Thursday and the U S  releases their April CPI report Friday 
1  Stocks pare their Sino U S tariff losses
In Asia  the Nikkei was the biggest loser as domestic markets reopened following 10 days of holidays  Missing out on Trump s tariff threats to China  the Nikkei closed down  1 5  as 27 of the 33 Topix sectors fell  Some electronics and machinery stocks saw big declines on weak guidance issued ahead of the holiday 
Down under  Australian stocks lost most of their gains after the RBA declined to cut interest rates to help support a  slowing  domestic economy  It was an even split on a cut  but after rising as much as  0 9  intraday  the benchmark ASX 200 stock index ended with just a  0 2  gain  In S  Korea  the KOSPI was down  0 88   however  after North Korea conducted a round of missile tests on Saturday 
In China  equities staged a  mild technical rebound  but remained volatile after their worst drop in more than 36 months yesterday  The benchmark Shanghai Composite was  0 7  higher  while the blue chip CSI 300 rose  0 98   In Hong Kong  the Hang Seng was up  0 5  
In Europe  regional bourses are trading mixed  paring earlier highs  following a generally higher session in Asia after China s Vice Premier Liu said he will visit the U S this week for trade talks 
U S stocks are set to open in the  red    0 46   
Indices  Stoxx 600  0 18  at 386 20  FTSE  0 58  at 7 338 05  DAX  0 30  at 12 250 30  CAC 40  0 44  at 5 459 56  IBEX 35  0 20  at 9 350 10  FTSE MIB  0 27  at 21 466 50  SMI  0 10  at 9 648 50  S P 500 Futures  0 46 

2  Oil mixed as Sino U S trade war drags on prices  gold higher
Oil prices trade mixed  pressured by concerns that the escalating Sino U S  trade dispute could slow the global economy  while sanctions on Iran and Venezuela is helping to keep the market on edge 
Brent crude oil futures are at   71 12 per barrel  down  12c  or  0 2   below Monday s close  U S West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures were at   62 30 per barrel  up  5c above yesterday s settlement 
Prices have come under pressure by investor worries that the stalling U S China trade talks could dent global fuel consumption 
On the supply side  oil markets remain tense as the U S tightens sanctions on Iranian oil exports  indicating yesterday that it would also boost its military presence in the Middle East 
Note  U S sanctions have already halved Iranian crude oil exports over the past year to below  1M bpd  and future shipments are expected to drop to as low as  500K bpd by the end of the month  
Also providing pressure on prices is U S data showing an increase in production  U S crude production has already surged by more than  2M bpd since early 2018  to a record  12 3M  NYSE MMM  bpd  This has made the U S the world s biggest producer 
However  data from Baker Hughes last Friday showed that the number of rigs drilling for gas in the U S fell by  3 to  183 in the week to May 3  while oil directed drilling rigs rose by  2 to 807 
Ahead of the U S open  gold prices remain somewhat better bid as President Trump threatens to hike tariffs on Chinese imports has pushed investors to seek insurance in  safe haven  assets  Spot gold is up  0 2  at   1 283 41 per ounce  while U S gold futures are up  0 1  to   1 284 50 an ounce 

3  Sovereign yields are confined to tight ranges
The German 10 year Bund has fallen this morning  pushing back yields despite being well supported  albeit with low volumes  Over the past 24 hours  the market s reaction to the renewed trade tension was quite muted and mainly confined to equity markets  The 10 year Bund yield has rallied to  0 021   The spread between the 10 year German government Bunds and the Italian government BTP s has widened slightly   some from rising BTP yields and some from falling Bund yields 
Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  ignored market pressure to cut in the shape of weak inflation and a slowing domestic economy  Rather  RBA Governor Lowe said   the job market will steer policy as more unemployment declines are needed to get inflation to the central bank s 2 3  target range  
Note  An Aussie Senate election is next week  and some had speculated a rate cut would have to wait until afterward to avoid political entanglements 
Elsewhere  the yield on 10 year Treasuries has increased  2 bps to  2 49   In the U K  the 10 year Gilt yield has fallen  3 bps to  1 193   while in Japan s 10 year JGB yield fell  1 bps to  0 049  

4  Risk on trying to find momentum
The AUD  A 0 7035  rallied after the RBA failed to cut interest rates overnight  However  Aussie  bears  believe the currency strength won t last if U S China trade tensions escalate   AUD is  the main G10 currency in the firing line if risk sentiment sours  Rate cut odds have now been pushed out to August 
New Zealand s Institute of Economic Research does not believe that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand  RBNZ  will cut rates later this evening  10 00 pm EDT   If it does happen  Kiwi  bulls  are looking for the NZD to pullback toward last October s low of NZ 0 6425 
In Turkey  ongoing political uncertainty has pushed the USD up nearly  2  against TRY   6 1695  up  1 59    Yesterday  Turkey s national election board canceled results of the Istanbul mayoral race that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan s ruling party lost five weeks ago and ordered a rerun  The market believes that the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey  CBRT  has limited FX ammo to fight a weakening TRY   so we are back in the scope of CBRT needing to hike rates to prevent the lira going much weaker 
China  yuan   0 3  to  6 7939 offshore  weakened further against the dollar outright overnight  but the pace of losses has slowed  as the market digests Trump s tariff threats  The onshore yuan also fell  0 3  to  6 7789 
GBP   1 3088  down  0 1   is a tad softer as the prospect of a cross party Brexit deal is lacking market optimism 

5  German manufacturing orders missed forecasts in March
Data this morning from Germany s Federal Statistical Office showed that German manufacturing orders picked up slightly in March  but not enough to compensate the previous month s steep fall and held back by weak domestic demand for capital goods 
Total orders for the key sector rose  0 6  m m  versus market expectations of a  1 2  rise 
 The slight order increase in March is not least due to bulk orders   the German economics ministry said  Stripping out volatile demand for big ticket items  manufacturing orders would have registered another monthly decline  the ministry added 
Compared year over year  order volumes dropped  6 0  
Note  Industrial activity in Germany turned down in H2 2018 amid weaker foreign demand and partly reflecting temporary disruptions to production in the key automobile and chemical industries  
 On the whole  the order situation in the manufacturing sector indicates that industrial activity will remain subdued in the coming months   the economics ministry said

Trade tensions between the US and China continue to be the key driver for markets  more in selected news  
On the data front  the main releases will be US retail sales for April and the US Empire business survey index for May  We expect retail sales to continue to show strength but would keep in mind the data is quite volatile on a monthly basis  Retail sales bounced back strongly in March after a weak start to the year  The Empire index will give us the first survey for May  We also get the first estimate of German GDP growth in Q1  We expect 0 4  q q
In Scandi  we have Swedish inflation expectations from Prospera and Norwegian trade balance figures 
Selected market news 
Things have calmed down a bit on the surface between the US and China on the trade war with no new issues to fuel the fire yesterday  Trump tweeted yesterday   When the time is right we will make a deal with China   After adding that this must be a great deal for the US  he says   It will happen  and much faster than people think    It still seems every time stock markets are down  he starts tweeting about a deal coming  However  the nationalistic sentiment is growing on both sides and that could make it even harder to get a deal done  One of the key challenges regards China s willingness to change its laws  which is apparently a red line for China  But also one of the key requirements from the US  Will Trump be willing to sacrifice this demand  The next thing to look out for is whether a new round of talks is announced at some point or a potential phone call between Xi and Trump  Both might dampen the fears for a while  However  new talks are no guarantee of a deal and we see it as increasingly likely that it will take more financial stress for the two sides to feel enough pressure to find a compromise  This could easily drag into H2  see also  US China Trade  Back in the tit for tat spiral   13 March 2019 
As a result  risk sentiment was holding up yesterday  sending equities higher by around 0 8  in the US and slightly more in Europe  This comes after the dreadful day on Monday with equities down markedly 
Adding to the risk factors  note also that by Saturday  18 May  Trump has to decide on the potential of tariffs on European vehicles  While we do not expect Trump to go ahead with the tariffs  we should keep an eye on a potential new risk factors for the European global economy  Should he go ahead  the tariffs must either be implemented within 15 days or he can delay implementation by 180 days if negotiations with the EU start  the latter may be more likely

The market stabilised as President Trump is trying to ease fears of an outright trade war between China and US  Hence  US equities rose while US treasury yields rose very modestly  The 10Y spread between Italy and Germany remains under pressure and the comments from vice PM Salvini that Italy ready to break the growth and stability pact is not supportive for Italian government bonds  The market is looking for structural reforms on the Italian economy rather than debt fuelled spending in Italy 
Today  we have preliminary GDP numbers from Germany and the Eurozone  Growth in Germany is expected to rise 0 7  y y and we expect 1 2  for the Eurozone  The market will be looking for a continuation of the better than expected Q4 growth data  This would support the view that the Eurozone economy is slowly moving away from the risk of recession  However  the growth level is still very modest and thus the impact on rates should be limited 
We have Germany tapping EUR 1bn in the 30Y segment  while Norway will tap NOK 3bn in the 10Y benchmark 
FX markets
Global sentiment improved somewhat for the first time in little over a week as USD JPY  EUR NOK  EM currencies  semiconductors  commodity prices and cross market volatility all showed some reversal  Mostly  this seem to be a consolidation on the back of little additional negative news and the strong repricing seen last week  Even if we see some nearterm stabilisation in market sentiment  NZD USD and AUD USD remain quite exposed to further pressure  These trade more closely to industrial commodities  prices and the Chinese macro   which have yet to show convincing upward trends and are not focusing solely on creating a new manufacturing cycle  The NZD and AUD are likely to remain weak and follow potential CNY pressure in the coming month s  
In the Scandies  the revised fiscal budget in Norway yesterday revealed a more expansionary budget than expected  Markets paradoxically rarely move on budget news but the release clearly supports the notion of both a June and a December rate hike from Norges Bank  as the central bank has underestimated fiscal spending 
EUR DKK traded above 7 4690 yesterday  hence  above the level Danmarks Nationalbank  DN  sold EUR DKK in FX intervention back in December and January  We are still some distance away from the historical peak in EUR DKK  It is 7 4717 based on the daily central bank fixing and around 7 4740 50 based on intraday pricing  As we have emphasised before  DN is in a perfect position to be patient with ample FX reserves to draw on   in our view  it would be willing to draw down the FX reserve by around DKK40bn before it would consider a rate hike  Meanwhile  3M  NYSE MMM  EUR DKK FX forward has moved to the right over the past couple of weeks  It may be due to foreign investors buying DKK assets again

Yesterday s inflation print in Sweden was pretty much spot on the consensus  and the Riksbank s  forecast  Still  seeing as EUR SEK traded down some five figures  to 10 75   it seems that the market had at least some fears of yet another disappointing print  and that relief over this drove the cross down  Today s release of inflation expectations  see Scandi section  should not have any major impact on the SEK  unless there is a big jump in either direction ",2019-05-15,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/improved-risk-sentiment-with-little-news-on-trade-war-200421488,200421488
194191,415707,MMM,FX Forecast Update   Global Disinflation Risk Taking Control Of FX Markets,opinion,"EUR NOK   The Q1 NOK rally has suffered a serious setback over the past month on the back of external developments  Initially  a dovish Riksbank triggered the EUR NOK move higher  However  the primary single driver behind NOK weakness has been lower global inflation expectations on the resurfacing of the trade war and relatively hawkish central banks  As a result  we have seen a disconnect between EUR NOK spot and model estimates based on relative rates  oil prices and risk sentiment proxies  This alone suggests eventual NOK rebound potential but the near term outlook for external drivers does not look too supportive  As a result  we lift our 1M and 3M  NYSE MMM  forecasts to 9 70  from 9 50  and 9 60  was 9 50   respectively  Fundamentally  we still emphasise that as long as the global economy does not fall out of bed  the NOK is now too weak for Norges Bank to fulfil its inflation target  Therefore  alongside a higher oil price and long term NOK valuation  we still pencil in a lower EUR NOK at 9 40  previously 9 30  in 6M and 9 30  unchanged  in 12M 
EUR SEK  We think that it is in monetary policy expectations where one could eventually get a trigger for a SEK turnaround  Such a turnaround is hard to see though  given that Swedish inflation will probably force the Riksbank to stay on hold for longer  This said  the market has priced out almost all probability of a hike this year  Unless one expects rate cuts  we do not   a positive driver for EUR SEK may abate going forward  More generally  the SEK still stands out as one of the most attractive funding currencies and this could continue to push USD SEK higher as long as carry remains a theme  On the other hand  EUR SEK is somewhat overbought relative to our short term models  Therefore  on balance  we raise our 1M forecast to 10 70  previously 10 60   3M to 10 80  previously 10 60   6M to 10 90  previously 10 70  and finally 12M to 11 00  previously 10 80  
EUR DKK  Weak equity markets  the unresolved trade war and a large discount in FX forwards are likely to keep EUR DKK elevated over coming months   at 7 4650 in 1M and 7 4630 in 3M  from 7 4590   On a 6 12M horizon  we expect a trade deal to be struck and the global macroeconomic backdrop to strengthen  which we in turn we expect to send EUR DKK back below the central rate to 7 4590 in 6M and 7 4550 in 12M 
EUR USD  The market is looking for more than promises from the ECB before selling the euro from an already short position despite weak PMIs and deteriorating inflation expectations  The Fed is not much easier to read but the pricing of Fed cuts has lent some support to EUR USD  We forecast EUR USD at 1 12 in 1M and 1 13 in 3M  as we look for a status quo in the current weak economic environment  In 6M and 12M we stick to our forecasts of 1 15 and 1 17 as the China led recovery  along with a US China trade deal  should lend support to EUR USD

The US China trade war continues to be the most important driver in financial markets  However  in the short term  we may not get much new information as no new measures are likely to be announced from either side  The next thing to look out for would be comments about a new round of talks or a potential phone call between Xi and Trump  It could initially be seen as positive  However  we would caution that the two sides seem quite far from each other on some key elements and we could end up in a war of attrition where it takes financial stress for the two sides to find a compromise

Selected market news 
Yesterday  US April retail sales and industrial production figures missed expectations and point to a somewhat soft start to Q2  Across the Atlantic  German GDP growth rebounded to 0 4  q q in Q1  after narrowly avoiding a recession in H2 18  Domestic demand was again the main growth driver  but part of the recovery in growth rates also reflects the unwinding of H2 18 temporary factors  car sector bottlenecks and low Rhine water levels   While it is encouraging that the domestic side of the economy continues to underpin the growth momentum  the near term outlook for the German economy remains muted amid gloomy PMI readings  declining factory orders and an escalating trade war between two of Germany s most important export markets 
Added to that  the threat of US car tariffs   with the deadline for Trump s decision coming up on Saturday   is lingering in the background  However  news headlines yesterday suggested that Trump might opt to delay the tariffs by up to six months  as long as negotiations for a trade deal with the EU and Japan are ongoing  see  here   However  the executive order has not yet been officially signed by President Trump and even then uncertainty would just be delayed rather than resolved 
Risk sentiment generally remained under pressure as markets grapple with the implications of the intensifying Sino American trade war  with Trump s latest decision to effectively ban Huawei from selling technology into the American market further deepening the rift  Although shares in US and European automakers cheered the delayed car tariffs  Asian stocks remain in the red this morning and S P 500 futures point to a lower opening  Yesterday  10Y Bund yields fell to their lowest level since the autumn of 2016  but pared gains later in the day as news hit about Trump s decision to delay car tariffs

Fixed income markets
The risk off sentiment continues to dominate the global bond markets with Bunds and Treasuries outperforming in a bullish curve flattener and a widening of the Bund spread  Furthermore  there is still pressure on Italy  where it is becoming more like a credit  event  as the Italian government yield curve is subject to a bearish flattening  although we are not seeing a widening between high coupon and the low coupon bonds yet 
There are few important economic key numbers  Hence  the market will continue to be dominated by trade related headlines  France is coming to the market today with taps in the 3Y and 6Y nominal bonds and linkers in the 4Y  10Y and 17Y segments 
FX markets
The SEK has suffered lately at the hands of a soft Riksbank and seeing as the accommodative stance is here to stay for a while  there is no turnaround for the SEK in sight  Our short term models do  however  indicate that EUR SEK is somewhat overbought  and thus there is scope for some SEK support  albeit limited  in the short run 
Further  the market has already priced out almost all probability of a rate hike this year  which might alleviate some of the pressure on the SEK for now  However  we believe there is a clear risk that Swedish growth and inflation will undershoot the Riksbank s forecasts further out on the horizon  and that monetary policy will have to remain accommodative for the foreseeable future  Therefore  on balance  we raise our 1M forecast to 10 70  3M  NYSE MMM  to 10 80  6M to 10 90 and 12M to 11 00  For further details  see May s FX forecast update  The market continued to price Fed cuts yesterday  but despite the big move in US rates  EUR USD was largely untouched  Today and in the coming days  leading Fed members are set to speak and will likely have to answer to the recent development in markets  We still expect EUR USD to trade around 1 12 1 13 in 1 3M

194193,415709,MMM,3M Company  Finally  A Great Dividend Growth Company Becoming A Good Investment ,opinion,"Introduction
I find it serendipitous that after just completing a 19 part series on how highly valued the general market is  I get the pause that refreshes  Now please don t read more into my words than are being offered  I still believe that the market at large is fully valued  Consequently  finding great companies at great values is still rare and hard to do  However  after Monday s swoon  we are finally  at least I am  starting to see some value coming into focus on some of my favorite companies  Therefore  I can finally feature some of my favorite companies that have become good value choices 
3M Company  NYSE MMM  is a case in point  There are a lot of valid reasons to like 3M  therefore  it s no surprise that many dividend growth investors do  Although I am a long term fan of the business  as a value investor  I have not been a fan of the stock for more than 2   years  However  that changed as of yesterday  Today  I consider 3M fairly valued but not necessarily cheap   at least yet  Stated more directly  I consider 3M a sound investment today based on quality and valuation 
This leads me to a brief discussion on what my personal experience suggests is a common misconception about quality stocks at attractive valuations  Just because a company becomes fairly  valued does not simultaneously suggest that it is also a great investment  It may now be sound and prudent  but still not be capable of generating exceptionally high rates of return  This is how I currently see 3M Company  Because it has moved into fair valuation territory  I have added it to my buy watch list  However  I am still not quite ready to lay my money down  but I am close  Therefore  I will be watching it carefully looking for an entry point that I believe would make it both a good company and a good investment 
Investment Thesis  Short and Long Term Perspective 
I never invest in any stock without first calculating a specific and precise forecast of what future returns I might expect  In other words  I never buy a stock simply hoping that it will go up  or in hopes that it might raise its dividend over time  Instead  I attempt to assemble as much relevant information as I can that will support a thesis for growth and or sustainability  Furthermore  I utilize this information to run my expected future return numbers out to their most logical conclusion 
Additionally  I go through this exercise from a best  worst and most likely expectation  Future returns can never be precisely calculated  However  rational forecasts supported by data can provide a reasonable level of expectations that are highly likely to unfold within an acceptable range or level  So  this might beg the question  how do I do that  or what s the process  The central idea is to simply run your growth expectations out to their logical conclusions and apply rational valuation methodologies to the numbers  In the FAST Graphs analyze out loud video later in this article  I will cover this process extensively 
Moreover  I will not rely on one single metric in order to attempt to make my determination of what my future returns might be  Instead  I will look at 3M utilizing numerous earnings and cash flow metrics to include EV EBITDA  Finally  the critical point I m attempting to illustrate is that I am not offering an opinion on 3M  Instead  I am analyzing factual data that enables me to offer real world calculations based on fundamentals and sound principles of valuation  Consequently  this allows me to keep my emotions out of the equation and think analytically instead 
About 3M Company
The following overview and description of 3M is provided courtesy of the Wall Street Journal 

 Description 3M Co

The company was founded by Henry S  Bryan  Hermon W  Cable  John Dwan  William A  McGonagle and J  Danley Budd in 1902 and is headquartered in St  Paul  MN  

3M s business playbook is reasonably well diversified across all their business segments  The following slide taken from 3M s website illustrates the relative contributions that each of their operating segments contribute to the company s growth and success 

According to MorningStar  3M is a wide moat company that they refer to as a GDP  plus business  The following quote illustrates 3M s commitment to future growth 

 In 3M s case  the  plus  is a testament to the value additive nature of the company s products  churned out by its virtually inimitable research and development platform  Unlike many diversified industrials companies  3M has committed to leveraging innovation across its disparate businesses  making it worth more than the sum of its parts  This commitment manifests itself in the apportionment of just under 6  of net sales to R D  which we expect to increase toward 6  by 2023  We forecast the firm will earn just under  9 in gross profit for every dollar spent on R D  Our forecast is relatively in line with recent experience  which historically has been significantly greater than other highly innovative firms  

To summarize  MorningStar considers 3M to be one of the most innovative diversified industrial firms in the world  In addition to committing a significant portion of sales to R D  the company holds over 112 000 global patents  9 000 awarded since 2001  and offer over 55 000 products that touch virtually every industry  Additionally  MorningStar believes that 3M s strong brands in its manufacturing scale allow it to be a low cost producer thereby enhancing their profitability 
Nevertheless  as indicated in their 1st quarter 2019 earnings call  3M has admitted to a disappointing start to the year  However  they are also suggesting they will be taking aggressive action to get back on track  The following Q1 2019 summary slide indicates the current weakness in 3M s businesses  Of course  the real question will be if this is a temporary phenomenon or something more permanent in nature 

3M also provided disappointing guidance for 2019  As I previously discussed  3M was a great company that was significantly overvalued throughout 2017 and fully valued for most of 2018  On May 31  2018 I penned an article titled  3M Company  It Didn t Take A Crystal Ball to See That It Was Overvalued   Therefore  the company s high valuation made it vulnerable to the bad news which includes negative earnings growth for 2019  Furthermore  as I will discuss later in the video  because I do not consider 3M s valuation attractive enough  I am not supportive of the company s share repurchase plans suggested under the capital allocation portion of the following slide 

Later in the FAST Graph analyze out loud video I will illustrate both near term valuation models and their impact on returns as well as running calculations on 3M s long term return potential based on its current valuation levels 
3M FAST Graph Analyze Out Loud Video  Fundamental Analysis By The Numbers
Before I conduct a comprehensive research and due diligence process on a company  I first run it through various fundamental metrics in order to determine if it s research worthy  For a company to be research worthy  it needs to be available at a reasonable valuation based on multiples of important fundamentals such as cash flows and earnings  If it s not  I am not going to waste my time and energy researching it further no matter how much I like the business  Valuation matters and it matters a lot 
However  I do not rely on any single metric to make that determination  Instead  I attempt to evaluate all the valuation methodologies at my disposal  In the following video  I will be running 3M through the valuation model paces utilizing various earnings and cash flow metrics  Since 3M is a Dividend Aristocrat I will also be looking for dividend sustainability and safety in addition to valuation  Finally  I am analyzing the data past  present and future in order to make the determinations described above  Simply stated  I am attempting to identify and evaluate real world historical multiples and then make rational forecasts based on the conclusions drawn from my analysis  Frankly  I believe the meat of this article is in the following video  Therefore  I suggest and ask that you please take advantage of the insights it provides 


Summary and Conclusions
The bottom line is that 3M has recently become a prudent and sound investment based on the principles of valuation and considering the extreme quality of this Dividend Aristocrat  Regarding whether  or not  it has simultaneously become an excellent investment requires judgment on the investor s part  If you assume that Mr  Market will soon apply a quality premium valuation based on operating earnings  as it historically has  then 3M would meet the definition of an attractive blue chip dividend growth stock  On the other hand  if you believe that a true reversion to the mean will be more permanent  then 3M would only produce below average total returns going forward 
Additionally  there is the question of your investment objectives  If you re investing for current dividend income  then 3M would make sense at current levels and yields  Furthermore  if you re investing for future dividend growth  3M would also make sense on that basis  But as stated above  above average total return would be more of a challenge 
Moreover  if you are an active trader  you should be concerned about 3M s current operating weakness  On the other hand  if you are a long term oriented investor  you might take solace in the company s long legacy of quality and performance  and even be willing to accept some additional short term pain if it were to occur 
In the final analysis  3M is an extraordinarily high quality blue chip dividend growth stock  In addition to paying an uninterrupted dividend for more than 100 years  3M has increased its dividend for more than 60 consecutive years  Furthermore  based on operating cash flow and free cash flow coverage of the dividend  it seems rational to assume that the dividend is both sustainable and safe  In closing  and as always  caveat emptor

194194,415710,MMM,Reading The Markets Sweden   17 May 2019 ,opinion,"SEK  small but business cycle dependent impact on inflation
Inflation dynamics   what are the risks 
Riksbank expectations have been scaled back too much and upward pressure on 3M  NYSE MMM  STIBOR  pay the 1Y SEK swap
KIX forecast scrutinised

SEK  small but business cycle dependent impact on inflation
It is very hard to determine the impact from the SEK on consumer import prices    30  of CPIF   We can see that import price inflation  with a lag  occasionally co varies nicely with the 12 month change in the KIX index  However  that relationship breaks down from time to time  for instance in connection with the financial crisis in 2008 2009 and the Euro crisis in 2011 2012  In the chart below it is obvious that FX movements become secondary and it is the state of the business cycle that is the prime determinant  here in the form of consumer spending growth  of import price developments 

We have estimated a simple regression model of CPIF import prices on 12 month change in KIX  lagged 9 months  and the 12 month change in the consumption indicator  lagged 1 month   The result is not very impressive  R2   0 13  i e  it is not even possible to talk about our variables as explaining movements in import prices  The impact from the SEK is 0 06  beta coefficient  in line with what we estimated before  a 10  weakening lifts import inflation by a mere 0 6pp  which is 30  of CPIF and hence the final impact is only 0 2pp higher CPIF inflation  Hardly an efficient transmission mechanism 


The regression shows that R2 on average is a moderate 60   but under stable business cycle conditions it rises to 80 90   which is more than OK  However  it is also clear that the impact varies sharply and is even negative during a large part of the time  This may appear unreasonable  but is it really  Before moving on to that we can just conclude that the coefficients for consumption growth co vary negatively with the intercept  suggesting they should perhaps be seen as one factor altogether 
A simpler way to show this is in the chart below where we look at developments from 2010 and onwards  There appears to be a tendency that as long as consumption growth outpaces a certain  threshold level   say 1 5  y y  the SEK has a positive and rising impact  say  maximum 0 2 and on average perhaps half of that  on import inflation  However  as consumption growth drops below this level  the impact becomes negative instead  It is not entirely unreasonable when you think about it  It may be that retailers have bigger problems to handle when the business cycle and consumption growth slow than to compensate for a weaker SEK  In our estimate this turns up as a negative coefficient value during these periods 

Summing up  our study led to the following conclusions  should not be over interpreted    1  The impact from the SEK on import prices depends on the state of the business cycle   2  In good times when consumption grows more than say 1 5  y y  the impact from a weaker SEK is positive and in the 0 05 0 2 range 
 3  When the business cycle deteriorates and consumption growth falls below 1 5   a weaker SEK does not raise import inflation 
It means that the maximum impact from the SEK in good times can be 10   weaker   0 2   30  weight   0 6 percentage points on CPIF but only temporary  On average  in good times  the impact is half of that  Currently  with consumption growth below the threshold at 1  y y  we do not expect the weaker SEK to show up in inflation 
Inflation dynamics   what are the risks 
As mentioned above  the consumption indicator is currently running below the threshold level  1 5   under which consumer prices typically do not respond to a weaker SEK  Nevertheless  considering that the SEK has weakened during quite a long period  there may be reasons to identify risks in our forecasts over the next few months  We do that by looking at current inflation dynamics for six important categories in the CPI basket 

The table above shows the latest y y rates  April  and accumulated m m changes January  April  YTD  for the last three years  the latter to give a view over the latest inflation dynamics 
It can be observed that import price inflation  the weak SEK notwithstanding  runs considerably lower than domestic price inflation  in a sense a positive thing from a Riksbank perspective   Regarding import price inflation  it is worth noting that inflation dynamics do not really suggest that it is starting to build up  YTD price changes this year   0 44   do not deviate in any meaningful way with YTD 2018   0 48    This seems to be in line with the econometric results discussed earlier 
Turning to the six individual categories we start with two items that both are  to a varying degree  exposed to imports   food and clothing 

The left hand chart shows domestic supply prices   a combination of imported and domestically produced goods   for food and clothing  Both have risen considerably reflecting a weaker SEK  Food products have risen substantially more though  and we suspect this is due to lagging effects from last year s drought  At the CPI level though  the curves behave differently  Higher producer prices have been passed on to consumers as far as food is concerned but not clothing  Also observe that when producer prices for clothing surged in 2015 this was passed on to the consumer eventually  In line with what we discussed above  it might be that consumer spending was much stronger in 2015 2016 


One could argue that we have seen most of the effects on food prices from last year s drought by now  Also we now approach the season when a larger proportion of food supply is produced domestically  fruit and vegetables   i e  less of an impact from the SEK  Still  we have assumed that total price increases through August will exceed last year s numbers by half a percentage point  bringing food price inflation to around 3   close to the peak earlier this year   We see that as a reasonable  safety margin  
Judging by our econometric study  retailers in clothing will have a hard time raising prices  Nevertheless we have assumed some  catch up  in the months ahead  Note that we are now approaching a season when clothing prices due to sales are going down  Last year prices were reduced by in total 5 6  in May August  This time around we look for smaller discounts of 2   pushing up the y y rate from  1 5  to 2 1  by the end of the period  So it is in our view not in food or clothing  or recreation  where we primarily see risk of upside surprises in our forecast  Instead  it might be that our forecast is somewhat too modest for household goods  cars and restaurants  maybe primarily the first two since restaurants are only indirectly affected by the exchange rate  via food prices   Then again  food  clothing and recreation represent a larger share of the CPIF than the other three  so net net it appears that our forecast includes sufficient safety margins for additional SEK effects  had it not been for one thing  which we have not mentioned so far   gasoline prices 

We typically make an active forecast for the current month  for succeeding months we only include a seasonal pattern but no trend  Undoubtedly  the combined effect of higher oil prices and higher USD SEK has pushed Swedish gasoline prices to an all time high and admittedly we do not see a strong reason to expect an imminent turnaround  So  it might very well be that we will have to hike our projection for gasoline in coming months 
The Riksbank  taken by surprise by low inflation  and soft messages from ECB et al   lowered the near term inflation forecast and pushed the next rate hike further out at the April meeting  In the coming period up to August we think the risks are more balanced and possibly slightly skewed to the upside depending on oil gasoline prices  Put differently  the case is less compelling for another downward revision of inflation and the repo rate path at the next policy meeting in July 
In the meantime  market pricing has almost taken out another rate hike this year  only 2bp left in Riba   To go further down  effectively starting to price in cuts is not warranted  we think  Instead it might be time for a short term correction  Also we are approaching a period where we expect to see some renewed upward pressure on STIBOR fixing  That is why we are discussing paying a 1Y SEK swap below 
Having said that  this is not a trade to hold  for ever   Later this year the story goes in reverse  The Riksbank s inflation forecast from September assumes a big jump over just a few months  but we do not really see where it would come from  That is a story for later this year  however 
Riksbank expectations have been scaled back too much and upward pressure on 3M STIBOR  pay the 1Y SEK swap Since the April meeting  Riksbank expectations have been scaled back significantly 
Admittedly  the combination of postponed rate hikes and continued bond reinvestments was  to us at least  surprisingly dovish  However  the Riksbank minutes revealed that the board s fundamental assessment of the Swedish economy and inflation outlook had not really changed that much  For instance  Governor Ingves states that  for 2020 2021  growth of just under 2  is expected  which is about the same assessment as in February  These are relatively healthy figures  especially bearing in mind the recent modest growth in the euro area   The same old battle lines between board members are still in place  with Governor Ingves in our view still holding the swing vote 
We still believe that the most recent inflation forecast is challenging during the fall to say the least  as we have pointed out previously  On top of that  the Riksbank probably cannot afford a further weakening of the labour market  Ironically  the board member that highlighted that unemployment has stopped falling was arch hawk Henry Ohlsson  He was  however  quick to dismiss it for various reasons  structural problems  job seekers supposedly having become pickier   Nevertheless  if unemployment starts grinding slightly higher  it may become increasingly hard for the Riksbank to ignore 
However  expectations of a move in late 2019 or early 2020 have been scaled back dramatically  Only around 2bp are priced for the whole of 2019  After that  Riksbank pricing converges relatively quickly with ECB pricing  as has been the case for quite some time  This can be seen in the chart below where we have taken each IMM contract for 3M STIBOR and 3M EURIBOR and subtracted the front contract  From this  we note that the SEK curve flattens out against the EUR curve from the Sep20 IMM contract and onwards 

Over time  the market has probably become more cynical about forecasted Riksbank hikes  However  with such a tilted market pricing  we think it would not take much for pricing to move  Even though we think our CPI forecast already takes into account the SEK depreciation  the pass through from the currency to inflation is a source of uncertainty  A global shift in risk sentiment would probably affect the Swedish short end as well 
On top of that  we remain convinced that the 3M fixing is likely to move higher in the short term  We reason that the proposed LCR requirements in the SEK have likely already been implemented by Swedish banks  which would explain the increased volatility in 2019  and upcoming bond maturities in June 2019  five bonds with an outstanding volume of SEK88bn as of end April  will put pressure on LCR ratios in SEK  We expect that to play out either through more demand for HQLA in the form of Riksbank certificates  which would drain away excess liquidity  or through increased demand for SEK funding through the FX swap market  In practice  it may be difficult to separate the two channels  We note that the most recent auction for Riksbank certificates  on 14 May  was oversubscribed  leaving little excess liquidity in the system  If that continues  the 3M fixing should at least be able to surpass the levels we saw in March around the maturity of SGB1052  0 023   

As can be seen in the chart below  the 1Y swap tends to track the 3M fixing  as the whole FRA Riba strip tends to be affected by the spot fixing spread  In our view  the downside in the trade primarily relates to the fixing spread component of the swap  It would be quite odd to start pricing in rate cuts on a central bank still firmly set on hiking  unless there is a significant deterioration in the global growth outlook 

As an alternative to the 1Y swap  it might look compelling to steepen the SEK curve against EUR in a FRA box  as current pricing puts these slightly above zero  In the chart below we have used the 10th versus the 7th IMM contract  which is the flattest SEK FRA box versus 3M EURIBOR  Historically  however  this FRA box correlates well to the spread in policy rates and at times  even when the Riksbank repo rate was above the ECB refi rate  it has traded well into negative territory  So the current level just above zero is not really standing out in our view 


Thus  we find the risk reward in paying the 1Y swap more attractive overall and recommend paying the swap outright  We set the P L levels to  4 5  7bp  start   2 5bp  
KIX forecast scrutinized
In the latest Reading the Markets Sweden we highlighted a number of fundamental factors  which in our view have been a headwind for the SEK  not only the past few years but over a longer time period  the trade balance in goods has turned negative and the current account surplus is basically gone  productivity growth has deteriorated and terms of trade  at least during the first decade after the turn of the millennium  trended lower  Circumstances that in different ways suggest that Sweden has become less competitive as a nation  despite the substantial depreciation of the SEK 
One could turn it around and say that worsened competitiveness has in fact  beside monetary policy divergence  contributed to and justified at least part of the SEK weakness  Today we learnt that the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise  Svenskt N ringsliv  made a similar analysis in which it mentions loss of competitiveness  Of course  this is a way of positioning ahead of the wage negotiation round  the conclusion is that wage growth must be held back and wage dispersion increase  Hardly what the Riksbank needs to hear  it still has a too optimistic wage forecast  in our view   How to solve this conflict of goals  Continued SEK depreciation year after year 
We have for a long time argued that the pass through from the exchange rate to growth and inflation has weakened   that the currency weapon is more blunt than it used to be  net exports have not helped GDP growth  import price inflation hovers around zero and the second round effects onto consumers are muted due to globalisation  digitalisation  fierce price competition and global supply chains  Judging by recent comments from the Riksbank  it seems to have reached a similar conclusion 
Instead  it will be very interesting to see what the so called  rethink  of the exchange rate analysis will bring  probably in an upcoming Monetary Policy Report   The reason why it sees a need to rethink is obviously related to the systematic forecast errors over the years  chart below   A not too bold a guess is that the analysis among other things will focus on the factors mentioned above  The outcome could be a flatter KIX path  less SEK appreciation   How it deals with this will be important for how it is received in the markets  On the one hand it could be interpreted as bearish for the SEK   even the Riksbank has thrown in the towel when it comes to SEK appreciation   On the other hand it could be SEK bullish   a weaker SEK in the forecast mechanically a higher inflation path earlier rate hikes    not ruled out  though we would not bet on it 
Hence  the SEK is weaker than the Riksbank forecast  Again  Our short term interest rate models indicate that EUR SEK is somewhat overbought  left hand chart   At the same time rate hikes for 2019 are all but priced out  only 2bp left  One could make the case that the upside in EUR SEK stemming from interest rate momentum is more limited now  carry remains a SEK headwind  though  and that there is a chance of a correction   risk reward may actually favour a tactical short rather than a tactical long in EUR SEK  A caveat  the GDP data in two weeks is likely to be a disappointment for the Riksbank  Our new FX forecasts suggest  in line with the rate models  some downside potential in EUR SEK near term  1M 10 70   Later on EUR SEK will likely move higher toward 11 00  12M   not least because the Riksbank will be challenged on its inflation forecast and make it hard to raise the repo rate this year and also next ",2019-05-17,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reading-the-markets-sweden--17-may-2019-200422386,200422386

Today s main event is the FOMC meeting tonight  however  the Fed has stated that it is on hold  so we expect it to keep the target range unchanged at 2 25 2 50  
Moreover  we get the ISM manufacturing in the US and UK  We still expect US manufacturing to have peaked and to move slightly lower before stabilising  still above 50   Based on a weighted average of the regional PMIs  we expect numbers to come in at 55 0  currently 55 3

Selected market news 
The price of Brent crude rose briefly above USD73 bbl on the news of a military coup attempt in Venezuela led by opposition leader Guaido and backed by the US  Later  API was said to report that US crude stocks rose 6 8mb last week  which helped reverse sentiment in the oil market  The oil market is clearly concerned about the ramifications for Venezuela s oil production and exports of a further deterioration of the situation  Venezuela is currently producing 800 900k b   down about 50  from a year ago 
South Korea s exports dropped 2  y y in April  which is less than the 8 2  y y drop seen in March and also less than the consensus expectation of a 5 9  y y decline  In the bigger picture  this development gives some rise to the notion that Chinese economic activity is slowly picking up further supporting Chinese external demand 
Euro area Q1 GDP growth rose to 0 4  from 0 2  in Q4  Recent improvement in industrial production data has already signalled a pick up compared to the gloomy H2 18 growth momentum in contrast to PMIs  although the overall growth pace remains below potential 
German HICP was 2 1  in April  The so called  Easter effect  took service price inflation from 1 2  in March to 2 1  in April  The strong German inflation outcome supports our call for a marked pick up in euro area core and headline inflation on Friday  1 2  and 1 8   respectively  
The effective Fed funds rate rose to 2 45  on Monday  reported yesterday   which now leaves it only 5bp below the upper bound in the Fed s 2 25  2 50  target range  We do not expect the Fed to make a 5bp  adjustment cut  of its interest on excess reserves  IOER  at the meeting tonight  but the Fed will likely discuss what to do at upcoming meetings if the upward pressure on Fed funds does not ease over the coming months 
Fixed income markets
Yesterday  European bond markets came under pressure and 10Y Bund yields rose to 4bp before the US open pushed yields back down  The sell off was fuelled by German regional inflation data that surprised to the upside and the Euro zone growth data for Q1 that rose to 0 4  q q from 0 2  q q in Q4  which is actually above the latest ECB projections  0 2  q q for Q1   German CPI was confirmed at 2 1  later in the day and points to a jump in both core  1 2   and headline CPI  1 8   for the Euro zone when the numbers are published on Friday 
US treasury yields were initially pushed higher by Bunds but edged down again as Chicago PMI surprised on the downside and as US equity markets came under pressure  In Europe  most fixed income markets are closed today due to labour day  Note that the Danish market is open  Yesterday  we published a research report looking at prepayment data ahead of the July payment data in the callable market  We argue that the  high coupon  callable bonds  3 5   3  and 2 5   are too expensive 
FX markets
In the G10 space  yesterday s higher than expected German inflation data contributed to lifting EUR USD above 1 12  Today  all eyes will be on the FOMC  where we expect little news even if there is a non negligible risk of a  technical IOER cut  amid rising pressures on the effective Fed funds rate from tightening USD liquidity  see here  Overall  we still see EUR USD as a range play 
In the Scandies  the SEK continues to trade heavy  which alongside oil support from the Venezuelan turmoil and a somewhat weaker USD has contributed to returning NOK SEK to the 1 10 threshold  We think it s a matter of time before the cross more sustainably breaks through this level 
PLN gained yesterday after Polish CPI inflation surged to 2 2  in April from 1 7  in March  also beating market expectations of a modest pick up to 1 8   The strong increase is probably driven by higher energy prices but also underlying inflation pressures  given the still strong economic growth in the Polish economy  Yesterday s strong inflation number will bring the hawks out in the Polish central bank  which should support the PLN given the current dovish market pricing  We have EUR PLN at 4 27 on 1M and 4 25 on 3M  NYSE MMM

Recent Earnings
On April 25  the company reported EPS of  2 23  which was  0 27 below the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a negative earnings surprise of 10 8    That alone is bad  but it gets worse 
Revenues were  7 86B and below the  8 02B estimate  but of the consensus that made up that estimate  not a single analyst could call that revenue number a strong one   It was below all of the estimates 
The company also moved to cut 2000 jobs as a result of a slower than expected 2019   Related to that move  the company will post a pre tax charge of  150M or  0 20 per share

Selected market news 
Most of Europe was off yesterday due to Labour Day and therefore markets centred on key events taking place in the US 
As expected  the Fed left the target range unchanged at 2 25 2 50  and overall there were no major changes to the policy signals  Powell said the IOER rate cut was a technical adjustment and not an expression of an easing bias  see more below   On one hand  the Fed said economic growth and the labour market remain strong but on the other  hand inflation is running below the 2  target
The Fed caught the market by surprise by cutting the Interest on Excess Reserves  IOER  by 5bp to 2 35  from 2 45  but Powell stressed during the press conference that this should not be interpreted as the beginning of an easing cycle  The Effective Fed Funds rate  EFFR  has risen to 2 45  since Easter due to a decline in the supply of bank reserves and was thus only 5bp below the top end of the Fed s target range  The quickest way for the Fed to return the EFFR closer to the mid point is to cut the IOER  There had been speculation in the market that the Fed could make this move at the June meeting  but the market was not priced for a cut to come at the May meeting   the May Fed Funds futures have traded around 2 42  
ISM manufacturing dropped sharply to 52 8 from 55 3 in April  All the important subcomponents fell as well  employment  new orders  etc    The ISM has been quite high for some time and  as we have highlighted  the US manufacturing sector is not immune to what happens overseas  So it is natural that the ISM had to go down eventually  although the decline is bigger than we had anticipated  That said  remember the service sector is more important for the overall economy 
Scandi markets
Norway  Today brings the manufacturing PMI for April  Historically  the PMI has tended to surprise to the upside the month before Easter  and disappoint slightly in the month of Easter  Hence  we expect the PMI to fall slightly to 56 0  but this still points to further strong growth in Norwegian manufacturing despite the global slowdown and bears witness to persisting differences in relative industrial production 
Fixed income markets
Initially  markets interpreted the IOER rate cut and the Fed s statement as a dovish twist but US yields ended higher and the curve 2s10s flattened again after Powell s comment that the Fed is firmly on hold and that current inflation weakness is  transient  
France will auction EUR7 0   8 5bn in the 10Y  15Y and 20Y bonds at today s monthly long end auctions  The French Tresor has opted for a slightly lower amount and  shorter  maturities this time  It could reflect concerns that some investors might be off an extra day after Labour Day and that Japanese investors might be absent due to Golden Week  The recent April steepening of the 10s30s curve in France during April might also have moved issuance towards lower maturities  We remain negative on France relative to Spain  Ireland  Belgium and Portugal as we are now past the big April redemptions and as bond supply might be revised higher as Macron adds to fiscal spending 
FX markets
EUR USD initially rose above 1 1260 on the statement from the FOMC meeting and the news that the Fed had cut the IOER by 5bp  Helping EUR USD higher was an initial drop in the 2Y USD OIS swap rate of 5bp  However  once Fed Chair Powell got going on the press conference  the initial move more than reversed  sending EUR USD back down to 1 1200  The market took its cue from Powell s comments that the Fed expects the inflation shortfall to be transitory and that the next move on rates could be either up or down  We maintain our view that EUR USD is headed back towards 1 13 in 3M  NYSE MMM    a move that would have less to do with Fed policy and more to do with further improvement in the Chinese economy including a US China trade deal

On the one hand  there is a decent chance that clarification could arrive already by the end of this week  i e  Trump s tactics work and a deal is finalised  This would kill volatility again but fuel a jump back up in USD JPY  On the other hand  in case of further escalation  i e  the US is set to play hardball for longer  the experience from 2018 is that risk off on cycles driven by trade war developments tend to last 1 2M  Chart 1   This would add to still low  in a historical context  volatility and weigh further on USD JPY 
Tactically  buy a 3M USD JPY straddle 
While highly uncertain where the US and China talks will go this week  we are most certainly in for a move in USD JPY away from 110  Further  volatility remains in  cheap  territory even after the latest uptick  Table 1  and will likely rise in case of escalation  As we see both the case for a bigger spot move and an asymmetric case for volatility from here  we recommend buying a 3M ATMF USD JPY straddle centred around 109 99  spot ref 110 80  in the Danske FX Trading Portfolio  This costs an indicative 275 pips  i e  break even levels at maturity are 107 24 and 112 74  If trade tensions escalate  the trade is set to benefit both from the spot and volatility side as the two tend to move inversely  Chart 2   Key risks are that USD JPY settles around 110 and or volatility drifts lower again 
A deal  will come   USD JPY remains a strategic buy on dips 
Near term escalation risks aside  we still look for an extensive US China trade agreement to arrive during Q2  For FX markets  this means that the palmy days for the safe havens could be over shortly   but it is a close call whether it be this week or later this quarter  When a trade deal lands  JPY weakness is likely on the back of  i  risk sentiment improving and  ii  Japan likely being next on Trump s tariff list  see also  Global Research   What a US China trade deal will bring to the markets   8 April 2019  for an overview of what to expect from and market implications of an eventual trade deal  We remain long AUD  NZD  CAD vs JPY  spot  in the Danske FX Trading Portfolio in anticipation of a wide ranging deal  see Table 2  and still see potential in this  even if it would suffer from prolonged trade uncertainty

194208,415724,MMM,Golf  Pressure on to strike while iron hot with new major schedule,news,By Andrew Both  Reuters    Hitting a hot streak at the right time will be the goal of golf s top male professionals this year as a new calendar crams the major championships into a super busy four month stretch  The PGA Championship has switched from its traditional mid August timeslot to mid May  which will force players to focus like never before on trying to peak between April and July  Starting with the April 11 14 Masters at Augusta National  the majors will come thick and fast  with the PGA Championship at Bethpage from May 16 19  the U S  Open at Pebble Beach from June 13 16  and the British Open at Royal Portrush from July 18 21  That s four majors in 15 weeks  which could be bad news for players who have a form dip at the wrong time  but conversely will allow those in good form to strike while the iron is hot  so to speak  The major venues will certainly have Tiger Woods salivating as he tries to end his decade long major drought streak   He has won four times at Augusta National  once at Bethpage  2002 U S  Open  and once in a major at Pebble Beach  2000 U S  Open   where he produced the greatest performance of his career  a record 15 stroke triumph  He has never triumphed at Royal Portrush  but then again neither has any other active player  because the classic Northern Ireland links has not hosted the British Open since 1951  While Woods  who turned 43 on Sunday  usually guards his schedule as closely as a state secret  you can bet the house on where he will play once the majors get started  His successful 2017 spinal fusion allowed him to play a full schedule in 2018  but he says he overdid it at times and will be sure to pace himself better in 2019  This means his regular PGA Tour appearances during the majors stretch could be limited to the May 2 5  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Championship in Charlotte  North Carolina  and the May 30 June 2 Memorial tournament in Dublin  Ohio  These events both fall two weeks before a major  which is the way Woods has traditionally prepared for the big ones  A new tournament in Minnesota  the 3M  NYSE MMM  Open  might also benefit from its slot in the schedule two weeks before the British Open  Woods has the all time PGA Tour record in his sights in 2019  while it will also be a most important year if he ever hopes to catch Jack Nicklaus  record of 18 major championships  With 80 PGA Tour victories  Woods is two short of Sam Snead s mark  while his 14 major titles leave him four short of the Nicklaus mark  Golf has no shortage of good young players  many already proven winners at the highest level but still with much to prove  Rory McIlroy has four major titles  but has not won one since 2014  Questions are being asked about whether his wedge game is consistent enough  Three times major winner Jordan Spieth will try to bounce back after losing his putting mojo in 2018  while Dustin Johnson at age 34 needs to get cracking if he wants to add to his solitary major title before Father Time catches up with him  Super talented Tony Finau  until now best known for turning an ankle while celebrating a hole in one at the Masters par three competition last year  seems poised to become the next genuine star  He did not win in 2018  but came close several times and once the floodgates open there might be no stopping him   And keep an eye on Cameron Champ  probably the longest hitter ever to play the PGA Tour  The 23 year old set an all time distance record with an average drive of 343 yards in the secondary Web Com Tour last year  10 yards longer than anyone else  Champ is anything but a one trick pony  however  already a winner this new 2018 19 season at the Sanderson Farms Championship and quickly following up with two more top 10s  Another worth watching is 20 year old Chilean Joaquin Niemann  a former world number one who has made a solid start to his professional career  In the women s game  the female equivalent of the Ryder Cup will take place at Gleneagles in Scotland in September  when the United States and Europe face off in the Solheim Cup  But unlike men s golf  in which nearly all the top players are European or American  the Solheim Cup will include only two of the world s top 10 players  based on the current rankings  Asian golfers continue to dominate women s golf  with South Korea supplying a never ending conveyor belt of talent  But the world number one ranking belongs to Thai Ariya Jutanugarn  the reigning U S  Women s Open champion  who will start 2019 as the woman to beat  The new year also ushers in the most widespread rules changes in decades  designed to make the game fairer  faster and simpler  At the recreational level  at least  it is more a case of the rules catching up to what many casual players have been doing for years anyway

194215,415731,MMM,Spain Could See Government Without Catalan Separatists ,opinion,"Market movers today
Markets will continue to digest yesterday s Spanish election result  see below  
In the euro area the economic confidence indicator for April is due out and it shall be interesting to see if it also points to a lacklustre start to Q2  in line with the latest PMIs  Loan growth data for March will also be released  which markets will keep an eye on to gauge how favourable the ECB will design its new liquidity operation  TLTRO3  when details are announced in June 
In the US  focus today reverts to the inflation front with the PCE figures for March  The Fed s communication recently has put more weight on the inflation dynamics and therefore it will be interesting to see whether the PCE core rate shows a further decline from 1 8  in February 
In Sweden  we get trade balance figures for March and in Denmark focus is on business confidence data 
Later this week  Q1 GDP data out of the euro area  Chinese PMIs as well as the Fed meeting and US job report will be in focus 
Selected market news
In the Spanish general election yesterday the Socialist Workers  Party  PSOE  emerged  as expected  as the election s winners by gaining 29 per cent of the popular vote  and thus obtaining some 123 seats  out of a total of 350   The result sees the number of PSOE seats increase by 38 on the 2016 elections and most importantly gives the PSOE options to form a government possibly without the need of Catalan separatist parties  whose place in a Spanish government would be highly problematic given the still unresolved Catalan question  and result in a higher probability of a hung parliament  Instead the PSOE s leader and sitting Prime Minister  Pedro S nchez  could be able to form a majority government together with either left wing party Unidas Podemos  whose election result at 14 3   42 seats  was less bad than expected  2016 result  21 1   expected  13    the Basque nationalists and more moderate regional parties  or look across the centre towards Ciudadanos  low probability  or even govern a minority government  The far right nationalist Vox  who is taking a hard stance against Catalan independence  gained 10   24 seats  although mostly at the cost of the centre right PP  16 7   2016 result  33   losing more than half its seats  leaving the Spanish right wing more fragmented than ever  Given the options of the PSOE the election outcome should be marginally positive for markets  In any case Spain has shown some resilience towards political uncertainty as of late and we remain positive on the Spanish economy 
Oil prices plunged on Friday after US president Trump was out saying he had called on OPEC to reduce crude prices  On Thursday  current waivers on Iran sanctions expire and the oil market could suffer a supply shortage if OPEC does not follow Trump s call  This comes on top of last week s increased uncertainty regarding Libyan oil exports following attacks on Tripoli by Libyan opposition  with fighting continuing this weekend 
Scandi markets
Sweden  Among today s Swedish data we particularly want to stress the March trade balance  Over the latest several years  the trade balance has gradually deteriorated and in fact in 2017 2018 Sweden had a deficit in goods trade for the first time in more than two decades  This development has had  at least  two effects  First  net goods exports have been a drag on GDP and secondly  we believe that a shrinking trade surplus has been weighing on the krona  The two first months this year have been better though with relatively robust surpluses  For March we expect a surplus of 4 5bn 
Fixed income markets
Italy maintained its BBB rating and unchanged outlook from S P on Friday  We expect that Italy will rally significantly  since the S P states in its comments that it would require a significant worsening of the Italian budget deficit and growth outlook for the Italian economy or a significant worsening of the funding costs for both the Italian government and the Italian banks  for a possible downgrade  Hence  we expect a positive opening on the Italian government bonds this morning with spreads tightening to core  and semi core EU 
The main event of the week is the FOMC meeting on Wednesday  The consensus view is that the Federal Reserve will remain on hold  and thus the  wording  will be important  On Friday we published our Government Bond Weekly  GBW   Here we take a closer look at France and the possible impact  if Moody s remove its positive outlook  See more here 
FX markets
This week  we ll see a host of events that in part centre on oil supply  but importantly on global liquidity conditions and cyclical demand  In order  watch Chinese PMIs   US ISM  Tuesday   FOMC  Wednesday   US sanctions on Iran   European CPI  Thursday  and non farm payrolls  Friday   To us  a dovish Fed  sideways China PMIs and possibly hints of oil supply increases from Saudi Arabia and others to mitigate impact of Iran sanctions sounds like the right recipe to reboot risk appetite  Put together  this should favour commodity currencies  AUD  NZD  CAD and NOK  vs JPY  It could also pave the way for a rebound in EUR USD towards 1 13 
More specifically on the NOK  EUR NOK moved to the high end of the 9 60s at the end of last week  Primarily two drivers were behind the move  first a dovish Riksbank and secondly the Trump induced oil price drop on Friday  Historically  SEK induced spikes in EUR NOK have been profitable to sell and indeed the near term Norges Bank policy impact of the Riksbank message is marginal  The coming months will be decisive of whether Norges Bank will hike rates in June  our call  and with markets pricing less than 50  probability of this materialising we expect relative rates to turn increasingly supportive of the NOK  see Reading the Markets Norway for more colour here  In terms of oil markets it is trickier amid Iran waiver uncertainty and possible strategic petroleum reserve selling  That said we think Trump s overall influence on oil markets is overstated  see tweet history  and supply story driven oil price volatility has less impact on NOK FX than demand related volatility  In sum  we still expect a stronger NOK and see value in buying USD NOK 3M  NYSE MMM  volatility  which valuation wise seems cheap as we enter decisive months for spot drivers ",2019-04-29,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/spain-could-see-government-without-catalan-separatists-200412139,200412139
194216,415732,MMM,Next Round Of Usd Liquidity Tightening Coming In June ,opinion,"Effective Fed funds was 2 44  on Friday for the sixth straight day on tight USD liquidity  
Next round of further tightening of USD liquidity likely to come in mid June  
We still see value in hedging further out the FX forward curve  i e  out to 6M 1Y  
Over the past two weeks  USD money market conditions have tightened pushing up short term USD rates  The effective Fed funds rate was 2 44   6bp below the Fed s upper target bound  on Friday for a sixth straight day  The main cause of the upward pressure on short term USD rates has been further tightening of USD liquidity  USD liquidity is primarily tightening due to the Fed s quantitative tightening  QT  but in April it was a significant rise in the US Treasury s cash balance that tipped the scale  The ongoing tightening of USD liquidity since Q4 17 when the Fed initiated its QT programme has also pushed up the implied O N USD rate in EUR USD FX forwards 
It is now evident to the market that reserve supply around USD1 600bn and an interest rate on excess reserves  IOER  at 2 40  do not necessarily produce an effective Fed funds rate close to the mid point of the Fed s current 2 25 2 50  target range 
Looking ahead  we see three important events to keep an eye on with respect to USD liquidity   1  From 17 June  when corporate tax payments are due  and until a resuspension of the debt ceiling  USD liquidity is set to tighten around USD100bn from the current level   2  We expect the debt ceiling to be resuspended sometime around the end of Q3  but we stress a high degree of uncertainty about this time   This would give rise to a large fall and subsequent rise in the US Treasury cash balance   3  USD liquidity is set to be around USD300bn tighter when we come to year end compared with the current level  See Chart 1 for our projection of USD liquidity towards year end 
All other things being equal  we should see a further rise in the effective Fed funds rate above the current 2 44  level  which should also push up EUR USD FX forwards  EUR USD FX forwards were not priced for a tightening of USD liquidity in April  The market is likely to be alert ahead of the next round of tightening coming in June  which could push  for example  the 3M  NYSE MMM  EUR USD FX forward higher over coming months via a widening of the 3M EURUSD OIS basis  Note though that the Fed could try to mitigate such a rise by cutting the IOER 5bp  or more  at the 19 June meeting  The circumstances around the resuspension of the debt ceiling likely to take place in September and October are set to lead to a temporary easing of USD money market conditions but this would be only short lived and upward pressure on short term USD rates should resume towards year end 
We stick to our view expressed in  FX Strategy   EUR USD FX forwards  one down  three quarter turns to go   2 April  Hence  we see value for EUR  and DKK denominated investors in hedging USD assets further out the FX forward curve  out to 6M to gain the 12bp Fed cut priced at the September meeting and hedge the planned USD liquidity tightening or out to 1Y to hedge the year end effect  further tightening in USD liquidity and gain from the additional 23bp Fed cuts priced on 1Y

Weighing on U S prices is data from the API last week showing that U S  crude stocks rose by  6 9M barrels  more than expected  while U S commercial crude oil inventories hit an October 2017 high of  460 63M barrels according to the EIA s report yesterday  That was a rise of  1 3M  NYSE MMM  barrels 
Ahead of the U S open  gold prices have edged a tad higher as a dip in equities and weak S  Korean GDP data overnight is raising some red flags about the pace of global economic growth  Nevertheless  a stronger USD is capping gold price gains  Spot gold has rallied  0 2  to   1 277 72 per ounce  while U S gold futures are steady at   1 279 60 an ounce 

3  Central banks continue with dovish surprise on rate outlook
Earlier this morning Sweden s Riksbank tweaked its forward guidance so that the Repo Rate would remain at current level for somewhat longer period of time than was forecasted back in February   the next potential rate hike is near year end or in early 2020  revised from H2 of 2019   The Riksbank also extended its QE program and would buy government bonds for nominal value of SEK45B from July 2019 to December 2020 
In Japan  the Bank of Japan  BoJ  kept its policy steady but clarified its forward guidance to reinforce it will not hike anytime soon  Governor Kuroda in his press conference stated that it was  possible that the time frame under forward guidance could exceed the spring of 2020 thus could keep low rates beyond that time period   He reiterated that a  virtuous economic cycle was in place but consumer prices had remained somewhat weak   and expects CPI to pick up towards the  2  target  gradually but likely would take time  
Elsewhere  German 10 year Bund yields dropped back into negative territory yesterday and are lower this morning at  0 017   U S  10 year Treasury yields also fell yesterday  but are marginally higher ahead of the U S open at  2 523  

4  Loonie falls as BoC sees slower growth
The USD continues to hold onto its recent gains as weak overseas inflation and GDP data support the  buck  
The Canadian dollar  C 1 3517  is weaker  trading at its lowest level outright  since early January  after the BoC held its key interest rate steady yesterday and lowered its growth forecast for this year  signaling that further rate increases are unlikely in the near term  By dropping any reference to future rate hikes  Governor Poloz delivered his most  dovish  signal in two years 
EUR USD   1 1136  is trading softer and is not too far off its July 2017 low print  The recent soft IFO data out of Germany this week is not helping the currency nor are the economic and political concerns in Italy  The ECB s recent economic bulletin also stressed that risks in the Eurozone are  tilted to the downside  
USD JPY   111 79  could not sustain any momentum above the psychological  112 handle despite the BoJ keeping its monetary policy steady and clarifying its forward guidance to reinforce it would not hike anytime soon 
The SEK   9 5601  has come under extreme pressure outright  down  1 46   after the Riksbank put a more dovish spin on its rate path  Riksbank tweaked its forward guidance so that the Repo Rate would remain at current level for longer  EUR SEK is higher by over  1 25  to test above  10 65 level 

5  UK April CBI retailing reported sales 13 vs  0e
Data from the Confederation of British Industry  CBI  this morning showed that retail sales grew for the first time since November 2018 in the year to April 
The survey of retailers  showed that sales volumes rose for the first time in five months  likely supported by the later timing of Easter this year 
49  of retailers said that sales volumes were up in April on a year ago  whilst 36  said they were down  giving a balance of  13   This was broadly in line with expectations   15  
Digging deeper  orders placed on suppliers also grew and are expected to pick up further in the month ahead  with sales volumes also set to see somewhat faster growth 
Note  The readings are an indicator of short term trends in the retail and wholesale sector of the UK economy

194223,415739,MMM,Danske Daily   Riksbanken In Focus As The BoJ Lowers GDP Estimates ,opinion,"Market movers today 
Riksbanken will publish its monetary policy decision following the April meeting  We look for an unchanged rate path and an end to the QE programme  Although not a high conviction call this could see EUR SEK move towards 10 35  see more on page 2  
Also today the Turkish central bank  TCMB  will have its monetary policy meeting and make a decision on policy rates  In line with Bloomberg consensus  we expect the one week repo rate to remain unchanged at 24 00 as inflation deceleration has stopped and the rising oil price risk is seen as a negative factor for both the Turkish economy and the current account balance 
In Norway Q2 manufacturing confidence is released today  see more on page 2  
In Sweden  apart from the Riksbank  we also get NIER s economic tendency survey  see more on page 2  
Selected market news 
Following weaker than expected Australian Q1 CPIs  and a disappointing German Ifo survey  which saw bunds rally 5bp and EURUSD at close to 2y lows  the sights were set on the Bank of Canada s rate decision late in the European session  The market interpreted the BoC s decision as dovish as it firmed its  on hold  stance  policy rate unchanged at 1 75   and markets are now pricing in a 50  probability of rate cuts over the coming 6M  despite the monetary policy report containing several upbeat elements on growth  inflation and capital utilisation  In our view  we would have to see a significant negative global growth shock or a Fed funds target cut for the BoC to cut rates  and thus the market reaction seems overdone  The USDCAD strengthened towards the 1 35 mark  but we still see a stronger CAD going forward on relative rates and higher oil  The decision and preceding events laid the foundation for a rally in US treasuries which saw 10y yields down 5bp 
Staying in the focus of central banks the BoJ kept its QQE with yield curve control unchanged at a meeting ending this morning  It tweaked the forward guidance somewhat though  now saying they  will keep very low interest rates levels for an extended period of time at least through to around spring 2020   Until now there was now specific time frame for how long rates would be kept at low levels  The BoJ cut its GDP forecast for FY2018 ending in March from 0 9  to 0 6   which is no surprise considering what looks like a weak Q1  In addition  FY2019 and 2020 GDP and inflation forecasts have been cut slightly  Particularly interesting is the new inflation outlook  which now includes FY2021  BoJ expects CPI inflation to hit 1 6  by then  lowest t 2 inflation forecast since 2013   That is  the BoJ does not expect to meet its inflation mandate within a two to three year horizon 
Oil could not sustain its recent gains as American crude inventories saw a surprisingly big jump of 5 48 million barrels according the EIA  Also yesterday  according to Bloomberg  US government officials stated that Trump backed the recent attack on Tripoli by the Libyan opposition led by strongman Khalifa Haftar  This could potentially be a long term blow to Libya s growing and stabilising oil exports 
Scandi markets
Norway  Statistics Norway will publish the Q2 manufacturing confidence  This never has any great market impact  but will give us important signals about what is currently the economy s most important growth driver   oil related activity  Despite the global manufacturing slowdown  it seems that activity in Norway is accelerating  which is of course a result of strong growth in oil investment boosting oil related industries  The PMI also picked up in Q1 after softening towards the end of last year  We therefore expect the manufacturing confidence indicator to climb from 9 to 10  which would be the highest for more than eight years and help eliminate much of the uncertainty about the growth outlook for 2019 
Sweden  Today s main event is undoubtedly the Riksbank rate decision  We look for 1  a downward adjustment of the inflation forecast  2  an unchanged rate path and 3  an end to the QE programme  Although inflation has widely undershot the Riksbank s forecasts three months in a row  the communication from board members has remained relatively upbeat  On top of that  recent developments regarding ECB and the FED are clear headwinds for the Riksbank s hiking ambitions  Thus  from an analytical standpoint  the most prudent policy action would probably be to lower the rate path and postponing the next hike somewhat  However  we believe that the board will opt to buy themselves more time  in hope of an inflation pickup  Thus  although not a high conviction call  we end up with a call for an unchanged rate path  Regarding the NIER the indicator dropped sharply last year  to levels just above the neutral 100 level  Confidence in several domestic sectors has dropped below that level i e  in households  consumer   private services and retail trade  while surprisingly construction still remains above  Manufacturing confidence is now in a steep decline  but still remains at very positive levels  This time the overall direction of confidence may be of more importance than normal 
Fixed income markets
The sentiment in the European rates market changed significantly yesterday on the back of the weaker than expected Ifo indicator and a decent Bund auction where the bid to cover was 2 relative to 2 6 in March  Hence  the yield on the 10Y Germany government bond yield was pushed below 0  and the curve flattened  while the Bund spread moved back above 50bp  The spread between the periphery and core EU widened modestly as peripheral markets could not follow the rally in the core EU markets 
FX markets
Today s Riksbank rate decision will set the tone and guide the SEK moving forward  and we look for a more pronounced break of the 10 40 50 range  Our call for today s decision  see Scandi section  would entail strengthening of the SEK  but we stress that this is not a high conviction call  If we were to see an unchanged rate path  our base case   coupled with an end to the QE programme  we look for a move towards 10 35 and maybe even a test of 10 20  which coincidentally are our 1 and 3M  NYSE MMM  forecasts  respectively  On the other hand  should the rate path be revised down  and perhaps coupled with continuation of QE   we could easily see EUR SEK above 10 60  Then  of course  there are all the outcomes in between  unchanged rate path coupled with continuation of QE  and the opposite  The effect of these outcomes are harder to predict  but if anything we believe policy actions regarding the rate path to dominate those of the QE programme  at least as far as the SEK is concerned  The Riksbank decision will most likely also set the tone for the NOK even if the SSB industrial confidence data are important for economists  less so for markets   We still pencil in a stronger NOK in the coming months but highlight that USD NOK volatility has become an attractive hedge against such a view  details here  
NZD  AUD and JPY tumbled further against USD by around 1  and slightly less for JPY  These moves appear to have been broad outflows versus most EM indices to USD and bonds and are joined by a loss of momentum in industrial metals and slightly rising volatility across asset classes  The key theme for week s ahead seem thus to refocus on the drivers for risk appetite ",2019-04-25,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danske-daily--riksbanken-in-focus-as-the-boj-lowers-gdp-estimates-200411538,200411538

Based on the market pricing on 25 April at 11 45 CEST and assuming curves are correctly priced  we think a fair mid valuation for SCBC145 is 18 19bp above SCBC144  In the charts below  we have assumed a spread of 18 5bp above SCBC144  In matched ASW terms  this would mean a spread around 18bp

194235,415751,MMM,Another PMI Disappointment To Send EUR USD Back Down ,opinion,"Euro area manufacturing PMI has declined in eight consecutive months and on every release day of the flash estimate over this period EUR USD has dropped  
On Thursday  we look for another drop in the manufacturing PMI to 47 0 from 47 5  while consensus is looking for a rise to 48  
If we are right  we could see EUR USD drop 0 5 0 7  on the day  
We forecast EUR USD at 1 13 in 3M  NYSE MMM  before drifting higher to 1 15 and 1 17 in 6M and 12M on a China led recovery  
Euro area manufacturing PMI has declined in eight consecutive months from 55 1 in July to 47 5 in March  Moreover  on every release day of the flash estimate over this period EUR USD has dropped  Some of the day to day declines in EUR USD have been among the most significant over this period  i e  in the area of 0 5 0 7  on six out of the eight observations   see chart 1 to the right 


On Thursday  we look for another drop in the euro area manufacturing PMI to 47 0 from 47 5 in March  Although we have seen some rays of light in Chinese and even European data  Ifo  ZEW  industrial production  as of late  it might be too early to call for the trough in euro area manufacturing PMI in April  Forward looking sub indices such as new orders still showed marked declines in March and the leading order inventory balance signals further downside in April  see chart 2   Eventually  we expect the improvement in the Chinese export sector also to spill over to the euro area  but the impact will not be felt instantaneously  Looking at the South Korean leading indicator  which can be seen as a good  China proxy    we could still see further declines in the euro area manufacturing PMI in the coming 1 2M  see chart 3  

If we are right in our call for Thursday s PMIs to disappoint then we could see EUR USD drop around 0 5 0 7  on the day  which is around 50 70 pips from the current level just above 1 13  Hence  the move above 1 13 following the positive data releases on Friday could prove temporary and we could see EUR USD trading towards the 1 12 level after Thursday 
In the bigger picture  it is too early to be calling for EUR USD to move higher in our view  There are some positive factors from improvement in Chinese economic data and progress towards a US China trade deal  which are supporting the pair  However  we have yet to see a definitive bottom in euro area data  which would further cancel the need for further speculation in additional ECB monetary easing  beyond the recent extension of forward guidance and another TLTRO   We still expect the euro area macro data to bottom out in Q2  with some acceleration in the growth momentum ahead  In March  the ZEW expectations current conditions spread turned positive for the first time since 2012  which historically has preceded turning points in the manufacturing PMI by some 2 5M  We forecast EUR USD to stay close to 1 13 on 3M and only drift towards 1 15 in 6M and 1 17 in 12M once a turn in the Chinese cycle and the impact of a US China trade deal start to show in the euro area ",2019-04-15,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/another-pmi-disappointment-to-send-eurusd-back-down-200406696,200406696
194236,415752,MMM,3M  MMM  Reports Next Week  What To Know Ahead Of The Release,opinion,"The market expects 3M  MMM  to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Post it notes  industrial coatings and ceramics is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 50 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  8 09 billion  down 2 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 49  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for 3M 
For 3M  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 00  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that 3M will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that 3M would post earnings of  2 27 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 31  delivering a surprise of  1 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
3M doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3m-mmm-reports-next-week-what-to-know-ahead-of-the-release-200408330,200408330
194237,415753,MMM,Danske Daily   Oil Surge To Set Post Easter Market Agenda ,opinion,"Market movers today 
After a week of thin Easter trading  focus will be on the uptrend in oil prices  more below  and on news from the ongoing US China trade talks  for more on our expectations of what a trade deal could bring market wise  see  Global Research   What a US China trade deal will bring to the markets   The start of Japan s Golden Week will likely keep volumes thin in that region this week 
The oil market will stay in focus after the comments by President Trump yesterday that the US plans to end Iran sanction waivers by 2 May  Notably  attention will centre on whether other OPEC members will ensure adequate oil supplies after a further fall in Iran oil exports  as indeed suggested by Saudi Arabia yesterday 
On the data front  we have a rather quiet day with the only notable release being the euro area consumer confidence for April  Later this week the Riksbank meets  Thursday  and next week brings Chinese PMI  a Fed meeting and the US jobs report 
Danish consumer confidence data is due today  see Scandi section p  2 for details 
Selected market news 
A continued uptick in global oil prices is setting the scene for markets following a week of thin Easter trading  Notably  over the weekend  the US administration announced that it would not renew waivers on sanctions on Iranian oil exports  This effectively means that a range of countries that have been allowed to take up oil from Iran  despite the US withdrawing from the Iranian nuclear deal in May last year  will no longer be allowed to do so starting from 2 May this year  While Saudi Arabia and the UAE reportedly aim to make up for a good deal of the 1 9 mb d that Iran currently supplies  Brent crude oil rallied past USD74 bbl yesterday  Indeed  the US removal of waivers is just one of a string of recent supply concerns hitting the oil market  Adding to strains  Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz   a key gateway for Middle East oil to the rest of the world 
Risk sentiment has held up reasonably well so far in the wake of the sustained oil uptick  with major equity indices little changed over the Easter period  Trading has been mixed overnight in both the US and Asian sessions  Over the past few trading days  US 10Y yields have settled just above 2 55  while the German 10Y bund again fell below 0 025  after PMIs came out on the weak side of expectations in the euro zone  and the US  ahead of the Easter period  EUR USD dropped below 1 13 as a result  We stress  however  that some key signs of stabilisation are visible in the euro zone figures  as notably  the PMI  new orders  rose for the first time since December 2017  Hence  we still hold the view that the euro zone economy is bottoming out in Q2 and will regain some momentum in H2 19  with annual growth of 1 3  for 2019 
Scandi markets
In Denmark  new consumer confidence data is due today  We have become accustomed to lower levels of consumer confidence at around 3 on the index  meaning Danes are generally less positive compared with the summer  when consumer confidence was around 10  Hence  there has been a marked drop in optimism  though we expect slightly more cheer in April and forecast consumer confidence at 4 7 
Fixed income markets
Bunds rallied last week on the back of weaker than expected euro PMIs   if the IFO indicator surprises on the downside this week  it will likely confirm the weak sentiment in Germany and send core EU yields lower again  There are some EUR43bn in redemptions and coupons from France  and thus a big reinvestment need from the more passive investors such as ETFs  However  much of the seasonality in French government bonds has already been priced in given a 10Y spread around 33 34bp  Hence  we expect to see only a modest tightening in France versus Germany on the back of the redemption flow 
Italy and Greece are up for review by S P  The rating agency already has Italy on negative outlook  and the risk is that Italy is downgraded one notch to BBB  given that the deficit for 2019 has been revised up and growth down  The risk of a downgrade is not really priced in the 10Y Italian German yield spread  but we stay neutral on Italy  Indeed  we still prefer Spain despite a tight spread to core EU  The upcoming elections on 28 April indicated that the current left wing government will win but still needs the support from e g  Podemos  This could provide some short term  noise   but we expect limited impact on Spanish government bonds in the long run 
FX markets
Towards the end of last week  EUR USD dropped back below 1 13 following another disappointing PMI reading out of the euro zone  US figures  however  also came out on the weak side  Continued upward pressure on oil and continued support for equities helped to stabilise the cross though  We look for EUR USD to stay close to 1 13 on 3M  NYSE MMM   Calendarwise  the next big movers are not until next week  Elsewhere in the majors  EUR GBP has remained steady above 0 8650 and USD JPY close to 112  EUR CHF remains in an uptrend though  as demand for safe havens is waning amid more upbeat global sentiment and underpinned by comments ahead of Easter from the SNB s Jordan that rate cuts  from the current  0 75   are a viable option  We note  however  that positioning looks ever more stretched on CHF   but also JPY   shorts  see IMM Positioning Update 
In the Scandies  the NOK continues to benefit from the rise in oil prices with EUR NOK now settling in the 9 50s  With domestic data keeping up  diminished global geopolitical risks  higher oil prices and improving global economic data  we still think markets are underestimating the likelihood of a June rate hike  Indeed  under a reasonable set of assumptions  Norges Bank s rate path implies a roughly two thirds probability of an early summer hike  Also  despite the latest NOK rise  the import weighted NOK  I44  actually remains weaker than the central bank projection  Hence  we think the NOK rally has further legs to go  EUR SEK is back above 10 45 ahead of Thursday s Riksbank meeting 
As noted in Reading the Markets Sweden   12 April 2019  our base case is that the Riksbank will revise down its inflation forecast but keep the repo rate path intact this month  The market will likely take this a bit hawkishly and EUR SEK could drop more than 10 figures  towards 10 30  On the other hand  should the Riksbank lower the rate path after all  EUR SEK could once again challenge the 10 60 highs  In any case  we do not underestimate the volatility of the cross in response to the Riksbank s actions ",2019-04-23,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danske-daily--oil-surge-to-set-posteaster-market-agenda-200409303,200409303
194238,415754,MMM,FX Forecast Update   Scandi Spring Support In Sight,opinion,"EUR NOK  Norges Bank stands out as the only G10 central bank hiking policy rates  With the outlook for hikes in both June and December this year  we think relative rates will become an increasingly NOK supportive factor  Indeed  rates markets are pricing only one hike for the whole year  Oil prices are also increasingly becoming a supportive factor as OPEC  production cuts  geopolitical worries and speculative positioning are all sending the black gold higher  If we are right in assuming the global economy will rebound in the second quarter  this should further support oil prices and the NOK via improved risk appetite  We  roll  our NOK forecasts profile and now see EUR NOK at 9 50 in 1M  previously 9 60   9 50 in 3M  NYSE MMM   unchanged   9 30 in 6M  9 40   and 9 30 in 12M  unchanged   The unchanged 3M tenor reflects the summer period  during which improved structural liquidity and lower FX market activity have been a NOK headwind historically  Meanwhile  on a 6M tenor  we still pencil in a further move lower for the overvalued EUR NOK 
EUR SEK  If the Riksbank comes across as hawkish at the April meeting  which we think it will  the SEK should be supported and a break below 10 40 and possibly a test of 10 20 could be on the cards  Moreover  we think that the market may have overestimated the negative SEK impact stemming from dividends  That said  a shabby domestic growth outlook  weak inflation pressures and a central bank that is expected to eventually give in on any hikes this year suggests that the downside potential in EUR SEK is limited  Instead  we could see the krona coming under renewed selling pressure later this year when the market is starting to reprice the Riksbank  Based on the above  we lower our 1 3M targets to 10 35  10 50  and 10 20  10 40  but raise our 6 12M forecasts to 10 40  10 30  and 10 50  10 30   respectively 
EUR DKK EUR DKK peaked in December and early January and has traded lower since  It rose temporarily towards the 7 4660 level during the annual dividend season  We forecast EUR DKK at 7 4610 in 1M  7 4580 in 3M and 7 4550 in 6 12M 
EUR USD  The ECB has introduced an easing risk premium on the euro  which could increase  i e  negative for the cross  if the euro zone outlook continues to falter  However  price action during the April ECB meeting suggests to us that the market is looking for more than promises before selling the euro from an already short position  We forecast EUR USD at 1 12 in 1M and 1 13 in 3M  where we see a potential for euro area data to continue to disappoint and underperform other regions  On 6M and 12M  we stick to our forecasts of 1 15 and 1 17  as the China led recovery along with a US China trade deal should lend support to EUR USD 
EUR GBP  With a medium to long Brexit extension and no reason to believe PM May s deal will pass any time soon  we think it is difficult to see much further GBP strengthening near term  Hence  we have raised our GBP forecasts throughout the forecast horizon and look for EUR GBP to remain range bound at 0 85 0 87 in 1 3M  It is difficult to predict what will happen when we get closer to the new Brexit deadline in October  but as we think a further extension is likely  we expect the cross to remain at 0 85 0 87 also in 3 12M  We target the cross in the mid of this range across horizons  i e  0 86 in 1M and in 3M  previously 0 83   0 86 in 6M  0 82   and 0 86 in 12M  0 83

194239,415755,MMM,Strategy   Sweden  QE Purchases Unlikely To Be Extended ,opinion,"Sell SGB1061  Nov 2029  ASW   56bp  Carry   0 3bp 3M  P L   46  63bp  In December 2017  the Riksbank  RB  provided a crude roadmap for normalising monetary policy  see below   After the hike in December 2018  we are now at phase 3  In our view  the RB could very well enter phase 4 by deciding not to extend QE purchases beyond June 

We note that the RB in December 2018 chose not to extend the mandate for FX interventions   another non standard measure  The need for more bond purchases can obviously be questioned in an environment where the RB remains intent on hiking rates 
On top of that  despite the bond purchases being very modest relative to the size of GDP  the RB holds an impressive share of the outstanding volume  just below 50   No doubt  this has affected market liquidity  Turnover in government bonds has decreased relative to turnover in covered bonds  The Riksbank s own December 2018 survey points to some investor dissatisfaction with bond market liquidity  In addition  the SNDO appears to remain worried about potential long term harm to the investor base  We note that many nominal SGBs trade close to 40bp expensive relative to the RB repo rate 

Below  we have done some simple simulations  based on the latest issuance forecast from the SNDO  The question the RB will have to address at the April meeting is whether to reinvest SGB1047 early  which matures as late as December 2020   The extreme scenario would mean reinvesting all holdings early  That would imply the RB s holding increases to around 57  of the outstanding volume  a number that would stand out internationally  A more moderate scenario would imply reinvesting only coupon payments  In that scenario  the RB s holding relative to the outstanding volume would only decrease marginally 

Considering the questionable need for more bond purchases and the strain on the bond market  we think a logical step for the RB at this point would simply be to end bond purchases  Even under our scenario  the RB balance sheet would remain mostly intact up until December 2020 
Earlier this year  we were hesitant about selling long dated SGBs vs swaps  as they had cheapened significantly relative to Bund ASWs  However  in recent months  10Y SGB ASWs have become significantly more expensive  partly supported by the upward pressure on the 3M  NYSE MMM  fixings  which however  seems to be abating for the time being  

Thus  entry levels now appear more attractive  We especially recommend to sell SGB1061  the current 10Y benchmark bond  The loan is noticeably cheaper in the repo market  trading around  0 45    and is unlikely to be squeezed in the near term as it is still  under construction   i e  being regularly tapped by the SNDO 
Thus  we recommend selling SGB1061 ASW  We generally expect the short end of the ASW curve to continue to outperform the long end  as the short end should benefit from the proposed LCR rules putting upward pressure on fixings  especially as we near the large June redemptions  and from the general lack of short dated government bonds bills ",2019-04-25,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/strategy--sweden-qe-purchases-unlikely-to-be-extended-200410721,200410721

In the US  we get February housing market numbers and 2018 Q4 private consumption print  Recently  the housing market has started to show a bit weakness especially home sales numbers  which we expect is driven by higher mortgage rates  However  housing market data are quite volatile  The day also brings a number of Fed speeches  but these are going to fade into the background for some time  as the Fed has clearly signalled it is on hold for the rest of the year  see  FOMC review  Fed done hiking rates

Selected market news 
In yesterday s indicative votes  the House of Commons rejected all eight Brexit options   Readers of yesterday s Danske Daily will know this was not a big surprise given the House of Commons had rejected most of the options in one way or another in previous votes  Next step is likely more indicative votes on Monday 1 April  where members of parliament may vote again but on fewer options  Within the Conservative Party more Brexiteers are now backing May s deal after she promised to resign soon after Brexit has been delivered  but unfortunately for May  the supporting party DUP from Northern Ireland remains against  May s deal will likely be dead on arrival if brought forward for a vote tomorrow  With just about two weeks to go  uncertainty is high  In our view  there seems to be four possible ways forward now  May s deal  no deal  second EU referendum or May s deal including a permanent customs union  Risk of snap election might have gone up  though  For a more detailed analysis  please see   Brexit Monitor  No No No No No No No No    28 March  EUR GBP is likely stuck in the range 0 85 0 87 for now 
Yesterday s ECB watchers conference shook markets   The comments from Mario Draghi  Peter Praet and Luis de Guindos on attention to banks  profitability fuelled with a Reuters ECB sourced story sent yields lower  Their comments predominantly focused on the weak banking sector profitability and what ECB could do to mitigate this  However  it was not until the Reuters story around 14 00 CET that the significant market move took place  This morning  Praet said that ECB staff are looking into the possibility of a tiering system should a monetary policy reason warrant that  That also means that all options to mitigate the side effects from the negative deposit rate are on the table  However  we expect next step from ECB is announcing the TLTRO3 modalities  which could be made very favourable  should they find the need before a tiering system were to be announced

This morning we have published the Nordic Outlook   March 2019  our quarterly outlook for the Nordic economies  We call for a sharp slowdown in Sweden as housing investment head down  but strong growth in Norway supported by oil investments  Danish exports have accelerated despite the global slowdown  and the recovery has some way to go yet  Finland is returning to more normal growth levels after three strong years  The Outlook does not contain new financial forecasts but underpin our expectations of rate hikes in Norway but not in Sweden 
The only Swedish data set for release today is retail sales for February  Given the modest rebound  still below the benchmark of 100  in consumer and retail confidence noted in yesterday s release of NIER s economic tendency survey we might see a small uptick in retail sales  although the downwards trend will most likely be kept intact

Yesterday  Draghi and Co  brought back the discussion of a tiered deposit system  Praet officially confirmed this morning in a Bloomberg interview that the ECB is looking at tiering  but underlined that the ECB would need a monetary policy case to introduce it  But the signal is the important thing here  When ECB is ready to look at the side effects of negative rates  ECB are aware that negative rates might very well be here for extended period of time and even new rate cuts could be on the table 
We believe the rally in Bunds can continue  The discussion of further ECB easing has just started and it seems our earlier call that we would reach  10bp in 10Y Bund yields is now too modest  Especially  as we do not expect to see an imminent turn around in Euro zone key figures  10Y Bund yields dropped 6 5bp and the curve 10s30s steepened 3bps after the speech  The market is now pricing a tiny probability that the next move could in fact be a cut from the ECB  The rally continued in the US where the market is now pricing some 20bp cut at the September meeting  Fed s Kaplan said he would be ready to cut rates if the inversion of the curve would last for longer or the magnitude changed  The comments came after Stephen Moore   whom Trump might nominate for the Fed   called for an imminent 50bp cut earlier in the day 
Periphery markets could now follow Bunds higher and underperformed slightly  In BTPs the reason was probably some concessions ahead of the new 5Y BTP that will be introduced today  Italy will sell up to EUR 3 75bn in the 5Y and EUR 2 75bn in the 10Y benchmark bond  The 5Y point still offer a health carry roll in Italy and demand should be no problem 
FX markets
EUR actually proved rather resilient to ECB hints of a tiered deposit system yesterday notwithstanding the significant drop seen in euro rates across the curve  On the one hand  to the extent that tiered deposits allow ECB to keep rates lower for longer it is clearly a EUR negative  On the other hand  to the extent that this leaves the impression of an ECB that is severely challenged on its toolbox and that low inflation risks becoming entrenched  like has happened for SNB and BoJ  it is a EUR positive down the road  ECB will have to stick to a soft stance near term  and as we wrote in FX strategy  EUR USD trap   escape routes blocked this may fuel a larger easing risk premium on EUR USD  but we are not in for a break of 1 10 in our view 
In the Scandies  NOK came under relentless pressure in yesterday s session in a move that started with a dovish RBNZ  weaker than expected LFS data and general Scandi selling but ended up in broader based NOK selling as important technical levels were broken and stops were triggered  The final part of the move seemed heavily overdone and difficult to explain from fundamentals even if the deflationary global tendencies are negative for NOK SEK as illustrated by this chart  The domestics remain strong as pointed out in this morning s edition of the Nordic Outlook and overall we think the latest price action is overdone  No major SEK move expected on retail sales today  We will see a total of SEK 14bn  Ericsson  BS ERICAs    SHB  of dividends today  of which approx  SEK 6 5bn is distributed to foreign investors  This should however not have any major impact on the SEK  see our piece on dividends and the SEK for more on this 
EUR DKK has grinded higher the past couple of days to a high of 7 4669 and close to the peak of 7 4680 in the beginning of January  In our view  the move higher is undramatic and likely owes to the  March dividend effect   The past two years EUR DKK has edged lower again the beginning of April  which supports our case for the recent move higher to be temporary  We forecast EUR DKK at 7 4570 in 3M  NYSE MMM   see DKK Edge  
In emerging markets  the TRY remains under considerable pressure after a sharp drop in the central bank s foreign reserves and renewed geopolitical fears  The Turkish central bank drained TRY liquidity in an attempt to halt offshore USD TRY shorting activity  which stabilised TRY  We expect the pressure to continue on the TRY and cannot preclude an emergencey hike from the Turkish central bank ",2019-03-28,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danske-daily--potential-ecb-tiering-system-opens-for-a-rate-cut-200401706,200401706
194251,415767,MMM,This Is Why 3M  MMM  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
3M in Focus
Based in St Paul  3M  MMM  is in the Conglomerates sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 9 44   The maker of Post it notes  industrial coatings and ceramics is paying out a dividend of  1 44 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 76  compared to the Diversified Operations industry s yield of 1 43  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 93  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  5 76 is up 5 9  from last year  3M has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 10 79   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  3M s current payout ratio is 55   meaning it paid out 55  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for MMM for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  10 55 per share  with earnings expected to increase 0 86  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  MMM is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-03-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-3m-mmm-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200402262,200402262
194252,415768,MMM,Monthly Executive Briefing  Central Banks Loosen The Brake ,opinion,"Global economic momentum remained fragile in March and recession fears made a strong comeback in markets   as the global manufacturing cycle shifted further into lower gear   Despite encouraging signs of strengthening domestic demand  spring has not yet arrived for the Eurozone economy and the ground remains particularly frozen in Germany s industrial sector  see  here    Brexit uncertainty has been an important headwind for Europe as of late and while the risk of a no deal Brexit has decreased following the EU leaders  decision to extend the deadline to 12 April  it has by no means disappeared as the UK parliament remains deadlocked in its search for a way forward  see  here    Amid the already abundant uncertainties for the euro area outlook  another risk factor has resurfaced with the threat of US tariffs on European cars  That said  at the current stage we still attach a relatively low probability of them coming into effect near term 
A US China trade deal in Q2 remains one of the key building blocks for our expectation of a rebound in the global economy  Although progress in the negotiations seems to have stalled as of late on the tricky question of enforcement mechanisms  this is not unusual as we are entering the final  rocky  stage and we still expect a deal to be signed at a US China summit in the coming months  both April and June have been mentioned   Meanwhile  signals that the Chinese economy is bottoming out in Q1 are getting more frequent and fiscal easing through VAT cuts should further support the recovery ahead 
Following a string of disappointing data  central banks on both sides of the Atlantic are shifting course towards a more dovish direction  The ECB has become increasingly worried about a structural slowdown of the Eurozone economy and the side effects of a prolonged period of negative rates  see  here    It has opened the door for further easing by extending its forward guidance  rates remaining at present levels  at least through the end of 2019     while also announcing another liquidity operation  TLTRO3  to spur lending growth to the real economy  In light of this  we now forecast no interest rate changes to any of the ECB s policy rates within the next 12 months  The ECB was not the only major central bank to perform a dovish tilt  Similarly  the Fed shifted gear  now signalling no rate hikes this year and just one hike in 2020  while the balance sheet run down will already stop in September  We have not experienced the Fed pausing for a prolonged time and then resuming the hiking cycle and hence we no longer expect the Fed to hike this year either  see  here   
The dovish tilt from central bankers  however  did not dispel markets  increasing worries about the global cyclical outlook  10Y German Bund yields moved below zero and in the US  the yield curve started to invert  with the 10Y Treasury yield falling below the 3M  NYSE MMM  rate for the first time since 2007  Although such an inversion historically has coincided with recession hitting within 18 24 months  the yield spread itself does not trigger an economic downturn and while the US industrial sector seems to have hit a rough patch   not being immune to global developments   we still think the US economy overall is in good shape and remains supported by fiscal stimulus this year 
Near term we project a continued environment of low rates and flatter curves  while we see potential for a wider  ECB easing risk premium  to weigh on EUR USD in the short term ",2019-04-01,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monthly-executive-briefing-central-banks-loosen-the-brake-200402606,200402606
194253,415769,MMM,Danske Daily   Chinese PMI Data Eases Global Growth Worries ,opinion,"Market movers today 
Today is a very busy day in terms of economic data releases  This morning  PMI manufacturing indices for many European countries  including Norway and Sweden  see overleaf   are due out 
In the euro area  we get unemployment data for February and preliminary HICP inflation at 11 00 CEST  Although we still expect core inflation to climb higher in 2019  we expect the March core inflation print to remain at 1 0  y y  as the Easter effect will exert downward pressure on service price inflation  which might be even more pronounced following the methodological changes to German package tours  For headline inflation we see scope for a rise to 1 7  y y  driven by increasing energy prices 
In the US  there are plenty of data releases as well  At 14 30 CEST  retail sales are due out  which will be interesting given the weakness in recent months  We expect core retail sales rose  0 5  m m in February  At 16 00  ISM manufacturing for March is due out  which  given the regional PMIs  may increase marginally  US manufacturing is not immune to what happens in the rest of the world and we expect it to move lower over the next 3M  NYSE MMM  
In the UK  there will be another round of indicative Brexit votes today  Last week  a permanent customs union or a second EU referendum were closest to getting a majority 
Selected market news 
Over the weekend and this morning  China published its official PMI and the Caixin PMI  Both indices surprised on the upside  with the official PMI rising to 50 5 from 49 2 last month  and the Caixin PMI rising from 49 9 to 50 8  It was the biggest increase since 2012 in the official PMI  Both new orders and new export orders rose to a six month high though new export orders are still below 50  We believe we will continue see a rebound in Q2 data  that tends to correlate with commodity prices  and we have seen higher prices for both metals and oil this year  Hence  the PMIs are encouraging  We also expect further monetary easing to add to the stimulus and thus support activity in Q2  The better PMI data came after positive news stories last week that the Chinese US trade talks are moving forward  We published our  China Weekly Letter on Friday  where we argued that we could see a  signing meeting  between Xi and Trump in late April  
The Asian markets have reacted positively to the growth news and the major equity indices are in green  USD JPY is also higher  trading above 111  and 10Y US treasury yields opened some 3bp higher at 2 43   In Turkey  Erdogan and his AK party lost several key cities in Sunday s election  and the lira remains under pressure after last week s turmoil 
Finally  on Brexit  EU s Junker warned over the weekend that the EU s patience will not last forever  The voting continues this week in the UK parliament  The government must now make a request to the EU at the extraordinary summit on 10 April or leave with a hard Brexit on 12 April 
Scandi markets
Swedish manufacturing PMI is due for release at 08 30 CEST  New orders bounced back in February after a dip close to the  standstill  50 level in January  However  Swedish manufacturing is closely correlated with German manufacturing and hence the significant drop seen in German orders over the past couple of months implies a sharp downside risk for Swedish PMI 
In Norway  the global slowdown in manufacturing shows no sign of infecting the manufacturing sector so far  This is of course due to the strong impulses coming from oil investments  and as they are set to grow strongly in 2019  we expect an increase in industrial activity over the year  Hence  we expect the PMI to stay at elevated levels  even though we expect a slight fall to 55 0 in March 
Fixed income markets
This week  there is an estimated EUR13 5bn in supply from Spain and France coming to the market  There are only small coupons  so there is an estimated total negative cash flow of EUR12 9bn  There are minor positive cash flows for the next two weeks  while large redemptions in Italy  Spain and not least of all France will generate major positive cash flow in the second part of April  On Thursday  France will tap in the 10Y  15Y and the new 30Y OAT  5 2050   Spain has decided to only tap two nominals also on Thursday  These will be the 3Y and the 10Y benchmark bond  Market discussion goes on whether Spain could introduce a new 5Y bond relatively soon  Spain will also tap the 8Y linker  For more  see the Government Bonds Weekly  which we published on Friday 
In our Government Bonds Weekly we also have a special theme on a possible ECB tiering system  In the end we do not expect that the ECB will opt for a tiered system  But the important thing to notice from a strategic point of view is the clear message the ECB is sending to the market  When the ECB acknowledges that it is once again considering tiered rates to shield banks after the idea was abandoned in 2016  it underlines that the ECB now sees it as likely that rates will stay negative for an extended period of time  and it even opens the door for new rate cuts 
We continue to favour carry trades and see more downside for Bunds  10Y yields  However  today  Bunds might open on the weak side after the stronger than expected Chinese PMI data 
This week  focus will once again be on Brexit and then we have the labour market report on Friday  Today  Euro zone CPI will be in focus  We expect core inflation to remain at just 1 0  
FX markets
On Friday  the NOK benefitted from a rally in oil prices  equities and also a strong NAV labour market report  which confirmed that the labour market remains strong despite Wednesday s disappointing LFS data  Also  the strong Chinese PMI data over the weekend is very encouraging as it should support global commodity FX including the NOK  Going forward  we still expect a stronger NOK  as explained in Reading the Markets Norway to be published later this morning  In this edition  we also take a look at the Norwegian dividend season  which peaks from mid April to mid May  Under even rough assumptions  we estimate a very moderate net exchange need of NOK7 5bn worth of net NOK selling from now until early June  Historically  the NOK has even tended to strengthen during the dividend season and we think this pattern could be repeated 
On the SEK  Swedish PMI is likely to edge lower this morning and a break of 50 cannot be ruled out  If so  the SEK should take a hit and push EUR SEK firmly back into the higher end of the 10 40 10 50 range

194254,415770,MMM,ECB Preview   No New Policy Actions Expected As  inflation Is Delayed  Not Deraile,opinion,"The ECB confirmed its  low for longer  narrative at last week s Watchers conference 
We expect Draghi to repeat his  delayed  not derailed  inflation message  thereby no new policy signals from the ECB  However  we expect Draghi to strike an overall cautious tone and the ECB to keep its downside risks assessment on growth 
The economic indicators are yet to show a convincing pickup but positively some stabilisation in indicators  except in the German manufacturing sector and core inflation  has been observed  which we expect Draghi to acknowledge 
We do not expect TLTRO3 modalities to be announced next week  not until June   We expect questions on a tiering system but no additional colour to the discussion compared to last week comments from chief economist Peter Praet 
Cautious stance
The ECB kept its downside risk assessment on growth at the last governing council meeting  GC   while launching a new series of TLTROs and extending forward guidance  The ECB keeping its downside risk assessment while announcing policy measures has not been seen before often  which clearly points to awareness of and concern about the outlook  The March minutes showed that a case was made to change the risk assessment after the lower projections  That said  we still expect the ECB to keep its downside risk assessment  reflecting particularly weak manufacturing  which is still to show a pickup  On the positive side  the recent Chinese PMI pointed to an improved global cycle in the near future 
Worryingly  though  the minutes said  that growth might not be mean reverting  as typically assumed in projections   pointing to China amongst others 
Tiering system and TLTRO3 modalities
We do not expect TLTRO3 modalities until June  We believe the verdict is still out on how favourable the ECB wants to make the operations and more time is needed for this 
According to the communication so far  the main refinancing operation rate plays a crucial role in the incentive structure  without further colour of how this is structured 
We also expect markets to be disappointed about additional colour on a potential tiering system  In our ECB Watchers conference  is a tiering system really the answer  and our Government Bonds Weekly we outline why we do not expect a tiering system to be announced  However  given Peter Praet s comments last Thursday we expect Draghi to face questions on the format and timeline of a potential tiering system  We expect Draghi to acknowledge the discussion of a tiering system  but as part of a discussion on how to mitigate the side effects of the negative deposit rates 
We find it important to stress that we cannot rule out a tiering system at this stage and markets are right by assigning a non zero probability to this given the comments from Draghi and Praet  However  we reiterate that the important lesson here is that ECB s  lowfor  longer  narrative is dominating and a discussion on a tiering system shows ECB s willingness to use all instruments  as it is wary of the situation in the euro area 

Low market based inflation pricing amid no hike on our forecast horizon Inflation market pricing  measured by forward inflation swaps  stands c  15bp lower compared with the GC meeting in March  The 2y2y and 5y5y inflation swap troughed at worryingly low levels of 1 03  and 1 32   respectively  last week and have since then recorded a small rebound to 1 08  and 1 36  currently  Interestingly  the ECB attributes the recent repricing to a rising negative inflation risk premium   67bp in five years  as the survey based inflation measure remains broadly stable  However  we note that the most prominent survey gauge  the Q1 update of the survey of professional forecasters  is set to be released to the GC ahead of the meeting and if the survey points to deteriorating inflation expectations  from the current 1 82   the ECB may open the door for more easing  Previously  when the longer term SPF was at 1 77  in Q1 15  the ECB started QE  A similar move is expected to trigger an even more dovish reaction from the ECB  The SPF publication is due for release on 11 April 
As the inflation market pricing and EONIA pricing are strongly correlated with first rate hike pricing  measured by number of months to first rate hike   we need to see a significant pickup in market based inflation expectations  in turn on the back of a pickup in economic data  before we can actively trade the first rate hike in outright terms 
Lower growth near term   inflation delayed  not derailed
The downward revision of the staff projections at the March meeting was larger than we and markets had expected  The revisions  which were of a similar size as in the run up to the PSPP announcement in 2015  led to the ECB announcing its third round of targeted liquidity operations and postponing the first rate hike guidance  as a building worry of the slowdown becoming more structural has emerged 
Since the March meeting  only four weeks ago  we have seen some stabilisation in forward looking indicators such as Ifo  ZEW etc  However  the important German PMI manufacturing and inflation data disappointed  euro area growth likely remained subdued in Q1 19 and indicators point to a quarterly growth of 0 2   in line with the ECB s baseline   Overall  the PMIs paint a two speed picture of the economic momentum  While the service sector rebounded in signs of strengthening domestic demand  manufacturing is painting a dour picture  Particularly  the Germany manufacturing sector is suffering from the global trade channel  albeit the rise in Chinese data may point to easing headwinds in the  German  manufacturing sector in the future 
The ECB still expects a pickup in growth and in turn inflation figures in a classical textbook  output gap  approach  which points to a loss of growth momentum that implies a later and more subdued pickup in inflation  We agree with this assessment  albeit our core inflation profile is slightly more dovish than the ECB s profile staff projection suggests  The March disappointing core inflation figure of 0 8  was to a large degree driven by seasonal factors due to the timing of Easter  service price inflation declined to 1 1    That said  the tight labour market conditions and strong wage growth are yet to translate into core inflation 
The missing transmission from wages to consumer prices is becoming an increasing worry for the ECB as Draghi also pointed to structural changes during the March press conference  However  so far we believe the ECB to stick to its mantra that  the sustained convergence of inflation towards the 2  aim has been delayed rather than derailed  


FX fatigued
The weak PMI  the collapse in market based inflation expectations and the turnaround in the ECB s communication at last month s meeting as well as during the Watchers conference have put focus on the potential need for further ECB easing  The discussion has so far centred on forward guidance  TLTRO modalities and a tiered deposit system   none of which has the potential to substantially weaken the EUR in our view  A signal of more QE or rate cuts could do the trick  but that is not for the April meeting  but could come later depending on how the incoming data play out 
The recent development in short term real interest rates  illustrated by 2Y OIS real swap rates  highlights the current asymmetric outcome space for EUR USD with respect to relative monetary policy  The Fed can tighten  as it did last year  when it pushed the real rate about 100bp higher  and Fed can ease  as it has done this year  where the short term real rate has dropped about 15bp  In contrast  the ECB does not seem to have an answer to the 35bp rise in the real rate since the start of 2018 
For EUR USD  the coming months will be a tug of war  between the development in global risk sentiment and carry  The recent bout of better Chinese data provides some comforting support for EUR USD  however  on the other hand  carry on short EUR USD still sits above 3  in a 1Y FX forward  albeit down from 3 45  last year following the repricing of the Fed  We forecast EUR USD at 1 13 in 3M  NYSE MMM  and highlight that if the ECB starts to look into QE or rate cut options  we could see a dip to 1 10 in the short term 
Still ECB support for European fixed income
The focus in the fixed income markets is set to turn to the economic outlook  as the effort to find news about the details of the new TLTRO and the potential of a tiering system for deposit rates is unlikely to be fruitful 
Hence  the ECB will hardly rock the boat and the market will conclude once again that any rate hikes are very far away  The first 10bp hike in the depo rate is currently priced in H1 21 and after the tiered rates discussion started at the ECB Watchers conference last week  the market now sees a very small probability that rates could be cut in late 2019  This is unlikely to change next week with no new details of a possible tiering system  We also expect that Bunds will remain supported and 10Y Bund yields are expected to continue to trade in a  10bp to  5bp range after the meeting 

We also hold on to the view that the  low for longer  rhetoric including the tiering discussion has created a very supportive carry or hunt for yields environment in the Eurozone and recommend to overweight periphery and semi core in the government bond market  The EUR swap curves have steepened after the tiering rates discussion last week  We expect that especially the 5s10s flattening will start again as the pivotal point on the curve has moved out on the curve ",2019-04-05,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ecb-preview--no-new-policy-actions-expected-as-inflation-is-delayed-not-deraile-200404148,200404148
194255,415771,MMM,China  RRR Cut Needed To Sustain Credit Growth ,opinion,"China s aggregate financing  which includes loans and other credit channels  amounted to CNY2 86 trillion in March alone  Loans comprised only a part of this  with the rest coming from the debt market  The central bank wants credit creation to support the economy  We believe a cut in the reserve requirement ratio is needed to maintain strong credit growth 
A very high credit growth
Aggregate financing at CNY2 86 trillion  as a measure of China s credit growth  was up 80 28  YoY in March  1Q19 total credit created was near CNY8 20 trillion  up 40   from 1Q18 
Though it is usual to have high credit growth in the first quarter of the year in China  the growth is surprisingly high and a clear sign to us that this is to support the economy  Another sign that the central bank is supporting the economy is that the interest rate bid has remained low  as shown by 3M  NYSE MMM  SHIBOR 

Yuan loans likely went to small exporters
RMB loans from banks are still the largest contribution of total credit for the economy 
This is likely the result of central bank efforts to help small private firms to get funding from banks  Some of these private firms have been hurt by the trade war  As such  the credit diversion to small private firms should reduce the risk of a slump in the job market  We are not sure how these funds will be used if small exporters face weaker global growth 
Debt market serviced local government infrastructure projects
The second largest credit creator was the debt market  facilitating fundraising for infrastructure through the issue of local government special bonds 
This funding will go directly into project finance  and so boost the mining  commodities  energy and transportation sectors  Most of the infrastructure spending is for new metro lines  new toll roads and water management systems 

Rapid yuan loan growth means an RRR cut is needed
As trade war uncertainties linger on  there is a need to keep the fast yuan loan growth to help small private firms survive  An RRR cut is needed to facilitate fast credit growth 
China may not need such fast ongoing credit injection into small private firms  That said  we believe that the central government will allow speedy credit growth to continue for some time  at least until it is satisfied that the job market is stable RRR cut in April still on the cards
Liquidity seems to be ample  as shown by 3M SHIBOR  However  by 17 April a sizeable liquidity injection expire and there will be tax payments around mid April   Usually  this would create some tightness in the interbank market  This should allow the central bank to cut RRR by 0 5 percentage points to 13 0

194264,415780,MMM,CSL Vs  MMM  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Diversified Operations sector have probably already heard of Carlisle  CSL  and 3M  MMM   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  Carlisle is sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while 3M has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that CSL has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
CSL currently has a forward P E ratio of 16 71  while MMM has a forward P E of 19 71  We also note that CSL has a PEG ratio of 1 11  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  MMM currently has a PEG ratio of 1 94 
Another notable valuation metric for CSL is its P B ratio of 2 84  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  MMM has a P B of 12 36 
These metrics  and several others  help CSL earn a Value grade of B  while MMM has been given a Value grade of C 
CSL is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that CSL is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-03-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/csl-vs-mmm-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200399408,200399408
194265,415781,MMM,Norges Bank To Hike Today Amid Fed Hike Cycle Is A First ,opinion,"Market movers today 
In our core markets  all focus is on Norges Bank  NB   which we expect to raise the policy rate by 25bp to 1 00   as the economy is in very good shape  We expect NB to signal another rate hike this year  with more to come next year  which is more aggressive than current market pricing  See next page for full preview and market implications  See more   Reading the Markets Norway  Norges Bank preview  not as dovish as markets expect    18 March 
Today  the EU leaders meet to discuss  among other things  whether to grant the UK an extension of Article 50  A final verdict is not expected today  The EU summit starts at 14 00 CET and the Brexit discussion at 15 30  A press conference will be held afterwards 
The Bank of England meets today and Carney   Co seem to be in no hurry to raise rates in the current environment  Our case for a rate hike in November 2019 is under pressure given the other dovish central banks 
The Swiss National Bank  SNB  is widely expected to keep its policy rate unchanged at  0 75  at today s quarterly meeting 
Overnight to Friday  we get Japanese inflation numbers 
Selected market news 
Unsurprisingly  the Fed maintained the target range at 2 25 2 50   However  the biggest change to the statement is that the Fed thinks the US domestic economy has slowed   The  dot plot  was lowered significantly and the median dots are signalling no rate hikes this year and just one rate hike next year   Five  out of 17  FOMC members think the Fed is on hold until at least year end 2021 
Based on the dovish Fed  we also have to admit we have misread the Fed   With the new signals  it seems like the bar is high for the Fed to move again on rate hikes  In previous hiking cycles  we have not experienced the Fed pausing for a long time and then resuming hiking and hence we no longer expect the Fed to hike in this hiking cycle   See more in  FOMC review  Fed done hiking rates   21 March 
On Brexit  in a letter to Donald Tusk  PM Theresa May outlined she wants a short extension until 30 June 2019  That said  we see the options being either a very short one to mid May or a long one lasting into 2020  Our base case remains the latter  The risk scenario is that the EU27 leaders reject an extension  as they are more hawkish on Brexit than Tusk  Juncker and Barnier  Today s EU summit is only expected to discuss the principles of an extension and a final decision can be taken next week right before deadline  as it would allow May to try to get her deal through the House of Commons a third time  Donald Tusk and other leading EU politicians said the EU is ready to grant a short extension IF the UK passes the Withdrawal Agreement  WA   The EU has repeated said there will be no more negotiations on the WA  The EU commission has recommended to grant either a short extension to mid May before the European elections or a long one lasting until at least end 2019

Scandi markets
We expect Norges Bank to raise the policy rate by 25bp to 1 00   The economy is close to capacity  and we expect growth to remain above trend both this year and next  pushing capacity utilisation up further  Unemployment continues to fall  wage growth is picking up  and inflation is above the 2  target and rising  which all suggests that the normalisation of monetary policy should continue  We therefore expect Norges Bank to signal another rate hike this year  with more to come next year  The outlook beyond 2020 is uncertain  with the growing risk of a downturn in both the global and the domestic economy  If we are right  this would be more aggressive than current market pricing  which is coloured by global uncertainty and more cautious signals from the ECB 
In Denmark  today brings the monthly employment figures for January  The labour market looked strong for most of 2018  with an average of 3 800 jobs created per month  but December brought a slightly weaker picture  with private sector employment increasing by a more modest 1 750  down from a monthly average of 3 400 over the year as a whole  It will be exciting therefore to see which way things headed at the beginning of 2019  We also get March data for consumer confidence  which has become increasingly entrenched at lower levels due to a less positive view of the economy  We expect the indicator to climb slightly from 3 3 in February to 4 0 in March 
Fixed income markets
The FOMC effectively went on  neutral  or patience wait and mode last night as it signalled it will not tighten this year and only hike once in 2020 according to the dots  The new forecasts and the rhetoric from Powell were clearly to the dovish side  The FOMC also said it would start slowing down the balance sheet reduction in May and halt it in September  The belly of the Treasury curve rallied strongly and 5Y yields dropped 8bp  The curve 2s5s inverted further to  6 7bp  while the 10s30s curve steepened to 44bp  The market stepped up the probability that the next move will be a cut and some 18bp is priced in cuts over the next 12M months 
Today  the EGB markets will have to absorb supply from France and Spain  Spain will sell in 3Y  10Y and 20Y bonds  We prefer the 3Y 5y segment in Spain given the roll on this part of the curve  Spain is up for review tomorrow by S P  A  positive outlook   Given the Spanish growth outperformance  Spain is heading for an upgrade  but with the election uncertainties it is likely that S P will wait until September before pulling the upgrade trigger  France will open a new 10Y linker  Mar 29   The volume is set at EUR1 5 2 5bn  France will also tap in the Feb 22  May 22  Mar 24 and Nov 25 bonds 
FX markets
In Scandi FX markets  all eyes turn to Norges Bank  NB  today  see scandi section above for a full preview  There is much focus on recent dovishness from other central banks and there still seems to be a perception in the markets that NB  is always dovish   this is actually an outdated perception  see this table   If we are right  we would expect a move lower in EUR NOK  The big question is whether we will see a break of support levels in the 9 63 9 65 range in today s session  Eventually we do think we will see a break to the downside  For more return statistics and a comment on option pricing  see this tweet  We think that a hawkish surprise from Norges Bank would  on the margin  spill over positively to the Swedish krona  where a test break of 10 40 should be within reach  The dovish Fed sent the USD lower last night and given that the rates market is now pricing a cut next year  we further see limited downside potential for USD from the current level 
Soon focus should shift back to possible additional easing from the ECB  Hence  we remain confident in our 1 13 forecast for EUR USD on 3M  NYSE MMM  
After the ECB has deferred a first hike  the SNB will be stuck with a franc that will most certainly still be denounced  highly valued  and a need to reserve its right to intervene to curb CHF strength  SNB is currently priced largely on par with the ECB for the next 12M  which seems fair in our view given that it would require a sustained uptick in EUR CHF before the SNB looks to shift into  genuine normalisation  mode 
EUR GBP moved higher to 0 865 yesterday due to Brexit  As an extension before 29 March remains more or less priced  we expect EUR GBP to remain above 0 85  If EU27 explicitly rejects an extension  which we cannot rule out given the more hawkish Brexit stance among EU27 leaders  10  probability   we should see EUR GBP break above 0 87  as markets would start pricing in a higher risk of a no deal Brexit again ",2019-03-21,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/norges-bank-to-hike-today-amid-fed-hike-cycle-is-a-first-200399695,200399695

After the EU27 s decision to grant a very short unconditional extension of Brexit  see more below   we will follow closely the response from leading UK politicians today and over the weekend ahead of next week s decisions in the House of Commons 
In the US  we get Markit PMIs  preliminary  for March  which will be particularly interesting on the back of this week s Fed meeting  where the central bank signalled concern about the momentum in the US economy  We still think Markit manufacturing PMI will stabilise  so we expect the manufacturing index to come in at 54  up from 53 
We also get euro area March flash PMIs  where we expect some stabilisation in the manufacturing index  which we see arriving at 49 1  while we see services PMI continuing to rebound to 53 1 due to solid domestic demand  Today also brings German PMI  improving activity in Germany s industry will be an important ingredient for the euro area growth rebound we still expect to take shape in Q2 
Selected market news 
The EU Council decided to offer the UK a very short unconditional extension of the Brexit deadline of two weeks to 12 April  with a possible extension to 22 May if the House of Commons passes the Withdrawal Agreement before that  If the House of Commons rejects the deal again  the UK will either leave without a deal on 12 April or alternatively indicate a way forward for the EU Council to consider  i e   among other things  accept participating in the European Elections in May   PM Theresa May accepted the terms  Basically  the EU leaders  agreement means that the UK has one more time to pass the deal but keeping the option of a long extension on the table  At the moment  a long extension seems more likely than the deal passing  as during the many votes in the House of Commons we saw a majority wanting to take a no deal Brexit off the table while May has still not found a majority for her deal as of now  That said  we have to watch the response from UK politicians in the coming days to see whether there will be a change of positions in British politics 
After the announcement  the GBP reversed earlier losses in Asian trading  US equity index futures  Treasuries and the USD were mostly steady  while 10Y Japanese bond yields fell to their lowest levels since November 2016 after disappointing inflation numbers 
While the Bank of England remained on hold amid mixed UK figures and growing Brexit uncertainties  yesterday Norges Bank  NB  hiked policy rates by 25bp as widely expected  but still delivered a hawkish surprise to the market by adjusting the rate path upwards  As Norges Bank supports our view on the relative performance of the Norwegian economy  we now expect NB to hike rates again in June  and deliver another rate hike in December  previous call was one 2019 hike in September   EUR NOK continues to test the 9 60 support level and we think the carry momentum argument has been significantly strengthened  with June becoming a live meeting  see  Norges Bank Review

The Swiss National Bank  SNB  kept all policy measures and signals unchanged yesterday as expected  The stance and another downward revision to inflation forecasts reflect a central bank that sees little relief in getting back to target  With the ECB sidelined  the SNB will have to remain patient for longer with little ability to shift into genuine  normalisation  mode  EUR CHF saw a delayed drop after the announcement and is a good example of the perceived asymmetry in reaction functions that haunt FX markets  SNB is constrained toolwise  while the Fed has room to cut  What about the ECB  Near term  we think FX markets will test its willingness to shift into easing mode again  This hints at a higher EUR easing risk premium on a 3M  NYSE MMM  horizon  which leaves downside risks to EUR USD intact in our view  Today  focus is on PMIs  which could be decisive in fostering this provided the relative cyclical outlook continues to favour the USD

2  Oil trades atop 2019 highs on OPEC  supply cuts  U S sanctions  gold lower

Oil hovers just shy of this year s high  supported by ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC  and by U S sanctions on Iran and Venezuela  However  market worries about an economic slowdown is capping crude prices from rallying further 

Brent crude oil futures are at   67 92 per barrel   6c above Thursday s close  Brent hit a four month high of   68 69 per barrel yesterday  U S West Texas Intermediate  WTI  futures are at   60 04 per barrel  up  5c  WTI printed a 2019 high in Thursday s session at   60 39 

Market consensus believes that OPEC is likely to extend its current supply cut deal for the duration of 2019 when they next meet in Vienna in June  Russia has been a reluctant partner in the supply cuts but is expected to opt to preserve the deal and retain a leadership role within the group that accounts for  45   of total global oil output 

Support for the  black stuff  has also come from U S sanctions against OPEC members Iran and Venezuela 

Note  Iranian crude oil shipments have averaged just over  1M bpd this month  down from  1 3M  NYSE MMM  bpd in February  while in Venezuela  production has plummeted from  3M bpd in 2000 to  1M bpd in 2019 

Ahead of the U S open gold has extended its losses  moving further away from its three week high print from yesterday  as appetite for some risk improved on upbeat U S economic data  The  yellow  metal remains on course for a third consecutive weekly gain

 The downturn in Germany s manufacturing sector has become more entrenched  with March s flash data showing accelerated declines in output  new orders and exports   IHS Markit economist Phil Smith says 

The latest set of national and eurozone purchasing managers  data should certainly add to downside risks for the EU s economy and increase further pressure on the ECB

We have a number of important events this week  with most prominently a potential Brexit vote tomorrow or Wednesday  as well as several central bank speeches potentially addressing the recent dovishness from policymakers  US trade negotiators are heading to Beijing for another round of talks later this week and Chinese vice PM Liu He is set to go to DC on 3 April 
Today s highlight on the data front is the German Ifo for March  After last week s uptick in ZEW expectations investors are becoming on balance a bit less pessimistic on the Eurozone Germany outlook  However  with the disappointing PMI manufacturing figures on Friday it is clear that the Germany is not out of the woods yet and challenges for the euro area recovery still lie ahead  see  Flash Comment  Growing manufacturing abyss challenges Eurozone outlook   
Selected market news 
The global manufacturing cycle continues to shift into lower gear  as both Eurozone and US manufacturing PMIs eased further in March  In Europe  weaker external demand continues to drive the deterioration in companies  order books  which are back at the worst levels since 2012  Especially Germany remains at the epicentre of the Eurozone manufacturing slowdown  leading us to revise down our forecast for German Q1 GDP growth to 0 2  q q  from 0 3  q q previously   see  Flash Comment  Growing manufacturing abyss challenges Eurozone outlook  
Following disappointing data releases on both sides of the Atlantic markets are getting increasingly worried about the global cyclical stance  Both the EUR and the Scandi currencies were sold off and rates markets headed south  10Y Bund yields moved below zero and in the US the yield curve has started to invert  with the 10Y Treasury yield falling below the 3M  NYSE MMM  rate for the first time since 2007   which historically has coincided with recession hitting within the next 12 months  However  the yield spread itself does not trigger an economic downturn and although the US industrial sector seems to have hit a rough patch   not being immune to global developments   we still think the US economy overall is in good shape and remains supported by fiscal stimulus this year  That said  we currently have a very strong combination of rapidly deteriorating global data combined with surprisingly soft rhetoric from the four major central banks  notable the Fed and the ECB  Hence  we see room for further fixed income performance and curve flattening this week  We continue to see 10Y Bund yields in a  10 to  15bp range the next couple of months and expect that we will soon move towards the lower end of that range 
This morning the sour risk sentiment seems to continue with Asian benchmarks in the red  while Brexit uncertainty remains elevated after reports that PM Theresa May is again facing pressure from her cabinet to resign  In the US risk sentiment might get a boost from news that US justice department special counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Donald Trump and his presidential campaign did not collude with Russia in an attempt to influence the 2016 election result  see  here

Especially  we see room for further curve flattening 5s10s in core  semi core and periphery  as the pivotal point on the curve in our view has moved from the 5Y point to the 10Y point given the strong carry hunt for yield environment created by global central banks  In Government Bonds Weekly we recommend to position for a flatter 5s10s curve in Ireland and Portugal  We recommend it on an outright basis rather than in a box versus Germany 
Often periphery and semi core cannot follow Germany higher in strong rallies  However  we do recommend to buy 10Y Belgium versus Bunds  as we have EUR13 7bn coming to the market in redemptions and coupons in Belgium this week  which also implies supportive ECB reinvestment flows in Belgium in Q2  Note we have closed our long 10Y Finland versus the Netherlands as we have reached our profit target 
This week there will be an estimated EUR18bn in supply from Germany and Italy  but with redemptions and coupons from Belgium  the net cash flow is only modestly negative  Germany will tap EUR4bn in the Mar 21 Schatz and EUR3bn in the Feb 29 Bund  while Italy taps in zero coupon bonds  linkers and nominals 
Sweden and Norway are also coming to the market with small tap auctions in the long end of the curve  we expect a tap in the 10Y NGB   announcement today at 12 00 CET   We expect no less than two more hikes this year  Hence  we expect the Norwegian 2s10s curve to flatten significantly in 2019  both outright and relative to peers   a development similar to what we saw in the US when the Fed started to hike a few years ago 
FX markets
With a US China trade deal postponed  focus for majors is clearly on where the global and the European cycle are heading and focus today will be on the German Ifo numbers  EUR USD has been supported in recent weeks by rate spreads moving in its favour  but towards the end of last week sentiment clearly shifted despite   or rather due to   a dovish Fed  Recession fears have clearly come back with a vengeance with the inversion of the US curve on Friday and to the extent that markets are grabbed near term by fears of a wider and deeper global slowdown  The scope for this to hit the EUR negatively is tangible in our view  the Fed is already priced for cuts  whereas the ECB is one of the few central banks that is effectively open for repricing in a softer direction given its option of restarting QE  We continue to see risks in EUR USD tilted to the downside short term and the plethora of Fed and ECB speakers this week could prove instrumental in this respect 
The Brexit saga continues  last week the EU gave the UK one more chance to pass May s deal  vote likely Tuesday or Wednesday  but a long extension of the Brexit deadline seems more likely than the deal passing  A long extension should be mildly positive for GBP  as the chance of a second referendum would increase 
Meanwhile  even though the six figure rally in EUR SEK seems overdone  the fundamental link is that a sharp slowdown in Europe will bring down Sweden too  This week brings lots of Swedish macro data  e g   the Riksbank business survey  Tuesday  and NIER data  Wednesday   We see EUR SEK at 10 50 and 10 40 in 1 3M  For the NOK  we continue to emphasise that mainland Norwegian exports are much less sensitive to a slowdown in Europe than one may think  Indeed  that was one of the reasons behind the hawkish NorgesBank message last week  If global sentiment stabilises  this further underpins a rebound in the NOK ",2019-03-25,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danske-daily--recession-fears-make-a-comeback-200403395,200403395

Today s calendar is rather thin  Although we have a range of Fed speakers today  Evans  Harker and Daly   they will likely fade into the background for markets for now  as the Fed has clearly signalled it is on hold for the rest of the year 
In Scandinavia  Danish retail sales are due for release  see next page  
Overnight to Wednesday  the central bank of New Zealand will meet  no rate change is expected   We also get Chinese industrial profits 
Next focal point for markets are the indicative votes in the UK parliament and some notable ECB speakers at the Watcher s conference tomorrow 
Selected market news 
Yesterday  PM Theresa May was forced to abandon plans to hold a third  meaningful vote   after members of parliament voted in favour of taking control over the Brexit process by demanding a series of indicative votes on a way forward taking place on Wednesday  While this is another sign that May is Prime Minister in name only  it may actually help getting her deal over the finish line  as some of the Brexiteers  who have made life very difficult for her  seem afraid of losing control of Brexit  as it increases the likelihood of a softer Brexit  customs union or Norway style single market participation  or a long extension  Still  May will likely need to get more Labour MPs on board to get her deal through parliament  The indicative votes will not be legally binding and hence we do not know how the EU will respond  As the issue in the UK parliament is still that there is no majority for anything  it remains to be seen whether this is the start towards a compromise in a softer Brexit direction  Our base case remains a long extension but the development on Wednesday is crucial near term  We cannot rule out Theresa May resigning or a general election at this point 
The Eurozone gloom that captured markets late last week subsided somewhat yesterday  when Germany s Ifo index for March painted a somewhat less bleak picture of the state of the economy than the PMIs on Friday  see  Flash Comment  Growing manufacturing abyss challenges Eurozone outlook   Both companies  assessment of the current situation as well as business expectations registered a first small rebound since August 2018  That said  with abundant challenges still on the horizon   not least with regard to Brexit   the German economy is far from being out of the woods just yet  
Despite a better than feared Ifo reading  the global FI rally got another boost yesterday as the 10Y US treasury yield dropped below 2 40  and 10Y German Bund yields dropped to  3bp  Still  as pessimism over the global growth outlook eased a little  FX markets calmed down a bit after a nervous end to last week  while Asian equities rebounded overnight and S P 500 futures also point to a higher opening today  Along with global markets Brent oil rebounded above USD67 bbl on news of a surge in Russian crude exports 
Scandi markets
In Denmark  we get retail sales figures for February today  Retail sales  a useful indicator for private consumption  have disappointed in recent months  This may in part be due to lacklustre January sales  when clothing prices were not quite as low as they usually are  Riksbank s business survey is released 09 30 CET  Last time in November  the message was  strong growth with indication of moderation   probably something less upbeat now  Riksbank Governor Skingsley speaks on digitalisation at 12 00 CET 
Fixed income markets
In the US the 2Y 5Y segment is outperforming on the curve as the market continues to price in rate cuts  whereas the curve continues to flatten 5s10s in Bunds  We continue to favour positioning for flatter EGB curves  5s10s  and target  10bp for 10Y Bund yields  We are approaching month end and yesterday we published our month end index extension update  France is set to experience the greatest weight increase of 0 39pp  as well as a modest increase in duration of 0 12 on the back of the addition of FRTR 0 50  2029 in March  France contributes 45 9  to the total duration change of 0 135 
Today  the German Finanzagentur will sell EUR4bn in the Mar 21 Schatz  Despite a yield of  57bp  there should be good demand given the uncertain risk picture  Norges Bank yesterday announced that it will somewhat surprisingly tap the old 10Y benchmark NGB 4 28 by NOK3bn tomorrow 
Given the weakness in European data  the market is increasingly discussing the next ECB step  ECB s Hansson  who normally belongs to the hawkish part of the ECB  yesterday said that the new TLTROs might be less favourable  Importantly  he also said that QE could be restarted in the event of a major shock and that further use of forward guidance is an option as well  Note also that Coeure yesterday underlined that the ECB is not at the limit of what it can do yet 
FX markets
EUR USD is back around 1 13   our 3M  NYSE MMM  target   and near term the cross is in the hands of central banks as both the ECB and the Fed are clearly revisiting their previous pre set paths at the moment  Watch out for Fed speakers today  ECB ones tomorrow  With the indicative votes taking place tomorrow Brexit uncertainty remains elevated  but in any case  as we are in our view heading for a long extension  we see EUR GBP in a range around 0 85 for an extended period of time 
EUR SEK continues to head lower but this week the Swedish dividend season kicks off for real with a couple of big payouts from Wednesday through Friday  see FX Strategy Dividends  seasonality and the SEK  We argue that the SEK negative flow stories that tend to pop up are not very convincing  first because if dividends are reinvested  which we think is common  there are no flows and  second  the seasonality that we have seen over the past few years seems to stem from dovish news from the Riksbank rather than dividends  whereas in earlier years the SEK always appreciated during the dividend season  Still  we think it may be important to keep track of certain dates  not least because of these flow speculations  Today  we focus on the Riksbank s business survey  which could be a SEK mover  Elsewhere in the Scandies  EUR DKK FX forwards continue to trade at low levels  i e  the 3M tenor has traded around minus 21bp for some weeks now  The Q1 turn has notoriously been tricky for this market due to tight liquidity owing to seasonality in Danish tax payments  which tends to trigger a rise in EUR DKK FX forwards  This year should be different though  since the liquidity is likely to exceed DKK200bn on Friday  around DKK80bn more than last year   In turn  it should dampen any upward pressure on EUR DKK FX forwards around the Q1 turn ",2019-03-26,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danske-daily--brexit-reshuffle-200400933,200400933
194270,415786,MMM,Pound Unfazed By Latest Brexit Development,opinion,"Tuesday March 26  Five things the markets are talking about
Global equities have rallied overnight after two session of losses as the U S 10 year Treasury yields backed away from this year s low yield print  but the outlook remains somewhat uncertain as investors weigh the possibility of the U S slipping into a recession 
Note  The 10 year note has backed up to  2 442   having lost  5 bps yesterday and dropped temporary below the three month bill 
U K MP s take control for a day
In FX  sterling   1 3185  has edged lower after PM Theresa May lost control over the Brexit process in a U K Parliament vote late last night  MP s may now be able to demand that the PM pursues radical Plan B options  potentially including a second referendum  keeping Britain in the EU union  or even canceling Brexit  Remember  a no deal Brexit does remain on the table 
MP s are expected to vote on a range of Brexit options tomorrow  Mar 27   basically looking to agree on a deal with closer ties to Brussels   and then try to drive the government in that direction 
In commodities  oil prices have rallied for the first time in a number of days amid rising tensions in Venezuela that again threaten to further curb supplies 
On tap  U S consumer confidence   RBNZ monetary policy announcement  Mar 26   CAD trade balance   NZD business confidence  Mar 27   U S final GDP  Mar 28   GBP current a c  CAD GDP   U K Parliament vote  Mar 29  
1  Stocks given the  green  light
In Japan  the Nikkei rallied aggressively from its five week lows print on Monday to close sharply higher overnight as cyclical stocks rose on short covering  The market is also being supported by investor purchases of stocks before they go ex dividend at the end of March  The Nikkei share average ended  2 15  higher  while the broader Topix rallied  2 57  
Down under  Aussie shares closed marginally higher overnight  helped by mining shares and an uptick in U S Treasury yields  The S P ASX 200 index firmed nearly  0 1   The benchmark fell  1 1  on Monday  In S  Korea  the Kospi stock index rose slightly   0 18   overnight as foreigners turned net buyers following Monday s sharp selloff  The index has risen  5 28  so far this year and fallen  1 5  in the previous 30 trading sessions 
In China  shares fell overnight  extending this week s sharp losses as investors remain concerned over the outlook for global growth and the next round of China U S trade talks to take place later this week  Mar 28 29   At the close  the Shanghai Composite index was down  1 51   while the blue chip CSI300 index was down  1 13  
In Hong Kong  equities were steady after Monday s heavy losses  but investor sentiment remains fragile as concerns over the possibility of a U S recession happening  and as China and the U S prepare for this week s high level trade talks  At the close of trade  the Hang Seng index was up  0 15  
In Europe  regional indices trade mostly higher following on from a stronger session in Asia overnight and higher U S futures this morning 
U S stocks are set to open in the  black    0 25   
Indices  Stoxx600  0 29  at 375 42  FTSE  0 41  at 7 207 25  DAX  0 06  at 11 340 28  CAC 40  0 35  at 5 279 12  IBEX 35  0 04  at 9 183 12  FTSE MIB  0 15  at 21 090 50  SMI  0 52  at 9 354 10  S P 500 Futures  0 25 

2  Oil prices rise amid ongoing supply cuts  but recession fears loom  gold lower
Oil prices have rallied overnight  pushed up by supply cuts led by OPEC  and U S sanctions against Iran and Venezuela  although investor concerns about a potential recession is keeping a lid on the market for now 
Brent crude oil futures are at   67 48 per barrel  up  27c  or  0 4   from yesterday s close  U S West Texas Intermediate  WTI  futures are at   59 35 per barrel  up  53c  or  0 9   from Monday s settlement 
Oil prices have been supported for much of this year by efforts by OPEC   who have pledged to withhold around  1 2M bpd of supply this year to prop up markets 
Market consensus believes that OPEC is likely to extend its current supply cut deal for the duration of 2019 when they next meet in Vienna in June  Russia has been a reluctant partner in the supply cuts but is expected to opt to preserve the deal and retain a leadership role within the group that accounts for  45   of total global oil output 
Support for the  black stuff  has also come from U S sanctions against OPEC members Iran and Venezuela 
Note  Iranian crude oil shipments have averaged just over  1M bpd this month  down from  1 3M  NYSE MMM  bpd in February  while in Venezuela  production has plummeted from  3M bpd in 2000 to  1M bpd in 2019 
However  recession risk is at an 11 year high  and it s this fear that could dent global fuel consumption 
Ahead of the U S open  gold prices have eased overnight  after hitting a one month high in Monday s session  as a recovery in equity prices and U S Treasury yields help reduce some of the  yellow  metal s safe haven appeal  Spot gold is down  0 3  at   1 317 46 per ounce  after touching its highest since Feb  28 at   1 324 33 yesterday  U S gold futures are down  0 4  at   1 317 10 an ounce 

3  Sovereign yields back up  but recession fears loom
Ten year German government Bund yield remains below the psychological zero print as recession fears dominate market sentiment and Brexit troubles drain market liquidity 
U K MP s voted Monday to take control of parliament for a day from PM May  meaning they are now expected to vote on various Brexit options tomorrow 
However  a  no deal  Brexit actually occurring would see a massive swing to owning more German bunds  which could push the 10 year Bund yield much deeper into negative territory and trigger more flattening of the long end of the German yield curve  and a very strong widening of credit indices 
Currently  German Bund yields remain atop of their three year low at  0 027   as fears of global economic slowdown continue to dictate investment strategies along with Brexit 
The U S 10 year Treasury yield   2 428   fell to their lowest since December 2017 yesterday  causing the curve between three month bills and 10 year notes to invert further as investors evaluated last week s  dovish  pivot by the Fed 
Elsewhere  Aussie 10 year yields hit a fresh record low overnight before rising about  5 bps to  1 83  

4  Pound unfazed by latest Brexit development
Sterling   1 3175  trades largely flat after posting a modest rise yesterday after the U K parliament voted to take control of the Brexit process  Market consensus believes the majority of MP s would prefer a move toward a permanent custom union option  which would in turn would require an extension of Article 50 by the year end  The downside is that a long extension to Brexit would bring  prolonged uncertainty   EUR GBP is at  0 8576  U K MP s will now decide whether to back  indicative  votes on alternatives to U K PM May s divorce deal 
Elsewhere  the yen has slipped  0 2  to  110 15  while the offshore yuan is steady at  6 7144 and the EUR is little changed at  1 1317 
Note  The focus is on the Hungary Central bank rate decision where the MNB is likely to begin its  normalization  process  

5  German consumer morale slips despite job market
German data this morning shows that German consumers are less optimistic heading into April despite a renewed growth outlook and a vibrant labour market 
Market research firm GfK s forward looking monthly barometer stood at 10 4 points for April  down on 10 7 for March 
The gap has  once again narrowed  between rising consumer expectations of changing economic conditions and declining earnings related conditions  against the backdrop of strong labour market performance  the GfK noted 
 The coming months will show whether this is the beginning of a turnaround   said GfK in a statement 
The pollsters said consumers  do not expect Germany to slip into a recession this year  
They do however expect a noticeable slowdown in the economy  like Germany s  wise men  panel advising the government who last week lowered their GDP growth forecast for this year to just 0 8 percent 
Also weighing on the GfK survey was a drop in both expectations of income and desire to consume  the latter of which has fallen to a level last seen two years ago 
Note  German unemployment remains at historic lows  with just  5 0  of people out of work in Europe s largest economy

With one exception  Norges Bank   central banks have in recent weeks given in on  normalisation  efforts  Table 1  by either going on hold  Fed  BoC   postponing a first hike  RBA  ECB  BoE  or disclosing their locked positions  BoJ  SNB   We now see no more Fed hikes in this cycle    FOMC review    and for USD this means that carry momentum is ebbing out amid stretched long positioning and overvaluation  A USD downtrend  It is too early as talk of rate cuts is premature with the US economy to stay in decent shape this year  For EUR  a key question is if ECB will shift its rhetoric to whether   rather than when   a first hike is warranted  The bar for ECB to  do more  is clearly lower after the March meeting  but it remains high due to a constrained toolbox and a new president in the autumn 
What then about EUR USD  The cross has decoupled from relative rates lately  rate spreads have moved in favour of a higher EUR USD   both in nominal and real terms  Chart 1  and across tenors  Our Short Term Financial Model estimate currently stands at 1 15  Chart 2   Together with a smaller risk of a no deal Brexit  this helps to explain why the cross has failed to move lower despite Eurozone weakness lately  Will this support last  We think not  Global nominal yields have grinded lower since early autumn  but so have inflation expectations  suggesting market confidence in central banks has been in decline  In the US  break even inflation rates started to recover around New Year when Fed shifted its stance  but Eurozone ones still look fragile  Thus  euro real rates remain on the rise  Chart 3  and elevated spreads to the US do not seem warranted by relative cycles  We expect global growth concerns continue to linger near term   indeed our quantitative business cycle model Macroscope increasingly calls for stamina in this respect   which suggests ECB will have to put its money where its mouth is and bring lower real yields  Will it deliver  History says not  enough   that said  we do see potential for a wider  ECB easing risk premium  to weigh on EUR USD    FX Strategy    but to send EUR USD below 1 10 will require a fundamental shift in ECB s stance on rates  e g  more negative  and we doubt that will be delivered  However  we are not in for a firm EUR uptrend either just yet  for this  we need much firmer signs of a self sustainable Eurozone recovery 
On a 3M horizon  we see EUR USD trapped in a range around 1 13 but with risks tilted to the downside as ECB will be forced to keep a soft stance at a time where Fed looks more side lined  Relative cyclical hints will be key near term   but a trade deal could be a knee jerk USD positive  Beyond the 6M horizon  a drift higher will materialise as the skies clear a bit for the Eurozone  but we still merely target 1 17 in 12M  For now  ECB has effectively put a lid on the cross and with still heavy carry  we continue to advocate risk reversals when hedging USD income assets  From  FX Top Trades 2019 we are long USD  versus SEK  JPY  CHF  for the carry  but due to the outlook for a fragile risk environment for some time still we close the JPY and CHF legs  Table 2   effectively leaving us long USD SEK spot

194272,415788,MMM,Danske Daily   Brexit Vote Looms Tonight ,opinion,"Market movers today 
Today is rather heavy for market moving events on data  Brexit and ECB speakers  On the data front  the Norwegian labour force survey and Swedish manufacturing confidence are released  page 2  
On the central bank front  several ECB officials are due to speak at the annual ECB watchers  conference  which definitely has the potential to move markets  Programme can be seen  here   Most prominently  Draghi will speak at 9 00 am and Praet at 9 45 am CET 
On the political front  we have yet another round of indicative votes today on Brexit in the UK  watch out for what they will vote on  especially the formulation on softer versions of Brexit  as it would be important for whether the House of Commons can support it or not   Remember  the indicative Brexit votes are not legally binding and we do not know how the EU will respond  although EU leaders will probably welcome a softer stance  This  however  will likely require a longer extension to negotiate  The main problem about Brexit is there is no majority for anything  except for a majority being against a no deal Brexit  and the House of Commons has voted most proposals down already in one way or another  so what has changed  Voting starts at 20 00 CET and results will likely be in 21 30 23 00 CET  for more details see The Guardian  
Selected market news 
On Brexit  all eyes are on the indicative votes tonight and to what extent they will bring clarity on the way forward   Yesterday  more Brexiteers including now officially Jacob Rees Mogg  one of the most prominent Brexiteers  are now suggesting they will  or are close to  support May s deal  as they see the alternative is a softer  not a harder  Brexit  We have argued for a long time that this would probably happen eventually  The problem is that DUP does not seem near supporting May s deal just yet and yesterday DUP s Wilson said a long extension would be better than May s deal  It would probably also help if PM Theresa May was willing to step down but she is unlikely to give in to this demand before she knows it is sufficient to get the deal over the finishing line  Even if DUP and most Conservatives support the deal  May will probably still need Labour votes  as both conservative die hard remainers and Brexiteers  although small in number  are voting against the deal no matter what
In relation to the economic outlook for the Eurozone   it was interesting to see the bounce in the INSEE measure of French business confidence for the month of March  This was the third confidence measure over the past two days  after yesterday s German IFO and Belgium business confidence measures  to suggest improvement in Europe in March rather than the significant decline implied by the manufacturing PMI data last week  While markets may place more weight on the PMI data  at least so far there is not sufficient evidence to suggest its decline has been universal across other survey based measures
Scandi markets
In Sweden  we have been somewhat surprised to see the manufacturing industry staying so upbeat in the NIER data  index levels well above 110   We are not alone  though  as companies seem to be positively surprised according to the Riksbank company survey  Now  the industry complains over inventories being too large and as a result of that sees a slowdown in production going forward  which suggest that the manufacturing index should edge lower  NIER publishes fresh data at 09 00 CET alongside its new macro forecast at 09 15 CET  We also get foreign trade data and household lending data today  both due for release at 09 30 CET  At 08 00 CET  the FSA publishes its yearly Swedish Mortgage Market Report 
In Norway  employment is continuing to grow strongly  and although the supply of labour is also expanding  unemployment is still falling  albeit at a more moderate tempo  We therefore expect  seasonally adjusted  NAV unemployment for March to be unchanged at 2 3  and LFS unemployment for January  December February  also to be unchanged at 3 7  
Fixed income markets
Despite the better risk appetite 10Y Bund yields barely moved higher yesterday underlining the strong support to Bunds  Today  we have a number of key ECB speakers at the annual ECB watchers  conference  Draghi will speak at 9 00 and Praet at 9 45  Both will be speaking on monetary policy in public for the first time since the March policy meeting  We expect Draghi to strike a cautious tone on the economic and monetary policy outlook and with the door opened for monetary policy easing this includes a readiness to act should data warrant that  We do not expect any comments on the TLTRO modalities  Praet will participate in a panel called  next step in policy normalisation  
The German Finanzagentur will be in the market again today selling EUR 3bn in the 2 29 Bund  Despite trading with a below zero yield demand is expected to be healthy 
Norges Bank will NGB 4 28 today with a volume of NOK3bn on 27 March  The decision to tap this nine year bond was slightly surprising given the need to increase market liquidity in the new 10 year benchmark bond  However  the upcoming tap will be one of very few opportunities to buy this bond at auctions in 2019 and demand will probably be good  We continue to expect a significant flattening of the NGB curve in 2019  have a positive view on the NOK and the NOK ASW curve remain steep  see Fixed Income Research 
Sweden will tap a modest SEK2 5bn in total in the 10Y and 13Y SGB  Given the modest supply of SGBs and the growing probability that the Riksbank will follow in the footsteps of the ECB  we expect strong investor demand at the auction  There is still plenty of room for performance in the 10Y segment where SGB 11 29 trades 36bp above DBR 2 29  Finally  in Denmark 30Y callable mortgage bonds continue to perform and two mortgage institutes yesterday announced that they will open a 1  30Y callable bond that will be the main issuance paper for 30Y fixed rate mortgages in case the current 1 5  2050 bond with amortization moves above par 
FX markets
EUR DKK rose above 7 4650 yesterday  The dividend season is not fully over and FX forwards continue to trade deep in negative territory  which may be the key drivers behind the move higher  We look for EUR DKK to fall back on 3M  NYSE MMM  to 7 4570 
The SEK may take direction from today s Swedish macro data  see Scandi section  although global growth factors and risk sentiment including Brexit also have a saying for the Scandies  Yesterday  we published Danske s FX Thermometer where clients remain bullish on SEK and  in particular  NOK while being hawkish on Scandinavian central banks 
Finally  in FX Strategy  EUR USD trap   escape routes blocked we stress that on a 3M horizon  we see EUR USD trapped in a range around 1 13 but with risks tilted to the downside as ECB will be forced to keep a soft stance at a time when Fed looks more sidelined  Beyond the 6M horizon  a drift higher will materialise as the skies clear a bit for the Eurozone  but we still merely target 1 17 in 12M  For now  ECB has effectively put a lid on the cross   today keep an eye on speakers at the ECB Watchers  conference 
Yesterday  the Hungarian central bank joined the small group of central banks tightening monetary policy  The central bank raised its depo rate by 10bp to  0 05   It was however a  dovish tightening  as the central bank governor stressed that the hike was a  one off  despite the rise in core inflation  The HUF consequently weakened  but we see the weakening as a strategic buying opportunity as we see the EUR HUF declining to 310 on 6 12M basis ",2019-03-27,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danske-daily--brexit-vote-looms-tonight-200401330,200401330

194281,415797,MMM,Aussie Dollar Drops On Coal Ban,opinion,"Thursday February 21  Five things the markets are talking about
Euro equities are struggling for direction  unlike most of its Asian counterparts in the overnight session  The  big  dollar has edged a tad higher after Wednesday s FOMC minutes  while the Chinese yuan extended gains ahead of Sino U S trade talks amongst senior officials  Down under  the AUD  A 0 7108  dropped as much as  1 1  in the overnight session after a news report said China s Dalian port authorities had banned imports of Australian coal 
Hawkish U turn
Yesterday s highly anticipated January Fed minutes did not disappoint  They showed officials see  tighter financial conditions  as one of the biggest risks to the U S economy  They cited  slower global growth and deteriorating consumer and business sentiment as risks to the outlook  
Their December statement said the risks were  roughly balanced   but in the January statement  they dropped this language and instead emphasized that  global economic and financial conditions  called for the Fed to be patient in evaluating the economic outlook  This suggests the Fed has put its plans for rate hikes on hold  despite officials signalling that a rate increase remains on the table 
On tap  The European Central Bank  ECB  releases its monetary policy minutes this morning  07 30 am ET   while Bank of Canada  BoC  Governor Stephen Poloz will also speak on Thursday  12 35 pm ET  and ECB President Mario Draghi speaks on Friday  10 30 am ET   a day after Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  Governor Philip Lowe gives his parliamentary testimony  05 30 pm ET  
1  Stocks mixed results
In Japan  the Nikkei reversed course and ended higher overnight on investor optimism over Sino U S trade talks supporting companies which have large exposure to China  The Nikkei share average ended  0 2  higher  for a fourth consecutive session of gains  The broader Topix ended flat at the close 
Down under  Aussie stocks traded higher overnight after Australian conglomerate  Wesfarmers   7    reported a jump in profit and wider margins  while robust January jobs data boosted overall sentiment  The S P ASX 200 Index at the close was  0 7  higher  In S  Korea  the Kospi index recouped losses to end flat overnight following reports that the U S and China were outlining agreements on the  stickiest trade issues   The index lost  0 05  
In Hong Kong  stocks ended higher as signs of progress in trade talks between the U S and China boosted investor hopes  The Hang Seng index settled  0 41  higher  while the Hang Seng China Enterprises index rose  0 68  
The outlier was China  were stocks surrendered gains to end lower overnight  as enthusiasm over progress in U S trade talks gave way to concerns that the PBoC would not resort to aggressive interest rate cuts to boost growth  At the close  the Shanghai Composite index fell  0 34   while the blue chip CSI300 index declined  0 27

2  Oil hovers atop of year highs on cuts  gold little changed
Oil prices hovered atop of this year s highs this morning  supported by OPEC  led supply cuts and U S sanctions on Venezuela and Iran  however  crude prices are capped by slowing growth in the global economy 
Brent crude futures have eased by  14c  or  0 2   to   66 94 after touching a 2019 high yesterday at   67 38  while U S West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude oil futures are at   57 14 a barrel  down  2c  but close to a 2019 high of   57 55 reached Wednesday 
The supply curbs led by OPEC have helped crude prices rally more than  20  in 2019 
Note  OPEC member Nigeria signaled yesterday that it would limit output after its production climbed last month 
The main factor keeping oil prices from rising even further is soaring U S output  which rose by more than  2M bpd last year to a record  11 9M bpd 
The increase in production has resulted in rising U S oil inventories  Data from API yesterday showed that U S crude oil stocks rose by  1 3M  NYSE MMM  MMM barrels to  448 5M barrels in the week to Feb  15 
Expect traders to take direction from this morning s production data report which is due from the U S Energy Information Administration  EIA  at 11 00 am ET 
Note  OPEC last week lowered its forecast for growth in world oil demand this year to  1 24M bpd   however  there are some analysts who believe that number  could be weaker still  
Ahead of the U S open  gold is trading a tad shy of its 10 month peak as the  big  dollar has gained some support on rate  hawks  optimism that the Fed has another rate hike on their agenda this year  Spot gold is steady at   1 338 76 per ounce  having touched   1 346 73 per ounce in the previous session  its highest level since April 2018  U S gold futures are down  0 5  at   1 341 80 an ounce 
Note  Investors are also keeping a close eye Sino U S trade talks 

3  Eurozone yields back up as PMI s signal growth
Eurozone bond yields backed up  2 3 bps along the curve after surveys showed business activity was surprisingly firm this month  particularly in France  though poor manufacturing readings across the bloc kept a lid on the move 
French PMI s showed that French business activity rose more than expected as manufacturing growth helped offset slack in services and this despite the  yellow vests protests  
In Germany  Europe s strongest economy  the PMI number was more of a mixed picture  with the services sector accelerating to a five month high  compensating for a second successive monthly contraction in manufacturing 
Germany s 10 year Bund yield was  1 bps higher at  0 11   having hit a one week high of  0 124  earlier  just after the French PMI survey 
Elsewhere  the yield on U S 10 year notes climbed  1 bps to  2 66   while in the U K  the 10 year Gilt yield advanced  1 bps  1 19   reaching the highest in two weeks on its fifth straight advance 

4  Aussie dollar drops on coal ban
The AUD  A 0 7108  dropped as much as  1 1  in the overnight session after a news report said China s Dalian port authorities had banned imports of Australian coal  Apparently  they imposed the indefinite ban covering five harbors at the start of February  Coal was Australia s second biggest export in the year through June 2018  making up  15  of exports 
EUR USD   1 1342  saw its initial gains erode after the major European PMI data registered mixed readings  Germany s export heavy manufacturing sector fell deeper into contraction territory  while Eurozone registered its first contraction in over five years  Investors now wait for this morning s ECB minutes 
GBP USD   1 3064  has drifted off its highs after EU s Juncker stated that  Brexit was a disaster  and that he was suffering from Brexit fatigue  Could not exclude the possibility of a no deal with terrible consequences  Earlier Chancellor of the Exchequer Hammond had noted that he saw some movement from EU side on backstop issue 

5  U K posts record budget surplus
Data this morning showed that the U K  government posted its largest budget surplus for a single month in January 
The ONS said the government brought in   14 9B more in tax and other revenues during the month than it spent  the largest surplus for a single month since records began in 1993 
Note  January historically tends to be a strong month as it s the month in which many people settle their tax bills 
The large surplus would suggest that U K government could still meet its   25 5B borrowing target  despite a slowing economy

194282,415798,MMM,Fed Tightening To Push EUR USD FX Forwards Up Again ,opinion,"In our view  the decline in EUR USD FX forwards over the past couple of months is temporary 
Two 25bp Fed hikes and a 40  tightening of USD liquidity are set to push EUR USD FX forwards higher over the course of the year 
We look for the Fed to provide clarity about the outlook for its quantitative tightening programme  QT  at the upcoming March meeting  including preannouncing an end to QT in Q4 this year 
The 12M EUR USD FX forwards are currently priced about 15bp too low to fully account for this scenario 
Hence  EUR  and DKK based clients with USD assets and a hedging mandate may consider hedging further out the curve  i e  1Y 

Repricing of EUR USD FX forward curve
During the past three to four months  there has been a significant repricing of the EUR USD FX forward curve  EUR USD FX forwards across the curve have moved to the left and in addition  the curve has flattened  see chart 2   The 12M EUR USD FX forwards are currently trading around 3 11   down from around 3 45  at the peak in mid November last year 
The move is mainly the result of the two following factors   1  The repricing of the future path of the Fed funds rate since last November  The market has put the brakes on further Fed hikes  which has led to a decline in US rates   2  The EUR USD OIS basis tightened the past year   1Y EUR USD OIS basis now trades close to  30bp compared to  70bp around this time last year  See chart 3 for an illustration of this development 

Fed to resume hiking cycle in June
We are quite confident that the Fed is set to restart its hiking cycle when we get to the June meeting  In our view  concerns about the outlook for US growth have been exaggerated and we expect the lingering uncertainty with respect to the trade war and Brexit to fade out  Furthermore  market based inflation expectations have started to recover 
We look for a 25bp hike in June and another 25bp in December  After that  the Fed is likely done hiking rates  The market on the other hand is pricing a slightly lower effective Fed funds rate at the end of this year and a high probability of a rate cut next year  See chart 4 for an illustration 
Until June  it will be interesting to see if the ongoing fall in bank reserves due to  among other things  Fed s QT  will lead to renewed upwards pressure on the effective Fed funds rate  see chart 5   In the big picture  it will not be important for the direction of EUR USD FX forwards since the Fed is likely to contain the upward pressure through adjustments of the interest rate on excess reserves 

Fed to announce Q4 end to QT at March meeting
Based on the minutes from the January FOMC meeting and the recent string of comments from Fed members  we now expect the Fed to announce that it plans to end QT in Q4 this year  We further look for the Fed to clarify its intention to swap its holdings of mortgagebacked securities for US Treasuries and gradually reduce the maturity on SOMA  Finally  we expect the Fed to maintain a constant size of its balance sheet for some time after the end of QT 

This outlook has a number of implications for USD liquidity  The total supply of bank reserves will be just north of USD1 000bn when Fed ends QT  see chart 6   However  a constant size of the Fed s balance sheet means that the supply of bank reserves will continue to tighten since the trend higher in non reserve liabilities  e g  currency in circulation  will eat into the supply of bank reserves by more than USD100bn per year  see chart 7  
This passive form of QT will matter as it effectively tightens the available supply of high quality liquid assets  HQLA  to banks  Holding more US Treasuries instead of mortgagebacked securities will have a similar effect due to how these assets are classified  See Research US Fed s regulatory hurdle for starting quantitative tightening for our 2017 primer on the subject 
Based on this outlook  there is limited scope in our view for the EUR USD OIS basis to tighten further from the already quite tight levels  see chart 8   An announcement from the Fed on the outlook for QT in March is set to provide clarity to the market  but if we are right that QT will continue until the end of the year  USD liquidity will tighten another 40  from the current level 
The market is currently pricing a premium on overnight EUR USD FX forwards around 18  over year end if we take into account that it is a two day turn  It seems about fair at the current stage compared to price action the past years  see chart 9  

Outlook for EUR USD FX forwards
Based on our analysis above  in our view  the decline in EUR USD FX forwards over the past couple of months is only temporary  The Fed is set to continue to tighten on all levels this year  i e  hiking rates another 50bp in total and tightening USD liquidity another 40  from the current level 
The USD OIS market and EUR USD OIS basis market are not priced for this outlook  In turn  EUR USD FX forwards are bound to return towards the highs from last year  The 12M EUR USD FX forwards are currently priced about 15bp too low to fully account for the scenario sketched above  See chart 1 on the front page for an outline of our projection of 3M  NYSE MMM  EUR USD FX forwards relative to current market pricing 
Hence  EUR  and DKK based clients with USD assets and a hedging mandate may consider hedging further out the curve  i e  1Y  which is the horizon we look at here  to hedge the impact of additional Fed rate hikes and tighter USD liquidity on EUR USD and USD DKK FX forwards ",2019-02-26,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fed-tightening-to-push-eurusd-fx-forwards-up-again-200392449,200392449

2  Oil rallies as OPEC set to continue supply cuts  gold steady
Oil prices have rallied overnight after a report of declining U S crude inventories and as OPEC  seems content to stick to its supply cuts despite pressure from President Trump 
Brent crude futures are at   65 48 per barrel  up  27c  or  0 4  from Tuesday s close U S West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude oil futures are at   55 89 per barrel  up  39c  or  0 7  
Data yesterday from the API showed that U S crude oil inventories fell by  4 2M barrels in the week to Feb  22  to  444 3M  NYSE MMM  barrels 
Crude oil prices have generally received support this year from supply curbs by OPEC  who agreed in 2018 to cut output by  1 2M bpd to prop up prices 
Note  OPEC  has indicated it will continue to withhold supply despite pressure from Trump this week to stop artificially tightening markets 
Expect investors to take directional support from this morning s EIA report at 10 30 am ET 
Ahead of the U S open  gold is holding steady despite the  big  dollar trading near its three week lows  after U S Fed Powell reiterated that the central bank  will be patient in hiking interest rates   Spot gold is down  0 1  at   1 327 26 per ounce  while U S gold futures are flat at   1 329 

3  Strong Spanish bond sales a good sign
Spanish government bond yields are holding close to their two year lows this morning after a very strong 15 year bond sale  Even the eurozone periphery bonds are in demand as progress in Sino U S trade talks continue to support a healthy demand for riskier assets 
Note  This week sees a number of periphery auctions  Expect dealers to cheapen up their curves to take down supply  
This morning  Spain s 10 year bond yield has fallen to a 28 month low of  1 126  after yesterday s sovereign sale and holding near to that level this morning has pulled Italian and Portuguese equivalents lower too 
Also providing some support for E U regional product is the fact that the Fed s Jerome Powell threw up no surprises yesterday   the Fed is in no rush to makes any changes to interest rates anytime soon  decisions are  data dependent  
Elsewhere  the yield on U S 10 year Treasuries has eased  1 bps to  2 63   the lowest in a month  In Germany  the 10 year Bund yield fell less than  1 bps to  0 11   while in the U K  the 10 year Gilt yield has climbed less than  1 bps to  1 21   the highest in three weeks 

4  Dollar s slippery slope
Ahead of the U S open  the  mighty  USD is on  soft  footing in the aftermath of Fed Chair Powell s semi annual testimony in Congress and seems well contained within recent quarterly ranges for G10 currency pairs  The Fed chair reiterated that policy decisions would continue to be  data dependent  and that in no rush to make a judgment about changes in policy

The EUR is unmoved by the weakening consumer sentiment in Europe  given that it had already risen to the key psychological level of  1 14 on the back of a weaker dollar  Analysts are anticipating that the  single  unit will begin to struggle to rise from here  Strong resistance at  1 1425 30 

5  Eurozone slowdown fears underlined by weak money and lending data

The ECB s key indicator of the money supply  M3  grew  3 8  y y through January  down from December s  4 1  growth rate  Markets were looking for a  4  growth 
A positive in today s report was that lending to households was stable in January  It rose  3 2  y y  the same as in December 2018

194284,415800,MMM,Danske Daily   Worried ECB Opens The Door For Easing ,opinion,"Market movers today 
Markets will continue to digest the ECB news yesterday  Note that the ECB s Nowotny is speaking this morning at 09 00 am CET 
The key focus today will be the US labour market report at 14 30 CET  We think average hourly earnings rose  0 25  m m in February  which means an increase in the annual growth rate to 3 3  y y  up from 3 2   while we expect the change in nonfarm payrolls to come in at 190k  Regarding nonfarm payrolls  it seems employment growth has reached its high and has stabilised around its current level of 1 7  y y  At the moment  the labour market is still strong  but in our view it is important to keep an eye on deceleration in employment 
German factory orders are also worth keeping an eye on at 08 00 CET  The numbers should give an indication of whether the euro area is close to the bottom or not 
A range of data is due in the Scandi region today including Norwegian GDP  see page 2 
Selected market news 
The ECB admittedly surprised us yesterday by delivering an all round dovish message   and last night this was topped by ECB sources saying that some ECB officials still see the growth forecasts as too optimistic  First of all  contrary to our call but in line with market expectations  the ECB announced a liquidity injection with a new 2Y TLTRO3 starting in September 2019  Second  the ECB surprised markets by also extending the forward guidance on rates and now expects these to remain at current levels  at least through the end of 2019   vs  through the summer  previously   Third  growth and inflation forecasts were taken down across horizons  and it is clear that the Governing Council is much less convinced by its previous narrative and has opened the door for further easing  As highlighted in our  ECB review   7 March 2019  on the back of this we have changed our ECB rate expectations  we now forecast no interest rate changes to either of the ECB s key interest rates over our forecast horizon for the next 12M  vs a first hike in Dec 19 previously  
The markets responded sharply as the ECB has effectively opened the door for further easing  The German 10Y bund yield fell to 2016 lows  standing at only 0 067   and not least the Italian 10Y yield fell by some 12bp as the soft ECB alleviates the funding pressure for Italian banks  Equities fell in Europe  as the downward revision to the outlook and the prospect of lower rates for longer weighing on banks dominated any positive impact from the ECB on an extended hold  The negative sentiment has continued in both the US and Asian sessions  where data overnight showed notably Chinese export orders faltering in February  EUR USD fell markedly during the day  and the follow through as technical resistance levels were broken continued last night  Separately  EU trade commissioner Malmstrom said the EU is preparing a list of US manufactured products worth EUR22bn on which to retaliate should Trump move on with tariffs  Indeed  the ECB induced EUR depreciation could be an eyesore for Trump as it is weighing on US competitiveness towards Europe  and increases the risk the US administration will lash out after the EU on trade next

Norway  Mainland GDP growth accelerated to 0 9  in Q4 after slowing temporarily in Q3  and today brings data for January  The monthly numbers have proved somewhat volatile and we do not yet have much information about January beyond unemployment  retail sales and the PMI  It is therefore only on a very uncertain basis that we predict mainland GDP growth of 0 2  m m  consensus   0 3    in January 
Sweden  The January household consumption indicator should rebound on the back of retail sales  noting that last year s data has been revised lower  release at 09 30 CET   Already at 08 00 CET  Riksbank vice governor Martin Flod n will give a speech on the state of the economy  On that note  we think the negative response in the krona to the ECB news was fair since a more dovish ECB will  all else being equal  affect the Riksbank 
Fixed income markets
The new TLTROs combined with the new extended forward guidance and the press conference message from Draghi that that ECB now has an easing bias and is ready to do more has reignited the hunt for yield  Italy is of course the main beneficiary of the new TLTRO  But also  the new outright lower yield levels that have pushed 10Y Spain towards 1  and 10Y France below 0 50  are forcing carry investors towards Italy  We believe the carry game will continue for the next couple of months and even though the 5Y segment in periphery rallied strongly yesterday  this is still our favourite segment of both the BTP and SPGB curves  Among the semi cores  10Y Finland looks interesting vs core  There is now little to price out of the money market curve  as the first 10bp hike is priced autumn 2020  Hence  we believe that the German curve both 2s10s and 5s10s will continue to flatten  We also think that we are heading for a sub zero level for 10Y bund yields  and our expected trading range for the next two months is  15 to 10bp  After the ECB sources story from last night stating that ECB officials still see the growth forecasts as too optimistic  there should be room to rally today as the race towards the bottom continues 
FX markets
The ECB clearly took us by surprise today and as the expectation of a 2019 hike was a pillar of our bullish EUR USD view this year we have changed our EUR USD call  see FX Strategy   ECB introduces  easing risk premium  on EUR  Near term  we now expect EUR USD to drift somewhat below the 1 12 mark  With the risk of pockets of USDstrength from renewed pricing of Fed hikes and a trade deal that will not provide much imminent support  this opens the possibility for a EUR USD move towards 1 10 out to a 3M  NYSE MMM  horizon  In the medium term  beyond 3M   we expect EUR USD to stabilise and move back into the 1 12 1 16 range and stress that any drift higher will be limited  with upside mainly deriving from positive spillover to the euro area from a turn in the global  China  cycle  Our new forecast profile for EUR USD thus reads 1 11 in 1M  1 13 in 3M  previously 1 15   1 15 in 6M  previously 1 20  and 1 17 in 12M  previously 1 25  
A surprisingly dovish ECB spilled over to the SEK  USD SEK once again broke through 9 40 and EUR SEK drifted upwards as well  We think a weaker SEK is warranted on the back of the ECB s dovish shift  as this has direct consequences for the Riksbank s forward guidance and subsequent hiking ambitions  As emphasised by Ingves  the correlation between the KIX weighted  of which the Eurozone weighs approximately 50   policy rate and the Riksbank s repo rate is very high  0 92   This means that as the ECB policy rates are set to be kept unchanged this year  it is a severe blow to the Riksbank s own hiking expectations  Indeed  Stibor curves shifted down and EUR SEK traded higher post ECB 
Also  the NOK suffered from especially USD Scandi buying yesterday  However  we do think that Norges Bank s monetary policy is less sensitive to the shift of tone from the ECB as the domestic growth and inflation case is much different from that of Sweden and the Eurozone  That is also why the Nibor curve flattened less than the Stibor curve  with the Norges Bank March hike probability virtually unchanged  roughly 19 bp priced   The next three sessions should confirm this pricing with GDP today  inflation on Monday and finally  but not least  the Regional Network Survey on Tuesday 
EUR DKK dropped to around the 7 46038 central rate on the ECB meeting yesterday  We attribute this move to the rally in the EUR fixed income market and the drop in EUR USD  which are both important factors in driving DKK buying via FX hedging rebalancing  The dividend season in Denmark is coming up  the bulk of flows will take place between 14  22 March   which could entail some temporary EUR DKK positive flows hence  we see limited further downside for EUR DKK in the very near term ",2019-03-08,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danske-daily--worried-ecb-opens-the-door-for-easing-200396301,200396301

Earnings History
I see a solid earnings history and that is important to any investment thesis   You want to own stocks that are consistently beating expectations   The reason for this is that management is good enough to understand their business and still able to communicate where Wall Street s expectations should lie   That way  they can always beat the number 
The most recent earnings on 2 26 was a solid beat of 7 cents in reporting EPS of  0 47 on  131 7M in sales compared to the  128 3M  NYSE MMM  expectation 
Estimate Revisions
Following this beat  the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved higher   Higher for this quarter  next quarter  the full year and next fiscal year   I have to tell you  that is what investors like to see after a beat  strong estimate revisions that continue on a year out 
The current quarter raised up from  0 39 to  0 40 while the full year moved from  1 67 to  1 69   Next year has limited visibility at this point  but that didn t stop analysts from moving their numbers up and that pushed the consensus to  1 88 from  1 86 
Valuation
The value style score for this stock is a C  but it looks like it should be a lot higher to me   I see a forward PE of 16x which is very reasonable and much better than the 22x trailing PE   The price to book of 2 6x is below the 3x level that many value investors use are a cut off   Finally I see the price to sales at 1 8x and that is comfortably above the 1x level that I like to see   With margins inching higher  this stock looks like an excellent value here

194286,415802,MMM,Markets Waiting For The Fed To Adjust Their Policy Expectations Downwards ,opinion,"Market movers today 
The week starts out on a fairly quiet note with regards to economic releases  Instead markets will be looking for new signals from Brussels with regard to the extension of the triggering of Article 50 in relation to Brexit
Later in the week  central banks will dominate the agenda with the BOE  Fed and Norges Bank concluding their policy meetings 
On Wednesday  the Fed is on hold while lowering the  dot  signal for 2019 to one hike  from two   and hence we think the most interesting meeting will be the Norges Bank meeting on Thursday  where we expect a rise in its policy rate by 25bp to 1 00  and to signal one further rate hike this year 
Selected market news 
The Asian equity markets have been grinding higher this morning  while bond yields have remained range bound as the market are looking for support from the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday  Here  the Federal Reserve is likely to revise its forecast for rate hikes down to one rather than two  This will continue to suppress volatility in the markets and support a flat yield curve going forward 
In the UK  PM May has been trying to get more support from the Eurosceptics in her party for her deal  which is expected to be put to a vote on Tuesday  However  if she does not have strong chance of getting the deal accepted  then she is not likely to put it to a third vote according to media reports quoting ministers in her government  Otherwise  PM May will go the EU summit on Thursday to seek an extension on the Brexit process  Hence  there will be plenty of uncertainty regarding the Brexit process during the week  GBP has remained fairly range bound versus both the USD and EUR this morning

There was some positive rating news on Friday  Firstly  Moody s kept the stable outlook and rating on Italy unchanged despite the current growth crisis  This should be supportive for BTPs this morning and the IT DE 10Y spread is expected to converge slowly towards 225bp  Secondly  Portugal was upgraded from BBB  to BBB by S P  The outlook is stable  The main reasons for the upgrade was a combination of solid growth  a surplus of more than 3  on the primary deficit and a downward path for the government debt and lower funding costs 
On Friday  we have Spain up for review by S P  A  positive outlook   Spain could potentially be the next periphery country to see an upgrade  but due to the current election uncertainty  S P might choose to wait another six months  For more see Government Bonds Weekly  GBW   In our Government Bonds Weekly we argue that we are still in a  hunt for carry  environment and repeat our long 5y Spain  long 1y Italy and long 10Y semi core  Finland  vs core  However  we also recommend   partly as a hedge   to position for a wider Bund spread  which is currently trading in the lower end of the 50bp to 60bp trading range we expect to prevail in 2019 
Belgium kicks off the EGB supply week today with taps in the 5Y and 10Y and the 15Y green bond  This is the first time Belgium will tap the Apr 33 Green OLO since it was launched in February 2018  Note that Belgium will see EUR13 7bn in redemption and coupons next week  and we estimate the ECB holds EUR2 6bn in the maturing bond 
FX markets
EUR USD has settled around pre ECB levels and the continued drop that we have been looking for has yet to materialise  The Fed this week will be important in determining whether we can see another dip lower  we expect the Fed to lower its  dot  signal to one rate hike in 2019  down from two  and would not be surprised if it signals that it will be  one and done   this would likely be seen as dovish and support EUR USD even if the Fed has begun downplaying the importance of the dots  We still look for two hikes due to our overall positive outlook for this year  this should hold a hand under the USD further out   but not necessarily this week  Friday s PMIs from either side of the Atlantic could what send EUR USD lower yet again though  we are looking for a decent US manufacturing reading while the euro zone one could be set for another drop  highlighting that the cyclical picture still favours the USD  Further  a US China trade deal now looks delayed until April  Also note that we have published new FX forecasts this morning  see FX Forecast Update 
EUR DKK rose above 7 4630 towards the end of last week   the highest level since early February  The annual dividend flow from the largest Danish corporations ise coming to the market these days  which could help explain the move  In that case the move should prove temporary  We forecast EUR DKK at 7 4570 in 3M  NYSE MMM  
Last week EUR NOK returned to the 9 60s primarily driven by external drivers in improved risk appetite and a higher oil price  This week all eyes will be on Norges Bank s monetary policy meeting on Thursday  This morning we published our preview for the meeting where we explain why we expect both a rate hike and a lower rate path  see Reading the Markets Norway  18 March 2019  Meanwhile  crucially we do not expect the rate path to be lowered as much as markets currently expect and we therefore expect yet another  hawkish  surprise  which could finally change the market perception   from especially foreign investors   that Norges Bank always is dovish  At least in 12 out of the last 13 extended Norges Bank monetary policy meetings EUR NOK has ended the session lower  We think that will turn to 13 out of 14 and still see prospects for an even lower EUR NOK in the coming months ",2019-03-18,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-waiting-for-the-fed-to-adjust-their-policy-expectations-downwards-200398527,200398527
194287,415803,MMM,FX Forecast Update  ECB Stance Reintensifies The FX Carry Hunt ,opinion,"EUR SEK  The SEK has been hit by its attractive funding properties in a low volatility environment  a deteriorated growth outlook and expectations that central banks will stay soft for longer  The latter two factors may be discounted already  while the carry argument could continue to weigh on the SEK  We think the Riksbank will keep the rate path intact at the April meeting  while lowering the inflation forecast   a hawkish signal  which should weigh on EUR SEK  We expect the SEK to remain weak throughout our forecast horizon  We raise our 1M forecast to 10 50  previously 10 40   keep 3M  NYSE MMM  at 10 40 and lift our 6 12M estimates slightly to 10 30  from 10 20   On balance  we believe the profile conveys a relatively neutral view on the EUR SEK 
EUR NOK  We think many of factors weighing on the NOK in February are now fading  leaving investor focus on the strong and relatively unique macro case in Norway  a closed output gap  inflation surprising positively from levels already above the central bank target and mainland growth accelerating despite weaker global impulses  We expect Norges Bank s rate hike on 21 March and its revised rate path to create renewed interest in the NOK from foreign investors  who have been net sellers recently  In addition  we expect the global environment gradually to improve  which should directly and indirectly via a higher oil price underpin the NOK  We still expect tighter structural liquidity and higher daily Norges Bank NOK purchases to support the NOK  We leave our NOK forecasts unchanged at 9 60  9 50  9 40 and 9 30 in 1M  3M  6M and 12M  respectively 
EUR DKK peaked in December and early January and has headed lower since  The dividend season will continue until the start of April  which could give rise to some temporary EUR DKK positive flows  We forecast EUR DKK at 7 4590 in 1M  7 4570 in 3M and 7 4550 in 6 12M 
EUR USD  The ECB has introduced an easing risk premium on the EUR  which could increase if the eurozone outlook continues to falter  Further  with the risk of pockets of USD strength from renewed pricing of Fed hikes and a trade deal that will not provide much imminent support  this opens the possibility of a EUR USD move towards 1 10 near term  Over the medium term  we expect EUR USD to stabilise and move back into the longstanding 1 12 1 16 range  as the EUR easing discount is priced out  a drift higher this year would derive mainly from positive spillovers to the euro area from a turn in the global  China  cycle  In  FX Strategy   ECB introduces  easing risk premium  on EUR   7 March  we updated and notably flattened our forecast profile and we see EUR USD at 1 11 in 1M  1 13 in 3M  1 15 in 6M  and 1 17 in 12M  This is a marked change in our EUR USD outlook and we emphasise that it should be seen as a EUR USD rate that is effectively left without much of a trend this year 
EUR GBP  With the likely extension of Brexit  we think EUR GBP will remain in the 0 85 0 87 range for now  We see a risk investors will be disappointed about the progress near term  which could lead EUR GBP to move to the higher end of the range again  We target 0 86 in 1M  Further out  we build our forecast on the baseline scenario that a deal will pass and that this could happen before the summer holiday  paving the way for a decline in EUR GBP  We lower our targets to 0 83 in 3M and 0 82 in 6M on the back of the ECB s dovish policy shift  from 0 84 and 0 83  respectively

194288,415804,MMM,FOMC Preview   Fed To Signal One More Rate Hike ,opinion,"Key takeaways 
Fed will stay on hold while lowering the  dot  signal for 2019 to one hike  from two   We will not be surprised if the Fed signals  one and done   
Our base case with two hikes this year will be under pressure if the Fed confirms it has changed its reaction function by looking more at inflation expectations  
We expect the Fed to announce it will end shrinking the balance sheet in Q4 19  
Impact on fixed income should be limited even if the Fed completely remove all hikes from the dots  
Fed outlook  Fed is likely to signal just one more rate hike 
We expect the Fed will keep the target range unchanged at 2 25 2 50  and make no major changes to the statement  
Powell   Co have emphasised that they will be   patient  in raising hikes but the question is what that means in terms of the  dots    which are released alongside the rate decision  The U S  macro outlook is still positive but Fed stated already in December it wants to see it confirmed before continuing its hiking cycle  In addition  the Fed is concerned about possible spill over effects from the slowdown in China and Europa  and therefore also want to wait and see how things evolve in the global economy  The Fed also wants to make sure the rebound in risk appetite so far in Q1 19 is robust  We expect Fed to lower its  dot  signal further to just one rate hike in 2019  down from two    We expect them to be revised lower also for 2020 and 2021 and  we will not be surprised if the Fed signals  one and done    We expect the longer run dot is to be unchanged at 2 75   That said  Fed has begun downplaying the importance of the dots given the increased uncertainty around the base case  so be careful putting too much weight on them going forward 
Our current base case is two Fed hikes  in June and December  based on our overall positive economic outlook  Economic growth is strong  unemployment rate is moving lower  wage growth is moving gradually higher and risk sentiment in markets has rebounded  PCE core inflation  however  has softened in recent months  However  if the Fed confirms it has changed its reaction function by looking more at inflation expectations and less on the unemployment rate  a June hike seems less likely   as marked based inflation expectations remain well below historical average 
Still  markets are pricing the Fed too dovish at the moment   as they think the Fed is on hold for the rest of the year  A change in Fed s rhetoric can happen fast  A good example is the rate increase in March 2017 where the market was not expecting a rate hike until Fed signalled it three weeks in advance 
We believe the Fed will announce it will end shrinking its balance sheet in Q4  
Fixed Income  The market has priced Fed on hold 
The market is already pricing that the Fed will stay on hold at the March meeting and the market impact should be limited even if the Fed completely remove all hikes from the dots   Even if the pencil in one more hike during 2019 the market will probably ignore it for now  But if we are correct we might see a small bearish repricing of the US money market curve  The market is pricing some 5bp of rate cut in 2019 and a full 25bp rate cut in 2020 
During 2019 we have seen the FRA OIS spread  3M  NYSE MMM  USD Libor   3M OIS Swap  tightening some 20bp since mid December 2018  It has helped pushing 3M USD Libor down from 2 82  to currently 2 61   The lower 3M USD Libor has been a result of the market pricing an end to QT  as there is now less fear of a tight dollar liquidity situation in 2019 due to QT  Hence  if Fed does not announce an end to balance shrinking  as we expect  the FRA OIS spread could widen again

German numbers continue to stumble  raising concerns about the strength of the eurozone economy  Retail sales ended the year with a whimper  as the December score plummeted 4 3  last week  its sharpest decline in more than 12 years  On the manufacturing front  German manufacturing PMI for January dipped to 49 7  below the 50 point level which separates contraction and expansion  This was the weakest score since October 2014  The dismal news continued on Wednesday  as factory orders fell 1 6   after a decline of 1 0  in the previous release  Global trade tensions and weakness in the German auto sector continue to weigh on the manufacturing sector  Weakness in manufacturing can be seen across the eurozone  as France and Italy both posted manufacturing PMIs in contraction territory in January 
The eurozone may be experiencing a slowdown  but that hasn t changed the ECB s guidance on interest rates  The bank continues to forecast a rate hike in December  but this stance has become increasingly out of sync with market sentiment  which has ruled out a rate hike before mid 2020  With ECB President Mario Draghi due to leave the job in October  policymakers are reluctant to alter current guidance and  tie the hands  of Draghi s successor  This means that the ECB will cling to its guidance unless economic conditions significantly deteriorate

194297,415813,MMM,Danske Daily   Gloomy EU Growth Expectations Weigh On Market Sentiment ,opinion,"Market movers today 
A quiet day on the data front  but markets will keep an eye on the Brexit headlines 
Italian markets already sold off yesterday  after the European Commission slashed its annual growth forecast for the country to just 0 2   bringing back concerns about a resumption of last autumn s budget fight  To feed the gloom  today s Italian industrial production figures for December are unlikely to lift investors mood on the economy  which contracted by  0 2  q q in Q4 
In Scandinavia  we get Norwegian Q4 18 GDP figures and Danish foreign trade data for December  We
Selected market news 
Overnight Trump said that he has no plans to meet with Xi Jinping before the 1 March deadline and the end of the 90 day truce on higher tariffs  Hence  the trade war fears are now returning to the market 
Yesterday  the EU Commission released new rather gloomy 2019 winter forecasts  Euro area growth for 2019 was revised down to 1 3  from previously 1 9   The growth forecasts for Germany was lowered from 1 8  to 1 1   The EU Commission slashed its 2019 euro area inflation forecast to 1 4   down from previously 1 8  
Noteworthy  the growth for Italy was lowered to just 0 2  in 2019 from previously 1 2   This is well below the assumption in the 2019 budget and further questions the budget deficit assumptions by the Italian government and it could restart the budget fight with the EU  Remember  the EU and Italy agreed on a 2 04  deficit in December  The market reacted negatively to the news and the 10Y Italian spread vs Germany widened almost 15bp  10Y Bund yields dropped to the lowest level since 2016 
We should expect that also the ECB will present lower growth forecasts when the staff projections are updated next month  It could further trigger market speculations of new easing postponing of tightening from the ECB 
In light of the gloomy EU commission outlook it is quite important that we now see tentative signs of a bottom in the Chinese business cycle in Q1  Metal prices are up  PMI for large enterprises rebounded in January and export orders also off the lows   see more in  China Leading Indicators   First signs of a bottom   7 February 
As expected  the Bank of England  BoE  yesterday voted unanimously to keep the Bank Rate at 0 75   BoE lowered both its GDP and CPI inflation projections  but made no big policy signal shifts though it even more strongly highlight the economic growth risks from Brexit 
The poor risk sentiment from Europe was carried over to the US and the major US indices ended the day roughly 1  lower and US Treasury yields dropped further and 10Y US yields are now at 2 65   Asian markets are also in red

In Norway  we expect the Q4 GDP figures to confirm our assumption that the slowdown in Q3 was only temporary  Despite weak consumption  we expect mainland GDP to grow 0 9  q q in Q4  driven by increases in oil investment  mainland investment  government investment and  to a degree  housing investment  All recent news and data  including confidence surveys and anecdotal information  support our expectation of a relatively strong upswing in industrial production despite the downturn in the global manufacturing climate  The investment surveys for both the business and government sectors show considerable infrastructure investments on the way  If we are right in our forecast  growth will be above trend in an economy already hitting full capacity utilisation  It will also be somewhat higher than Norges Bank projected in the December monetary policy report  0 7   and so would point clearly to a further rate increase in March

The Scandies stay under pressure with EUR SEK close to the 10 50 mark yesterday  dragging EUR NOK along with it  Sour risk appetite and a drop in oil prices contributed to the move in NOK  We do  however  expect a strong GDP release today and if global risk stabilises we would expect EUR NOK to return to the 9 60s with the coming sessions 
Not much have gone the SEK s way at the start of this year  While we have already pointed at surprisingly weak macro data and revised growth assessments  we would also mention Fed s and ECB s signalling of slowing  normalisation  of policy  Another observation is that the SEK is acting more like a funding currency in carry trades with the extremely low implicit volatility offering good conditions for such positions  Separately  EUR DKK briefly touched 7 4630 yesterday   the lowest level since mid December  In our view  a main driver of the recent DKK strength has been spill over from rising equity markets  We think it has further to go and forecast EUR DKK to fall to 7 4600 in 3M  NYSE MMM  and 7 4550 in 6 12M 
In majors  EUR USD touched new February lows before stabilising around 1 1350 yesterday  USD continues to strengthen despite Fed s soft tone and trade deal optimism but this seems to be more about weakness elsewhere including on the cyclical side in Europe 
We still the cross range bound with 1 15 the attractor  GBP quickly recovered from the initial knee jerk sell off after the BoE announcement and continued to rally on the message that markets should prepare for further rate hikes in the UK  We still expect the BoE to hike in November 2019 whereas the market is pricing the next hike for June 2021  But with the Brexit issue prominent near term  we still look for EUR GBP to remain in the 0 86 0 89 for now  We maintain the view that it will require further reduction in the  no deal  Brexit risk for EUR GBP to test and eventually break below 0 86  Appetite for GBP is likely to deteriorate as 26 February approaches without any signs of an agreement between the EU and UK ",2019-02-08,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/danske-daily--gloomy-eu-growth-expectations-weigh-on-market-sentiment-200385590,200385590
194298,415814,MMM,Reading The Markets Sweden   8 February 2019 ,opinion,"Riksbank in wait and see mode

Riksbank in wait and see mode
We are in a rather confusing situation  Fixed income markets seem to be increasingly convinced that Europe is heading towards recession and rates are going down  At the same time  equity markets show a significant upward correction  Credit spreads widened along with falling equity prices late last year but are now tightening again  The SEK typically trades weaker when equity prices are down and vice versa  That correlation appears to have reversed of late 
After the January board meeting  ECB president Draghi explained that the board was in assessment rather than decision mode  We take that as a sign that any alteration of policy guidance will rely on the ECB s assessment of the medium term outlook for growth and inflation as expressed in the new staff forecast 
Our guess is that the Riksbank is in a similar position  except the Riksbank presents updated forecasts at each policy announcement  As a minimum  we would argue that the Riksbank would acknowledge that growth risk has intensified both internationally and in Sweden  Having said that  one should remember that the Riksbank has already made rather significant downward revisions to the 2019 20 GDP forecasts and compared with private banks  forecasts the current Riksbank projection does not really stand out in a meaningful way  Therefore  at this stage we think that the most likely outcome is more emphasis on downside risk but no changes to the rate path  That would allow the Riksbank to wait for the outcome of Q4 GDP and more information about the ECB s updated view on the EZoutlook and possible policy implications 
In the meantime  recent German order data showed a y y drop of no less than 7   It does not appear to be the car industry and its issues with new emission tests that is creating problems  as orders for cars and part have recovered of late  Instead  other industries are in reverse  Admittedly  we have some trouble grasping what is going on in Germany 
However  considering the strong correlation between Swedish and German manufacturing it is a little worrying  Our base view is that while the global  and Swedish  economy are slowing  fixed income markets are too gloomy and we see some correction in long term yields as warranted  However  more data of the kind we got from Germany would not help the case 

At the same time  the current environment is positive for covered bonds  considering the steepness of the curve  the yield pick up covered bonds offer versus govvies and from a carry and roll down perspective  From a repo financed investor s point of view  the total ASW carry roll down profile is quite flat between 2021 and 2024 maturities  see chart  for instance buying SHYP1585 ASW  Long dated ASW spreads could be under tightening pressure
but entry levels are unattractive
Fundamentally  we see clear supply related factors that could affect longer ASW spreads  As we wrote earlier  we think the Riksbank is unlikely to extend QE beyond June 2019  In addition  we see upside risks to the latest SNDO forecast  So far  the accumulated deviation relative to the forecast is some SEK15bn and the SNDO probably needs to revise its growth assumptions  next forecast is due on 20 February  
For quite a while  mid 2018  we have been short the SGB1057  Nov 2023  versus SGB1056  June 2032  tail versus swaps  We reasoned that the very long end   10Y  traded expensive given that the loans are not particularly dear in the repo market and would likely suffer from the introduction of SGB1061  The position has yielded a tiny 3 5bp profit but we acknowledge that the pricing has been slow to materialise and thus we close the trade 

Fundamentally  it could be argued that the Swedish long end ASW spread should gradually move tighter as spreads are significantly wider than where the bonds trade in the repo market  given the possible turnaround in the supply balance  However  given the very reduced free float  no bond even reaches as little as SEK30bn in the 10Y segment   we think that it will take a long time for this repricing to occur 
In the meantime  the relative pricing versus Bunds looks clearly less attractive  Swedish long end ASW spreads have cheapened steadily versus Bunds  Since May 2018  the ASW box has moved by around SEK15bp  Thus  we feel that entry levels are currently not attractive enough and decide to remain on the sidelines for now 

Risk on sell SEK but it is beginning to look stretched
Not much has gone the SEK s way at the start of this year  We have already pointed at surprisingly weak macro data and revised growth assessments  IMF  Fed  ECB and other analysts as well as the Riksbank in December  with lower expectations regarding both the global and the Swedish economy  We ought to also mention the Fed s and ECB s signalling  or confirmation  of slower rate hikes from now on  where Draghi refers to weaker domestic conditions whilst Powell is mainly concerned with global risks  The Fed s softer stance has mostly to do with factors that   maybe even to a higher extent   one could argue should be hampering Europe  the ECB and the Riksbank as well  With this in mind  we are not surprised to see EUR USD trading lower and USD SEK higher following the Fed s unexpected U turn  if the Fed turns dovish because of global risks  this should not be interpreted as a step towards policy convergence where the Riksbank and ECB carry on as if nothing has happened  On the contrary 
Another observation is that the SEK since some time is acting more like a funding currency  Since last fall  we have seen EUR SEK and USD SEK disconnect from  normal  stock market correlations  The typical pattern has been to buy SEK with rising stock markets and the other way around  This pattern now seems reversed  One possible interpretation is that investors largely use the SEK as funding for carry trades  USD SEK is one obvious winner of this  NOK SEK another  It is quite remarkable that this happens despite the Riksbank s rate hike in December  However  Ingves s careful  dovish  baby step has done nothing to reduce the rate gaps towards the Fed or Norges Bank  Possible rebalancing flows  e g  when the stock market rises  might then make a smaller impact in the market 


Since the turn of the year  implicit volatility in the currency market has generally all but vanished  This might seem odd considering the global event risks  trade war  uncertain economic outlook and central banks that cannot decide whether the next move will be a hike or a cut  Nonetheless  this reflects an equally depressed realised volatility  If actual movements are small  one tends to believe that future movements will be small as well  At least until  something  happens  a trigger  Furthermore  the stock markets have rebounded and Powell has signalled that the Fed does not want to cause the markets to enter  recessionmode  if this can be avoided  The extremely low implicit volatility offers the best conditions for such positions  As we have said  implicit volatility is generally depressed in FX markets  where for example NOK SEK  implicit 3M  NYSE MMM   is trading at the lowest levels since the mid  00s  For example  3M implied volatility in NOK SEK is 5   which implies an expected daily movement of about     30 pips  For EUR SEK  corresponding expected movement is     3 5 figures  Almost nothing  In other words  it is  cheap  to buy volatility  puts  calls  straddles   On this theme  we have recommended 3M straddles in EUR SEK  We remain long NOK SEK  from 1 0570  
We believe that surprisingly weak macro data  a re evaluated view on the cyclical outlook and carry trades to a high extent can explain the sell off in the SEK  i e  if there is carry  there is a clear risk that this will continue  However  we feel that the recent rally in EUR SEK has gone far enough  The Swedish surprise index is at historical lows and thus it should be easier to match or exceed expectations  Our  simple  model based on relative rates indicates that the spot is currently trading two standard deviations above  fair value   As the SEK has collapsed  the rate spread has remained stable  indicating that EUR SEK has overreacted   Fair value  is in the neighbourhood of 10 25 to 10 30  where we also find Fibonacci retracement levels of 50  and 61 8   respectively  RSI is at 76  which indicates that the cross is overbought from a technical point of view  and thus ready to recoil 
Next week s rate decision from the Riksbank is on top of the agenda for the SEK  As we have already discussed in this publication  we see no significant revisions for this meeting  even though the board might choose to express higher uncertainty regarding the global economy  could be SEK negative   At the same time  market pricing on the Riksbank is soft whilst KIX is approximately 5  above its Q1 forecast  One thing worth looking out for is that the mandate for FX interventions expires  This could be removed and it would not be unreasonable to do so in our view  If so  we might see some positive response from the SEK  However  can the Riksbank stomach this  The options market does not expect this to be a big deal  just slightly more volatile than a normal day  approximately 50  largerintraday movement than what is normal  corresponding to about five figures up or down  Even if the Riksbank does not make any major adjustments  we still feel this is low ",2019-02-08,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reading-the-markets-sweden--8-february-2019-200385600,200385600
194299,415815,MMM,Scandi FX Volatility Monitor   High Spot low Vol Is An Opportunity To Buy EUR SEK ,opinion,"Implied vol  in the Scandi crosses picked up last week along with a general increase in FX vol  As such  impl  vol  remains in cheap territory and we still see value in adding long NOK SEK by buying 3M  NYSE MMM  call spreads  
Especially for EUR SEK we note an interesting decoupling between spot and impl  vol   different from EUR NOK  where impl  vol  has spiked higher along with spot    chart    Divergence in EUR SEK can be explained by 1  the fact that EUR SEK vol has been following the general  global  FX vol  pattern and 2  the increase in EUR SEK spot has been more gradual compared to the recent spike in EUR NOK  We reckon that it most likely would require a break above 10 60 in EUR SEK at this stage to trigger a significant isolated increase in EUR SEK vol

194300,415816,MMM,FX Forecast Update  Mind The Scandi Differences ,opinion,"EUR NOK  Once again  the NOK got off to a strong start to the year  as year end underperformance was followed by year start over performance amid investors returning to the market and global risk appetite rebounding  Going forward  we pencil in a stronger NOK based primarily on three factors   1  relative growth and relative rates   2  tighter structural liquidity and  3  a further stabilisation in global risk appetite and a higher oil price  We leave our NOK forecasts unchanged at 9 60  9 50  9 40 and 9 30 in 1M  3M  NYSE MMM   6M and 12M  respectively 
EUR SEK  The December rate hike has not had the positive effect we envisaged  which is probably due to the board s dovish communication coupled with weaker Swedish macro data  In addition  we see the SEK being used as a funding currency in carry trades  As long as this continues  the EUR SEK uptrend is your friend  That said  a lot of macro negativity has been priced in as forecasters have already revised their growth forecasts to sub trend and the pricing of the Riksbank is very cautious  especially versus the ECB  Hence  we feel that the recent  and to us unexpectedly aggressive  rally has gone a bit too far  On balance  we raise our forecast profile to 10 40  10 20  in 1M  10 40  10 10  in 3M and 10 20  10 00  in 6M and 12M  Taking into account the recent overshooting  the forecast reflects a relatively neutral view on the SEK  where a break of 10 00 is still far off  in our view 
EUR DKK peaked in December and early January and has since headed lower  As equity markets recover  DKK will see support from a rebalancing of FX hedges by domestic investors  At the same time  low front end rates due to the high net position will slow the pace of DKK appreciation  We forecast EUR DKK at 7 4620 in 1M  7 4580 in 3M and 7 4550 in 6 12M 
EUR USD  Carry momentum for USD is fading on the back of the Fed s soft rhetoric and even if another rate hike or two is in the cards  we do not think this will be a major source of dollar support  We have for some time argued that the next big move in EUR USD will be higher as monetary policy divergence fades and the cross is undervalued  While a Fed that is now effectively on hold has been the first stage  we think the next trigger for a continued rebound will be a US China trade deal  Whether the ECB will fuel a third stage in this rebound remains an open question  but a first hike looms as a key EUR supportive factor  For now  1 15 should act as an attractor for the cross  We have left our forecast profile unchanged and thus continue to see EUR USD at 1 15 in 1M  1 17 in 3M  1 20 in 6M  and 1 25 in 12M 
EUR GBP  Our EUR GBP FX forecast is based on our main scenario that UK Prime Minister Theresa May s Brexit plan will be approved by parliament eventually  We expect this to pave the way for a significant decline in EUR GBP  We target 0 84 in 3M and 0 83 in 6 12M  However  it is a close call  and we would like to emphasise that the key risk to our bullish GBP view is if Brexit clarifications are dragged out   even beyond 30 March if Article 50 is extended   and that GBP appreciation would consequently be much more moderate and materialise later than our forecast  main scenario  implies

194306,415822,MMM,Bond Flow In April Could Weigh On EUR DKK FX Forwards,opinion,"Bond flow around the April mortgage bond auction could be another source of downwards pressure on EUR DKK FX forwards along with high net position  
We reiterate our view that the EUR DKK FX forward curve is currently trading at too high a level  
In April of the past two years we have seen a drop in foreigner s holdings of Danish bonds by DKK33bn and DKK63bn respectively  see chart 1   The drop coincides with the April auctions of mortgage bonds  The drop is partly due to lower supply of mortgage bonds and lower demand from USD based investors due to a less attractive pick up from the USD DKK FX swap  We could likely see the same pattern in the bond market this year  where foreigners will receive around DKK50bn in redemptions amid lower supply 
As we stressed last year in  FX Edge  Why did the EURDKK 3M  NYSE MMM  XCCY basis tighten in April    19 July 2018  portfolio flows are an important determinant of EUR DKK FX forwards along with changes in DKK liquidity  hence  the net position  If the pattern from the last two years repeats itself in April  we could therefore see some downward pressure on EUR DKK FX forwards in April from this cause  However  bond flows should not be viewed in isolation since flows in stocks and money market instruments have mitigated some of the effect from the reduction in foreigners  holdings of Danish bonds in April in the previous two years   see chart 2 
In conjunction with April s mortgage bond auction  the debt management office will be buying DKK19bn in mortgage bonds to fund social housing and draw down its deposits at the central bank  That in turn will push the net position higher to around DKK240 245bn in the first half of April  see  FX Strategy  Update on DKK net position   18 January 2018   That will add another source of downwards pressure on EUR DKK FX forwards in April  The EUR DKK FX forward market is currently pricing 3M EUR DKK FX forward to rise to around  0 18  from  0 20  in 3M and to trade in the  0 15  to  0 18  range the rest of the year  see chart 4   Based on the analysis above  this pricing looks too high in our view   see here for further detail  FX Edge  DKK liquidity flood   16 January 2019  ",2019-01-29,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bond-flow-in-april-could-weigh-on-eurdkk-fx-forwards-200381690,200381690

Taking a step back  we have over the past couple of weeks witnessed a rather remarkable shift in tone from the world s two leading central banks  the Federal Reserve and the ECB  The world economy is apparently slowing down  The ECB tried to stick to the  temporary slowdown story  for as long as possible but at the January policy meeting it finally acknowledged that economic developments have been disappointing  In March we will see if and to what extent this perception will affect policy guidance  Fed chair Powel  while underlining that the US economy remains healthy  specifically mentioned weakness in China and Europe as a concern along with event risks like Brexit and trade conflicts  Mr Powel confirmed that the Fed is on hold for now  We get the impression that the message is not necessarily pause and then hike later on  Instead it is a matter of pausing in order to evaluate what the next appropriate direction is  up or down 
Of course the market responded with rates going lower especially in the front end of the US yield curve  However  considering the magnitude of the policy shift  the reaction could have been bigger had it not been for the fact that much of this was already priced in  After all  the US money market curve implies rate cuts ahead  not hikes 
The perceived recession risk has definitely risen in markets  We certainly do not question that growth is cooling off  On the other hand  economies do not just glide into a recession without a particular reason  like the Asian crises  bursting asset bubbles or other types of unsustainable imbalances working as a trigger 
A hard Brexit could surely be such a trigger  The optimistic side of the Brexit story is that no one wants a hard Brexit  The pessimistic side is that the Britons do not seem to know what they want other than a renegotiated deal  while the EU is unwilling to re negotiate  Someone will have to blink and the clock is ticking 
In Sweden  we got a new batch  January  of consumer and business sentiment numbers this week  This time around there was a very broadly based decline across all sectors  That was not really a surprise considering that all similar survey data out of Europe are down as well but it is worth mentioning that manufacturing is holding up relatively well  Admittedly manufacturers are less upbeat on expected order flows over the coming three months but apart from that things are not that bad  This corroborates with recently presented earnings reports from companies like Volvo and Atlas Copco  which sound relatively optimistic 
Instead it is services producers  and consumers  that are gloomy  It is a mixed picture  though  Some services producers seem to be relatively unaffected  while others say that business conditions have deteriorated  The latter group include financial institutions  employment placement agencies  interesting   architects and technical consultants to mention a few  The latter probably reflect a significant decline in housing starts  Assessed labour shortage in private businesses is very high but we may have seen the peak 


The Riksbank is now in the process of figuring out what to say in the 13 February monetary policy report  Considering that several of the downside risks to the global outlook appear to be materialising  it would be a surprise to us if it does not lower the GDP projections again  Still  one could make the case that it can abstain from making any sharp policy conclusions until the April meeting when the fourth quarter GDP has been released and it has more specific knowledge about the ECB s policy guidance  In a sense  the Riksbank is already on pause considering that the currently planned next rate hike is not until Q3  That gives the board ample time to evaluate how data evolve 
If the Riksbank lowers the GDP numbers while keeping the repo rate path unchanged  FRAs and other short term rate instruments will almost certainly go up with the story being that the Riksbank will hike irrespective of data and projections  That would be a misinterpretation we think  contradicting the way the central bank thinks  So in our minds higher FRA rates would offer an opportunity to enter receiver positions in for instance FRA Sep 2019 
Covered bonds  stable short end conducive to carry roll trades   buy 3Y covered bonds in ASW spreads
Last year was characterised by heavy supply  at least in gross terms  driven by the large redemptions  This year resembles 2017  in our view  back then we saw smaller redemptions but relatively large buybacks  If we look at the current maturity profile  we see a significant peak in 2020 21  Issuers might be keen to smooth out the maturity profile  which should speak in favour of larger buybacks this year  We expect SEK120bn  which would be slightly higher than we have seen historically 

Lending should continue to slow down  Deposit inflows remain healthy and account for an increasing share of the lending  Thus  we think that net supply will remain relatively muted  We have pencilled in SEK40bn for 2019  in line with previous years  Gross supply is set to become significantly smaller compared to previous years  The supply outlook thus appears relatively supportive 


Also interesting in our view is the spread stability in the short end  both relative to SGBs and swaps  Probably the lack of short end material  very few T bills  small volume in SGBs after correcting for Riksbank holdings  benefits short dated covered bonds  This stability is clearly helpful for carry roll down trades further out on the curve 

Noteworthy here is that there is not a huge incentive to move far out on the curve   the carry roll down is relatively flat in the 2021 2024 segment  see table below 

In our view  the risks are concentrated further out on the curve  As can be seen in the chart below  the SEK covered bond curves remain very steep compared to other markets  but there is clearly a tendency for steeper curves both in the EUR and DKK market  This could at some point affect the SEK 5Y point as well 

Another risk comes from the CCS market  The relationship between SEK and EUR covered bonds  which at the margin will drive in which market mortgage institutions will prioritise issuance  is clearly linked to longer EUR SEK CCS  Historically  the EUR SEK CCS has correlated with what happens with EUR USD CCS  in practice a mirror image  albeit with smaller magnitude moves in EUR SEK CCS   Throughout 2018  USD funding has become less expensive in the EUR USD CCS  i e  less negative in spread terms  despite the Fed shrinking the balance sheet  There is now market speculation about the Fed being slower in shrinking the balance sheet  Although we have no strong opinion where the spread may head next  we note that EUR USD CCS trades at levels we have not seen for years  If we see a rebound  EUR SEK CCS is likely to move higher  which would make SEK issuance more attractive for issuers  and SEK denominated bonds less attractive to foreign investors  

As relative value oriented investors in our view do not really get paid more for moving further out on the curve  we prefer shorter maturities  i e  the 2021 2022 segment  which are less exposed to a sell off in the EUR market and issuance  Thus  we recommend buying for instance SHYP1585 in an ASW   7bp  We set the P L levels to  3 bp 15bp 
ASWs in this segment have cheapened somewhat during fall 

Another development to keep track of in the housing market is the increased demand for fixed rate loans  Although there is no data where the demand is on the curve in the 1 5Y segment  we suspect that household demand is mainly concentrated in the 2 3Y segment as the lending curve out to households is relatively flat out to 3Y and somewhat steeper out to 5Y  see chart below   Generally our impression is that households tend to view fixed rate loans as insurance and are reluctant to pay up too much relative to floating rates  Banks  on the other hand  probably see an advantage with more clients having fixed rate loans  if anything lower risk and somewhat more difficult to shop around between banks    we note that some banks have been running discounting certain fixed rate maturities 

The volumes involved are significant   over the 3M period between October December 2018  the volume of fixed rate loans increased by SEK82bn  Although we expect that most of the loans will hit relatively liquid points on the ASW curve  if volumes continue to be large  it could put upward pressure on swap rates in the shorter end 

Riksbank likely to wind down bond purchases As mentioned the Riksbank is unlikely to continue to buy SGBs beyond the June 2019 date  Let us elaborate on this point  Although bond purchases are small relative to GDP   7  of GDP   8  of GDP if linkers are included   the Riksbank holds a substantial share of the outstanding volume  In the more liquid segments of the SGB curve  i e  if we exclude SGB1056  SGB1053 and the newly introduced SGB1061   the Riksbank in most cases holds a majority of the outstanding volume  The  free float   outstanding volume minus Riksbank holdings  is in most cases below SEK30bn  We have no doubt that the debt office is concerned about the potential harm to the liquidity and investor base 

The current bond purchases are in effect smoothed out reinvestments of SGB1052 scheduled to run until June 2019  After the maturity of SGB1052 in March 2019  the Riksbank will hold around 48  of the outstanding volume  The next nominal SGB to mature is SGB1047 in December 2020  Assuming that the latest SNDO forecast is correct  SEK30bn in 2019  SEK40bn in 2020   we have summarised how the different alternatives would affect the share of Riksbank holdings 

The extreme scenario would be if the RB decides to reinvest all holdings  SEK58bn  in SGB1047 early  Assuming the debt office forecast is correct  note that we see upside risks   the share of the Riksbank would jump to close to 57   We reason that the Riksbank would see that as problematic 
A more likely scenario perhaps would be to reinvest portfolio coupon payments  which would be a way to wind down purchases more gradually  That would amount to around SEK8bn year 
Overall  however  we think the need for further bond purchases can be questioned  The Riksbank is clearly on a path to normalisation of monetary policy and the sense of urgency around inflation has largely disappeared  Also  the threat of a rapidly appreciating SEK has gradually vanished  Consequently  we do not expect the Riksbank to extend bond purchases beyond June 2019  which would keep the size of the balance sheet intact until December 2020  however   A continued reinvest of coupons is conceivable but it is not our main scenario 
Negative macro surprises weigh on the SEK
In the past couple of weeks Sweden s macro data have in general been weaker than expected  December s retail sales came in weaker than in years and added to disappointing household consumption for November  The yearly growth rate for household consumption has fallen from levels at 2 3  this summer to currently  0 5   which was an unexpectedly large tumble  Earlier this week  NIER s economic tendency survey came in weak as well  where in particular the households  views of the economy remains pessimistic  Following all this  the SEK has shown weakness since the turn of the year and EUR SEK is now back at levels last seen before the Riksbank s rate hike in December  which is remarkable  The fact that data have been weaker than expected of late is evident in the surprise index  which is at its lowest levels since 2016 

It is as expected that the SEK trades down on weak Swedish macro data but  at the same time  EUR SEK begins to look overbought in our view  We stick to our rather pessimistic view on the Swedish economy and believe that data will continue to come in weak  We are not alone in this view  On the contrary  it is widespread consensus that 2019 will turn out to be a weak year growth wise  Many forecasters  including us  hover around the Riksbank s estimate of 1 5   Nevertheless  this is a reason for the relatively modest strengthening of the SEK that our forecast indicates  where we see 10 20 at 1M and 10 00 at 12M  Given the recent weeks  weak data we believe that there is a case for the markets expectations on the Swedish economy and data to adjust downwards  which limits the space for further negative surprises  By the same reasoning  this could imply a higher probability of a positive reaction in the SEK given positive  or simply neutral  macro outcomes  as the expectations have fallen  Focus can then once again shift towards the fact that the SEK seems somewhat undervalued  at least where relative rates are concerned  which strengthens our cause for a stronger SEK  Our short term model based on relative rates yields a fair value of EUR SEK around 10 25 ",2019-02-01,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reading-the-markets-sweden--1-february-2019-200382488,200382488

Selected market news 
Yesterday  US President Trump urged China to make a trade deal in order to support the Chinese economy on the back of the weaker Chinese economic data  On top of the comments from Trump  Chinese President Xi Jinping came with an unusual warning to the Chinese leaders about  sharp and serious dangers of a slackness in spirit  
Hence  there is little doubt about the seriousness of the slowdown in the Chinese economy  The IMF cut its global economy forecast for 2019 on expectations of the lowest growth in three years  warning about the threat to the global economy from the trade tensions as well as weak demand in the eurozone economy  Hence  growth was revised down from 3 7  to 3 5  
The Asian equity market has reacted negatively to comments from Trump and Xi Jinping as well the softer growth outlook from IMF this morning  10Y JGBs are trading at a yield below 0   Hence  we expect a negative opening in the European equity markets as well as a positive opening in the bond market with lower yields this morning 
As expected  PM Theresa May s Brexit plan B did not really give us any new information or clarification  It seems like May s strategy is to find out how to get her supporting party  Ulster s DUP  on board  as it would mean bigger support also within her own party  Now  focus is on the amendments  where our focus is on these four topics   1  a customs union or not   2  a possible extension of Article 50   3  preparation of a new EU referendum and  4  new deadlines for Theresa May  The main problem with Brexit is that there is no majority for anything  so it is not a given that any of the amendments will get support from the majority of the MPs  Focus is also on the EU  where we no can no longer rule out a long extension of Article 50  giving time to negotiate the future permanent relationship  which would be the best way to avoid ever having to activate the much hated Irish border backstop

In the Scandies  both EUR NOK and EUR SEK got off to a calm start to the week amid little domestic news and the US holiday  This is also reflected in the Scandi option space where implied FX volatility has declined substantially over the last trading sessions supported by improved risk appetite  As such  the combination of a constructive risk environment and falling realised volatility could continue to push down implied vols in the short term  In addition  the risk of political uncertainty in Sweden has declined with the new government in place  We have generally recommended to sell 3M  NYSE MMM  EUR SEK straddles  but given the latest volatility move  we would recommend clients to consider taking profit

194317,415833,MMM,U S  Housing  Hopes For A Turnaround ,opinion,"Amidst the government shutdown  third party housing numbers are one of the few data sets we are still receiving  Existing home sales offer further warning signals  but elsewhere  we may be seeing signs of stabilization and even a potential recovery 
A stall becomes a slowdown
A healthy housing market normally equates to a healthy economy  Rising housing transactions are typically associated with rising residential construction activity and retail sales   particularly in furniture and furnishing components  as well as the building materials and garden equipment sector  However  over the past 12 months  we have seen a clear slowing in both existing and new home sales with the stock of unsold supply on the market picking up  too  For new homes  it currently stands at an eight year high of 7 4 months of sales  Tuesday s steep fall in existing home sales for December to 4 99 million annualized   the lowest since the November 2015 blip   means that it now takes an average 46 days to sell a property 
House prices have tentatively started to respond to this with the national annual rate of inflation slowing to 5  in October versus a peak of 6 8  seen in March last year  The slowdown appears particularly pronounced in cities that have experienced construction booms in recent years  such as the major West Coast cities  This has led to fears that a weakening housing market could become another headwind for the U S  economy  prompting slower economic activity and a more cautious approach to interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve 
U S  home sales and U S  S P Case Schiller house price inflation  3M  NYSE MMM  annualized 

In one sense  the fact that the relationship between residential construction and GDP growth has broken down offers some comfort that we shouldn t necessarily brace for a broader economic downturn   the former slowing while GDP growth has accelerated  But this is not something that we expect to last for a prolonged period given housing s important feedback into broader activity and confidence 
GDP growth and residential investment  YoY  

What s caused it 
President Trump s tax bill from last year has likely been a significant factor behind this development  Income tax cuts equivalent to  900 per household have helped support consumer spending and therefore GDP  but there were also changes to the tax benefits of home ownership that have created headwinds for housing 
The tax reforms resulted in state and local property tax deductions being capped at  10 000 while mortgage interest deductions have been limited  too  The standard deduction has been doubled so the net result is that people looking to buy in an expensive housing markets in states that have high property taxes are going to be less well off  This clearly weakens the incentive for home ownership in these markets and again explains why coastal cities are seeing more of underperformance versus the national average 
The other key factor behind the slowing in residential property has been the rise in mortgage rates over the past twelve months  The 30Y contracted fixed rate mortgage peaked at 5 2  in early November  nearly 100 basis points above where it started the year  There was a particularly sharp increase during 3Q18  driven higher by rises in Treasury yields over the period  This too hurt affordability with mortgage applications for home purchases falling sharply over the July November period 
Mortgage rates and mortgage applications

Coming back to life 
Despite this gloom  we see some signs that the prospects for the housing market may be getting a little brighter as we start in 2019  The equity market correction in late 2018  as fears mounted over U S  economic prospects  helped drive Treasury yields lower with mortgage rates now responding  This 40 basis point drop in borrowing costs seems to have sparked renewed life into the housing market with mortgage applications for home purchase surging in early January 
Indeed  consumer fundamentals remain in great shape with unemployment at a 49 year low while wages are rising faster than the cost of living  In fact  we think wage growth can continue on its upward trajectory is given that demand for workers outstrips supply 
We regularly mention the National Federation of Independent Businesses survey in this regard  It is reporting that the proportion of firms that can t fill their current vacancies is at all time highs   the survey goes back over 40 years  At the same time  the latest Federal Reserve Beige Book reported that  all Districts noted that labor markets were tight and that firms were struggling to find workers at any skill level   It added that  wages grew throughout the country  across skill levels  and numerous Districts highlighted rising entry level wages as firms sought to attract and retain workers and a new minimum wage laws came into effect  
We also have to consider the plunge in gasoline prices from  2 92 gallon in October to  2 25 currently  This works out as an annualized saving of nearly  100 billion for U S  households 
As such  consumers have cash in their pockets and while consumer confidence has dipped a little in response to equity market weakness and perhaps the government shutdown  it remains high by historical standards  So  from a demand perspective  the outlook seems to be reasonable 
We will get mortgage approvals numbers for the week of 18 January tomorrow and given lower mortgage rates at a time when the Federal Reserve s Senior Loan Officers report suggests lending standards remain relatively loose  there seems little constraint from the supply side  Demand should also look OK given healthy consumer cashflows  decent confidence and perhaps too  a fading shock from last years  housing tax changes  which may be tempting cautious buyers to return to the market But there are still risks 
We will need to follow the data closely in coming months to see if we can breathe a sigh of relief on housing  but either way  we know the U S  faces tougher challenges in 2019  which could still translate into softer housing demand  The lagged effects of higher interest rates and a strong dollar will weigh on activity while the weaker external environment coupled with uncertainty on trade policy and the imposition of additional protectionist measure are risks 
The prolonged government shutdown is also a growing threat as it becomes increasingly apparent that private sector business is being restrained by it  with contractors not being paid  business permits and travel visas not being issued and queues at airport security lines growing 
This suggests to us that the Federal Reserve will likely leave interest rates unchanged this quarter  but a tight labor market and a buoyant domestic consumer sector still justify tighter monetary policy later in the year  We will become increasingly optimistic if a way can be found through the US China trade impasse 
The pace of rate hikes will be more modest than in 2018 with just two 25 basis point hikes foreseen  but this scenario of strong consumer fundamentals and gradual interest rate increases we believe will be bearable for the residential property market  Nonetheless  a turnaround in residential investment may take longer to materialize

Selected market news
Yesterday  markets had a volatile session on the back of the ECB  trade war comments  PMIs etc  Equity markets rose marginally across most jurisdictions while  core bond market yields declined  EURUSD ended the day lower  Overnight  equity markets in Asia are in the green at the time of writing 
At the ECB meeting yesterday  it changed its growth risk assessment in light of continued weaker incoming data and persistent global uncertainties  This has been long overdue in our view and with January PMIs  see below  a balanced risk assessment would clearly have challenged the ECB s claim of being data dependent  We still expect ECB hiking rates this year in December as Draghi was upbeat on the labour market and wage dynamics  We lower our expectation for a liquidity operation in March after the meeting yesterday to 75 80  for an announcement in March 
Norges Bank  NB  left the sight deposit rate unchanged at 0 75   in a decision widely expected by both markets and analysts   This was a  small  meeting  including only a press release and the one page  Executive Board s assessment   i e  there was no monetary policy report  no revised rate path and no press conference  This  alongside the central bank having only one month s worth of data and economic developments to digest  limited how big a change in the policy outlook the central bank could signal  NB clearly clarified that markets should expect a rate hike in March  Our call remains for two rate hikes in 2019  March and September  but  notably  we see the balance of risk skewed towards three and not one rate hike  We also pencil in two rate hikes for 2020 and 2021 
Swedish unemployment  seasonally adjusted  bounced higher to 6 4  in December  more or less as we expected  while the trend adjusted number stayed flat at 6 2   Employment growth was still solid at  100k  In all  a fairly strong report  although our impression is that unemployment may be starting to find a bottom 
January euro area PMI fell further in line with our expectation to 50 7  Yesterday s PMI readings signal the euro area economy edging closer to stagnation at the start of 2019  pointing to just 0 1  q q growth in Q1   which is in line with that latest signals from Macroscope   Yesterday  Handelsblatt reported that the German government revised down its growth expectations for this year to 1  from 1 8   which is a sizable cut given the new risk assessment from the ECB 
In the US  Markit PMI manufacturing rose in January to 54 9 from 53 8 with the service component broadly unchanged  Despite global manufacturing slowdown  government shutdown and US China trade tensions  the US still seems in good shape  We could see further negative surprises here going forward  but also positive later in the year if we see a rebound in China and Europa  as we expect  
On the trade war  US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that there is a  fair chance  of the US and China reaching a trade deal  which is more upbeat from Ross than previous comments  However  Ross also said that China and the US are  miles and miles  away from a trade deal 
Scandi markets
Swedish retail sales had a lousy 2018 and the December numbers out today will not change that  We estimate retails sales rose 1 5  y y  even though clothing sales suggest a weaker outcome  We estimate sales outside of that sector compensated  We will also get PPI numbers for December 
Fixed income markets
The ECB meeting turned out to be a pleasant surprise for the European bond market as the ECB in light of weak incoming data  most recent PMIs  and the weaker international picture changed the growth assessment to the downside despite no new staff projections 
The market once again postponed the timing of the first rate hike further into 2020  The European bond income market rallied on the news and Bunds touched 165 54  See Flash Comment  ECB Review  24 January 2019 
Despite the weaker growth assessment  periphery markets rallied strongly on the soft news and the 10Y BTP bund spread dropped below 248bp  Spain also continued to perform and the momentum for SPGBs remains very strong and further performance is expected today  While ECB reacted to the weaker global economy Norges Bank did not blink yesterday and confirmed its plan to hike rates at the March meeting  We continue to see value in paying SEP 3M  NYSE MMM  NOK FRAs vs the equivalent FRA in Sweden  See Norges Bank Review  24 January 2019 
Today  the agenda is less exciting and the market will continue to look out for clues on how severe the weakness in the eurozone economy when the German ifo is released at 10 00 CET

FX markets
Yesterday s Norges Bank  NB  announcement clearly shows that NB stands out as the only G10 central bank planning to hike rates in the coming months  As we approach March  the repricing of the short end  if global risk holds up as we expect  should underpin a stronger NOK on both carry level and carry momentum  We still pencil in a stronger NOK in coming months  primarily on  1  relative growth and relative rates   2  tighter structural liquidity and  3  global risk appetite and higher oil  We remain short EUR NOK via options and long NOK SEK spot outright 
Spillover effects from intra Scandi NOK SEK buying yesterday sent EUR SEK toward 10 30  Today  we expect another weak reading on retail sales  1 5  y y   But so does consensus  1 2  y y   and thus it shouldn t be too bad for the krona 
In the majors EUR USD notably took a rollercoaster ride yesterday on weak PMIs  the ECB meeting and negative comments from US commerce secretary  Ross on the trade deal outlook with China  Do we have genuine EUR support from ECB  We still think the first hike is a tad too distant fragile for FX markets to send EUR significantly higher  but as H1 progresses  we expect the next stage in a EUR USD rebound to reached via a US China trade deal  Associated CNY appreciation would further help keep the effective EUR from strengthening too much which would in turn pave the way for ECB  For true lift off in EUR USD towards the high 1 20s as warranted by valuation  we need to get closer to confirmation that the ECB intends to move on rates   and that will likely not happen until H2  but we are gradually moving in that direction ",2019-01-25,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-take-a-breather-after-a-heavy-day-yesterday-200381681,200381681

ECB  risk down
The ECB has been quite reluctant to accept the narrative that weaker growth data in the eurozone could be  for real   When the Q1 18 GDP number was reported at 0 4  q q  down from 0 7  in the previous four quarters  it was said to be a temporary dip  Q2 GDP also came in at 0 4  q q  This was described as a natural alignment to potential growth  Q3 GDP rose by a meagre 0 2   At the December ECB board meeting  Chair Mario Draghi acknowledged that growth had turned out weaker than expected  However  the balance of risks was still regarded to be broadly balanced   but moving towards the downside  Recent data do not really provide much support for a recovery in Q4 either 
From this point of view  it was not much of a surprise that the central bank finally shifted the risk balance to the downside  The previous time the ECB changed risk assessment  from downside to balanced  was in June 2017  Nonetheless  no sharp policy implications were communicated and it seems as though the market did not really expect anything else 
Our euro analysts are of the view that the March policy meeting   when an updated staff forecast is presented   will be more interesting  The first line of defence will probably be a new round of liquidity operations  At the December meeting  Draghi said that  At some point in time  our committees will start to work on that   We expect the committees to be tasked formally to examine the liquidity situation next week  Previously  when the ECB made large changes to its monetary policy stance  it has used task committees  How will the Riksbank respond 
The Riksbank board majority has clearly communicated that it has shifted focus from the latest few inflation prints to a more traditional longer term assessment of the outlook for growth and inflation  Could it flip back again 
The Riksbank made some rather significant downward revisions of its growth projections in 2018  For instance  in the September 2018 report  the Riksbank forecast growth in the current year to be 3   By December  it had lowered that figure to 2 25   In the meantime  we saw lower projections for 2019  This coincides with some  minor  downward revisions to the projection for underlying inflation  CPIF excluding energy   Note that forecasts further out than two years are not really forecasts in the true sense of the word but rather a convergence of GDP towards potential growth and inflation to 2  

According to our GDP indicator  domestic data says that growth remained modest in Q4  particularly consumer spending and housing investments  At the same time  labour market indicators so far remain robust  with a steady increase in employment and vacancies at elevated levels 


The latter is important in the sense that it gives the Riksbank room not to jump to conclusions  Presumably  it will lower its GDP forecasts somewhat at the February policy meeting but  for the time being  we guess that it will stick to the current policy guidance  rate path   In our view  the April meeting should be more interesting  It will have released GDP data for Q4 will have been released  due 28 February   new ECB forecasts and policy guidance will be available and the Riksbank will know whether the Fed is actually on hold  Our guess is that this will result in a combination with  on the one hand  an end to reinvestments in June 2019  at most we would expect only coupons to be reinvested  and  on the other  yet another delay to the second rate hike  Currently  Riba contracts price in 29bp up to May next year  We see little reason to move pricing higher  We have experienced a significant curve flattening  As we describe later in this document  we have decided to close our positions for a flatter curve  In the US  yields express a recession risk  which we find somewhat far fetched and some upward correction in yields seems warranted 
However  a few domestic factors also deserve some attention 
First  if our expectations are correct regarding the Riksbank not extending QE beyond June  we believe it would be somewhat negative for longer yields 
Second  with growth slowing we have probably seen the lows in government bond supply  The National Financial Management Authority  NFMA  just released a new budget forecast  showing lower surpluses than in the previous forecast for 2019 20 and lower surpluses than in the Debt Office projections  The Debt Office is due to update its borrowing forecasts next month and  in our view  it will probably also lower its budget projections  So  we believe the risk is skewed towards some upward revision of borrowing 
Finally  it appears to us that the Riksbank  and probably private banks  have convinced households to prepare for higher mortgage rates  One sign of this is that  for the first time  we are now seeing a more significant flow from variable  3M  NYSE MMM   rate mortgages to fixed rates  In October November  the stock of fixed rate loans increased by around SEK50bn  while floating rate loans declined by SEK20bn  If this continues  or accelerates  it could potentially mean less liability swapped covered bond issuance  i e  somewhat more net risk to the market  i e  upward pressure on rates  

Relative flattening trend takes a break   curves could steepen in coming months
Since mid 2016  the SEK swap curve has steadily flattened relative to the EUR curve  If we look at the 3Y 10Y box specifically  it has flattened by around 60bp 

If we split up this box into a short and long cross country spread  it becomes clear that the primary driver for the move has been the 3Y spread versus EUR  while the 10Y spread has moved in smaller increments 

If we look at each leg of the 3Y spread  we see that the SEK 3Y swap has moved up by more than 50bp since the rate bottom in 2016  while the 3Y EUR swap is only a meagre 15bp from the low 


Over the course of 2019  some 20bp is priced in on the Riksbank  with an emphasis on Q3   We find it hard to see much upside risk to this  As we see it  there is a risk that at some point in the spring  the market may increasingly question the rate hike given the domestic slowdown  admittedly becoming more and more mainstream  and the continued lack of wage pressure  At the same time  expectations of the ECB are no doubt muted  This speaks against a further spread widening in the short end 
Therefore  we close our relative flattener 2Y 10Y 1Y forward against the EUR  Despite the steady relative flattening trend  the position has yielded only a 4bp profit  The reason is the negative roll in SEK relative to EUR 
We have also had on an outright flattener in the same 2Y 10Y 1Y forward segment  On the back of the move lower in global rates  the position has delivered positively  profit around 13bp   The uncertainty is where rates go from here 
There is no doubt that the international macroeconomic environment is showing signs of weakness  This is clearly visible in PMI type indicators  In German rates  we find it hard to see much downside in yield terms  The market has almost completely taken away hike expectations in 2019  On a generic basis  the Bund still trades some 30bp from all time lows from 2016  In an environment where the ECB is scaling down its purchases after all  we doubt there is much downside unless the euro area is heading for an outright recession  and not just a growth deceleration  

While the picture for Europe is somewhat darker  US data remain relatively upbeat as a whole  However  there are clear signs of weakness in housing as well as in manufacturing  and one could fear that growth will decelerate further once the impact of tax cuts increased expenditure fades  At the same time  the economy as a whole continues to do well  see chart below   At least in the short run we seem to be heading towards more than decent growth numbers  In our view  the labour market remains impressive 

We cannot rule out that in the longer run we will get caught in a more negative scenario but current pricing is aggressive  In US rates  we are close to a recession like scenario  We are not there yet  so we see a risk of a move higher in rates  Therefore  we close our outright flattener as well 
How would such a scenario affect Sweden  We reason that there is a likely to be resistance against moving up SEK short rates  to say  around 3Y  unless pricing on the ECB moves as well  What happens internationally would affect longer rates more 
During the recent move lower in rates  the 5Y point has outperformed significantly  Since mid October  the 2Y 10Y spread has flattened by almost 35bp  However  the 5Y 10Y curve has flattened by only 7bp  while the 2Y 5Y spread has flattened by 27bp  We see the 5Y point as exposed to a sell off 

The long end could also be affected by higher borrowing requirements  risks are  in our view  skewed on the upside  and or a possible end to QE beyond June 2019  our main scenario  
Thus  we think it is time to position for higher rates  For SEK rates  this should mean steeper curves  We prefer to play the 3Y 10Y segment  Therefore  we recommend paying 10Y swaps versus receiving the 3Y swap  86bp   We set the P L levels at 105 70bp 
Current risk sentiment affects FX markets
Following the Riksbank s December rate hike  EUR SEK has mostly been trading in the 10 20 30 interval with only temporary breaches  Although a notable event in its own right  the first rate hike in seven years has yet to prove to be a game changer for the SEK  Cross checking with our short term financial models using interest rate differentials and a proxy for risk sentiment  suggests that EUR SEK trades marginally on the high side of fair value which is close to 10 20 
As we argue in FX Forecast Update   EUR USD rocket   now on the launch pad  21 January  the dovish leaning of the hike and poor risk sentiment have capped the downside in EUR SEK  We expect the apparent global slowdown and a domestic deceleration of housing investments to weigh on the Swedish economy in 2019  which in turn is a potential headwind for the pro cyclical SEK  Thus  we see only limited downside potential in EUR SEK from today s levels  This is reflected in our forecasts  where we see the cross at 10 10  10 00 and 10 00 in three  six and 12 months respectively 
As stated above  poor risk sentiment is in general negative for the SEK  Looking at historical correlations between the global equity index MSCI and couple of currency pairs  we see that the usual suspect JPY seems to offer the best protection during stock market corrections and this is especially true versus the SEK  The other two major currencies included  EUR and USD  have also fared well against the SEK during major equity selloffs 

Although correlation must not be taken for causality  it might still serve well to remember this as we move forward into 2019  On top of continued uncertainty regarding the USChina trade deal still to be negotiated  we also have a prolonged Brexit process to consider  which adds to the financial markets  uncertainty  If the sour risk sentiment is here to stay  we are hard pressed to find reasons to be overly SEK bullish moving forward  regardless of the December hike  That said  our base case is that a hard Brexit will be avoided  while China and the US will eventually strike a deal   if so  this would be risk friendly and an argument for some stabilisation of the SEK over the course of the year ",2019-01-25,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reading-the-markets-sweden--25-january-2019-200381683,200381683

EUR SEK   For many years  the Swedish money market curve was too steep relative to peers which suggested that re pricing of the curve would push EUR SEK higher  this is not the case anymore as market pricing of the Riksbank is now closely aligned with the ECB  The scope for re pricing in relative terms is  in our view  perhaps more in favour of the SEK  But  we continue to look for a cyclical slowdown in 2019  a potential headwind for the krona  In all  we see only limited downside potential in EUR SEK from here  We raise the 1M forecast to 10 20 and keep the 3  6 and 12M forecasts intact at 10 10  10 00 and 10 00 
EUR DKK  EUR DKK rose close to 7 4680 in December   a move which triggered DKK12bn in FX intervention by Danmarks Nationalbank  EUR DKK peaked in December and we expect it to head lower from here  It will probably be a slow process as a firm recovery in equity markets is needed to spur DKK buying from domestic investors through rebalancing of FX hedges  At the same time  low front end rates due to the high net position will slow the pace of DKK appreciation  We forecast EUR DKK at 7 4640 in 1M  7 4600 in 3M and 7 4550 in 6 12M 
EUR USD  A higher range   now around 1 15   is justified by a move higher in real rate spreads as the Fed has withdrawn support  As Q1 progresses  we expect the second stage of the EUR USD rebound that we forecast this year to be reached with a another leg higher in the cross towards 1 20 mid year  We have lifted our short term profile a tad and see EUR USD at 1 15 in 1M  1 17  1 13  in 3M  1 20  1 18  in 6M  and 1 25  unchanged  in 12M  In other words  while we do not yet have lift off in the sense of new cycle highs being within reach  the EUR USD  rocket   which valuation suggests will eventually escape gravity  is now on the launchpad   but a trade deal and or a first ECB hike is needed for next stages of the firing to be reached 
EUR GBP  Our EUR GBP forecasts are based on our main scenario that May s Brexit plan eventually will be approved by parliament  We expect this to pave the way for a significant decline in EUR GBP early spring  We target 0 84 in 3M  and 0 83 in 6 12M  However  Brexit is a  digital event  and we emphasise that the key risk to our bullish GBP view is that Brexit clarifications are dragged out   even beyond 30 March if Article 50 is extended  in that case  GBP appreciation will be much more moderate and materialise later than our forecast  main scenario  implies

Finally  a new government and budget 
At the time of writing the Swedish Riksdag parliament has not yet voted for the Social Democrat L fv n as Prime Minister  but this is probably only a formality  He will pass the parliament on Friday 18 January  He will now be able to form a government with the Greens  same as the outgoing government   but the platform for its future success has changed  It now rests on the 73 point deal struck with the middle parties  the Centre Party and the Liberals  and the implementation of the programme will be checked continuously  There is a glitch though  The government s former support partner  the Left Party  has been ousted 
Its party leader says it will let L fv n form the Government  while threatening it will propose a no confidence vote if some of the points in the deal are put forward  Currently  it is hard to gauge if this is an empty threat or not  If it does so at some point in the future  they will get enough support from the three right wing parties to oust this government 
The budget implications are very unclear as the deal is largely without figures  However  1  The income tax cuts from the Moderate Christian Democrats enacted by the Riksdag in December cannot be reversed this year  but other tax cut can be changed  tax on airline tickets for instance  and will be reversed  2  The deal contains a SEK15bn green tax swap  meaning environmental taxes  read energy taxes  will be hiked in exchange for tax cuts on jobs and business  3  Income taxes will be cut by SEK15bn  SEK6bn lower payroll tax and SEK7bn in the top 5  state income tax   4  It aims to reduce subsidised household borrowing by phasing out mortgage interest tax deductions  now 30    5  It aims at reopening talks on high speed rail  a 20 30 year project   but it is unclear whether this will be financed within the DO framework or outside  Two politically very hot additional issues that the Left Party opposed are easing labour market regulations and increasing the degree of free rent setting  In total  we see the budget as mildly expansionary  but there is some uncertainty regarding the distribution  winners  high income individuals in the cities  losers  middle income individuals in the country  owning a house and dependent on cars for transportation  
Datawise  December inflation turned out a tenth higher i e  spot on Riksbank s forecasts for CPIF and CPIF excl  Energy at 2 2   y y and 1 5   y y  Looking forward  inflation is set to remain high in the first half of 2019 as the food industry needs to compensate for soaring input prices due to last summer s drought  Later this year we expect core inflation to be lower than the Riksbank s forecast  That said  the November consumption indicator was weaker than expected  suggesting consumption remains depressed in Q4  It also confirms our GDP model signal of a mere 0 8   y y GDP growth 
Is the unemployment rate bottoming out 
There are two important data points out this week pertaining to December which go into our GDP model 
The unemployment rate has dropped significantly over the past two months in an unusual seasonal pattern  While the unadjusted unemployment rate reached new lows  lowest since 2007 08   the development of the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is more unclear  It appears to have been on an upward trend since February 2018  but the recent drop questions that trend  Labour market developments is the next big thing to keep in focus for the macro economy  We expect a slight increase in both unadjusted and seasonally adjusted unemployment in December 
The main question for retail trade is if the Christmas sales caused any further gain from the 1 1   y y recorded in November  For instance  the Swedish Trade Federation s monthly index suggests clothing  shoe sales dropped by 3 8  y y in nominal terms  and roughly as much deflated by CPI clothing   We have a slightly optimistic approach here  expecting sales in other areas to outweigh clothing  going for a 1 5   y y increase 
Close short dated ASW spreads  consider moving further out on the Kommuninvest curve
Since we added K2012 ASW at end November  the position has performed by around 5bp  Admittedly  the spread performance has been supported by the trend higher in fixing spreads  In our view  we are probably close to the peak in fixings and expect ted spreads to move tighter in the coming weeks  The FRA MAR19 Riba JUN19 ted spread is currently trading around 14bp  Given that total excess liquidity continues to accumulate  we see no convincing reason why the equilibrium level for the 3M  NYSE MMM  fixing spread would have moved higher 

The volatile demand for RB certicates may create some short term noise  but we think that the current rise in 3M Stibor is unsustainable  Furthermore  the rise in the 3M Libor OIS spread has abated since the turn of the year  Normally the correlation with 3M fixing spreads in SEK is rather unstable over time  However  the rise in swapped 3M USD Libor to SEK has probably been the main contributor to the SEK fixing spread widening  Thus  3M Stibor could start moving lower in the near term 

As short dated swaps have been pushed higher by the rising fixing spreads  ted spreads further out on the money market curve have also been affected   we are inclined to close our long positions in short dated ASW spreads  Thus  we close our long position in K2012 ASW with a 5 5bp profit 
During fall  we also recommended buying SGB1047  December 2020  in an ASW to benefit from the lack of t bills and short dated bonds going into year end  Despite the rise in fixings  this position has not performed  As the rationale for entering the position is more or less gone  we close the position with a 3bp loss 
Longer dated Kommuninvest bonds have performed poorly in recent months  both relative to covered bonds and to other agencies denominated in SEK  Although agencies have generally widened in ASW terms  the underperformance in Kommuninvest stands out  Kommuninvest now trades considerably cheaper than the less liquid EIB and Kfw in the same segment 

The underperformance relative to covered bonds also stands out  When credit spreads are under pressure as has been the case in recent months  Kommuninvest generally tends to perform relative to covered bonds as Kommuninvest bonds tend to behave as more defensive assets  This time around  the opposite has been true  Covered bonds have continued to tighten relative to matching Kommuninvest bonds despite the shift in credit sentiment 

Thus  we think the underperformance in longer dated Kommuninvest bonds is overdone  We therefore recommend buying longer dated Kommuninvest bonds  such as K2410 ASW  October 2024     23bp  We set the levels to 12 31bp ",2019-01-18,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reading-the-markets-sweden--18-january-2019-200382448,200382448

194334,415850,MMM,Week Ahead  NASDAQ Enters Bear Market  Will Other U S  Indices Follow ,opinion,"US markets suffer worst week since 2011
Yields  USD slip
Oil plunge continues
Several market themes collided on Friday  weighing on equities that had already been pressured earlier in the week  The massive trading volume  greater than what had been seen in years  drove stocks to their worst week since August 2011 
The S P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both dropped significantly  down 2 06  and 1 81  respectively  while the NASDAQ  which slipped almost 3   officially entered a bear market  Yields fell as well as investors  fleeing equities  moved into the safety of Treasurys 
Quadruple Witching  New Political Headwinds Drive Selloff
Quadruple witching compounded volatility on Friday  futures and options expirations for indices and equities pummeled stocks which were already under pressure from rate hike jitters  This was aggravated by headlines ahead of the weekend that US President Donald Trump  had discussed firing the Fed chair Jerome Powell amid an elevated risk of a coming recession 
Broader political concerns exacerbated the selloff  including the uncertainty caused by personnel turmoil in the White House and the advent of a partial government shutdown  which took effect on Saturday  Fueling concerns  the Senate adjourned on Saturday for the holiday  which means there s no hope of a deal until after the Christmas break  Trump President Trump insists on  5B to fund a border wall but doesn t have enough votes to support the funding he desires  minority leader Chuck Schumer told the president   If you want to open the government  you must abandon the wall  plain and simple 
Still  as a rule  government shutdowns rarely impact the market in a significant way  And that s using a 100  shutdown as an example  The current closure effects only at 25  of services  the remaining 75  continue to be funded 
Ironically  dovish comments by Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams provided an early boost to stocks on Friday  He said that the central bank could reassess its interest rate policy and balance sheet reduction in the new year if the economy slows  However  escalating selling pressure later in the day overwhelmed the temporary bullish attempt 
All major US benchmarks topped out to finish the week 

S P 500 losses were driven by its two tech sectors  Communication Services underperformed   2 95    followed by Technology   2 62    Utilities  the only sector in the green  outperformed   0 43   
For the week  the benchmark dropped 7 05 percent  with all sectors deep in the red  Even the two best performing sectors Utilities and Materials  noteworthy amid tariff jitters  each slumped 5 30 percent 
Oil s 17 5 month low enhanced the technology rout  driving an underperformance in Energy shares   9 63    Technically  the S P sliced through its 100 WMA and is headed forcefully toward its 200 WMA  which is guarding the bottom of a channel in place since the mid 2009 bottom 
This is the first time this has occurred since the February 2016 bottom  The channel bottom is at 23000  another 4 5  lower  and it s the first place we d even consider looking for a bottom  That would put the average in bear territory  which can snowball into an even deeper correction  as it would violate the channel bottom  for the first time since the aftermath of the 2008 crash
Even though the Dow declined 414 23 points  its 1 81  loss  rendered it Friday s best performing index  On a weekly basis as well  the mega cap benchmark outperformed  shedding 6 87  of value 
We have been providing bearish signals  including the flattening of the yield curve amid a top for the 10 year yield  and a record close last week for Utilities  Markets are following through on these patterns 

The tech heavy NASDAQ Composite plunged on Friday  losing 2 99   It was the laggard among the major indices  Every member of the FAANG cohort lost more than 2 5 percent  though Twitter Inc  NYSE TWTR  plummeted even further  down more than 6 percent 
Since the summer the NASDAQ Composite has fallen over 20   putting it in a bear market  For the week  the NASDAQ fell 7 94  
The Russell 2000 was the second worst performer ahead of the weekend  with a 2 7 percent slump  It was also the worst performing benchmark for the week  dropping 7 94 percent  falling to its lowest level since mid 2015 
Where To From Here 
Market observers disagree as to where the market goes from here  Some consider this the bottom 
Jeffrey Saut  an analyst for Raymond James  says  on a worldwide basis  valuations are the cheapest they ve been in a decade  The global P E is down to 13 3 on next year s earnings  He points out that the real yield curve yield was always the 3 month T bill to the 30 year Treasury bond  and that is nowhere near inversion 
We could support his assertion from a technical perspective  at least in the short term 
Nevertheless  there s also the bearish argument 
The resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis  who opted to leave the cabinet after the president announced he was pulling out US troops from Syria  added to market worries  Traders in the bearish camp expect additional bad headlines going into the holidays  with the shutdown in effect  Trump s escalating unpredictability and historically low trading volume this time of year  when markets are generally quiet 
Beginning in January  when the Democratic House majority takes over  a divided government will not make it easier for the Trump administration to get any policy decisions through  as they did with the most significant tax cut in history and regulation rollbacks  which earlier this year contributed to the so called  positive  Trump trade 
Former presidential candidate Ron Paul believes a depression era sized pullback could happen within the next 12 months  The former Congressman thinks that free money QE and near zero interest rates have been drugs to which investors have become addicted  The removal of accommodation  which has hidden the symptoms but worsened the condition  will cause a stock market meltdown that will be worse than what occurred in 1929 
We skew toward the bearish side of the argument  though not at the level of severity Paul is predicting  Wednesday s  winners  Utilities  REITs and non durable Consumer Staples the areas of safety where investors may have been hiding  were sold off in forced selling  on margin calls and redemptions  This might create a short term bottom  at least for the next couple of weeks 

Stocks could  however  receive a surprise boost from somewhere else   the dollar  We ve been noting that in the long term  we see the dollar declining  If this turns out to be a massive top for the greenback since early 2015  as the MAs  MACD are setting up  it would give an enormous boost to multinational firms  whose less expensive exports might provide the leg up this stock market needs  This would also help the 35  of US GDP that comes from the non US consumer side of the equation 

Meanwhile  oil continues to crash  reaching an almost 18 month low last week  after burning through the 200 WMA and closing near the bottom of the session on Friday

194335,415851,MMM,Current 3M Stiborfixing Level Too High   Receive FRA MAR19 Versus The Matching Rib,opinion,"In 2018  the usual turn effect disappeared earlier than in previous years 
Apart from expectations of a Riksbank rate hike  this appears driven by cheapening of USD liquidity in FX forwards 

The rate hike bias may also have contributed to wider fixing spread  on top of the direct effect of a rate hike  
However  from a longer term perspective  the 3M  NYSE MMM  Stibor fixing has on average been very close to the Riksbank repo rate   0 49  in the 2016 to June 2018 period  

Liquidity situation in SEK has not fundamentally changed as the structural excess liquidity has continued to accumulate  Effects from FX forwards in USD and EUR are thus likely to be transitory 
A 3M fixing 12 bp above the Riksbank repo rate should decrease the appetite for weekly Riksbank certificates  offered at the Riksbank repo rate  
Market likely to respond to the maturity of SGB1052 by
buying fewer Riksbank certificates
The Riksbank QE programme is set to continue with reinvestments at least until June 2019  as previously communicated 
We would expect some more details about future plans at the April meeting 2019  In the meantime  SGB1052 will mature on 12 March 2019  As the Riksbank holds around SEK47bn in that loan  excess liquidity will decrease by around SEK49bn  including the coupon payment  

However  the market should respond by buying less weekly Riksbank certificates 
Our view on fixings is that there has historically been a threshold effect on excess liquidity  whenever excess liquidity exceeds SEK100bn  fixings should be low on average  In 2010 11  fixings did not increase until the last 1Y Riksbank repo expired and liquidity fell well under these levels 

We are currently significantly above these levels  above 10bp   Also  the spot level for fixing spreads tends to drive FRA Riba spreads all along the money market curve 
Ted spreads likely to move tighter from elevated levels
Several factors point towards current fixings being excessively high 
  SEK excess liquidity to remain ample and close to record highs even after SGB1052 maturity 
  There are no redemptions in benchmark covered bonds in the coming months  Only the smaller

Kommuninvest loan K1903 will mature in the coming months  SEK19 3bn remaining   so there is no need for issuers to hoard liquidity 
  Rate hikes are unlikely in the coming months   first hike in the current path is after summer 2019 and risks are likely to be on the downside compared to that forecast 
  The year end effect from cheapening USD liquidity is likely to fade as domestic liquidity conditions should prevail over time 

As the short end Ted spread tends to reverberate all along the money market curve  we like going for tighter fixing spreads 
  We like receiving the matching FRA MAR19 versus RibaJun19  weekly compounded Riksbank repo rate between Mar19 and Jun19 IMM     11 5bp

194336,415852,MMM,CSL Vs  MMM  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Diversified Operations stocks have likely encountered both Carlisle  CSL  and 3M  MMM   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Carlisle has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while 3M has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that CSL has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
CSL currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 29  while MMM has a forward P E of 17 02  We also note that CSL has a PEG ratio of 0 95  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  MMM currently has a PEG ratio of 1 67 
Another notable valuation metric for CSL is its P B ratio of 2 18  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  MMM has a P B of 10 38 
Based on these metrics and many more  CSL holds a Value grade of B  while MMM has a Value grade of D 
CSL stands above MMM thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that CSL is the superior value option right now ",2019-01-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/csl-vs-mmm-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200372917,200372917

Central banks getting nervous 
The FOMC minutes published last Wednesday along with a series of dovish comments from FOMC members including Chair Powel are important in our view  The Federal Reserve has been pretty much on auto pilot for quite a while  but no more it seems  The so called dot plots still show a median forecast saying two more rate hikes this year but one gets the impression that board members are uncertain about the appropriate next step and for now the Fed seems to be on hold  The Fed has noticed the Q4 equity market turmoil but we sense that the fundamental issue is a higher degree of uncertainty about the global economic outlook 
In the meantime  Eurozone  EZ  data have not been very upbeat  rather the opposite  Business and consumer confidence declined again in December  The numbers are still a bit above the 2015 16 levels but there is nothing that suggests a growth rebound in Q4  Hard data are disappointing as well  Industrial production  November  was poor in France    2 1  y y  and lousy in Germany   4 7    Retail sales  also November  were modest at best  1 1  y y  

Swedish macro data have been mixed but tilted to the soft side  Our GDP proxy suggests that GDP continued to lose momentum into the fourth quarter  even though the latest observation  December  must be taken with a grain of salt considering that several data have not been published yet 

In short  the story that gripped markets late last year   that of a cyclical slowdown   seems to be corroborated by recent data 
All this is reflected in market pricing  The table below shows annually implied central bank rate changes derived from 1m forward OIS 


What really stands out is the US  where the market is now pricing in rate cuts rather than hikes  In our view that might be somewhat stretched  Another interesting observation is that it is only this year that pricing of the Riksbank and the ECB deviates to any meaningful degree  In Sweden the market is not fully pricing in another 25bp rate hike  whereas for the ECB the market foresees only a marginal probability of a hike 
However  from 2020 and the following four years implied rate hikes are almost identical  For now  we do not see a reason to expect that the Riksbank would move at a slower pace than the ECB over the next 4 5 years  To us this suggests that implied Riksbank rate hikes in 2020 24 are at or close to the lower bound   unless the ECB adjusts its rate guidance lower 
This year is another matter  though  The December Riksbank minutes released this week suggest that  even though all members but one agreed to raise the repo rate  the Riksbank is not on a pre set course  There was a lot of talk about global downside risks and again no mention of signs of higher wage growth 
With the Fed announcing a more cautious approach the question is what can be expected from the ECB  At the December board meeting  the central bank for the first time openly said that data had not lived up to expectations but it did not adjust forward guidance on rates  If data do not start to look better pretty soon  it would not be a big surprise if the ECB would signal more caution as well 
The Riksbank at its latest meeting pushed the next forecasted hike from summer to autumn  Our guess is that the Riksbank sticks to the current rate path at the upcoming meeting in February  announcement 13 February   At the time of the April meeting Q4 GDP will have been published  The Riksbank forecast is 1 4  y y  which based on current information looks too high  We think that would provide the Riksbank with a strong argument to shift the hike further out by another quarter at the April meeting  We are sceptical about the reasons to deliver another hike in 2019 
For the whole of 2019  we estimate that around 20bp is expected from the Riksbank  see table below   Even though the probability of a rate hike is far from zero  we see current pricing as being clearly on the high side  If the market postponed what is currently discounted in Q3 19 to Q4  it would justify FRA SEP19 moving lower by around 10bp 
Moreover  as we wrote earlier  we do not expect the current rise in the 3M  NYSE MMM  Stibor versus the average repo rate spread  FRA MAR19 versus Riba JUN19 currently at  14 5bp  to be sustainable in an environment that continues to reach new record levels each week  if we disregard the volatile weekly demand for Riksbank certificates   We expect fixing spreads to gradually move lower  which should provide some tailwind for receiving FRA SEP19 
We therefore recommend receiving FRA SEP19 outright    1 5bp  We set the P L levels to  10  10bp 
Loss taken  On the back of the above our trade recommendation  receive FRA SEP19 versus FRA SEP21 and the opposite in EUR  no longer makes sense  which is why we close the position at a small cost  5bp  
New trade  We see a good case for the Riksbank to delay another hike  Therefore we see value in receiving FRA SEP19   1 5bp  P L    10  10bp  

Expect December inflation sub Riksbank  with a downside risk
We expect CPIF and CPIF excluding Energy to print 2 1  y y and 1 4  y y respectively  both figures being 0 1 percentage points below Riksbank s forecasts  Higher prices for international airline tickets and charter packages are the main contributors to Swedish inflation this month  but we also expect a certain increase in food and clothing  Looking at Danish and Norwegian December data  however  suggests there is a downside risk to our forecast  food and clothing prices actually fell in both countries  The data on airline tickets and charter packages were mixed  In the background  however  Travelmarket s Flight Price Index for December showed a smaller than normal increase  suggesting a slight downside risk 




Profit taken in short EUR SEK   neutral ahead of CPI week
As we expected the Riksbank raised the repo rate in December and as expected it lent support to the SEK  while EUR SEK has trended slightly lower since then  That said  the dovish tilt and poor risk sentiment have capped the downside in EUR SEK  The market doubts whether the Riksbank is set to deliver a second hike this year as do we  see table   For many years the Swedish money market curve was too steep relative to peers  which suggested that re pricing of the curve would push EUR SEK higher  This is not the case anymore as market pricing of the Riksbank is now closely aligned with the ECB  2020 and beyond   The scope for re pricing in relative terms is  in our view  perhaps more in favour of the SEK  Meanwhile  we continue to look for a cyclical slowdown in 2019  a potential headwind for the SEK  although it is more of a consensus call now  In all  we see only limited downside potential in EUR SEK  which is reflected in our 3M target at 10 10 


In December  we entered a short position in EUR SEK in anticipation of the first hike in seven years  We noted that it was close to a 50 50 call in terms of pricing  a 55  45  event among currency investors according to our own survey  the FX Thermometer  while  finally  bank analysts favoured on hold  February hike   Hence  we saw good risk reward to be long SEK  This week we closed the trade at 10 1850 with a 1 3  profit  We prefer to be square ahead of next week s inflation data  where our forecast is slightly below the Riksbank  see above   the vote on the new PM and government in Sweden and the Brexit vote in the House of Commons 
We note that EUR SEK is trading close to fair value  10 20  as implied by short term rates and a proxy for risk sentiment 

The government end game has arrived  Four months have now passed since Election Day  The only concrete result is that the conservative  Moderate   Christian Democrats  budget gained approval in the parliament  Regarding the new PM  however  the positions appears to be as locked as ever  The two main candidates  Stefan L fven and Ulf Kristersson  have both been voted down and now only two attempts remain until a snap election is triggered

194339,415855,MMM,Brexit Monitor   May Is Losing Control Over The Brexit Process But No Credible ,opinion,"The House of Commons went back to business this week and the first thing on the agenda for 2019 was the debate and vote on PM Theresa May s Brexit deal  which began on Wednesday  The vote is due to take place on Tuesday  15 January  Nothing seems to have changed since the MPs went on Christmas holiday and the most likely outcome is still that the deal will be voted down next week  we now estimate an 85  probability up from 75  given the development this week  more on that below   PM May s strategy was to get  further assurances  from the EU  but it has not been sufficient to win MPs over  The EU has very clearly said that it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement  but has expressed it is not in the EU s interest to keep the UK in the backstop indefinitely  The EU would probably like to be more helpful  but has not been able to help May  as she has not told the EU leaders what she needs to get support for her deal 

What happens if the deal is voted down  A defeat seems widely expected  so markets will not react to the defeat itself but to the size of the defeat  A narrow defeat means that she might be able to get it through at a later stage when we are closer to the 29 March deadline  but a big defeat means we are in uncharted territory  and we cannot rule out that Theresa May will resign   Based on her defeat on the so called  what next  amendment on Wednesday this week  May will be forced to present a Brexit plan B within three days if she loses the vote on Tuesday  which seems very likely  Remember that a previous amendment means that the MPs can debate and amend her plan B  Both mean that the House of Commons has taken more control over the Brexit process  but the problem remains that there is no credible alternative with backing from a majority of the House  also the EU negotiates with government and officials  not parliaments   It also means that PM Theresa May is not able to run down the clock in order to get support for her deal 

We still think some outcomes are more likely than others  see our game tree on page 4   The default option is a no deal Brexit  but it would only happen  by accident   While some hardcore Brexiteers are advocating a no deal Brexit  there is not a majority for it in parliament and the government s defeats on several amendments support this view  The problem is that it will happen nonetheless by default unless the centrist MPs from different parties find a common way forward and so far they have failed to do so  We attach a 15  probability of a no deal Brexit  assuming the deal is voted down next week  
We continue to believe the probabilities of a soft Norway style Brexit and snap election are low  10  and 5   respectively  assuming the deal is voted down next week   In the soft Norway style Brexit  there would not be any economic consequences  but the political damage would be significant  as the UK would be subject to all EU laws  including EU contributions and accepting free movement of people  without representation in institutions  agencies  etc  In that case  it would make more sense to just stay in the EU  We think the probability of a snap election is very low  The Prime Minister cannot call for a snap election anymore and this could only occur if  1  the Commons voted for no confidence in the government and no new government was formed within two weeks  or  2  the Commons dissolved itself by a two thirds majority  It is difficult to see the Conservative MPs having the incentive to support a snap election  as they risk losing their seats  Labour and the Conservatives are neck and neck in the opinion polls  
This leaves us with two possible outcome  either PM Theresa May s deal  or something very similar  passes the House of Commons at a later stage in a second attempt when we get closer to the deadline  or the politicians agree to call for a second EU referendum  As something needs to settle for the politicians to choose one of the options  we think it is difficult to predict which one is most likely  but at the moment we attach a slightly higher probability of the former than the latter  40  and 30   respectively  assuming the deal is voted down next week   While it is from an economic perspective positive that PM Theresa May s deal is probably the hardest realistic version of the Brexit on the table right now  uncertainty is high and the probability is increasing that the UK must ask for an extension of the Article 50 deadline  According to The Telegraph  paywall  8 January   British officials are  putting out feelers  with the EU for an extension of Article 50  If the Article 50 deadline is extended  the UK may need to hold European Parliament elections  for which there is time enough to call from a legal perspective  but may be very chaotic from a political perspective in the current situation 

What is the argument for the deal passing the House of Commons at a later stage  The main argument is the passing of time  While companies  investors and analysts all seem exhausted from the Brexit uncertainty and think the deadline is very fast approaching  the deadline is still  far away  from a political perspective  As time goes by and 29 March draws closer  the pressure on the politicians increases  which is an argument we have highlighted many times  Soft Brexiteers within the Conservative Party would then be inclined to vote in favour of the deal despite it not delivering the perfect Brexit in their view  as they would fear the alternative would be a majority for a second referendum  something the moderate Conservatives have already threatened   Moderate Labour MPs may support the deal when they find out that a snap election is unlikely  This scenario requires enough politicians willing to compromise eventually 
UK politicians may call for a second EU referendum either if they find out they cannot find a way forward themselves or if moderate MPs start backing staying inside the EU  A second referendum would require an extension of the Article 50 deadline  as it would require at least 4 6 months to organise the referendum  As the UK is on summer holiday in July August  a second EU referendum would most likely be held in September  perhaps late June at the very earliest but it seems optimistic in our view   meaning that the UK would probably need a nine months extension of Article 50  Staying inside the EU has been made easier as the European Court of Justice has ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke the Article 50 notification without changes to the existing member terms  Looking at the opinion polls  the share of the voters regretting the Brexit decision is increasing and the remain camp is currently ahead in polls  53  on average versus 47    Overall  we still see this as very close 

Another way forward could be to ask the EU for a long extension of 9 12 months in order to make time for negotiations on the future relationship  The two main issues for UK politicians have been the Irish backstop and not knowing details of what the future relationship looks like  Looking back at the past two years  the UK and the EU27 were actually supposed to start negotiating the future relationship in 2018 after the first phase of the negotiations was concluded late 2017  Due to internal disputes in the UK  especially over the Irish backstop  this did not happen  By extending the deadline  there will be more time to make the negotiations on the future relationship  without reopening the Withdrawal Agreement  which would probably make it easier for Theresa May to get her deal through parliament  The question is whether the EU would accept such an idea 
FX outlook  key risk to our bullish GBP view is that Brexit
clarifications are dragged out
As argued above  it appears likely that PM Theresa May will lose the Brexit vote next week  but markets might react to the size of the defeat  Unless we see a big defeat  we think EUR GBP is likely to stay boxed in the current 0 88 0 9060 range near term  As the 29 March deadline approaches  upside risks to EUR GBP may dominate unless we get further clarifications  We thus raise our 1M EUR GBP forecast from 0 88 to 0 90 

Longer term  our EUR GBP FX forecast is based on our main scenario that May s Brexit plan eventually will be approved by parliament  We expect this to pave the way for a significant decline in EUR GBP  We target 0 84 in 3M  NYSE MMM   and 0 83 in 6 12M  However  it is a close call and all options are still on the table  meaning the post Brexit outcome space for EUR GBP remains extremely wide  which will keep volatility high 

That said  we still attribute the highest probabilities to either a decent Brexit  Theresa May s Brexit plan in some form  or a new referendum and both are positive for GBP in our view  Especially  if a second referendum is called  we expect GBP to appreciate as the probability distribution is likely to shift substantially in favour of  NO Brexit  and  Decent Brexit   We expect EUR GBP to settle in the 0 82 0 86 range until the referendum  most likely in September  in this scenario 
Hence  a key risk to our bullish GBP view is that Brexit clarifications are dragged out   even beyond 30 March if Article 50 is extended  and the GBP appreciation consequently will be much more moderate and materialise later than our forecast  main scenario  implies  In a scenario where the EU and UK agree to extend Article 50 in order to further negotiations about the future relationship  this would be moderately positive for GBP as it increases the probability that the UK parliament eventually will support the deal 
FX strategy  Short EUR GBP via options
Timing a possible break lower in EUR GBP is very difficult and given the high degree of uncertainty related to Brexit  we prefer to position for GBP appreciation via FX options 
We are short EUR GBP via 1M 4M put calendar spread as one of our FX Top Trades for 2019  the sold 1M put has expired in our FX Top Trades   Risk premiums  EUR GBP volatility  is much lower compared to the peak in December  and we still like to position for a lower EUR GBP by selling 1M puts and buying 3 6M puts 
Hedging GBP income asset
We generally recommend hedging GBP income assets by buying EUR GBP call options 

In our view  volatility  option price  is fair given the risk of a bounce in EUR GBP and not least given the downside potential in our main scenario and other GBP positive scenarios such as a new referendum or  no Brexit  
Corporate clients should consider to hedge the entire 2019 flow via 4 6M call options 
Hedges can then subsequently be swapped out to the actual pay dates when Brexit is clarified  The risk to this strategy is that Brexit remains unresolved when the bought options expire  which then would require one to buy another period of protection 
Hedging GBP expenses
We are approaching the end of the Brexit path  and we recommend clients hedging GBP payables to use bounces in the spot to increase hedge ratios and hedge horizons via FX forwards  Given the risk of a prolonged period of uncertainty clients could consider hedging via risk reversals  1 3M  ",2019-01-11,Danske Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/brexit-monitor--may-is-losing-control-over-the-brexit-process-but-no-credible-200382429,200382429

Investors will be hoping for strength from MMM as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be January 24  2019  The company is expected to report EPS of  2 28  up 8 57  from the prior year quarter  Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  7 98 billion  down 0 07  from the year ago period 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  9 95 per share and revenue of  32 85 billion  These totals would mark changes of  8 51  and  3 77   respectively  from last year 
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for MMM  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability

194346,415862,MMM,An Early Christmas Present  To SEK  From The Riksbank  ,opinion,"EUR NOK  Once again  the NOK has weakened in the final months of the year  This time  the move was triggered by souring global risk appetite and falling oil prices  Meanwhile  we still expect the cross to move lower in 2019 on the relatively better growth outlook  valuation and Norges Bank  NB  continuing its hiking cycle  Indeed  at the December NB meeting  the central bank confirmed its intention to hike policy rates twice in 2019 with the next hike due in March  this is more than current market pricing  In addition  we think oil prices are set to move higher on both supply  and demand related factors  We roll the front end of our forecast profile to 9 50 in 1M  from 9 60  but keep the profile unchanged at 9 40 in 3M  NYSE MMM   9 20 in 6M and 9 10 in 12M 
EUR SEK  November inflation data pushed EUR SEK higher while it lowered the probability of a December rate hike  We acknowledge this uncertainty  but stick to our call for a 25bp rate hike  If we are right and if the communication is not overly dovish  it should pull EUR SEK towards and possibly below 10 20  with a test of the December low at 10 16 being feasible  However  the cyclical slowdown in Sweden is a headwind for the SEK and the Riksbank could become hesitant to commit to a hiking cycle as a result  If  contrary to our expectations  the Riksbank leaves rates unchanged this month  it could seriously question the hiking cycle altogether  In that case  EUR SEK could very well rally towards 10 50 and establish a higher range than we pencil into our base scenario  That said  in our base case of  at least  one Riksbank hike near term  we see EUR SEK at 10 10 in 1M and keep our forecast profile intact at 10 10 in 3M  10 00 in 6M and 10 00 in 12M 
EUR DKK  DKK is relatively more exposed to an escalation in the global trade war  as the Danish economy is small and very open and has significant exposure to global shipping  Furthermore  Denmark has net exposure to the stock market due to  in particular  the Danish Life and Pension  L P  sector s large holdings of US and euro area stocks  This  in addition to the easier DKK liquidity situation and negative FX forwards  helps to explain the recent rise in EUR DKK to the 7 4600 level  We expect the pair to trade around 7 4600 in 1M  revised up from 7 4550   7 4550 in 3M  revised up from 7 4525  and 7 4550  n 6 12M 
EUR USD  Although the ECB has now formally ended its asset purchase programme  the December meeting made it clear that rate hikes are not imminent  Meanwhile  the Fed looks determined to get to  neutral  on rates  which following the recent softer pricing of its cycle  leaves risks titled towards continued carry and cyclical support for the USD  We maintain the view that EUR USD is caught in a range of around 1 13 near term  while we still believe ECB  normalisation  and valuation are set to support the cross on a 6 12M horizon  We maintain our forecast profile and thus continue to see EUR USD at 1 13 in 1M and 3M  1 18 in 6M  and 1 25 in 12M

194354,415870,MMM,EUR USD  Euro Posts Gains As Trump Holds Off On New Chinese Tariffs,opinion,"EUR USD has posted gains in the Monday session  Currently  the pair is trading at 1 1347  up 0 25  on the day  On the release front  German and eurozone manufacturing PMIs both missed their estimates  with both indicators posting readings of 51 8 points  In the U S  today s key event is ISM Manufacturing PMI  which is expected to tick lower to 57 7 points  On Tuesday  the eurozone releases PPI  which is expected to remain pegged at 0 5  
German indicators have been pointing lower  and this worrying trend continued on Monday  Manufacturing PMI dropped to 51 8 in November  down from 52 2 points in October  This marked a fourth straight downturn and was the lowest reading since April 2016  The global trade war has taken a bite out of German exports and a slowdown in the eurozone economy has dampened manufacturing growth in Germany  On Friday  German retail sales fell by 0 3   its first decline since July  Consumers are holding tighter to the purse strings  which is hurting economic growth  Unsurprisingly  consumer confidence softened in November   the reading of 10 4 points was its lowest level since May 2017 
The G 20 summit ended on the weekend  and there was an audible sigh of relief from the markets after a meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping  Trump suspended his threat to raise tariffs on Chinese products on January 1 from 10 percent to 25 percent  The sides agreed to continues talks for another 90 days  and the U S  tariffs will take effect if no agreement is reached  The  cease fire  was welcome news for investors  and the increase in risk appetite on Monday has led to broad losses for the U S  dollar  Still  the U S  and China remain far apart on a deal  and the greenback will likely reverse directions unless the parties make substantial progress in the trade dispute  which has shaken the markets and threatens to derail global growth

194355,415871,MMM,Investors Fret Over Inverse Yield Curves And Global Growth,opinion,"Wednesday December 5  Five things the markets are talking about
Euro and Asian equities fell overnight  following the stateside rout Tuesday  though declines were contained  Currently  U S equity futures are a tad better bid after China pledged to start delivering on trade agreements reached with the U S last weekend in Argentina 
China s Commerce Ministry said trade negotiations would proceed  based on a timetable  and it will swiftly execute on items where there is consensus 
Since the G20 meeting last weekend  the market has been trying to second guess the outlook for global growth  with a percentage of the market betting that the Fed will cut interest rates as soon as 2020 
Note  U S equity and fixed income markets will be closed today in a mark of respect in the passing of President George H  W  Bush 
Elsewhere  sterling has slipped again  reaching a fresh 18 month low of  1 2672  During parliamentary debate on leaving the E U  which started yesterday  PM Theresa May suffered several defeats  An amendment was passed that granted members of parliament the right to have a say in future Brexit plans should May s agreement be rejected next week 
In commodities  oil prices come under pressure again as the market waits for tomorrows critical OPEC meeting where production cuts are expected  Saudi Arabia and Russia are set to meet today for a make or break preparatory meeting that s going to set the direction for the oil market 
1  Equities decline contained for now
Stateside yesterday  stocks plummeted more than  3   led lower by bank and industrial shares  as investors reacted to the inversion of parts of the U S yield curve with a degree of panic   the 2 5 s spread painted a worrying picture about economic growth 
In Japan  the rout continued overnight with the Nikkei falling to a fresh two week low  The Nikkei share average dropped  0 5   while the broader Topix also fell  0 5  
Down under  Aussie shares experienced a similar fate  with recession concerns and doubts about the Sino U S trade talks unnerved investors  Broad based losses pushed the benchmark S P ASX 200 index down  0 8  at the close  On Tuesday  the index fell  1 0   In S  Korea  stocks pared deeper declines as investors  recalibrated expectations from cooling U S China trade tensions  The KOSPI was  0 6  lower at the close  led by Samsung Electronics  KS 005930   which fell  1 7  
In China  investor doubts over whether China and the U S would be able to settle their trade dispute before the 90 day deadline expires shook equity prices  At the close  the blue chip CSI300 index was down  0 5   while the Shanghai Composite Index fell  0 6   In Hong Kong  the Hang Seng index closed  1 6   while the China Enterprises Index lost  1 4  
Note  Data overnight showed that China s services sector grew  53 8 vs  50 7  at its quickest pace in five months in November due to an uptick in new orders  although the outlook for businesses over the next year worsened for the third month 
In Europe  regional bourses trade lower across the board following sharp losses in the U S yesterday and weaker Asian equities  Indices have rebounded off the lows tracking higher U S futures 
U S futures are in the  black    0 57   
Indices  Stoxx600  0 79  at 355 82  FTSE  0 95  at 6 955 72  DAX  0 79 at 11 245 29  CAC 40  0 84  at 4 971 93  IBEX 35  0 69  at 8 999 35  FTSE MIB  0 17  at 19 320 50  SMI  0 97  at 9 003 80  S P 500 Futures  0 57 

2  Oil prices fall on global growth worries and over supply concerns
Oil prices remain under pressure this morning  pulled down by a U S supply glut and a drop in equity markets 
Brent crude oil futures are at   61 14 per barrel  down  94c  or  1 5  from yesterday s close  while U S West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures are at   52 44 per barrel  down  81c  or  1 5  
Oil prices were pressured by yesterday s API data that showed that U S crude inventories rose by  5 4M barrels in the week to Nov  30  to  448M barrels  in a sign that U S  oil markets are in a growing glut 
Markets attention now turns to tomorrow s OPEC meeting in Vienna  OPEC  are working toward a deal to reduce oil output by at least  1 3M  NYSE MMM  bpd  However  Russia s resistance to a major cut is so far the main stumbling block 
Saudi Arabia has indicated a need for steep reductions in output from January  but has come under pressure from President Trump to help support the world economy with lower oil prices 
The Saudi s and Russia are expected to meet today in a  make or break preparatory meeting  that s should set the direction for the oil market 
Gold prices are steady in early trading as the  big  dollar trades contained against G10 currency pairs  Spot gold is at   1 236 85 per ounce  In yesterday s session  prices touched a peak of   1 241 86  their highest since Oct  26  U S gold futures are down  0 4  at   1 241 4 per ounce 

3  U S 10 year Treasury yield falls below 3 
U S government bond prices continue to rally  pushing the yield on 10 year notes further below  3  as investors continue to scramble into longer term bonds 
Concerns about trade tensions with China remain  despite the 90 day truce on tariffs  Investors are also less confident about the ability of the Fed to continue to raise interest rates on the path that policy makers had penciled in at their September meeting 
Note  The Fed was forecasting one more rate increase this year  Dec 19 fed funds are pricing an  83  odds for an xmas hike  and three in 2019  
Fed funds futures indicate the probability that the Fed meets its forecast or exceeds it at 10   That compares with 66  odds that it increases rates two times or less 
The yield on the benchmark 10 year Treasury note fell to a recent  2 928  from  2 990  Monday 
Elsewhere  the German 10 year Bund yield is trading at its lowest level of the year  having fallen to  0 26   while the U K s 10 year Gilt yield has gained  1 bps to  1 287   the first advance in more than a week 
While a lot of bad news has already been priced in  December 11  the day of the Brexit deal vote in the U K parliament  may still result in another spike in risk aversion 

4  Dollar contained for now
The  big  dollar remains contained in a tight range against G10 currency pairs  The USD is caught in the cross currents of safe havens flows  as global stock markets remain volatile  and investors  realignment of Fed rate hike expectations in 2019 
EUR USD   1 1339  trades steady despite some upward revisions in the major European Services PMI data   Beats  Euro Zone  France  Spain  and Italy  Miss  UK  In Line  Germany 
GBP USD   1 2736  was initially higher as the Grieve amendment was perceived to support the pound on reduced Brexit risk of a  no deal Brexit   However  a miss in Nov PMI Services data  see below  has taken some of the wind out of sterling s sails 
The Japanese yen dipped  0 3  to  113 07  the biggest decrease in more than a week 

5  U K service sector growth eases to 28 month low in November 
Data this morning showed that the U K service sector companies experienced another difficult month in November  with both business activity and incoming new work expanding at the weakest rates for almost two and a half years 
IHS Markit CIPS UK Services PMI Business Activity Index fell to 50 4 in November  This was down from 52 2 in October and the lowest reading since July 2016 
Digging deeper  survey respondents suggested that subdued business and consumer spending had held back growth and that heightened Brexit uncertainty had led to delays with clients  business investment decisions 
Service providers signalled a slowdown in new business growth for a third consecutive month

194358,415874,MMM,CR Vs  MMM  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Diversified Operations sector have probably already heard of Crane  CR  and 3M  MMM   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Crane has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while 3M has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This means that CR s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
CR currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 29  while MMM has a forward P E of 19 93  We also note that CR has a PEG ratio of 1 38  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  MMM currently has a PEG ratio of 1 96 
Another notable valuation metric for CR is its P B ratio of 3 05  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  MMM has a P B of 11 20 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CR s Value grade of B and MMM s Value grade of D 
CR sticks out from MMM in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that CR is the better option right now ",2018-12-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cr-vs-mmm-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200367048,200367048
194359,415875,MMM,Brexit Clash Postponed To January  At The Earliest  ,opinion,"Today has been an eventful day  The day started with the ruling from the European Court of Justice confirming the UK can unilaterally revoke the Article 50 notification  which started the negotiations officially  without any changes to the existing membership terms  In the afternoon  PM Theresa May announced the Brexit vote  which was scheduled to take place tomorrow night  would be postponed  The reason was that May was set to suffer a heavy defeat  as around 420 members of parliament would have rejected the deal according to media reports  During her statement  May said she wanted to get  further assurance  from the EU that the backstop solution to the Irish border issue is only temporary  While some hardliners will think Brexit would still not be hard or clean enough  it may persuade some of the softer hardliners and the supporting party DUP from Northern Ireland to vote in favour 
PM Theresa May did not set a date for the vote  She argued that she needs time to talk to her European peers  Under the EU Withdrawal Act the government must make a statement to the House of Commons no later than 21 January on how to proceed if no deal is reached  The question is whether this has already been reached  as May already has presented a deal although not ratified yet  Close to 21 January seems like the earliest date for a vote  at the time of writing  Donald Tusk tweeted the EU27 leaders will discuss Brexit on Thursday to  discuss how to facilitate UK ratification  but that the EU  will not renegotiate the deal  including the backstop  
What will happen from here  Well  basically things have not changed much from our preview released on Sunday  as she would have most likely lost the vote anyway  We still have sympathy for the idea that the deal may pass eventually but it is not a high conviction call  It is a big gamble for the hardliners to vote against it  as May s deal is probably the hardest possible Brexit on the table right now  no majority for no deal Brexit in Parliament   Some Labour MPs will probably also soon realise that the dream of snap elections is dead and that Labour s official stance on Brexit is unrealistic  as the EU would never accept it  The later the vote in the House of Commons is held  the harder it is for the politicians to reject it  because time would be limited to shift course unless the EU27 extends Article 50  While the probability of a no deal Brexit probably rose again today  the overall probability remains low  in our view  as there is no majority for it in the House of Commons  The probabilities of a Norway style or second EU referendum have increased 
In our main scenario  we still expect a  decent  Brexit and we maintain the long held view that EUR GBP will break lower towards 0 83 when we get more clarification  But as we argued in our preview  Brexit will probably remain unresolved when we enter 2019  which should keep EUR GBP volatile and range bound for a prolonged period 
On Sunday  we raised our 1M EUR GBP forecast to 0 88  from 0 84 previously  and raised our 3M  NYSE MMM  target to 0 87  previously 0 83   as the big break lower may not materialise in the coming months  We stress  however  that we see risk skewed to the downside relative to our 3M target in case Brexit is finalised within the next three months  We have kept our 6 12M forecast unchanged at 0 83

European stocks have started today s session deep in the  red   beating losses in Asia overnight and U S futures  as the market considers the ongoing rout in oil market and a mixed bag of data on China s economy and the latest trade developments

2  Crude oil extends steep dive  gold prices steady
Oil prices have extended their steep slide overnight on the back of worries about weakening world demand and oversupply 
Brent crude is down  0 35  at   65 24 per barrel after sinking  6 8  yesterday  while setting an eight month low of   64 61 
Note  Brent soared to a four year high of   86 74 in early October as the market waited for U S sanctions on Iran  but prices have plummeted  25 in four weeks  
U S West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures trade at   55 30 per barrel  for a loss of  0 7   following a descent to a 12 month low of   54 75 overnight 
OPEC warned yesterday that a supply glut could emerge in 2019 as the world economy slows and rivals increase production more quickly than expected 
Led by top exporter Saudi Arabia  OPEC has been making more public statements of late that they would start withholding crude in 2019 to tighten supply and prop up prices 
In its monthly report  IEA left its forecast for global demand growth for 2018 and 2019 unchanged from last month at  1 3M  NYSE MMM  and  1 4M bpd  respectively  but cut its forecast for non OECD demand growth  For H1 2019  based on its outlook for non OPEC production and global demand  and assuming flat OPEC production  the IEA said the  implied stock build is  2M bpd  
Note  Both OPEC and Russia are under pressure to reduce current production levels  this decision could be taken at the next OPEC meeting on Dec  6  There are rumors that there is a proposal to cut oil output by up to  1 4M bpd for 2019 
Ahead of the U S open  gold prices are holding steady as the  big  dollar eases away from its 18 month high print earlier in the week  easing amid a jump in the EUR   1 1270  and the pound   1 2969  on a draft Brexit agreement  Spot gold is little changed at   1 202 08 per ounce  while U S gold futures are up  0 1  at   1 203 9 per ounce 

3  BTP yields rise as Italy sticks to deficit target
Italian government bond yields have backed up sharply this morning after Italy resent its 2019 budget to the E C with  unchanged growth and budget deficit assumptions  but falling debt targets  
Note  Italy s first draft budget for 2019 was rejected last month for breaking E U rules 
Italian BTP yields are  5 to  7 bps higher across the curve and the BTP Bund yield gap has widened to  311 bps from around  303 bps from late yesterday 
Elsewhere  the yield on the U S 10 year note has gained less than  1 bps to  3 14   In Germany  the 10 year note has fallen  2 bps to  0 39   the lowest in two weeks  while in the U K  the 10 year Gilt yield has eased  4 bps to  1 484  

4  U K cabinet meeting in focus for sterling
The focus for sterling this morning is the U K Cabinet meeting  09 00 am EDT   when PM May s Cabinet may approve the Brexit deal that reportedly has been reached between the U K and the E U this week 
Consensus expects the pound to find a  bid  if the Cabinet signs off on the deal  because this would open the possibility for the agreement to be considered at an extraordinary E U summit in late November  and for the U K  Parliament to vote on it before the Christmas recess 
However  if the Cabinet rejects the deal at today s meeting  this would likely send GBP   1 2916  spiraling aggressively lower  as it would not only mean prolonged uncertainty regarding the terms of the U K s exit from the E U  but also increase the probability of a new general election 
Elsewhere  EUR USD   1 2963  is slightly lower after Germany s Q3 GDP   0 2  vs   0 5   missed expectations and contracted for the first time in over four years  German officials reiterated that slowdown was  temporary and largely related to the emission situation in the auto sector  
SEK   10 2733   0 5   is softer after Sweden Oct CPI came in below expectations  Some of the weakness was due to reposition of bets for the first potential Riksbank hike being pushed back to the February time frame 

5  U K inflation holds steady as fuel costs are offset by food
Data this morning from the ONS showed that annual inflation in the U K held steady in October  as weak growth in prices for food and drink counterbalanced surging fuel costs 
Consumer prices rose  2 4  on year in October  matching the increase in September 
The figures would suggest that the Bank of England  BoE  remains on track to hike interest rates next year provided the U K s exit from the E U goes smoothly  A bitter  divorce  is expected to cause widespread economic disruption 
Note  Governor Carney signalled this month that they would need to nudge up interest rates two to three times in the next three years to bring inflation back to its  2  goal

194365,415881,MMM,Cabinet Not Unanimously Behind May While Brexiteers Are Discussing Whether To Try  ,opinion,"As expected  PM Theresa May got support for her Brexit deal from the Cabinet  Theresa May said it was a  collective  not a  unanimous  decision  suggesting that some ministers were against 
The withdrawal text has also been released  On financial services  the UK and the EU will recognise each other s financial regulations  so some sort of equivalence  which the EU cannot pull out of overnight  according to Bloomberg  Banks would still lose a financial passport to the EU s internal market for financial services 
As anticipated  there will be a review mechanism  which before 1 July 2020 needs to determine whether an agreement on a permanent deal can avoid activating the backstop  Otherwise  the options are to either 1  activate the UK wide backstop  the UK stays in the customs union including  level playing field  conditions and Northern Ireland obeying many single market rules  or 2  extend the transition period for an unspecified period of time 
The UK cannot decide this itself  both sides need to agree  Also  if the UK wants to leave the customs backstop  it needs to be a joint decision with the EU  Still  the Withdrawal Agreement says that the ambition is still to sort things out in a permanent deal and that the intention of the withdrawal deal is that is should  only apply temporarily  
The real test is still whether it can pass the UK House of Commons  A date is expected to be held in mid December  10 December has been reported   PM Theresa May needs support not only from the moderate Conservatives but also some Labour MPs 
Markets are still not getting overexcited just yet  One reason is that it seems like the hardliners in the Conservative Party may try to challenge Theresa May as party leader  Another reason why the GBP movement was limited was that the Cabinet support was expected and the real test is whether it can pass the House of Commons 
When we get more clarification in either direction  we expect to see bigger movements in GBP and until then GBP will stay volatile  We forecast 0 84 in 3M  NYSE MMM  assuming the deal passes

194366,415882,MMM,GBP Cheer Is Here   But Mind The Risk Of The Commons  ,opinion,"EUR NOK  Despite the collapse in global equities and oil in October  EUR NOK has been surprisingly stable  The cross has only moved from the low end to the high end of the range  which in our view supports the notion that the aggregate NOK position is fairly balanced and leaves potential when USD longs are covered in 2019  We still pencil in a range trading EUR NOK on this side of New Year as the reduced potential for a Norges Bank repricing  oil weakness and investor focus on year end seasonality limit the likelihood of a NOK move higher short term  For 2019  however  we still think there is an appealing case for a stronger NOK on monetary policy tightening and valuation  We raise our 1M forecast to 9 60  from 9 40  but leave the rest of the profile unchanged at 9 40 in 3M  NYSE MMM   9 20 in 6M and 9 10 in 12M 
EUR SEK  The coming months will be busy  with the first rate hike expected in seven years  the messy Swedish political situation  including the risk of a snap election  and global risk sentiment from  among other things  Italy  Brexit and the global business cycle  Our 1 3M forecasts reflect the tailwind for the krona from the predicted December rate hike and the intermediate headwinds stemming from political risks  PPM and seasonality  Since the 1M point is just one week before the RB decision  we lower our 1M target to 10 20  from 10 40   stressing that we still see a chance that EUR SEK will breach 10 40 in coming weeks  We lower our 3M  6M and 12M forecasts slightly to 10 10  from 10 20   10 00  from 10 10  and 10 00  10 10  noting that we have pencilled in a second  still not fully priced  Riksbank rate hike in July 2019 
EUR DKK  The DKK is relatively more exposed to an escalation of the global trade war as the Danish economy is small and open and has significant exposure to global shipping  Furthermore  Denmark has net exposure to the stock market due in particular to the Danish Life and Pension  L P  sector s large holdings of US and euro area stocks  In addition to the easier DKK liquidity situation and negative FX forwards  this helps explain the recent rise to the 7 4600 level  We expect the pair to trade around 7 4550 in 1M  7 4525 in 3M and 7 4550 in 6 12M 
EUR USD  The strong US economy should keep the Fed adamant about becoming  neutral  on rates during the course of 2019 and thus should continue to add to the cyclical and carry support to the USD  With the risk of Italy and Brexit setbacks  this should leave EUR USD at a range of around 1 13 on a 3M horizon with a good chance of a short lived dip towards 1 11  However  we still believe ECB 1normalisation and valuations are still set to support EUR USD over 6 12M  We have lowered our short term profile slightly and see EUR USD at 1 13 in 1M  1 13  from 1 15  in 3M  1 18  unchanged  in 6M  and 1 25  unchanged  in 12M 
EUR GBP  EUR GBP has dropped sharply since late October  driven by rising Brexit optimism  The lack of a sustained break lower in EUR GBP after it was announced that UK PM Theresa May got support for a Brexit deal from her Cabinet in our view reflects that uncertainty remains high and that high expectations were priced into GBP already  We still expect EUR GBP to break lower once a deal is finalised and have revised our 1M target lower to 0 84  previously 0 88   as our base case remains that the House of Commons will vote in favour of the deal  However  expect GBP to remain very volatile in the coming month  with risks skewed to the upside amid the risk of a turbulent period in UK politics

194368,415884,MMM,FX Strategy   Brexit Scenarios And Outcomes For EUR GBP ,opinion,"Near term  the political situation in the UK will be pivotal for the GBP  We expect EUR GBP to stabilise and fall back into in the 0 865 0 88 range if  as we expect  Theresa May survives a vote of confidence  However  EUR GBP is likely to remain volatile ahead of a Brexit vote in the House of Commons 
In our main scenario  where we expect a decent Brexit  we expect EUR GBP to break lower and settle around 0 83 in 3M  NYSE MMM  
However  the likelihood of our main scenario has declined substantially  while the probability of other scenarios  such as a no deal scenario  has increased

194373,415889,MMM,3M Stock  Another Elliott Wave Reason For Skepticism,opinion,"2018 has not been very kind to 3M  NYSE MMM  stock investors  The share price was hovering in the vicinity of  260 in January  Fast forward to October 26th   it was down to  181 98 for a 30  plunge in just ten months 
Now let s take a look at the 4 hour chart of 3M stock  which we shared with you on June 22nd  and see how the Elliott Wave Principle helped us stay ahead of recent developments  Five months ago  MMM was still holding above  195 a share  The decline from  260 looked like a five wave impulse  whose wave  5  was poised to make a new low and complete wave A I  A three wave correction in the other direction was then supposed to lift 3M stock to roughly  220 in wave B II  before the bears return in wave C III  The updated chart below shows how things went  As expected  3M stock made a new low at  190 57  then rose to  217 87 and plunged again to  181 98  In other words  the Wave principle managed to put us ahead of not one  not two  but three consecutive moves in MMM stock  Good 
3M Stock Demands a New Elliott Wave Count
However  it turns out that none of the three was labeled correctly  The drop to  190 57 was supposed to be wave  5   but only had three sub waves  The recovery to  217 87 was supposed to be wave B II  but was actually an ending diagonal  Which leads us to the conclusion that the selloff to  181 98 wasn t wave C III either 
The new labeling we d like to propose suggests the entire decline from  260 to  182 is a five wave impulse in wave A I  Waves  2  and  4  obey the guideline of alternation as wave  2  is a sharp rally  while wave  4  is an expanding flat correction  The five sub waves of  3  and  5  are clearly visible  as well 
This makes us think the current jump from  181 98 to  204 27 so far is the beginning of wave B II  The same logic applies here  A three wave rally to the resistance of wave  4  near  220 can be expected  followed by another selloff to  180 or lower 
In conclusion  an impulsive decline indicates 3M stock has entered a downtrend  Lower levels can be expected in the long term  The short term outlook should provide investors with another chance to evacuate near  220 a share

194374,415890,MMM,Danske Daily   Deadline For Italy To Revise Its Budget  ,opinion,"Market movers today 
Politics continue to be in the spotlight as Italy faces a deadline today for a revised budget to the EU Commission  There are no signs though that Italy will budge and change it and the way is thus paved for a collision with the EU  The Commission will most likely proceed by initiating an excessive deficit procedure against the country 
Brexit negotiations continue today and tomorrow  as tomorrow is the deadline if there is to be an agreement this month  We think it looks increasingly difficult  see our latest Brexit Monitor   12 November 2018  Supporting this view is a story from The Guardian claiming the UK Cabinet will not sign off a final deal at its meeting today

194375,415891,MMM,Brexit Monitor   The Real Test Is The Vote In The House Of Commons  ,opinion,"Key takeaways 
PM Theresa May and the EU have reached a  technical  agreement on the UK s withdrawal from the EU 
We still do not know the exact content of the deal but according to media reports the backstop will be UK wide although Northern Ireland has to stay aligned with most EU single market rules 
The UK Cabinet will meet today at 15 00 CET to discuss the draft text and whether they can support it or not  This is hard to say given the comments from key Cabinet members over the past couple of days weeks 
If both the UK Cabinet and the EU say yes to the deal  the EU will most likely call for an extraordinary Brexit summit later this month  25 November has been suggested 
We think the real test is whether it can pass the UK House of Commons  Leading Brexiteers and Theresa May s supporting party DUP have already said they will vote against the deal  Moderate Conservative and Labour MPs are key for PM Theresa May 
The date for the vote in the House of Commons is suggested to be 10 December assuming the Cabinet gives it the nod 
The fact that we do not know the responses from the UK Cabinet  EU leaders and not least whether a majority in the House of Commons can support the deal explains why the GBP strengthening was only to a limited extent  This also means that the renewed Brexit optimism may fade again in the very near term  sending EUR GBP higher  GBP is likely set to stay volatile 
When we get more clarification that there is support for the deal   and again  most importantly whether it has support in the House of Commons   the GBP should appreciate more  We forecast EUR GBP at 0 84 in 3M  NYSE MMM   For more see Corporate Hedger  Strong November could turn to cold December for GBP  13 November

194380,415896,MMM,Debt Ceiling In March Unlikely To Repeat 2017 US Treasury Cash Deluge  ,opinion,"Debt ceiling USD liquidity arithmetic 
On 1 March 2019  the current debt ceiling suspension is due to expire  As seen on previous occasions  most recently in 2017  this is likely to be followed by a period where the debt ceiling binds and the US Treasury has to rely on extraordinary measures to fund the government  This time around  extraordinary measures will probably last around five six months before a solution will need to be found  which is likely to be another suspension  The upcoming mid term elections should not be a decisive factor in this progress 
In 2017  the end of the debt ceiling suspension provided a boost to USD liquidity as the US Treasury had to draw down its cash balance close to zero and in turn  it became a market mover for the USD money market and among other things led to a tightening of the 3M  NYSE MMM  EURUSD OIS basis  We do not expect a similar development this time around  First  since the US Treasury will only have to draw its cash balance down to USD200bn  the level it was at when the debt ceiling was suspended and  coincidentally  the level it has normally been at on 1 March  Chart 2    Second  the boost to liquidity will be mitigated by the Fed s balance sheet reduction 
In comparison  USD liquidity rose more than USD60bn between the end of September 2016 and March 2017  An optimistic estimate would suggest that it could fall around USD70bn between end September and March next year  Chart 1   It could be higher  e g  if the debt ceiling increases the use of reverse repos again  Chart 3   The market is currently pricing in the 3M EURUSD OIS basis to return to the level from mid 2018 when the debt ceiling arrives next year  chart 4   With tighter USD liquidity  there is a risk that the market is pricing the basis too tight

194391,415907,MMM,Strategy   Sweden  Flat Money Market Curve 1Y 3Y Vs EUR  ,opinion,"Receive SEK FRASEP19 and pay FRASEP21 for steeper curve while doing the opposite in corresponding EURIBOR FRA contracts  flatter curve  in a box at  11 5bp  indicative   P L  25bp  0bp  
The SEK FRA contracts MAR  JUN and SEP19 are all cheap options if the next few Swedish inflation prints disappoint and or growth slows more abruptly  there is  by the way  a risk that Sweden s Q3 GDP q q will be negative   see Reading the Markets Sweden   5 October   In our view  the market is discounting Riksbank hikes too aggressively up to H2 19  The FRASEP19 contract prices 46bp of hikes  up to the October meeting in 2019   This is basically in line with the Riksbank s own rate path and we find it unlikely the central bank will lift the path near term  probably the opposite if anything  However  further out  in 2020 22  we argue that too little is priced when taking risks into account  In our view  such market pricing does not reflect  what we today think  is the most likely scenario for the next few years 
Our clear view is that Swedish inflation  also headline CPIF  will move towards the long term average  i e  1 5   in 2019  see chart overleaf   The reason is that we see little evidence that wage growth is picking up  However  the next wage round  in early 2020  could end up in a higher deal  At least  we would not rule it out on the back of signs of higher wages in Europe  Germany  and the low real wage growth recently  close to zero since 2017   Hence  unions could look for a better deal this time  If they are successful  it could potentially affect inflation in late 2020 to 2022  It remains to be seen whether it will be enough to push inflation persistently towards the 2  target but with higher wage growth the chance increases  In addition  if the Riksbank moves in late 2018 or 2019  as expected  it would be well ahead of the ECB  while hikes in 2020 and beyond would be conducted in tandem with the ECB  according to pricing   Deviations in policy rates could have less impact on SEK when both banks are tightening in contrast to the Riksbank alone tightening 
The FRA box SEP19 SEP21 trades close to the three year low  see chart below   We see this as a good opportunity to go against recent relative flattening  A further flattening seems to us unlikely  as it already trades close to flat  Admittedly  back in 2011 the box was trading negative   inverted   but 3M  NYSE MMM  STIBOR was 80 160bp above 3M EURIBOR at that time

194394,415910,MMM,FX Forecast Update   USD Strength Set To Remain Until Year End  ,opinion,"EUR NOK  EUR NOK has re settled in the lower end of the 9 40 9 60 range following a turbulent period where fading NOK headwinds were countered by a dovish Norges Bank and tumbling risk sentiment  Going forward  we still expect EUR NOK to move lower on valuation and that Norges Bank has indicated in its base case that it will out hike peers  In our view  market pricing of Norges Bank remains too soft but we are likely to have to wait for a significant repricing  With year end creating an asymmetric balance of risk to foreign developments  this creates a tougher environment for EUR NOK to break below the 9 40 threshold this side of the New Year  In light of December no longer being a live meeting for the next interest rate hike  we raise our 3M  NYSE MMM  forecast profile  We now forecast EUR NOK at 9 40 in 1M  unchanged   9 40 in 3M  9 30   9 20 in 6M  unchanged  and 9 10 in 12M  unchanged  
EUR SEK  We have a 3M bullish view on the SEK based on the Riksbank delivering its first hike in seven years  Our 3M EUR SEK target is 10 20  unchanged    Near term  we continue to see upside risks based on political events in Sweden and abroad  On the other hand  the Riksbank s October meeting could have the opposite effect  On balance  we merely roll the 1M forecast lower to 10 40  10 50   Taking into account the latest batch of higher than expected inflation numbers and how these feed into the inflation forecast  one could argue that pricing is somewhat too dovish   more so when it comes to pricing further out  Hence  we opt to lower our 6M and 12M forecasts to 10 10  10 20  and 10 10  10 30   respectively 
EUR DKK  DKK is relatively more exposed to an escalation of the global trade war  as the Danish economy is small and very open and has significant exposure to global shipping  Furthermore  Denmark has net exposure to the stock market  in particular due to the Danish Life and Pension  L P  sector s large holdings of US and euro area stocks  This  in addition to the easier DKK liquidity situation and negative FX forwards  could help to explain the recent rise in EUR DKK to the 7 4600 level  We expect the pair to trade around 7 4550 on 1M  7 4525 in 3M and 7 4550 on 6 12M horizons 
EUR USD   The strong US economy will keep the Fed in the hiking game for now and add to the carry support to USD   notwithstanding recent Trump calls for slowing the tightening pace  Coupled with the risk of setbacks on Italy and Brexit negotiations  this should leave EUR USD in a range around 1 15 on a 3M horizon  Medium term  the euro capital outflows of recent years will fade as the first ECB hike draws closer  Alongside valuation  this is set to support EUR USD in 6 12M  We have kept our forecast profile unchanged and see EUR USD at 1 15 in 1M  1 15 in 3M  1 18 in 6M  and 1 25 in 12M 
EUR GBP  Brexit optimism has improved since the Conservative Party Congress ended on 3 October  We are still sceptical that the EU and the UK will reach a deal at the EU Summit in October  which leaves EUR GBP risks tilted to the upside near term  We target 0 88 in 1M  Longer term  we still expect EUR GBP to trade lower eventually  driven by Brexit clarifications and fundamental valuations  We target EUR GBP at 0 84 in 3M and 0 83 in 6M and 12M

194395,415911,MMM,Brexit Monitor  Final Deal Unlikely Before December  ,opinion,"As expected  there was no withdrawal agreement at yesterday s Brexit working dinner  negotiations broke down on Sunday   The EU leaders also said that the possible extraordinary EU summit in November is cancelled due to the lack of progress but sources say that it might come back into play if negotiations progress over the coming weeks  The tone was positive though and it did not end like the Salzburg meeting 
At the moment  it seems likely we will have to wait for the EU summit in December before a deal can be signed  and we cannot rule out that we have to wait until January   We are simply too far away from Brexit day for the politicians to make the necessary compromises 
Our base case remains a  decent Brexit   75  probability   where the UK leaves the EU on orderly terms  The real test for PM Theresa May is still when the withdrawal deal is put forward for a vote in the House of Commons  as there are enough hardliners to vote it down  unless PM Theresa May persuades Labour MPs to vote in favour  We expect that to be the case 
We assign 15  probability of a  no deal Brexit    as PM Theresa May is still under pressure from Brexit hardliners and the supporting party from Northern Ireland  the DUP  The likelihood of a general election or a call for a second referendum before 29 March is low  A soft Brexit keeping the UK in the single market also seems unlikely 
Brexit remains the key driver for GBP and uncertainty related to the outcome is likely to keep the GBP volatile and undervalued in the coming months  We still expect EUR GBP to trade lower eventually  driven by Brexit clarifications and fundamental valuations  We target EUR GBP at 0 84 in 3M  NYSE MMM  and 0 83 in 6M and 12M   see FX Forecast Update   15 October

194404,415920,MMM,Political Risk Set To Dominate The Agenda  ,opinion,"Market movers today 
It is a relatively light day on the data front  Financial markets will focus on political events   such as the Brexit negotiations  where EU negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday flagged optimism about a deal in six to eight weeks  time  and the possible announcement by US President Trump of new tariffs on Chinese imports  
In the euro area   German ZEW Economic Sentiment data is due for September  Our main focus will be on economic expectations  which saw a rebound in July and it will be interesting to see whether this trend has continued  especially in light of the decreasing risk of a US EU trade war

The U S China trade spat has been in the headlines for months  with the U S slapping tariffs on China and the latter responding in kind  Will President Trump ratchet up the trade war between the world s two largest economies  Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese tariffs  and the time period for public consultations ended last week  which means that Trump is free to announce another round of tariffs at any time  Despite fears that the trade war could trigger a recession trade between the U S and China actually increased in August  The dollar has benefited from the global trade war  and further tariffs against China could boost the greenback against its major rivals  including the euro

194407,415923,MMM,FX Forecast Update   Northern Lights Are On  ,opinion,"EUR NOK  Norges Bank hiking rates is to us an important fundamental trigger for the next leg lower in the overvalued EUR NOK  We also think markets underestimate the Norges Bank hike outlook due to strong mainland growth  upside risks for the petroleum industries and a tight labour market amid a working Phillips curve  At the June meeting  Norges Bank sent an important signal to markets that a much stronger NOK is now justified  In other words  the currency has gone from being an argument against rate hikes to a situation where NOK weakness in itself is an argument for faster rate hikes  In addition  we think the four headwinds that have been the main culprits behind the NOK underperformance in recent months are about to stabilise or even become direct NOK tailwinds  We leave our forecast profile unchanged and target EUR NOK at 9 40 in 1M  9 20 in 3M  NYSE MMM   9 20 in 6M and 9 10 in 12M 
EUR SEK  We now expect a 25bp Riksbank hike in December  This would be the first hike in seven years   a landmark in itself   and is not fully priced in  As such  it should be SEK supportive  However  we expect it to be a  one and done   which leaves the repo rate at  0 25  for longer than the Riksbank plans  for most of 2019 at least  Consequently  earlier this month in Reading the Markets Sweden   6 September 2018 we revised our outlook for EUR SEK and thus see the cross at 10 20 in 3M  10 20 in 6M and 10 30 in 12M  Near term  we expect the difficult parliamentary situation to keep EUR SEK elevated and  therefore  we leave the 1M forecast at 10 50  We acknowledge the risk that Sweden is heading for an extra election and if this happens  our 3M target is probably too low 
EUR DKK  DKK is relatively more exposed to an escalation of the global trade war  as the Danish economy is small and very open and has significant exposure to global shipping  Furthermore  Denmark has net exposure to the stock market due to in particular the Danish Life and Pension  L P  sector s large holdings of US and euro area stocks  This  in addition to the easier DKK liquidity situation and negative FX forwards  can help explain the recent rise in EUR DKK above the 7 4500 level  We expect the pair to trade around 7 4550 on 1M  7 4525 in 3M and 7 4550 on 6 12M 
EUR USD   Downside risks from worries about Italian fiscal sustainability now seem much more limited near term but we still think the relative rate support for the USD versus the EUR together with the lingering trade war will be prone to deliver pockets of USD strength during the autumn  This should leave EUR USD in a range around 1 15 on a 3M horizon  Medium term  the euro capital outflows of recent years will fade as the first ECB hike draws closer  Alongside valuation  this is set to support EUR USD in 6 12M  We have upped our near term profile a little as we see less potential for Italy to weigh in H2 and now see EUR USD at 1 15 in 1M  1 15  previously 1 13  in 3M  1 18  unchanged  in 6M  and 1 25  unchanged  in 12M

EUR DKK has moved above the central rate of 7 46038 for the first time since early 2016  As we wrote in FX Edge   Good reasons for higher EUR DKK spot rate   in our view  the rise in EUR DKK this year is owing to weak returns on Danish investors  foreign assets this year  deteriorating terms of trade  e g  due to escalation of global trade war and higher negative carry on short EUR DKK positions due to easy DKK liquidity  Chart 1  
That said  sustained trading around the 7 4600 level is not fully justified by these factors in our view  Bond yields have stabilised and the US stock market has risen in recent months  Furthermore  EUR DKK FX forwards have stabilised  We therefore forecast EUR DKK to fall back to 7 4525 on 3M  In our view  we would have to see DKK negative flow from the corporate side to justify continued trading around current levels  On 6 12M we forecast EUR DKK at 7 4550 on the risk of easy DKK liquidity and FX forwards move lower   see DKK FX FI Strategy   The new Danish budget could be a big deal for DKK in 2019

194421,415937,MMM,Lululemon  Warning Signs And Stretched Valuation,opinion,"Few would argue with the returns that Lululemon Athletica Inc  NASDAQ LULU  has given shareholders this year  And  few would assert that their financial metrics are anything but excellent  Yet  with the stock hitting all time highs  it s worth asking whether the current stock price is justified  Given that the apparel industry is incredibly trendy  subject to boom and bust  Lululemon would only be able to defend its current stock price relative to its peers by maintaining both its margins and growth  However  there are a few warning signs the company may not perform well in the future  as well as is overvalued at current levels 
ProfitabilityOne of the potential problems facing Lululemon is the rise in its SG A costs  While gross margin continues to climb  the ratio of SG A to revenues has slowly climbed from a low of 28 2  in 2014 to 24 03   the highest of the decade  If you only looked at the margins  you would likely miss this piece as the increases in gross margin have outpaced the climb in SG A  which has also led to an increase in operating margin 

It s worth taking a moment to discuss the tax rate percentages  The company realized a one time expense of  59 3M  NYSE MMM  related to the reforms in the US tax code  However  executives still expect to have a 30  effective tax rate in 2018  which is a full percent higher than they originally forecasted  In part  this is why the net margin appears so poor for 2018 and TTM 
Lastly  two items  in particular  stand out that show the company may not be as effective as it once was  Both the ROIC ROE and ROA measurements sit at some of their worst levels in a decade  On top of that  in the last 5 years  revenues have grown  1 3B or 93   and the lease expense has increased by  84M or 100   When you consider this in tandem with the climbing SG A costs  it gives the impression that with the company focused on their ivviva business  they may be slipping on maintaining their efficiency 
EfficiencyThere isn t any denying that Lululemon has been growing at a marvelous pace and beating out many of their competitors  However  the growth of its underlying stores is being masked by the growth in the online sales  The below chart shows how the increase in same store sales excluding e commerce is a paltry 1  in 2017  In fact  outside of a decent year in 2016  the sales growth at the stores has been pretty abysmal 

Digging a bit deeper  this becomes more apparent in the average sales per store and square foot  Only when the e commerce business started really taking off and becoming a much larger portion of revenues did the sales per square foot and store begin to increase  Strip away the e commerce growth and the company isn t actually growing as well as it should be 
The inefficiency also has begun to appear in what was their solid inventory controls  Notably  the days of inventory has climbed each year  as inventory turnover has declined  These indications may not necessarily mean anything other than the company expanding the list with the economic conditions  However  in the context of what we ve discussed here  it should be taken as a concern 

Overextended ValuationBeyond the warning signs that exist for potential problems for Lululemon  the current valuation relative to its peers suggest the stock is way overvalued  While clothing and retail companies can often garner high P E ratios in the 20s or 30s  Lululemon is at 51 12x current earnings  and still 42x forecasted earnings  It s price to sales sits at 6 65x  which is over twice it s closest peer  With the exception of Under Armor  UAA   Lululemon s price to cash flow is over twice its peers 
What s more striking is the price relative to earnings growth  Even with the outstanding growth Lululemon is experiencing  they sit at 3 08x earnings growth compared to most peers who are between 2 2 5x  Given the possible trends that exist in the efficiency of how the company operates  investors aren t pricing in much in the way of risk 

Lack of Debt Isn t A Good ThingWhen investors look at Lululemon  they ll notice that their ROE and ROI are the same  Lululemon currently only has equity and no debt  Compared to their peers  it s a bit of an unusual step given the company s investment in its ivivva business as well as its general expansion  While this is obviously a deliberate choice of management  it comes at the expense of shareholder value 
Most of the peers in the fashion industry do utilize long term debt  and often offer shareholders a dividend  Lululemon has chosen not to  and as such  has a much higher cost of capital than its competitors  Given the company s need to fuel growth  management would be more efficient by taking advantage of the still low interest rates to balance their WACC and return more value to shareholders 
Stay Away and Keep a Wary EyeFirst  it s worth stating that the company currently is performing remarkably well and much better than many of its peers  Yet  there exists considerable evidence that management isn t maintaining control of their efficiencies and effectiveness they once had  and likely are becoming a bit too narrowly focused at the moment  The price for the stock has gotten way ahead of itself  and there exists some considerable risk in the prospects  especially in an industry like fashion  It s not worth buying the company at the current moment  Should the stretched valuation stay as it is and the concerning trends begin to take hold  the stock could set up for a shorting opportunity ",2018-08-27,Sayat Kartabayev,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lululemon-warning-signs--stretched-valuation-200340740,200340740
194422,415938,MMM,Close Bullish EUR USD Seagull  ,opinion,"We see EUR USD peaking near term and expect a new fall below 1 15 in H2 
We are still bullish on the cross for 2019 but need the Fed to be on hold and or for an ECB hike to be in sight 
We close our bullish EUR USD seagull  approximately 3M  NYSE MMM  left to maturity  with a 1 33  loss 
In FX Top Trades 2018   How to position for the year ahead  6 December 2017   we recommended positioning for upside in EUR USD over the course of 2018   with the ECB s move towards policy  normalisation  as a key argument  However  risks have shifted  see below  and we see EUR USD peaking near term 
What happened  At the start of 2018  Donald Trump s administration s  America first  rhetoric and a more or less explicitly stated preference for a weaker USD briefly lifted the pair above 1 25  However  then the US led trade war came along and while the ECB put an end date on QE  its forward guidance effectively put rate hike hopes on hold  which weighed on EUR USD ahead of the summer 
Where are we now  The FX market has recently started to question the Fed s determination to hike but we believe Jerome Powell and company remain on course for two more hikes in 2018  which would add to USD carry  Trade woes have also eased recently but we still deem it is too early to write this off as a source of USD support as we expect further escalation of the conflict  Further  we also expect Italian fiscal sustainability to weigh on the euro when the budget discussions start in late September

194423,415939,MMM,Toll Brothers  Strong Financials  Buybacks And Housing Jitters,opinion,"Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL  is more than halfway through reversing a surprising post earnings gap up a week and a half ago  The 13 8  post earnings gain surprised me because the message from TOL was little different than its messages in the past two earnings reports that have coincided with an extended sell off in the stock 

Toll Brothers  TOL  has cascaded downward ever since hitting a 14 1 2 year high in January  Before the August post earnings pop  TOL hit a 1 1 2 year low  The stock is now struggling to hold onto 50DMA support 
Post earnings trouble is nothing new for TOL  Ahead of its late 2017 run up TOL experienced two hiccups that looked troubling at the time  For its May  2017 report  TOL gapped higher and faded enough to end the day at a loss  the dreaded  gap and crap    In August  2017  TOL gapped down and closed lower after reporting earnings  In both cases  investors eventually firmed up their confidence and took TOL higher  December s poor post earnings response ended a relentless buying streak that was only once interrupted by the market s initial disapproval of the announced tax reform plan from President Trump s administration 
The post earnings positivity on August 21st was the first solidly positive response for TOL since February  2017  Yet  the TOL message and strong financial performance has been nearly consistent  TOL even initiated a dividend last year and has been spending a large amount of money buying up stock  The market s consistent skepticism suggests a sentiment anticipating peak performance and perhaps even an imminent downturn in housing  TOL s valuation is also at or near downturn levels with a 1 2 price book ratio  TOL s 9 1 trailing and 7 1 forward P Es and a 0 8 price sales ratio normally represent an absolute steal 
I highlight the near consistency in TOL s message and financial performance with choice selections from the last three earnings report 
December 5  2017  4Q 2017

 We completed FY 2017 with our highest annual contracts and revenues in over a decade We ended FY 2017 with a  5 billion backlog  up 27  in dollars and 25  in units from one year ago  This should result in strong revenue and earnings per share growth in FY 2018  

For the quarter  TOL repurchased approximately 5 2M shares at a  38 48 average price and spent about  200 2M  For the full year  TOL spent  290 9M buying back 7 7M shares at an average price of  37 81 share  TOL also instituted a dividend in fiscal year  FY  2017 
TOL s stock gapped down 9 6  in response to these earnings and ended the day with a 7 4  loss  In another month investors regained their confidence by closing the gap down  In another week  TOL peaked at a 14 1 2 year high and just short of its all time high 
February 27  2018  1Q 2018

 The Company reaffirms its previous guidance for full FY 2018 Adjusted Gross Margin of between 23 75  and 24 25   

For the quarter  TOL repurchased approximately 4 4M at a  47 43 average price spending about  210 0M  For the second quarter to date  TOL spent  65 3M  NYSE MMM  buying back 1 4M shares at an average price of  46 07 
TOL s stock initially gapped up for a 2 0  gain but quickly and sharply faded into a 5 1  loss  TOL managed to close marginally higher two weeks later  but it has not closed higher since 
May 22  2018  2Q 2018

 We had another solid spring selling season  The value of signed contracts  the highest quarter in our history  rose 18  in dollars on a 6  increase in units  On a same store basis  signed contracts of 9 04 per community were up 16  from last year and the highest for a second quarter since FY 2005  This was our eighth consecutive quarter of year over year same store contract growth 
With our  6 36 billion backlog  our highest second quarter backlog ever  we believe FY 2018 will be a year of significant revenue growth  

For the quarter  TOL repurchased approximately 1 8M shares at a  45 44 average price  spending about  81 5M  For the year to date  TOL spent  291 6M buying back 6 2M shares at an average price of  46 86  TOL also increased its dividend in April to  0 11 share from  0 08 share 
August 21  2018  3Q 2018

 Revenues of  1 91 billion were up 27   our highest third quarter ever We achieved 12  growth in the value of new contracts signed  which  at  2 03 billion  was the highest for any third quarter in our history  Record third quarter contracts and a third quarter end backlog  up 22  in dollars from one year ago  indicate revenue and earnings growth in FY 2019  On a per community  same store  basis  contracts of 8 1 were the highest for a third quarter in over a decade  and up 18  compared to FY 2017  

For the quarter  TOL repurchased approximately 3 7M shares at a  37 24 average price  spending about  136 0M  For the quarter to date  TOL spent  10 5M buying back 300K shares at an average price of  35 02  For the year to date  TOL spent  438 0M buying back 10 2M shares at an average price of  43 05 
Conclusion
With  728 9M spent buying back stock since fiscal year 2017  TOL must be quite surprised by this year s persistent price decline  The company s balance sheet remains strong  but its cash balance is now down to  522M  Its loans payable plus senior notes combine for a  3 6B liability  So it is clear that TOL will have to at least slow down its downward pursuit of its stock price  Given the market s pessimism  I am guessing investors will interpret such a slowdown in buybacks as another signal of trouble ahead 
I want to interpret the market s skepticism and pessimism as a golden value opportunity but staying on the sidelines has proven to be a good position  For a trade  TOL could be a buy here with a stop at a new 2018 low  I am waiting to see TOL bounce away from its 50 day moving average  DMA  as a potential sign that  this time  is actually different  Any time TOL finally makes a post earnings high after its first day of market response  I will assume the stock is indeed turning around 
In the meantime  I produce some key notes from the last earnings conference call per the earnings press release and transcript provided by the company  I am eager to compare these results and the market s response to November s earnings report given November is the start of the seasonally strong period for the stocks of home builders 
Guidance  emphasis mine 

  we project full FY 2018 deliveries of between 8 100 and 8 400 units with an average price between  835 000 and  860 000  This would result in revenues of between  6 76 billion and  7 22 billion  which would be the highest annual revenues in the history of the Company  Fourth quarter deliveries are expected to be between 2 550 and 2 850 units with an average price of between  840 000 and  870 000 
For the full FY 2018  we are projecting an Adjusted Gross Margin of approximately 24 0   which is consistent with the mid point of our previous guidance  and 24 8  for the fourth quarter  


 We expect to reach approximately 315 selling communities by fiscal year end 2018  which should give us a strong start to fiscal year  19  We expect interest in cost to sales to be 2 7  of revenues for the full year and 2 65  for the fourth quarter 
Fiscal year 2018 joint venture and other income guidance is approximately  145 million with approximately  55 million expected in the fourth quarter  We are also revising lower our full year effective tax rate from a midpoint of 24  to approximately 23   Our fourth quarter effective tax rate guidance is approximately 28 5  The full year share count is down 8 5  from last year s fiscal year end share count  

Regional Markets
California stuck out as a source of disappointing  relative  weakness  Yet  as the initial post earnings response demonstrated  the market was perfectly fine over looking the commentary on California  Otherwise  I am sure the California weakness would have generated loud headlines 

 The value of our contracts in the West  South and Mid Atlantic regions and in our City Living division were all up at least double digits while the North was essentially flat  In California  our contracts were down 1  in dollars and 4  in units  The comp the last year is unique and was frankly fairly extraordinary in that last summer we actually saw acceleration of sales over the spring  which is something that typically doesn t occur  And I think what has happened this year is we ve gone back to a normalized seasonality where the summer months are a little bit slower than the spring  


 While California is not as hot as it was a year ago  it is still one of our stronger markets  Charolette  sic   Raleigh  Dallas  Houston and Austin drove our positive results in the South   

Buyback TOL attempted to allay analyst concerns that the company is reaching the end of its buyback efforts 

 With respect to capital allocation  we ve obviously exceeded through 3 quarters the  400 million of guidance we gave  which was obviously very soft guidance as to how much stock we would buy back  And we will continue to be strategic in our buyback  So we have not exceeded some cap  And therefore  on the sidelines  we will continue to examine stock price  land opportunities  M A opportunities and any other use of our capital  And share buyback will continue to be a growing part of our capital allocation as we move forward  

Buyer and market behaviorAs I noted in an earlier post  Redfin  RDFN  caused market wide concern with warnings about recent weakness in the housing market  TOL is the first post RDFN earnings report from a major home builder  TOL firmly refuted RDFN s observations  I can only assume that the large post earnings surge in TOL s stock was part relief rally and part short covering by bears who assumed that RDFN s warning guaranteed another TOL post earnings sell off 

  our mortgage company  TBI Mortgage  has seen behavior that seems to run counter to those headlines  Our cash buyers have jumped to roughly 24  this year compared to our more typical level of 20   We have not seen an uptick in leverage rates and in fact  our buyers  loan to value ratio in Q3 dropped to 67  from a more typical level of 70   
 May over May and June over June were slightly down and July was up  There is no region or division I will point to that drove it  My best guess is my comment about interest rates  They re down  They stabilize right with the fear of rising and in fact came down 0 8 point over the last 3 months  

An analyst rightly pointed out that with the full quarter up 7   TOL must have experienced an extremely strong July  The looming question is whether this burst was an outlier or the sign of a refreshed and more confident housing market 
Then there is the constant hand wringing over the reduced federal benefits for buying a home  TOL is still not worried  note that the company led the negative commentary on tax reform last year and then reversed its tune in December  

  we ve not seen any impact from SALT in those high taxed states  And the mortgage interest deduction now at  750 000 cap  we only have 18  of our mortgages in excess of that  750 000  

Margins and costs Increasing costs have become a part of the negative narrative for builders  I posted earlier about the sharp DROP in lumber prices in recent months  Of course  bears can turn around and take the plunge as a sign of weakness in demand for the housing market  TOL was cautious to note that the drop in lumber has not compensated for the increase in other costs 

  over the next 3  6  9 months  we are encouraged by the drop in lumber pricing since it s a   obviously major component on the material side of the home  But remember that has been offset with some continued cost creep on the labor side and some continued cost creep with some other materials

Trade talks  tariffs threats  EM contagion fears and central bank decisions are dominating asset price moves this month 
Add geopolitical risks and U S impeachment possibilities  market volatility is expected to remain elevated for the foreseeable future

The  big  dollar has eased a tad ahead of U S jobs data  08 30 am EDT   while Treasuries are steady  EM equities snapped a week of declines while their currencies rallied 
There are no major economic calendar events scheduled for this weekend  On Sunday  there is the Swedish general election and the market will be interested in the growth of the right wing 
Note  The  hard  right party is expected to get around  20  of the vote  While that would make it one of the largest single parties  others are in coalitions and centre right and centre left expected to achieve  40  each

2  Oil steady as U S crude inventories fall  but trade tensions weigh  gold higher
Oil prices are little changed despite a fall in U S crude inventories to the lowest levels in three years  although Sino U S trade tensions and economic weakness from emerging markets remain a concern 
Brent crude futures are up  8c at   76 58 a barrel  while U S West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude is at   67 93 per barrel  up  16c from Thursday s close 
According to the EIA s report yesterday  U S commercial crude oil inventories fell by  4 3M  NYSE MMM  barrels to  401 49M barrels in the week to Aug  31  the lowest since February 2015 
Despite that  crude prices have been limited by a rise in refined product stocks and a relatively weak U S driving season  Also not helping is the ongoing EM weakness  Investors can expect potential new U S import tariffs on Chinese goods to continue to weigh on oil market sentiment 
Ahead of the U S open  gold has extended its gains overnight as the U S dollar fell against the yen on news that President Trump would next take up trade issues with Japan  while investors feared another round of Sino U S tariffs at any moment 
Spot gold is up  0 1  at   1 200 88  after printing a one week high Thursday at   1 206 98  U S gold futures have rallied  0 2  to   1 206 40 an ounce 

3  Italian yields fall
Italy s borrowing costs have fallen to a one month low this morning and the best week for prices in three months  thanks to easing concern over fiscal spending worries from the new anti establishment government 
Short dated Italian BTP yields have fallen more than  50 bps this week after reassuring comments from Rome that the sitting government would respect E U rules on fiscal discipline 
Note  Italy s 10 year BTP yield has fallen more than  7 bps to  2 83   its lowest in four weeks   it has fallen  40 bps this week 
Elsewhere  the yield on 10 year Treasuries has climbed  1 bps to  2 88   In Germany  the 10 year Bund yield has advanced  1 bps to  0 36   while in the U K  the 10 year Gilt yield has increased  1 bps to  1 416  

4  Dollar waits for NFP
Today s U S August jobs data is expected to show more job creations   191K   which could bode well for the U S dollar  especially against EM currencies and riskier developed market currencies like the AUD  a proxy for China  
Note  USD is a tad softer against G7 currency pairs ahead of NFP   trade could quickly move back to the front burner if the U S decides to implement the   200B in additional tariffs on China now that the public comment period related to the US proposed tariffs has expired overnight  
With a  no  sign of U S slowdown  will permit President Trump to proceed with his trade tactics  and keep the Fed on its steady rate hiking path 
EUR USD up  0 2  at  1 1644  but AUD USD is down  0 7  at A 0 7155  having dropped to a 20 month low at A 0 7137  The EUR has got a lift from lower Italian BTP yields  see above  

5  Eurozone economic growth falls further behind U S
Data this morning showed that the eurozone s economy slowed slightly in Q2  as imports jumped despite weak household spending 
The E U statistics agency said Q2 GDP was  0 4  larger than Q1  and  2 1  up on the same period a year earlier  That was the equivalent of an annualized rate of  1 5   just below the  1 6  rate of expansion recorded in Q1 
Note  The loss of momentum stands in contrast with the U S   4 2    where growth has surged in the same time period due to a package of tax cuts and government spending increases

194432,415948,MMM,3M Stock Set To Give Investors A Chance To Evacuate,opinion,"2018 is nothing like 2017 so far for 3M  NYSE MMM  stock investors  The share price reached an all time high of  259 77 on January 26th  but has been steadily declining in the past five months  losing over 26  at one point in May  If you have been following us for at least two years  you probably know we are long term bearish 3M stock  not because the company is inherently weak  but because the five wave impulse pattern  which has been in progress since the early 1970s  seems to be complete now  According to this article  published in January 2017  the recent weakness represents the beginning of a large bear market for MMM stock 
Investors  who are still on the long side must be looking for a way to contain the damage and evacuate at a better price  The chart below shows that they might get the chance to do so if they wait a while 
The 4 hour chart of 3M stock shows that even though the recent plunge cannot be seen as a complete five wave impulse yet  it is very likely to evolve into one soon  The bearish reversal will be confirmed the moment wave  5  breaches the bottom of wave  3   It is interesting to notice that wave A I has been developing between the parallel lines of a trend channel  while the five sub waves of wave  3  form a trend channel of their own 
If this count is correct  we are about to see a false bearish breakout soon  False  because according to the Elliott Wave Principle  every impulse is followed by a three wave correction in the opposite direction  This means that instead of joining the bears when wave  5  makes a new low  traders should be getting ready for a notable recovery in wave B II towards  220  In addition  the RSI indicator seems to be forming a bullish divergence already  thus supporting the short term positive outlook  In our opinion  investors should see the anticipated recovery as their last chance to get out before the bears return to drag 3M stock much lower in wave C III

194443,415959,MMM,CR Or MMM  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Diversified Operations stocks have likely encountered both Crane  CR  and 3M  MMM   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Crane and 3M are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold  respectively  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that CR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
CR currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 77  while MMM has a forward P E of 18 92  We also note that CR has a PEG ratio of 1 43  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  MMM currently has a PEG ratio of 1 86 
Another notable valuation metric for CR is its P B ratio of 3 42  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  MMM has a P B of 10 61

 NEW YORK  July 26  Reuters    The U S  dollar fell broadly
on Tuesday as U S  lawmakers remained deadlocked over raising
the nation s debt ceiling to avoid a devastating default  while
U S  and European shares also declined 
 Unless lawmakers reach a deal to raise the  14 3 trillion
ceiling by Aug  2  the United States faces a technical default
on some of its  9 6 trillion government bonds outstanding

 Weakness in stocks weighed on crude oil prices  while gold
hovered near a record high hit in the previous session as
investors looked to the precious metal for safety 
 The U S  currency hit a record low against the Swiss franc
of 0 7997  on trading platform EBS and fell to a
four month low near 77 883 yen   approaching a record
low of 76 25 set in March 
  The market is getting more nervous about the debt ceiling
issue   said You Na Park  currency strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt   If the market was really starting to price in the
possibility of a default  the dollar would be losing more than
what we saw this morning  
 Against a basket of currencies  the dollar  fell 0 5

 Investors so far appear to have done little to prepare for
a default or a cut in the U S  triple A credit rating 
 While they say lawmakers will eventually reach a deal  it
is nearly impossible to insure against what is considered a
low probability event  especially given the lack of
alternatives and the depth of the market 
 The cost of insuring the United States against default
stood around 57 basis points   nearly half the
March 2009 peak 
 The credit default swap curve is nearly flat with one year
CDS  at 57 7 bps  This in itself reflects
investor jitters  but it is not the kind of pricing normally
seen when investors expect an imminent default

spreading to other countries 
 In the commodities market  U S  crude  fell  1 20 to

the end of its second phase of bond buying  a program known as
quantitative easing  or QE2  it will hold on to its portfolio

   Stocks rise helped by strong Wall Street earnings
   Silver rebounds after sharp losses

 By Saikat Chatterjee	
 HONG KONG  April 27  Reuters    The U S  dollar plumbed a
near 3 year low against other major currencies on Wednesday
before a Federal Reserve decision where it is expected to
reinforce its ultra easy policy stance while stocks in Asia s
developed markets rose  tracking a strong close on Wall Street 	
 Market players added bearish dollar bets  especially against
the euro and the Swiss Franc on expectations the
Fed will cling to a near zero interest rate policy even as it
lets a  600 billion bond purchase program wind down in June 
 ID nN1941922 	
  Focus will be on the inaugural press conference and whether
Bernanke is shifting along the dove hawk scale   said Michael
Sneyd  analyst at Societe Generale   	
  Attention will also be on comments for how the Fed may
respond to U S  fiscal tightening  All in all  the meeting is
likely to give the green light for risk appetite and for dollar
bears to continue to be bearish  	
  The dollar index   which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies  hit the lowest since
August 2008 at 73 483  before cutting some losses in early Asian
trading 	
 Shares rose  taking a leaf from the robust gains posted by
U S  indices overnight  which was helped by better than expected
performances from Ford Motor Co   3M Co and United
Parcel Services Inc   	
 Japan s Nikkei was up more than a percent while
Australia s benchmark index rose after a five day
holiday weekend  MSCI s index of Asia Pacific shares outside
Japan hovered just below a three year peak hit
last week  	
 U S  Treasury yields edged up after recent drops with the
10 year yield just above a one month low of 3 32
percent before the Fed decision     	
 In commodity markets  spot silver paused
around the  46 per ounce level after falling by nearly 5 percent
overnight 	
 High volatility and the expiry of U S  silver options added
to the intensity of the decline of the precious metal which
nearly doubled in value between the January lows and Monday s
peak 	
 Despite the sharp pullback in silver which rippled over into
other commodities  U S  crude  held above the  124 per
barrel line  rising from recent lows  as Libya s civil war and
violence tinged unrest Syria and Yemen helped limit bearish
sentiment on a price slide  ID nLDE73P0O7   ID nLDE73P0KX

  Adds Fed official in para 11 
 By Lucia Mutikani
 WASHINGTON  Oct 22  Reuters    A bigger than expected rise
in U S  workers filing new claims for jobless aid last week
underscored how fragile the labor market remains even as a
measure of economic prospects hit a two year high last month 
 Initial claims for state jobless insurance increased 11 000
to 531 000 last week  the Labor Department said on Thursday 
after falling for two consecutive weeks  Financial markets had
expected new claims to be 515 000 
 Separately  the Conference Board said its index of leading
economic indicators rose 1 0 percent to 103 5  the highest
since October 2007  but optimism over the robust increase was
tempered by a report showing that home prices fell 0 3 percent
in August  For details see  ID nN22198158  
  The data confirm an overall picture of a gradual economic
improvement  but we are not seeing it in the commercial real
estate and jobs markets   said Larry Milstein  head of
government and agency trading at R W  Pressprich   Co in New
York 
 Investors on Wall Street brushed aside the mixed economic
data  focusing instead on solid quarterly earnings reports 
including from the world s largest hamburger chain  McDonald s
Corp   and diversified manufacturer 3M Co  
 The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average  ended up
131 95 points  or 1 33 percent at 10 081 31   N   U S 
government bond prices fell as the Treasury announced a record
 123 billion worth of note sales next week  US   
 While data and earnings reports from some companies
strongly indicate the economy started growing again in the
July September period after four quarters of decline 
persistently high unemployment has raised questions about the
recovery s durability 
 White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers told Reuters
in an interview on Wednesday the economy was set for a recovery
but cautioned that the pace of growth might be moderate and the
job market would not revive immediately   ID nN21508789 
 SIGNS OF HEALING
 Analysts reckon the Federal Reserve  which is holding U S 
overnight interest rates near zero  will want to see labor
markets beginning to heal before it withdraws its massive aid
to the economy 
 Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren said
on Thursday that the economy would grow reasonably in the
second half of this year but added that the Fed needed to see
more progress before taking some of its economic support away 
 ID nNWNA6250 
 Separately  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President
Charles Evans said the economy should grow about 3 0 percent
over the next 18 months  but cautioned that unemployment posed
a big challenge   ID nWEN5236 
 The U S  unemployment rate rose to a 26 year high of 9 8
percent in September and is seen rising above 10 percent 2010 
 Jobless claims last week were probably influenced by the
Oct  12 Columbus Day holiday  which could have resulted in some
laid off workers not filing their claims during that holiday
week  Analysts say weekly jobless claims have to fall to
400 000 for payrolls show growth 
 For a related graphic see 

 Still  the pace of job losses has moderated considerably
from early this year  The four week moving average for new
jobless claims fell by 750 to 532 250 last week  the lowest
level since mid January  the Labor Department said 
 It was the seventh straight week of decline in the
four week average  which is considered a better gauge of
underlying trends 
 Among other encouraging signs  the number of people
collecting long term unemployment benefits in the week ended
Oct  10 dropped to the lowest since March  This measure has
trended lower for five straight weeks 
 Analysts view this steady decline as a sign unemployment
might be close to peaking but it could also reflect the fact
that many jobless workers have exhausted their benefits 
 The number of people receiving government funded emergency
unemployment aid rose to 3 39 million in the week ended Oct  3
from 3 35 million previously  the department said 
  Even as we anticipate that the economy likely grew in the
third quarter  the excess slack in the system and employers 
hesitance to ramp up hiring appear likely to weigh on the labor
markets for some time   said Jim Baird  chief strategist at
Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo  Michigan 
 The insured unemployment rate  which measures the
percentage of the insured labor force that is jobless  edged
down to 4 5 percent in the week ended Oct  10 from 4 6 percent
the prior week  the department said 
 Another hopeful sign was provided by a Labor Department
report that showed the number of mass layoffs  defined as job
cuts involving at least 50 people from a single employer  fell
by 129 to 2 561 last month   ID nN22139084

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Earnings Growth Makes These 5 Stocks Must Buys

	Whether it is a fledgling or a renowned company  the highest priority among the top brass in any organization is to secure earnings growth on a year over year basis  This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings 

	This metric is also considered the most significant variable in influencing the share price  Better than expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price  However  in addition to actual earnings  expectations of earnings play a vital role in determining share price movement 

Earnings Estimates Determine Share Prices

	We have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline  This happens because of the missing or beating of estimates 

	Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm 

	Investors  thus  should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Hence  it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates 

The Winning Strategy

	In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions  we added the following parameters 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2   Only Zacks   Buys  and  Strong Buys  are allowed  With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there  this is a great way to start things off   You can see   

5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry   Stocks that possess strong EPS growth history  

  Change EPS F 0  F  1  greater than or equal to 5   Companies that witnessed year over year earnings growth rate of 5  or more in the last reported fiscal  

  Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero   Stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks  

  Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero   Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week  

  Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero   Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks  

	The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7 881 stocks to only five  Here are the stocks 

SYNNEX Corporation   NYSE       is a business process services company  The company provides a range of distribution  logistics and integration services for the technology industry along with outsourced services focused on customer engagement strategy  SYNNEX has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The company s estimated growth rate for this year is 14 3   higher than the  industry s expected gain of 12 6

 LONDON  July 23  Reuters    Britain s top share index rose for a ninth

the U S   with miners and banks enjoying an afternoon rally after falls the

 The FTSE 100 index rose 66 07 points  or 1 5 percent  to 4 559 80  the
highest closing level since early January  making its longest winning run since
late 2003 
 The index touched a high of 4 566 77 earlier in the session  and has added
more than 11 percent in the past nine sessions 
 Investors cheered reassuring quarterly results  including from 3M Co and
U S  home sales and jobs data 
   The FTSE s gains are  down to not only momentum from U S  stocks  but all
the economic data out today has been bullish  positive for stocks  ever since
retail sales in the UK came out better than expected earlier this morning   said
Angus Campbell  head of sales at Capital Spreads 
  Also in the U S  jobless numbers     continuing claims have fallen   
that s a major figure  It seems that those unemployment figures are really a
very very important focal point for the market at the moment   he said 
 U S  government data showed claims for jobless benefits rose last week 
roughly in line with expectations  while continuing claims for the previous week
edged lower

HSBC  Standard Chartered  Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group up
3 2 5 3 percent 
 Water utilities were the greatest drag on the blue chips  under pressure
after regulator OFWAT ordered a 4 percent cut to household water bills over the
next five years  and said it would allow companies to make a return on their
capital at the low end of expectations 
 Pennon Group  Severn Trent and United Utilities fell between 3 4 and 7 3

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK  July 23  Reuters    The dollar and euro rallied
against the yen on Thursday as upbeat U S  corporate results
and housing data fueled optimism about the economy and dented
safe haven demand for the Japanese currency 
 A rally in U S  stocks further stoked investors  appetite
for risk  The Dow industrials rose above 9 000 points soon
after the start of trading for the first time since January 
boosted by strong quarterly results from 3M Co and others 
  For today  the mood is absolutely cheery   said Dan Cook 
a senior market analyst at IG Markets in Chicago   The story
has been yen weakness across the board as traders and investors
have been cheered by some pretty positive news  
 U S  existing home sales notched their third monthly rise
in June and prices hit their highest level since October 
fueling hopes that the housing sector is finally on the mend
and will help propel a broader economic recovery 
 The data suggests  that the ailing housing sector is
beginning to stabilize  That would be a necessary component for
a more meaningful U S  recovery   said Joe Manimbo  a currency
trader at Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington 
  The data that we saw today  coupled with some of earnings
reports are increasing the momentum that we re likely to see a
recovery this year   he added 
 In afternoon trading in New York  the euro rose to a
three week high at 135 61 yen  according to Reuters data  It
last traded at 135 34  up 1 8 percent 
 The euro climbed to a high of  1 4291  the strongest level
since early June  before paring gains to trade at  1 4206 
little changed on the day 
 The dollar gained 1 8 percent to 95 25 yen after hitting
95 29 yen  the highest in more than two weeks 
  All in all  the data will further encourage the positive
risk appetite tone   said Alan Ruskin  chief international
strategist at RBS Global Banking and Markets in Greenwich 
Connecticut 
  That equities finally look to be making headway into a new
price zone will further stir the risk positive trade  
 Comments from the Bank of Canada that the country s
recession is ending this quarter also helped risk sentiment 
 The BoC comments propelled the Canadian dollar to its
highest since June 3 against the U S  dollar  which last traded
down 1 2 percent at C 1 0866

 NEW YORK  June 18  Reuters    U S  stocks rose on Thursday 
buoyed by economic data pointing to stabilization in the job
market and improving regional business conditions in the
Mid Atlantic area 
 Government data showed that though initial claims for
jobless benefits were higher than expected  continued claims
posted their first drop since January  to 6 69 million from a
revised 6 84 million the previous week  and marked the largest
one week drop in that series since November 2001

much better than economists  expectations and the survey s May
reading 
  We re still in this healing process and this is one of the
better indications that manufacturing may be getting better  
said Kurt Brunner  portfolio manager at Swarthmore Group in

what people had anticipated

 NEW YORK  June 19  Reuters    U S  stocks rose on Friday
as Microsoft lifted technology shares following positive
comments from Goldman Sachs  and bets on a recovering global
economy eased investors  recent concerns 
 Microsoft jumped 2 8 percent to  24 15 after Goldman Sachs
added shares of the world s largest software company to its
Americas  conviction buy  list and said new products  combined
with an increase in information technology spending  should
underpin growth 
  It is a big move for a big company like Microsoft 
 which  can pull both software and hardware   said Janna
Sampson  co chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments
LLC in Lisle  Illinois 
  I think the Goldman Sachs report is buoying the sector
across the board  
 Microsoft was a top gainer in both the Dow industrials and
the Nasdaq  The S P information technology sector rose 1 3
percent 
 On the macro front  the International Monetary Fund
underscored the sense of improving economic fundamentals after
a top officer said the IMF may lift its 2010 growth forecast
for the world economy amid signs the decline in global output
was moderating 
 Shares in the consumer discretionary  industrial and

 With the market in the midst of a three month rally

3M Company  NYSE MMM   made a bottom with the market in January 2016  From there it rose with the market for 3 months and leveled out  The consolidation lasted 2 and a half months until another short drive higher to a top in July just over 182 It held in a tight range for another 2 months under that top acting as resistance  Then in October it dropped back  eventually retracing 38 2  of the full move higher 
Since then the stock has made 2 strong legs higher and finds itself entering the New Year consolidating under 180  A third leg would look for a move to about 190  But that would also be a new all time high and add a long term target to 240 
All of the SMA s are sloping higher now and the RSI is in the bullish range with the MACD flat but positive  There is resistance at 180 and 182 25 and then no price history to stop it  There is support lower 177 50 and 174 followed by 170 50 and 163 60  Short interest is low at 1 5   The company is expected to report earnings next January 24th 
Options expiring this week show a slight bias to the upside with at the money  ATM  straddles looking for a about a  2 50 move this week  January monthly options also show an upward bias in open interest with ATM straddles suggest the stock will be confined to about a  5 range each side of the current price  The January 27th Expiry options  the first covering the earnings report  show small open interest but an expected  7 30 move in the price

194731,416247,MMM,What s In The Cards For 3M Company  MMM  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Industrial goods manufacturer 3M Company   NYSE MMM   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Jul 26  In the last reported quarter  3M s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents  In the trailing four quarters  the company has beaten earnings estimates all four times with an average positive earnings surprise of 5 35  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Key Factors in the Second Quarter3M remains focused on portfolio management  investment in innovation and business transformation to gain a competitive advantage in the industry  3M also intends to continue investing in research and development  R D  to support organic growth  The company s global footprint  diversified product portfolio and ability to penetrate into different markets should boost its financials During the quarter  the company launched its 3M ScaleGard Blend Series of Products  These state of the art products enable flawless operation of expensive equipment by intelligently calculating water filter usage to provide Recipe Quality Water  With such smart and innovative products  3M strives to make its customers  lives easier  The company also recently launched its SGLP CL Series of Reverse Osmosis Systems which is used in combi ovens and boilerless steamers  This system reduces harsh minerals that can build up in steam equipment  while minimizing maintenance and replacement costs  and saving customers an estimated  300 per year on an average The company also announced that its StrongArm Technologies ErgoSkeleton personal performance equipment is available for purchase through its distribution channel across the U S  By joining forces with leading safety protection provider StrongArm Technologies  3M is well positioned to bolster its portfolio in the industrial ergonomic safety equipment industry  New product launches and strategic tie ups will likely boost the company s top line going forward 3M has initiated some prudent steps to strengthen and focus on its core portfolio of businesses  Since 2012  the company has pruned its businesses from 40 to 26  thereby improving customer relevance  productivity and speed through a leaner operating structure  At the same time  3M has maintained a steady investment in R D to develop innovative products  The company expects to invest  1 8 billion in R D in 2016 for higher organic growth and complement it through strategic acquisitions  It believes that these efforts will result in significant annual operational savings and reduction in working capital However  the U K  serves as one of the largest markets for 3M outside the U S  with 2 600 employees across 20 locations including 9 manufacturing sites  In 2015  the company recorded 20 5  or  6 228 million from Europe  the Middle East   Africa  a significant amount of which was generated in the U K  The products that are manufactured in the country includes coated abrasives  personal safety equipment  adhesive tapes  industrial microbiology products  drug delivery systems  high performance coatings and imaging systems  With a prominent exposure and presence in the U K   the company remains vulnerable to risks related to Brexit Given its international presence  adverse foreign currency translations are likely to affect the company s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause instability in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions  These undermine its long term growth potential to some extent 3M CO Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that 3M is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key components  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is at  0 48  Zacks Rank  3M s Zacks Rank  3 when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction uncertain We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or  5

194749,416265,MMM,You ve Got To Short This Stock,opinion,"3M Company  NYSE MMM  collapsed on Thursday  dropping to  180 14  1 28   0 71    This follows Wednesday s all time  While most investors marvel at the stock s move and want to buy  it is probably one of the biggest shorts or sells out there  There are so many negative indicators on all time frames that I get excited when I look at it 
Four Factors
There are 4 key factors on the charts that give confirmation to this theory  all of which indicate that a drop of 25  is in the cards  Let s review them so you can make an informed decision on this trade 
1  There was a bull flag on the daily chart going into Wednesday  This normally signals significant further upside  The stock surged early Wednesday  then gave up 100  of the move to close flat  Technical traders understand this signals a failed breakout  Failed breakouts usually result in a significant sell signal  Coming off all time highs  this could mean a multi year high and 20  correction in the next six months 

2  The weekly chart has a 3 bar surge  which usually signals a pull back is on the horizon  However  a weekly three bar surge  coming at all time highs  can mean a multi year high pivot is in place 

3  3M s monthly chart has seven green candles higher  This means that for seven months  the stock traded up  For hardcore investors  this is significant as it shows a 95  chance of a drop in the stock when matched with all the other signals discussed

The MACD is starting to level after a reset lower  There is resistance above at 170 and then free air  but a target on a measured move to 173 and eventually 205  Support lower comes at 166 and 163 followed by 160  Short interest is low at 1 0   and the company is expected to report earnings next July 21st 
The options chains show large put open interest at 150 and 152 5 this week and then 162 5 to 167 5  The call side is much smaller  May monthly options show the biggest open interest at the 175 strike on the call side  with smaller amounts at 170 and also 165 on the put side  July options are spread from 130 to 170 on the put side and tighter from 145 175 on the call side  The October options  the first beyond earnings  show open interest spiked at 175 on the call side and lower at 150 and 115 on the put side 

Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 170 with a stop at 165 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 170 with a June 24 Expiry 167 5 160 Put spread and selling a October 180 Call  Zero cost for the collar 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the May 165 170 bullish Risk Reversal for 40 cents 
Trade Idea 4  May July 170 Call Calendar   2 50  and sell the July 160 Puts for 45 cents 
 1 is a straight stock buy and  2 adds a collar for protection from 167 5 to 160 over the next 6 weeks while allowing for upside to 180   3 is a short term leveraged bet to the upside   4 looks for the move higher to happen after next week 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday  which heading into next week sees equities continuing to look better to the downside short term after a week lower  but with a glimpse of promise from the Friday action

194760,416276,MMM,3M Company  Another Stock In Danger ,opinion,"Similar to many other stocks  3M Company  NYSE MMM  s shares took a major hit during the 2007 2009 market crash 
The stock lost nearly 60  of its value  falling from as high as 97 00 in October 2007 to as low as 40 87 in March 2009  And  just as many other stocks  3M has been in a strong uptrend ever since 
Just several days ago prices reached a new all time high by climbing above 171 dollars a share  That is a massive 130 dollar rally in just 7 years  so you might think sky is the limit and now is the time to invest in 3M 
Our advice is to think twice 
The  is a technical market forecasting method  famous for its ability to help traders and investors predict reversals  Its main postulate says that trends move in repetitive patterns  called waves 
There are two types of waves    and corrective  Impulses consist of five sub waves and move in the direction of the larger trend  Once the fifth wave of an impulse is over  a correction in the opposite direction occurs 
Keep that in mind and take a look at the weekly chart of 3M Company stock  shown above 
That is right  The entire advance since March 2009 looks like a textbook five wave impulse  developing between the parallel lines of a trend channel  Wave  5  has already exceeded the top of wave  3   which could be seen as a reason for optimism by many 
However  according to the Wave principle  we should prepare for the corresponding three wave retracement  In addition  the relative strength index is showing the typical bearish divergence between waves  3  and  5   which further supports the negative outlook 
So  if this is the correct count  buying 3M shares could be worst possible decision  because the stock appears to be in reversal territory 
No trend lasts forever  The bears seem eager to take over ",2016-05-16,EWM Interactive,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/3m-company,-another-stock-in-danger-200130066",200130066
194767,416283,MMM,The Uptrend Is Still Intact,opinion,"Market bulls finally have something to talk about 
Last week  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index both posted their first positive weeks of the year 
Of course  the benchmarks have a long way to go before the optimists can truly jump for joy   both indices are down about 7  in 2016 
And what about the third major index  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  
Today  we re going to take a closer look at this critical index for technical traders  as well as two key levels to follow as we head into February 
Inside the Lines
Technical analysis is all about spotting support and resistance and then trading the trend  One of the easiest ways to identify these levels is to draw trend lines 
As I talked about last week   in one of three directions  up  down  or sideways  Support and resistance trend the same way   and you can sight these levels by drawing them on a chart 
The DJIA marked its 52 week high on May 20  2015  Since then  the average has made lower highs as it moves forward 

As you can see  the line indicates clearly defined resistance in a distinct downtrend pattern  The price hasn t been able to penetrate this line to the upside for the last six months 
However  if we zoom out a few years  we can see a clear support line from the lows in February 2014  August 2015  and the recent low in January 2016 

This tells us that the DJIA s long term uptrend is still intact  which is very good news for the bulls 
Fibonacci at Work
Since marking its 52 week high  the Dow has fallen 12   This places the index in what traders call correction territory   a decline of 10  from a previous high 
The index has been in this bearish zone for the last two weeks  and until last week  it struggled to regain momentum 
But strong earnings reports from constituents 3M Company  N MMM  and McDonald s Corporation  N MCD   as well as the prospect of a bottom in oil  have provided the Dow Jones with a hefty boost to the upside 
Let s take a closer look at the price action  On Wednesday  the index closed above a key technical level for bulls 

A  is depicted above  plotted between the intraday high on May 20  2015 and the intraday  flash crash  low on August 24  2015 
Using a recent high and low point  Fibonacci retracements provide traders with several lines of potential support and resistance 
As you can see  in addition to a solid bounce off the two year trend line  the index also found support at the 23 6  line 
This line represented crucial support in the bullish October rally off the September  biotech crash  lows  The DJIA shot up 10  from this level to its November peak 
Basically  if the Dow Jones can hold these levels  we could be looking at a major rally as technical traders rush in

194768,416284,MMM,Will 3M  MMM  Beat Q1 Earnings on Healthy Organic Growth  ,opinion,"Industrial goods manufacturer 3M Company   NYSE MMM   is scheduled to report first quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Apr 26  In the last reported quarter  3M s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18 cents  In the trailing four quarters  the company has beat earnings estimates thrice with an average positive earnings surprise of 2 74  
 Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Key Factors in the First Quarter
3M remains focused on portfolio management  investment in innovation and business transformation to gain a competitive advantage in the industry  3M also intends to continue investing in research and development  R D  to support organic growth  which will support its cost structure and increase capital deployment  The company s global footprint  diversified product portfolio and ability to penetrate into different markets should boost its financials 
During the quarter  the company augmented its scientific capabilities by unveiling a new state of the art research and development laboratory at its headquarters in St  Paul  MN  The company invested about  150 million in the 47 000 square foot facility to enhance its technological prowess and potential for future innovation 3M has undertaken some prudent steps to strengthen and focus on its core businesses portfolio  Since 2012  the company has pruned its businesses from 40 to 26  thereby improving customer relevance  productivity and speed through a leaner operating structure  At the same time  3M continues to invest steadily in R D  In 2016  the company expects to invest  1 8 billion in R D to boost organic growth as well as complement it through strategic acquisitions 
During the first quarter  3M collaborated with TTS Tooltechnic Systems AG   Co  KG to provide customers with an all inclusive surface preparation and finishing system  The new system will cater to the worldwide automotive collision repair industry s requirements for surface preparation and finished products  Per the deal  3M will become the sole supplier of this new system  The deal should give the company an edge over its competitors and thus  help in expanding its foothold worldwide  This in turn would bolster the company s earnings and revenues 
Also  3M completed the divestiture of the Pressurized Polyurethane Foam Adhesives assets to Innovative Chemical Products Group  ICP Group   a leading specialty chemical company engaged in the formulation  manufacturing  and marketing of coatings and adhesives 
This divestiture would enable 3M to focus on its core business  which includes adhesives  tapes and sealants  The company remains actively focused on seeking opportunities to optimize its portfolio by selectively divesting its businesses and gradually shifting focus to high growth markets 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model conclusively shows that 3M is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it boasts the key components  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  This is perfectly the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is currently at  2 08   This represents a likely earnings beat Zacks Rank  3M s Zacks Rank  2 when combined with a positive ESP makes us confident of a positive earnings surprise  Conversely  the Sell rated stocks   4 and  5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Currently  the stock is trading at  168 7  We expect the release to lead to stock movement 
Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter First Bancorp   NYSE FBP   has an Earnings ESP of  12 50  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is expected to report first quarter results on Apr 25 
Crane Co    NYSE CR   has an Earnings ESP of  1 16  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is expected to report first quarter results on Apr 25 
Canadian National Railway Co    NYSE CNI   has an Earnings ESP of  1 47  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company is expected to report first quarter results on Apr 25

 With regard to the outlook  excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike  producer prices are expected to decline at a reduced pace for the time being  reflecting movements in international commodity prices  and the year on year rate of increase in consumer prices is likely to be about 0 percent for the time being  due to the effects of the decline in energy prices  Financial conditions are accommodative  The monetary base has increased significantly as asset purchases by the Bank of Japan have progressed  and the year on year rate of growth has been at around 35 percent

The currency rose 12 45pm EUR Minimum Bid Rate 0 05  versus 0 05  expected 

 At today s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0 05   0 30  and  0 20  respectively  

1 30pm CAD Manufacturing Sales  1 7  versus 0 2  expected  The currency fell  1 30pm EUR ECB Press Conference  ECB President Draghi said that 

 As regards non standard monetary policy measures  on 9 March we started purchasing euro denominated public sector securities as part of our expanded asset purchase programme  which also comprises purchases of asset backed securities and covered bonds  Purchases are intended to run until the end of September 2016 and  in any case  until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below  but close to  2  over the medium term  When carrying out its assessment  the Governing Council will follow its monetary policy strategy and concentrate on trends in inflation  looking through unexpected outcomes in measured inflation in either direction if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium term outlook for price stability

 This widespread easing  coupled with the positive implications of lower energy prices for world growth  leads us to the conclusion that the global economy will pick up through the year  Increased economic divergence is prompting divergent monetary policies as well  and is delivering more exchange rate volatility and  on net  more strength in the U S  dollar  Turning to Canada  as we stated in the January MPR  although lower oil prices would have both upside and downside effects on Canada  the net impact would be negative  The negative effects would be immediate and seemed quite certain  whereas the positive effects would be more gradual and less certain  

The currency fell 3 00pm CAD BOC Rate Statement noted that 

 As the economy reaches and remains at full capacity around the end of 2016  both total and core inflation are projected to be close to 2 per cent on a sustained basis  Risks to the outlook for inflation are now roughly balanced and risks to financial stability appear to be evolving as expected  The Bank judges that the current degree of monetary policy stimulus remains appropriate and therefore is maintaining the target for the overnight rate at 3 4 per cent

 Outside of the energy sector  other areas of the economy appear to be doing well  In particular  the segments of non energy exports that we have been expecting to lead the recovery have been doing so  and we expect this trend to be buttressed by stronger U S  growth and the lower Canadian dollar  

The currency fell 11 30pm NZD Business NZ Manufacturing Index 54 5 versus 56 1 expected  The currency rose  Thursday April 16th 12 30am USD FOMC Member Lacker said that 

 Rising inequality is not the only clue that we are not adequately preparing the next generation of workers  Nationwide  about 20 percent of high school students fail to graduate within four years  and there are significant disparities in graduation rates between white students and black or Hispanic students and between students from high income and low income families  In some large urban school districts  as many as 40 percent of students do not graduate in four years

 The situation in Greece is the one that at the moment is the most worrying for the global economy  and the discussions about Greece have pervaded every meeting  The mood is notably more gloomy than at the last international gathering  And it s clear now to me that a misstep or a miscalculation on either side could easily return European economies to the kind of perilous situation we saw three to four years ago  The crunch appears now to be coming in May  and it would be a mistake to think that the UK would be immune to a return to this instability in European financial systems and the European economy  And of course it would be therefore the very worst moment for there to be any confusion about the direction of British economic policy or for a change of direction from the plan that we have pursued

 The Federal Open Market Committee has laid down two criteria to be met before we begin to raise interest rates  They are further progress in labor markets and reasonable confidence that inflation will rise to the longer run target of 2 percent  The FOMC has also emphasized that the decision will be data dependent  I consider this an essential discipline around our decision making on this matter  To me  data dependency means there is no preconceived plan  Data dependency means the decision will be based on the best evidence we have of the reality and trajectory of the economy  

The currency fell 8 00pm USD FOMC Member Fischer said that

194834,416350,MMM,The Downside To Dow 20 0000,opinion,"With the Dow Jones hitting 17 000 being pretty likely in the not too distant future  from there  it s only another 18  or so until the Dow hits 20 000  which is pretty incredible  These numbers seemed so unrealistic just a few years ago but now  it s not too farfetched  The most amazing thing to me is that stocks still haven t experienced a material price correction since the financial crisis 
Stocks aren t necessarily stretched in terms of valuation  especially with corporate earnings outlooks holding up for this year and going into 2015  What is stretched is investor determination with a market at its high 
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  is a great company and a worthy long term investment  see  Three Blue Chips Set to Drive Higher    but it s tough to buy stocks at all time record highs  In Johnson   Johnson s case  the position s up almost 20 points since the beginning of February  and this is on top of a previous 20 point gain in 2013 
One of these days  stocks are going to get walloped  But there s got to be some sort of catalyst for it to happen 
The Federal Reserve can be a catalyst if it decides to suddenly change its outlook for interest rate certainty  The catalyst could also be a geopolitical event or something that comes out of nowhere  like a big derivatives trade gone bad 
In any event  there will have to be a shock that is perceived to have a lasting effect on capital markets 
In the lull between earnings seasons  which we re currently experiencing  stocks reaccelerated on the back of very modest economic news and that in itself is telling about investor sentiment 
This is a market that can keep going higher based on monetary policy certainty  hope for a modest acceleration in economic growth and corporate earnings  and the wish of institutional investors to keep buying 
But this doesn t mean that investment risk for stocks has disappeared  it s quite the contrary 
3M Company  NYSE MMM  and Johnson   Johnson are a lot riskier now than they were 20 points ago  While their stories haven t changed  like so many other existing winners  it s a crapshoot as to whether these are worthy buys currently  given their recent capital appreciation 
I think it s reasonable to expect that the Federal Reserve is very close to changing its policy on interest rates or  at the very least  the language it uses to keep the markets happy 
The central bank is extremely aware that capital markets and stocks  in particular  require handholding regarding even an inkling of change in monetary policy 
New policy will have an effect on investor sentiment  however  I think markets are strong enough and willing to accept that extreme  crisis driven monetary policy can t last much longer  and this is beyond the tapering of quantitative easing 
Despite a difficult start to the year  stocks reaccelerated on a relatively quiet and benign landscape in global capital markets  This is what s required for further capital gains 
But when stocks go up  so does investment risk  In this market  I d only buy value  quality  and income  In the absence of these attributes  I d sit on new cash

194847,416363,MMM,Two Steps To A Solid And Profitable Portfolio,opinion,"When it comes specifically to dealing with stocks  creating a portfolio does not need to be complicated 
Depending on your goals  any equity market portfolio is well served by a handful of anchor positions  These are stocks representing underlying businesses with long track records of wealth creation  Preferably  they pay dividends  and those dividends can be reinvested into new shares if the income is not required 
All stocks are volatile and inherently risky securities  The Procter   Gamble Company  PG  had an earnings miss in 2000 and took six full years to recover  
While buying and selling stocks are business decisions  the stock market is an emotionally driven secondary market of corporate ownership  Within it  however  investment risk can be managed through diversification and the quality of the underlying businesses themselves 
Choosing five core anchor positions is a good way to start  I m a huge believer in dividend income  and if that income isn t required  dividend reinvestment compounds your returns and is a solid path to genuine wealth creation from the equity market 
The following are five examples of stocks that may be considered as core positions 
1  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   With more than 50 years of consecutive dividend increases  Johnson   Johnson is a dividend paying blue chip with three main business lines  including consumer products  pharmaceuticals  and medical devices  The company typically announces a quarterly dividend increase in the second quarter of the year 
2  Colgate Palmolive Company  CL   A well known producer of toothpaste  soap  deodorant  and dog food  Colgate Palmolive is a consistent grower of diluted earnings per share and dividends  and a consumer products favorite 
4  3M Company  MMM   A top conglomerate in industrial  safety  healthcare  consumer products  electronics  and energy  in 2013  3M paid  1 7 billion in cash dividends and bought back  5 2 billion of its own shares  The company has increased its annual dividend to shareholders for 55 consecutive years 
5  NIKE  Inc   NKE   Specializing in footwear and apparel  NIKE has offered an annual dividend increase for the last 11 years  In its fiscal second quarter  ended November 20  2013   NIKE saw an eight percent gain in sales from continuing operations and a 12  increase in global future orders 
6  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners  L P   KMP   One of the largest master limited partnerships and the largest natural gas pipeline and storage operator in the U S   Kinder Morgan provides oil and gas transmission and storage  The company s fee generating assets produce stable cash flows  and its current yield is 6 6  
Core positions can be accumulated over time and dividend reinvestment is an excellent way to increase your holdings in a cost effective manner  Positions can be reviewed quarterly 
Now  hopefully there s room in your portfolio for a handful of more aggressive stocks  These are the speculative positions for capital gains 
Restaurant stocks can be good moneymakers as new chains continually come to market  Large cap biotechnology stocks always offer lots of action  too 
Pure play technology is attractive  but not products that are easily commoditized  Likewise  cloud based software and data optimization companies are quickly growing 
Finally  resource stocks can make money  but they are highly cyclical and always tied to underlying spot prices  Turnaround or penny stocks are time consuming and not really worthwhile when broader market action is good  But there are always exceptions 
Overall  risk control is more important than potential return  which is why a portfolio of conservative  core positions can easily handle a few high flyers  At the end of the day  valuations and expectations are all relative  Anything can happen to any stock  so some diversification is useful

194848,416364,MMM,How To Find The Best Sector ETFs,opinion,"Finding the best ETFs is an increasingly difficult task in a world with so many to choose from 
You Cannot Trust ETF Labels
There are at least 45 different Financials ETFs and at least 182 ETFs across all sectors  Do investors need that many choices  How different can the ETFs be 
Those 45 Financials ETFs are very different  With anywhere from 21 to 550 holdings  many of these Financials ETFs have drastically different portfolios  creating drastically different investment implications 
The same is true for the ETFs in any other sector  as each offers a very different mix of good and bad stocks  Some sectors have lots of good stocks and offer quality funds  The opposite is true for some sectors  while others lie in between these extremes with a fair mix of good and bad stocks  For example  the Financials sector  per my 1Q Sector Rankings Report  ranks ninth out of 10 sectors when it comes to providing investors with quality ETFs  Consumer Staples ranks first  Utilities ranks last  
The bottom line is  ETF labels do not tell you the kind of stocks you are getting in any given ETF 
Paralysis By Analysis
I firmly believe ETFs for a given sector should not all be that different  I think the large number of Financials  or any other  sector ETFs hurts investors more than it helps because too many options can be paralyzing  It is simply not possible for the majority of investors to properly assess the quality of so many ETFs  Analyzing ETFs  done with the proper diligence  is far more difficult than analyzing stocks because it means analyzing all the stocks within each ETF  As stated above  that can be as many as 550 stocks  and sometimes even more  for one ETF 
Any investor worth his salt recognizes that analyzing the holdings of an ETF is critical to finding the best ETF 

Figure 1  Best Sector ETFs


Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings

The Danger Within
Why do investors need to know the holdings of ETFs before they buy  They need to know to be sure they do not buy a fund that might blow up  Buying a fund without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances  As Barron s says  investors should know the Danger Within  No matter how cheap  if it holds bad stocks  the ETF s performance will be bad 
PERFORMANCE OF FUND S HOLDINGS   PERFORMANCE OF FUND
Finding the Sector ETFs with the Best Holdings
Figure 1 shows my top rated ETF for each sector  Importantly  my ratings on ETFs are based primarily on my stock ratings of their holdings  My firm covers over 3000 stocks and is known for the due diligence we do for each stock we cover  Accordingly  our coverage of ETFs leverages the diligence we do on each stock by rating ETFs based on the aggregated ratings of the stocks each ETF holds 
State Street SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  XLP  is the top rated Consumer Staples ETF and the overall top rated fund of the 182 sector ETFs that I cover  Only the Consumer Staples sector contains any Attractive  i e  4 star  rated ETFs  while the best every other sector can offer is a Neutral or 3 star ETF 
Sometimes  you get what you pay for 
It is troubling to see one of the best sector ETFs  First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund  TDIV  have just  282 million in assets despite its 3 star rating  On the other hand  Dangerous rated iShares North American Tech Software ETF  IGV  has  1 165 million in assets  IGV has lower total annual costs than TDIV  0 53  and 0 55  respectively   but low costs cannot drive positive performance  Quality holdings are the ultimate driver of performance 
I cannot help but wonder if investors would leave IGV if they knew that it has such a poor portfolio of stocks  It is cheaper than TDIV  but  as previously stated  low fees cannot growth wealth  only good stocks can 
Sometimes  you DON T get what you pay for 
The smallest ETF in Figure 1 is PowerShares KBW Property   Casualty Insurance Portfolio  KBWP  with just  16 million in assets  Sadly  other Financials ETFs with more assets and inferior portfolios charge more than KBWP  In other words  Financials ETF investors are paying extra fees for no reason 
iShares U S  Broker Dealers ETF  IAI  is one of the worst ETFs in the Financials sector  It gets my Dangerous rating based off the fact that only 13  of its assets are allocated to Attractive or better rated stocks while 45  is allocated to Dangerous or worse stocks  IAI also has total annual costs of 0 53   higher than KBWP s 0 39   One would think that IAI would have fewer assets than KBWP  but instead it has over  263 million  Investors are paying extra fees for poor holdings 
The worst ETF in Figure 1 is PowerShares Dynamic Utilities  PUI   which gets a Dangerous  2 star  rating  One would think ETF providers could do better for this sector 
I recommend investors only buy ETFs with more than  100 million in assets  You can find more liquid alternatives for the other funds on my free ETF screener 
Covering All The Bases  Including Costs
My ETF rating also takes into account the total annual costs  which represents the all in cost of being in the ETF  This analysis is complex for ETFs  as one has to consider not only expense ratios  but also front end load and transaction fees  A high front end load not only costs investors at the beginning  it also reduces the growth investors can experience later on  While costs play a smaller role than holdings  my ratings penalize those funds with abnormally high costs 
Top Stocks Make Up Top ETFs
3M Company  MMM  is one of favorite holdings in State Street SPDR Industrial Select Sector SPDR  XLI  and earns my Attractive rating  MMM has grown after tax profits  NOPAT  by 10  compounded annually for the past decade  which means last year s NOPAT 260  greater than it was ten years ago  They currently earn a top quintile return on invested capital  ROIC  of 18   double the average among the other industrial conglomerates I cover 
Despite its strong history of profit growth  the market still underestimates the value of MMM  At   127 share  MMM has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 1 5  This ratio implies the market expects MMM to never grow NOPAT by more than 50  from its current level  With the company s track record of consistent profit growth  this expectation seems rather pessimistic  Long term investors should look at MMM as a company with low risk and great upside

194849,416365,MMM,Large Cap Long Term Pick Of The Week  3M,opinion,"3M Company  MMM   showed up on the radar in December in Playing 3M Both Ways  It shook out traders with a move higher and then pullback with the market in January  But on a longer weekly timescale it shows a really strong trend higher that has been supported by the rising 20 week Simple Moving Average  SMA   The January pullback brought it right down to that level and it has been riding it higher since  That gives a level to trade against  Placing a stop underneath that level gives a good reward to risk trade  As an alternative you can define your risk buying the 135 Strike Call in April  about  2 70  or July  about  4 85  for a simple trade  The option trade does give up the dividend though  I bought some of the July calls Thursday at  4 80

194862,416378,MMM,3M  Why I Like This Blue Chip So Much,opinion,In the world of large cap blue chips  the performance of so many mature  slow growth corporations in the market is truly remarkable  Ever since the stock market bottom in March 2009  the place to be has been dividend paying blue chips  While these stocks certainly can experience long periods of non performance  the dividends add up and they add up big time when reinvested in new shares A component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average  3M Company  MMM  is as mature an enterprise as they come  This stock has been doing very well on the equity market  even though its top  and bottom line growth is anemic But in the marketplace for institutional money  3M offers the  package  its slight hope for improving earnings  three percent top line growth  a current dividend yield of 2 2   and other positive balance sheet attributes  Dividends have been and will continue to be worth paying for From July of 2011 to the beginning of 2013  3M did nothing on the equity market but pay its dividends  But like so many other blue chips  3M just took off starting in January  so  in effect  the opportunity cost of owning this previously flat position was significant This is how so many blue chips trade  They don t do anything but pay their dividends until market dynamics lift them higher  3M s stock chart is featured below Wall Street has been boosting 2013 and 2014 earnings estimates for many blue chips  including 3M  Part of the expectations is a pickup in the U S  economy  which is highly unpredictable  In 3M s case  the  is expected to grow its earnings by about six percent this year and 10  in 2014  according to the Wall Street average  For such a large  mature enterprise  combined with a very steady dividend  an investor should reasonably expect a high single digit to low double digit return on investment per year  assuming that there will be no return to a recession  In June of this year  the company completed the sale of its Scientific Anglers and Ross Reels fishing equipment businesses to The Orvis Company Inc  3M didn t disclose financial details  but they were probably not significant enough to report  The company s industrial division experienced solid growth in the latest quarter  The company s other operating divisions  including safety and graphics  electronics and energy  and healthcare and consumer products  were flat  Currency impacts affected the company s sales by 1 3  year to date  This was mostly due to a 20  weakening of the Japanese yen compared to the U S  dollar  In the first half of this year  the company purchased approximately  2 0 billion worth of its own stock  compared to  1 16 billion in shares repurchased in the second quarter of 2012 Earlier this year  3M boosted its annual dividend by 7 3   representing its 55th consecutive year of increases  It s highly likely the company will do something similar next year  which adds to the attractiveness of this blue chip business  What I do expect is for the marketplace to continue bidding shares of safe  reliable  dividend paying stocks like 3M  The outlook for increased dividends continues to be very favorable Disclaimer  There is no magic formula to getting rich  Success in investment vehicles with the best prospects for price appreciation can only be achieved through proper and rigorous research and analysis  The opinions in this e newsletter are just that  opinions of the authors  Information contained herein  while believed to be correct  is not guaranteed as accurate  Warning  Investing often involves high risks and you can lose a lot of money  Please do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose ,2013-09-13,Mitchell Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3m:-why-i-like-this-blue-chip-so-much-183653,183653

194864,416380,MMM,3M  Playing It Both Ways,opinion,3M   MMM   has been another of those stocks that has just kept going higher  In fact at the end of July 2012 I suggested it was a long term buy at 91 and even after the recent pullback it is up 39  from that point  Since this time last year it has had a very steady run higher with a couple of pullbacks to just under the 50 day Simple Moving Average  SMA   in fact although it is not widely  or at all used  the 89 day SMA has stopped all pullbacks  This is the thicker line on the chart below  What is interesting about this is that it is a Fibonacci number and it is very near the Measured Move lower if the bear flag continues down  As this has been a buying signal you want to watch what happens as it gets there this time That move is around 120 50 but there is a second view that corroborates this level  The chart below shows that it is tracing out a bullish Bat harmonic  that has a potential reversal zone at 118 70  If you have been looking for an entry into a long term name that has a 2  dividend yield then keep an eye on this one to see how it reacts in the 118 70 120 50 range  If you are a short term trader then there is an opportunity from these to patterns  on a trigger under 125 to short it to that range or more  Disclosure  The information in this blog post represents my own opinions and does not contain a recommendation for any particular security or investment  I or my affiliates may hold positions or other interests in securities mentioned in the Blog  please see my  page for my full disclaimer ,2013-12-11,Gregory W.
