Officer  Steve Zabel  and Chief Operating Officer  Mike Simonds  as well as Peter O Donnell  who heads our International business  and Tim Arnold  who heads our Colonial Life business And now I ll turn the call over to Rick for his opening comments Richard P  McKenney    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Tom  and good morning everyone  We closed out 2019 with a good fourth quarter  Our after tax operating earnings per share increased 8 5  over the year ago quarter to  1 41  This puts our full year operating earnings per share at  5 44 and a growth rate of just under 5  In the fourth quarter  we had a good mix of growth  with after tax operating earnings growth of 3  complemented by the additional benefit from share buybacks producing the 8 5  overall increase  The business environment we operate in remains mixed  with headwinds from low interest rates and the economic impacts of Brexit on our U K  business  offset somewhat by the favorable employment trends and a strong consumer in the U S  All in all  we re pleased with performance in 2019  and optimistic  as we move into 2020 Looking at our business trends  I m pleased with the premium growth we saw in our core business lines  which are approximately 5  overall for the fourth quarter and for the full year  Sales trends however were more volatile in this quarter and sales for Unum U S  were lower on the quarter  impacted by the competitive conditions in the employee benefits market  and our desire to maintain discipline with our pricing and risk selection I feel it s important to remember that because of our focus on discipline  Unum U S  sales can vary from year to year  But I ll put that in the context  that our compound average growth rate has been 5 6  since 2016  and sales in total have exceeded  1 1 billion for each of the past three years  We saw favorable growth trends in our international lines  and an improved rate of growth at Colonial Life in the fourth quarter  which helped us generate a slight increase in sales for the full year for Colonial Life  Total sales for the company for the full year were  1 8 billion  and persistency levels in our U S  group lines and international business lines remain steady at very favorable levels  reflecting a strong value proposition we bring to our in force customers and our distribution partners Next we continued very favorable overall margin trends across our core business lines  Benefit ratios remained within our expectations  particularly in our U S  based businesses  This reflects a disciplined approach we bring to product pricing and underwriting  as well as in force block management through renewals  While adding new customers in our core business segments is a driving force of our strategy  we know that sustainable growth requires us to maintain our focus on protecting the strong profitability of these businesses Expense management trend also continued to be favorable in our core business segments  We re maintaining our focus on effectively managing our expense base  while freeing up the capacity to invest in new capabilities  I ll come back to this in a moment  but we see significant opportunities for growth and efficiency as an important element of success and will be continuing this focus on productivity  expense ratios and the profitability of our business Taking in aggregate  these favorable operating trends in our core business segments continue to drive strong margins and capital generation  As a result  our adjusted operating return on equity was 17 2  for the fourth quarter  Our core businesses also generated healthy statutory after tax operating earnings of over  1 billion in 2019  with the resulting cash flows funding our growth and supporting our capital deployment initiatives Wrapping up on our financial results  the Closed Block had an excellent fourth quarter  with historically low loss ratio in the Closed Disability Block  We also saw favorable overall results in the long term care business  which has remained within our expectations  since we updated assumptions 18 months ago  Steve will cover all these results in more detail in his commentary So to conclude my remarks  we re quite pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019  We enter 2020 with a strong sense of optimism  You also saw few weeks ago  we named Mike Simonds  as our Chief Operating Officer  a recognition of his past success and a well deserved expansion of responsibilities to drive growth  We know that delivering consistent long term success is a constantly evolving market for benefits  and through all this  new product introductions and business acquisitions we have made requires us to continually challenge our approach to how we do business  and Mike s new role will be instrumental in this process  Our team is excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us and for continued growth and success And now  I ll ask Steve to cover the details of the fourth quarter results  Steve Steven A  Zabel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGreat  thank you  Rick and good morning everyone  I m very pleased with our fourth quarter results  It was a good quarter overall with solid results in our Unum US and Colonial Life businesses  both of which came in consistent with our expectations The Closed Block had excellent results while the International business had a tougher quarter  reflecting the challenges we face in the U K  business environment  Our fourth quarter tax rate was slightly higher than expected in the quarter  but was in line with our expectations for the full year  a result of normal volatility  we expect to see over the course of the year Miscellaneous investment income rebounded in the fourth quarter from an unusually low amount in the third quarter  but remain below our expectations and historical trends for the full year  All in all  we ended the year in good shape with after tax adjusted operating earnings per share of  5 44  within our growth expectation of 4  to 7  that we established a year ago Now I d like to dig more deeply into the results  Starting with Unum U S   we continue to see solid underlying results in the fourth quarter  as adjusted operating income increased 5 8  to  263 1 million  with each of our three reporting lines showing positive year over year results  Premium growth remained healthy at 5  year over year  driven primarily by continued strong group persistency  Net investment income increased slightly less than 1   helped in part by an increase in miscellaneous investment income over the year ago quarter  Benefits experience in the segment was generally favorable  with the benefit ratio declining slightly to 67 3  in the quarter  The adjusted operating return on equity for Unum U S  remained quite strong at over 18  in the quarter Then within Unum U S   adjusted operating income for Group Disability increased 2 9  to  83 million in the fourth quarter  We continue to see good premium growth and strong benefits experience  as well as slightly higher net investment income  Premium income increased by 5 7   as the in force block increased from prior period sales growth  and continued strong persistency in our Group Insurance lines  The benefit ratio improved to 74  in the fourth quarters and 76 2  a year ago  driven primarily by favorable claim recovery experience in our group long term disability product line  which was partially offset by higher claims incidence Net investment income in the quarter was slightly higher  as higher miscellaneous investment income offset the effects of reduced assets back in the line and lower portfolio yields on those assets  The increase in the other expense ratio compared to the year ago quarter was primarily driven by the rapid growth of our lease services  Keep in mind  that the fee income related to those services is included in the other income line  Excluding the service business  we saw slight improvement in the operating expense ratio in the fourth quarter relative to a year ago Adjusted operating income for the Group Life and AD D line increased by 6 1  in the fourth quarter to  68 2 million  Premium income increased 4 8   primarily from prior period sales growth  The benefit ratio of 71 7  was generally consistent with the year ago quarter of 71 6   The expense ratio declined slightly  due to the ongoing focus on expense management and operating efficiencies It was a more volatile quarter for sales in our Unum U S  group lines of business  declining 9 4  from the year ago quarter  Full year sales however declined by less than 1   Persistency in our group lines in aggregate continues to be a bright spot for us  at 90 5  for full year 2019  compared to 90 3  in 2018 Finally  the supplemental and voluntary line  adjusted operating income was  111 9 million for the fourth quarter  an increase of 7 9  relative to the year ago quarter  Premium income grew by 4 5   primarily driven by prior period sales and the growth in our dental and vision product lines  partially offset by unfavorable persistency across all businesses Looking at benefits experience for each product line  the benefit ratio for individual disability was slightly lower relative to last year  due to a lower average claim size and favorable claim recoveries  The benefit ratio for the voluntary benefits line was higher  primarily due to unfavorable claims experience across all products Finally  in the dental and vision line  the benefit ratio is higher relative to the year ago quarter  due to higher utilization  The expense ratio for the supplemental and voluntary line improved relative to the year ago quarter from our focus on expense management and operating efficiencies  Sales for the supplemental and voluntary line were lower by 5  for the fourth quarter  with declines in both the individual disability and voluntary benefits product lines  offsetting growth in the dental and vision product line  For full year 2019  sales in our supplemental and voluntary line were flat Our Unum International segment reported adjusted operating income of  23 9 million for the fourth quarter  a decline of 21 4  from the year ago quarter  The decline was driven primarily by lower operating income from the U K  line of business in local currency  In local currency  the Unum U K  line of business reported adjusted operating income of GBP17 4 million in the fourth quarter  a decline of 21 6   These results reflect growth in premium income of 8 6   relative to the year ago quarter from higher persistency  sales growth and the benefit of rate increases in the group long term disability product line  Net investment income for Unum U K  declined 8 7  to GBP20 9 million British pounds in the fourth quarter  due in part to lower investment income from inflation index linked bonds that we hold to support the claim reserves associated with our group policies  that provide for inflation linked increases and benefits and also lower yield on fixed rate bonds The benefit ratio for the U K  business increased to 77 3  in the fourth quarter compared to 74 6  a year ago  primarily due to unfavorable claims experienced in both the group long term disability and group life product lines  partially offset by lower inflationary increases in benefits  Unum International sales in U S  dollars increased 13 8  in the fourth quarter  with sales in the U K  and local currency  increasing 13 9  and sales in Unum Poland increasing 8 8  on a dollar basis  Persistency for the U K  business continues to be favorable in the face of successfully implementing renewal rate increases over the past few years  as we look to offset interest rate pressures While our Unum U K  results are facing continued headwinds from Brexit  we are pleased with the execution of our strategies  which are centered on implementing rate increases  maintaining strong persistency and discipline on new sales pricing  and actively rewriting underperforming cases  In addition  we are very pleased with the performance of the Unum Poland business  which produced strong premium growth of 8 6  this quarter on a dollar basis  We continue to expect our 2020 operating income to be relatively consistent with our results for full year 2019 Moving on  the Colonial Life segment produced adjusted operating income of  87 7 million for the fourth quarter  an increase of 2 7  from the year ago quarter  Premium income increased 3 6  for the fourth quarter  primarily driven by prior period sales growth  including the expansion of the dental and vision products  offset in part by a lower level of persistency  The benefit ratio of 51 5  was generally consistent with the year ago quarter of 51 6   Sales at Colonial Life continued to rebuild momentum  with a year over year increase of 2 6  in the fourth quarter  which brings the full year sales to an increase of almost 1   In the quarter  we saw positive trends in the public sector markets  where new sales increased over 41   Persistency for full year 2019 declined to 77  from 78 1  in 2018  but we believe that persistency will level out in 2020 at current levels  We are confident in the actions we ve been taking to rebuild our sales momentum and expect improved sales growth levels in 2020 And moving on to the Closed Block  adjusted operating income was very strong at  46 1 million compared to  34 8 million in the year ago quarter  As expected  premium income for this segment continued to decline  down by 4 5  in the fourth quarter  which is primarily due to the ongoing policy terminations and maturities for the individual disability line  which is partially offset by premium rate increases within the LTC product Net investment income increased 3 1  in the quarter  driven by an increase in the level of invested assets backing the LTC line  which is partially offset by a lower yield  In the individual disability product line  the interest adjusted loss ratio was 74 7  for the fourth quarter compared to 81 2  last year  which is primarily driven by favorable claims experience  This quarter s loss ratio was the lowest we ve experienced in over 10 years  but going forward  we expect the loss ratio to be in the low 80s In the long term care business line  the interest adjusted loss ratio was 86 7  for the fourth quarter and remains within our expectations of a loss ratio in the 85  to 90  range  Over the past four quarters  which we feel the more appropriate time to measure a volatile line like LTC  the interest adjusted loss ratio for LTC is 88 1   again in line with our expected range I ll then round out the Closed Block discussion with three other important topics related to LTC  First  we made incremental progress with premium rate approvals in the fourth quarter  with several new approvals on our group LTC rate filings  We are pleased with the rate of progress we are making to our  1 4 billion assumption and believe we can achieve this goal in the coming years Second  we have exceeded the new money yield target of 5 5  since the third quarter of 2018  As we ve often cautioned  the assumption backing this business line need to be analyzed over a long term time horizon  giving us potential for quarterly volatility  but we remain satisfied with how the trends have evolved since the reserve update in 2018  And third  LTC related cash contributions to subsidiaries for the full year 2019 for our first Unum subsidiary totaled  100 million  and for the Fairwind captive  totaled  268 million Looking out over the next couple of years  our capital plans anticipate these cash contributions settling back to our previous historical average of around  200 million combined  as we work through the impacts of low interest rates and tax reform Wrapping up with the corporate segment  the adjusted operating loss  which excludes  2 1 million of before tax costs related to the early retirement of debt  was higher in the fourth quarter at  50 5 million compared to a loss of  48 2 million in the year ago quarter  This was driven by lower net investment income and higher interest expense  which was offset by lower operating expenses Statutory earnings for our traditional U S  insurance company were quite strong in the fourth quarter with statutory after tax operating earnings totaling  266 million compared to  215 million in the year ago quarter  and totaled  1 03 billion for the full year  Our capital metrics remain in good shape  with the weighted average risk based capital ratio for our U S  traditional life insurance companies at approximately 365   consistent with our plans for the year Also consistent with our expectations  cash at our holding companies totaled  863 million at year end 2019  Early in the fourth quarter  we completed the tender and redemption transactions that we began late in the third quarter  which generate the small debt extinguishment cost reported in the fourth quarter  In addition  share buybacks in the fourth quarter were  100 million and totaled  400 million for the full year 2019 I d also highlight that book value per common share  excluding AOCI  as of December 31  2019 was  48 92  which was an increase of 11 2  over 2018  So for full year 2019  after tax adjusted operating income per share was  5 44  an increase of 4 6  over full year 2018  Looking to 2020  we continue to expect growth in after tax adjusted operating income per share in the 4  to 7  range  which is consistent with the outlook we provided at our outlook meeting in December Now I ll turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments and look forward to your questions Richard P  McKenney    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Steve  And again  we re very pleased with the fourth quarter and we are in full swing for the new year in 2020  The team is here to respond to your questions  So I ll ask Kevin to begin the question and answer session  Kevin Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions   Our first question comes from Ryan Krueger of KBW  Please go ahead Ryan Krueger    KBW    AnalystHi  good morning  On disability  can you give a little bit more color on the benefit ratio  I guess it improved despite absorbing the lower discount rate  So  I m just hoping to get some incremental color on what you saw there  to offset that and drive further improvement Richard P  McKenney    President and Chief Executive OfficerMike Michael Q  Simonds    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah sure  Good morning  Ryan  Yeah  so as you noted  good solid loss ratio in the group disability line 74   I d say  to your question specifically  strong recoveries and offsets in the quarter  more than helped offset a moderate increase in new claim incidence  As you noted    and as we had talked about at Investor Day  we did go ahead and lower the new claim discount rate on 25 basis points in the quarter Ryan Krueger    KBW    AnalystGot it  And then on competition  you made a number of comments in December about seeing more voluntary competition  You also had softer traditional group sales  Are you seeing more competition in traditional group as well or do you view the quarter as more volatility  that s more confined to voluntary Richard P  McKenney    President and Chief Executive OfficerRyan  it s Rick  Let me just step back and talk a little bit about how the competitive landscape has changed over the last several years  You would note a number of players that have sold businesses to others that are incumbents in our space  and so that has been the dynamic that we have seen out there and that has covered across the group states  On the voluntary space  you would have heard us talk about new entrants  people getting into the voluntary space that    we have not as necessarily  historically been in that space  and so we re seeing how that s playing out over time  I d actually talk a little bit more about fourth quarter  feel very good about the sales we saw in our our UK operations  Colonial Life on a better trend  than we saw in the first half of the year  And then we did see Unum U S  down a little bit on the quarter  But when you look at the fourth quarter  I d go back to the greater than  1 1 billion in sales and are maintaining our pricing discipline  which you see year in and year out  we ll continue to push through that I think the recognition of a competitive landscape changing  are a number of players that really like this space  and I think that bodes well for us  that we re in the front of the pack  and as they go through and coming to the space and go through integration  we re focused on growth in the future  So I m very satisfied with where we are  but we re also looking forward to where it is Competition will come and go  we ve been there for many  many years  We don t necessarily see the irrational competitor  which is the one thing you can t do much about  but we expect competition and we think it s actually good for our business in the longer term  And Mike  if you want to add anything on the    what you re seeing  particularly to our lines in the fourth quarter Michael Q  Simonds    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerI think you summed it up well  In the fourth quarter  maybe just a little bit more color  We did see a decrease of about 8  overall  but if you unpack it a little bit  sales to our existing clients were actually up about 7  and that s really important to us  those tend to build stickier  longer term relationships  and they come in more favorably priced  and what you have to do to go out and win a new client relationship  I think that s where we felt Ryan  the most competition is in the new client market  And I d say  not terribly different than what we had seen emerge over the full second half of the year  and pretty consistent with prior cycles in the past I guess I d just close by saying  as we look out into 2020  there is a lot of reasons for optimism  We re certainly going to maintain that pricing discipline that you have known and seen from us very consistently  But new capabilities rolling out  particularly in that core market  where we have struggled to get some growth within our targeted underwriting margins  with the rollout of our new digital platform  we will now be taking core clients from    onboarding  all the way through the administration of their benefits  completely digitally and we think that s going to help set us apart  as well as new investment in sales reps in the quarter  where we have now built out a dedicated team to target the smallest under the core market  where we see a lot of opportunity to grow And maybe Tim  I think might have a couple of comments about the market on the voluntary side Timothy G  Arnold    Executive Vice President  Voluntary Benefits   President and Chief Executive Officer  Colonial LifeYes  sure  Thanks Mike  I think about the results that Colonial Life had in 2019  certainly the competitive environment was one factor  But just as a reminder  some of things we talked about in December  we made changes in our recruiting model that had an impact on our sales  so it has nothing to do with competitive environment  We also made changes in a number of key distribution relationships  We made some changes in migrating toward higher persistency industries and perhaps away from some lower persistency industries  So we feel great about the quality of the sales we had in 2019  The public sector growth that Steve talked about earlier  with that being the highest persistency industry in our book  we feel very good about that  We feel great about the to continued contribution of dental in our book  and we had a strong year again  selling to our existing customers  So that s also helpful  And as we look forward    maybe at the risk of slightly overanswering  But as we look forward  I agree with Rick  the market opportunities are tremendous  There are still 6 million businesses out there that have more than one employee and less than 100  Those businesses tend to be underserved  Their employees are certainly underserved with less than half of America s workers having adequate life or disability insurance We have a very strong value prop in all markets  in all segments  With our current footprint  we can reach over 80  of America s workers who live in one hour drive of one of our primary offices  We have 6 000 people who give benefits education and counseling  which is desperately needed in this environment  And on the recruiting front  after a challenging second  third quarter  we rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter and are back to the levels that we saw before we made the strategic shift in our recruiting approach So we remain pretty optimistic and we still feel comfortable with the guidance Richard P  McKenney    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo to sum that up  Ryan  I think we have competition  yes   Indecipherable   but as you can hear from the team  we are on offense Ryan Krueger    KBW    AnalystThanks a lot OperatorOur next question comes from Suneet Kamath of Citi  Please go ahead Suneet Kamath    Citigroup    AnalystThanks  The first question on pricing  particularly in Unum U S   I mean  your interest rates are down a decent amount so far this year  So how do you feel about the level of pricing that you re putting out in the market  and do you have to maybe work some more price through  to contend with where rates are today Michael Q  Simonds    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerSuneet  thanks for the question  It s Mike  And actually pretty consistent with where we were in December  because like we talked about in the past  certainly yields are one factor that we re going to put into new business and renewal policy claim trends and expense levels are also getting factored in  So there s some puts and takes  Like we talked about in December  I think we re in a really good spot  given current returns to probably nudge rates up a couple of points  certainly low single digits across most products and segments  But I think one of the things we work really hard to do  is deliver consistency to clients in terms of predictability to acquire clients at a sustainable rate  And then  where we need to make adjustments  they are going to be pretty modest Suneet Kamath    Citigroup    AnalystAnd then Rick in your opening comments you talked a little bit more about expense efficiencies and some of the actions you guys might be taking  Can you just provide a little bit more color on what some of those actions would be  and sort of how material it could be  in terms of driving growth Richard P  McKenney    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  thanks Suneet  It is a big part of our commentary  but it s part of the actions that we re focused on right now  And it comes on two fronts  maintaining the efficiency that you ve heard year in and year out  maintaining a very good expense ratio  It s not outsized  We do it in every year  when you look at how we can maintain efficiency  I think we re leaning into it a little bit harder these days  and the goal is to actually be able to channel our investments into these growth opportunities we see  You hear the optimism that we have  but we ve got to make sure that we re putting the money behind these opportunities to go after  So the expense efficiency that you see  will really be applied mostly back into our capabilities  as we go forward So that s why you hear about a little bit more about it because we are a little bit more focused on it  but it really will be going back more toward the opportunity and the capabilities that we see in the next several years Suneet Kamath    Citigroup    AnalystThanks Rick OperatorOur next question comes from Thomas Gallagher of Evercore ISI  Please go ahead Thomas Gallagher    Evercore ISI    AnalystGood morning  Just the follow up on the competition in in group  Would you say    and I heard your comment about the 7  increase in sales to existing clients  So most of the competition is coming from new client sales  Would you say that you are closed on a lot of these cases  that you re not winning  And the reason I ask is if  if you re really losing on price by a larger wider margin  just curious if you would have optimism that sales would recover in 2020  or is it not that far apart on pricing  to the point where you think you can kind of recover from a sales standpoint Michael Q  Simonds    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  Tom  it s Mike  Thanks for the question  I would actually say we re not that far off in general  There s going to be some volatility prospect to prospect  One  although it does not apply to all  But I think Rick hit it earlier in the call  we really don t see an irrational competitor too  which we have seen at times in the past  where you might be significantly out  I d say  we ve got a pretty healthy market out there  I d say in general  we re in the hunt and that bodes well  as we    as we are going to put some new tools into our salespeoples hands here in 2020  and I think that s    I think that does bode well  And few of the optimism around the guidance we put out there for continued steady top line growth I d say the other piece is  there s just    there is less churn in the market  and that s my observation certainly reflected in our persistency  and as we looked at our 1 1 renewal cycle  there is just less business moving in the traditional group side Thomas Gallagher    Evercore ISI    AnalystGot you  And then just a question on IDI Closed Block performance was very favorable  Was that mainly just increased mortality in the quarter  And I guess just relatedly  just given that you had several years of good performance there does that    would you say that improves the possibility or optionality of you doing something with that block to free up capital or where do you stand on thoughts  regarding that Steven A  Zabel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Tom  this is Steve  I ll take that one  So just related to the quarter around our Closed Block Individual Disability Income business  I d say it was a combination  but probably the main driver was just lower incidents  It was a bit of an anomaly for us  had lower incidents on that block  We did also see strong mortality  but probably not that was outsized what we would normally see in the fourth quarter  So I would say it was mostly driven by incidents  Definitely would not see that sustainable into the future  In my comments I guided back down to the low 80s  and that s still where we are  But I do have to say  we feel good about how that blocks performed  If you go back  that block    the majority of that block is in a special purpose vehicle  It was securitized with non recourse debt  That debt has performed very very well  So I think that really speaks to the consistency of the profits coming off of that block  The debt is actually going to be paid off  going into the middle part of next year So we feel good about it  But again  if you re thinking about kind of forward looking  the low 80  loss ratio  probably a more normalized level  When it comes to just the block itself and how we re thinking about opportunities  we continually test the market  and continually explore the market in a variety of ways  When we definitely look at reinsurance  obviously we ll look at potentially relevering that block  once that debt stayed off  But it also is generating some nice distributable cash flows  and so we also have the option to just let that come through  and have it be available at the holding company  So we will continue to explore all three of those options as we see  But whatever we do  it s going to be for the benefit of shareholders  and so we ll make sure that economically  it makes sense for the company and the shareholders Thomas Gallagher    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  thanks  And if I could just sneak one more in  just the 365 RBC  do you have a pro forma estimate of what that RBC would be  if you recaptured the long term care captive  What adjustment we should make to RBC Steven A  Zabel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I would  I would just go back to how we think about our targets for risk based capital  We try to keep it in aggregate of 350  and that s what we guide toward as far as our traditional insurance companies  We don t really publicly disclose what that would look like  But I think we d still be around that 350  range  if we were to do that Thomas Gallagher    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  thanks OperatorOur next question comes from Humphrey Lee of Dowling   Partners  Please go ahead Humphrey Lee    Dowling   Partners    AnalystGood morning and thank you for taking my questions  Looking at Unum U K   you pointed out  there is the impact of Brexit and interest rate and also you have some unfavorable underwriting in the quarter  But I think the profit margin is one of the lowest that I can recall  But given some of the ongoing impact  how should we think about the profit margin for that line of business going forward Richard P  McKenney    President and Chief Executive OfficerMaybe I ll just start and we will turn it over to Pete  I mean one of the things I would remind you Humphrey though  when you look at that line of business  it s still a mid teens ROE business  So  it has a little bit lower we talked about that in our comments  in the quarter and in the world of Brexit  having a still a mid teens ROE business is very good Now  let me turn it over to Peter to give some more details in terms of where margins stand and where they are going Peter G  O Donnell    Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer  Unum InternationalYeah  Thanks Humphrey  Maybe be I ll just take a step back and sort of give you my view of where the business is  So yes  we have experienced a challenging environment recently with a significant uncertainty around Brexit  and as you guys mentioned it  interest rates and the exchange rate  I would say  are the sort of most visible indicators of that  with interest rates down below    10 year down below 1   and the exchange rate being under  1 30 for most of the year  Good news  it s not a  1 30 and seems pretty stable around that Very positive about the election results in December  it s really good I think  for business in the U K   we talked to most business leaders  they just want to see a stable government for at least five years  However in 2020  we expect the external environment to be very similar to 2019  as the U K  debates its future relationship with EU As Steve mentioned in his remarks  I feel good about the progress we re making in many areas  We ve seen good growth in products that are sensitive to interest rates  good expense control  good core growth  and persistency is being good  given the renewal program  However  it s on our long term visibility product  we have seen the most pressure  both from interest rates and higher claims incidents and severity  moving away from our long term averages  But we ve been responding to again over the last two years with our rate program  which will restore margins  and we are also being very disciplined on pricing new business We do see volatility by quarter  and in 2018 we averaged around  20 million higher in the first half and lower in second half  I wouldn t worry too much about that trend in the second half  It does tend us to move around a lot  But basically  we landed about  80 million for the year  and as Rick mentioned  an ROE of just under 40   In 2020  we will continue to rewrite the book and work with clients to improve claims and grow those non interest rate sensitive products  And we expect BTOE to be broadly in line with 2019  but it can move around that  20 million mean by quarter  It s difficult to call it by quarter  So overall  very positive about the positioning and prospect for the business over the medium term  given the actions we have and are taking  and particularly as we see returns to more normal political environment  as we clear Brexit Humphrey Lee    Dowling   Partners    AnalystThat s helpful  And then shifting gears back to U S   so you ve talked about the efficiency and I appreciate the color that you provided  But just looking at group visibility  the expenses kind of came up  I think part of it is because of the lead management that you have in backup  you are spending more to grow that business  So I guess  how should we think about kind of the general expenses for group visibility going forward  as we think about your efficiency gain for your underwriting business  but at the same time  while growing your lead management Michael Q  Simonds    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerSure Humphrey  Good morning  it s Mike  So  you nailed it  So that group visibility segment is where we have our fee based services business  primarily lead management  which increasingly is becoming not just FMLA at the Federal level  but state level and municipal level  as well as corporate fees  So that in combination with the sizable disability fee based services that we provide is growing  We see that as a very attractive business for us over time and one of our biggest areas of the investment  So  the overall profile of the company that Rick was talking about  we re going to continue drive efficiency at the macro level  and that is one primary place that we re reinvesting funds back into this business  We see that as a real problem that we can solve for clients in a differentiated way  And so as we do that in the segment  as you re computing kind of an OE ratio with premium as your denominator and a fee based business  you are going to continue to see that OE ratio continue to drift up  What I would tell you is that  if you pull the fee based businesses out of the segment  we actually saw about a 50 basis points decline in the traditional operating expense ratio there So  in some ways  you kind of look out for that segment  I would continue to expect some modest growth in that expense ratio because of the growth in fee  but you should know that underneath that  we re continuing to sort of drive efficiency on the insurance side Humphrey Lee    Dowling   Partners    AnalystSo should we expect that kind of expenses for group disability to maybe    at least in the near term  perhaps  growing faster than your top line Michael Q  Simonds    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerI think it s going to grow slightly faster  but probably reasonable  We will see see that ratio climb a bit Humphrey Lee    Dowling   Partners    AnalystThat makes sense  Thank you Richard P  McKenney    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Humphrey OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Kligerman of Credit Suisse  Please go ahead Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thank you  Just wanted to narrow in a little bit on some of your earlier question  So with Unum U S   in the group disability area  this year you had a full year benefit ratio of 74 4   Last year  I mean in 2018  it was 76 1   So  as I think about an earlier comment you made about being able to get low single digit rate increases  maybe you could give some color on where that benefit ratio could stabilize  It sounds like 75  is doable  I know you had a favorable claims recoveries this quarter  but it seems like 75  or lower is doable going forward  and maybe you talk a little bit about that Michael Q  Simonds    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerYes  Andrew  thanks for the question  It s Mike  So  I think it s reasonable to have that sort of 74  to 75  range in mind  I would say just in general  that is pretty tight when you think about a business like this  that can overtime  particularly at a quarter to quarter level have some volatility  But as we look out and look at the returns on the major drivers of that benefit ratio  that seems like a reasonable range Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  I m still trying to reconcile your ability to grow sales in the voluntary markets  I mean  if you look at Unum U S   voluntary business  down to 12  year over year and it looked like in Colonial overall  it was 3  up versus 5  to 7  guidance  Maybe you could    I mean  maybe focused specifically on the pricing there  is pricing coming down Richard P  McKenney    President and Chief Executive OfficerWhy don t you start with Colonial Life and come back to the U S  Timothy G  Arnold    Executive Vice President  Voluntary Benefits   President and Chief Executive Officer  Colonial LifeYes  Andrew  Thanks for the question  Pricing on the voluntary side really isn t an issue  Almost all of the products that are sold on the voluntary side are shelf rated and    price is not a negotiating point  So the negotiating points tend to be around what type of participation you think you might get  based on the enrollment conditions  what the compensation looks like  whether there are technology companies that would need to share some of the compensation etc  So those are the negotiating points  and we don t see those being of any particularly real threat to us Richard P  McKenney    President and Chief Executive OfficerMike on the U S  side Michael Q  Simonds    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerYes  I d say  we talked about it a little bit  But I d say in the upper end of the market  it is    as Tim said  much less a price point  and its around underwriting and the product features  and we talked a little bit about    that we have rolled out some new products  they are I think  really oriented to creating additional consumer level value  There is less expense both to cover administration  because of the OE expenses that we ve had  but also through the channel  And those commissions level out  we have seen actually some pretty nice growth on that subset of new product  And about 25  of all of our new sales in the quarter came in on those new product chassis  and just looking at new clients is about 50   So  I think it will take some time  but as we look at the pipeline for voluntary under the Unum branded side of the business  I think there is reasons for optimism Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks so much OperatorOur next question comes from Erik Bass of Autonomous Research  Please go ahead Erik Bass    Autonomous Research    AnalystHi  thank you  Do you expect New York Life s acquisition of Cigna s Group business have much impact on the market  And historically  have you seen mutual companies approach the market much differently from a pricing or target margin perspective Richard P  McKenney    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks for the question  Erik  I mean  I think I would step back  I made some comments about how the market changes well  Prior to that acquisition  you have a had consolidation in the benefits space  For different reasons and different players  You ve also seen some acquisitions done from foreign players that have come into this space as well  So there is a lot of dynamics adding a new competitor in there  that is in the mutual space  This business still needs to be well managed and worked through the business  So  I don t    we haven t seen the dynamics yet  but I think that it should be similar to other competition that we have seen and people have gotten into the space  Mike do you want to add Michael Q  Simonds    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerI think you hit it well  Also specific to the question  we ve had a couple of long term mutual competitors in this space and have not seen a materially different sort of orientation to other competitors Erik Bass    Autonomous Research    AnalystGot it  Thanks  And you had some good success with the lead management services products  Are there other opportunities to add ancillary kind of fee based services or products to drive growth in the future Michael Q  Simonds    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerSure  We absolutely do think that  that is the case  I think the lead service gives us a point of intersection in a pretty meaningful way down to the consumer level and the worksite  and we can see a lot of potential services branching off from that as well  So that is one of things  as we kind of look forward as a company  we ve got a very strong insurance and benefits footprint across the U S  and U K   and we see increasingly that there s opportunities to introduce new  primarily digital backed by people services alongside those insurance products Erik Bass    Autonomous Research    AnalystThank you Richard P  McKenney    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Erik OperatorOur next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JP Morgan  Please go ahead Jimmy Bhullar    JP Morgan    AnalystHi  First  just a question on loss trends in the disability business  Obviously  they have been very favorable and I guess the labor market is helping as well  Do you see anything that would suggest that margins are not going to hold up at the recent level  I know  your guidance is a little bit more conservative than what you ve been reporting  And are you pricing based on what you ve seen in terms of lost claims trends over the past year or so  or more based on longer term averages Steven A  Zabel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Yes  So  on group disability  Id  just take you back to the commentary earlier  I think 74  to 75  on the loss ratio is very reasonable and consistent with what our expectations are  Looking out  as I was saying earlier  you look sort of the major factors that would sort of impact loss trends and we don t see things that would materially impact that  But as I say every time  it s an insurance business  it involves taking some risk  and their certainly can be  particularly  when you look at it on a quarterly basis  some volatility there But our approach is about being really smart and disciplined upfront about the risks that we take on  and then just investing heavily in a remarkably talented group of professionals that handles the claims process from the clinicians to the book  rehab to the disability benefit specialists  It is a really impressive machine and quite effective that helping support people return to work in a very consistent way Jimmy Bhullar    JP Morgan    AnalystAnd just on  like the changes    upcoming changes in long duration contracts in terms of accounting  do you have any better insight you ll be effective  I guess the LTC and IDI businesses are where you have the most exposure  but when do you think you ll be able to give some idea on what the impact on your book value would be Steven A  Zabel    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Jimmy  This is Steve  I ll take that one  So  I d step back just a little bit  just on the new accounting guidance  This is a GAAP only accounting guidance  How we view it  will have to change our reporting in our disclosures for GAAP basis financial reports  From a statutory cash flow  from a capital deployment perspective  we see this as a bit of a non event  It was delayed a year out  So  the effective date is in 2020 and so  the team s working through it  The recent change was adding the scope claim reserve liabilities  so we re working through that  The majority of the impact will be around discount rates  things that we talked about before So  as we look out  we re planning for the 2022 implementation  The team s working hard at it and  as we get more information  we will disclose it as it makes sense  But really nothing new to talk about right now Jimmy Bhullar    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  Thank you Richard P  McKenney    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Jimmy OperatorWe have no further questions at this time Richard P  McKenney    President and Chief

142361,363876,UNM,Unum  UNM  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Unum  UNM  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 38 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 2  
Revenues are expected to be  3 01 billion  up 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 36  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Unum 
For Unum  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 24  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Unum will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Unum would post earnings of  1 37 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 36  delivering a surprise of  0 73  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Unum doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/unum-unm-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200502297,200502297

142429,363944,UNM,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Unum  UNM  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Unum in Focus
Based in Chattanooga  Unum  UNM  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 23 04   The insurance company is paying out a dividend of  0 26 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 88  compared to the Insurance   Accident and Health industry s yield of 1 21  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 96  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 04 is up 6 1  from last year  Unum has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 12 18   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Unum s current payout ratio is 20   This means it paid out 20  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
UNM is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 49 per share  with earnings expected to increase 5 58  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  UNM is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-03-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-unum-unm-could-be-a-great-choice-200397706,200397706

142431,363946,UNM,Should Value Investors Consider Unum  UNM  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Unum Group   NYSE UNM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Unum has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 34  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 89  If we focus on the long term PE trend Unum s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares pretty favorably with the Zacks   Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 05  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Unum has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 6 12  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Unum has a P S ratio of about 0 61  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 24x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Unum currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes the stock a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio comes in at 5 86  which is better than the industry average of 9 17  Clearly  the stock is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though UNM might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives UNM a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current year has seen one upward revision with one downward movement in the past sixty days  For the next year  the estimate has seen one downward revision in the same time period with no movement in the opposite direction This has had an impact on the consensus estimate as the current year consensus estimate has inched down 0 18  in the past two months  while the next year estimate decreased 0 34   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Unum Group Price and Consensus   Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineUnum is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 6  of more than 250 industries  and Zacks Rank  3  instills our confidence  Further  over the past two years  the Zacks Insurance   Accident and Health industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8

142452,363967,UNM,Unum  UNM  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Unum  UNM  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 31 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15 9  
Revenues are expected to be  2 93 billion  up 3 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 34  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Unum 
For Unum  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 63  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Unum will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Unum would post earnings of  1 28 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 37  delivering a surprise of  7 03  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Unum doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/unum-unm-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200380561,200380561

Unum shares have added about 18 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 8 7  
What s Next for Unum 
While Unum has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Unum in Focus

142476,363991,UNM,5 Bargain Stocks Boasting Amazingly Low EV EBITDA Ratios,opinion,The price to earnings  P E  ratio is broadly considered by investors as a yardstick for assessing the fair market value of a stock  Many prefer to take the P E route in their quest for stocks that are trading at attractive prices  However  even this widely popular valuation metric is not without its pitfalls Is EV EBITDA a Better Substitute to P E Although P E is hands down the most widely used equity valuation ratio in the market  a relatively less used metric called EV EBITDA is often viewed as a better option as it offers a clearer image of a company s valuation and earnings potential  Unlike P E that solely considers a company s equity portion  EV EBITDA determines its total   also known as the enterprise multiple  is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  In a nutshell  it is the total value of a company The other element of the ratio  EBITDA is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it eliminates the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more enticing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued   However  unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA considers the debt on a company s balance sheet  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates P E also can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms with a debt laden balance sheet and have a high degree of depreciation  It also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels However  EV EBITDA is not devoid of limitations and it alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and its future performance  It varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Hence  a strategy entirely based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired results  But you can combine it with other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen bargain stocks Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in

142532,364047,UNM,5 Best Value Picks Based On PEG Ratio,opinion,During the time of market volatility  investors often rely on value investing rather than other options like growth or momentum  As soon as other investors start selling their stocks at a cheaper rate  value investors take this as an opportunity to pick good stocks at a discounted price However  this apparently simple value investment technique has some drawbacks and not understanding the strategy properly may often lead to  value traps   In such a situation  these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems  which once drove the share price down  turn out to be persistent  There are many value investment yardsticks such as dividend yield  P E or P B  which are simple and can single out whether a stock is trading at a discount However  for investors looking to escape such value traps  it is also vital to determine where the stock is headed in the next 12 to 24 months  Warren Buffett advises these investors to focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock  This is where lies the importance of a not so popular value investing metric  the PEG ratio The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings   Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors While P E alone fails to identify a true value stock  PEG helps to find the intrinsic value of a stock Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate  followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  for more accurate valuation purpose Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks

optimism  suggesting further bullishness  Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer

142552,364067,UNM,5 Best Stocks With Solid Sales Growth Worth Investing,opinion,Sales growth is an important metric for any company  as it is a vital part of growth projections and contributes to strategic decision making  By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods  one can clearly understand a company s growth trend Sales growth is essential to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business  Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and negative financial results  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  but can t accelerate enough growth to attract new investors Also  in a growing economy  lack of sales growth most likely indicates that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors  In simple terms  some sustained sales growth is required to support the bottom line But focusing solely on sales growth is not enough  A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks  but it does not ensure profits  Hence  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Sufficient cash also enables a company to endure market downturns  Most importantly  a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening Based in Hunt Valley  MD  Sinclair Broadcast Group  Inc    NASDAQ SBGI   operates as a television

Stocks with Solid Sales Growth Worth Investing InSales growth is an important metric for any company  as it is a vital part of growth projections and contributes to strategic decision making  By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods  one can clearly understand a company s growth trend Sales growth is essential to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business  Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and negative financial results  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  but can t accelerate enough growth to attract new investors Also  in a growing economy  lack of sales growth most likely indicates that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors  In simple terms  some sustained sales growth is required to support the bottom line But focusing solely on sales growth is not enough  A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks  but it does not ensure profits  Hence  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Sufficient cash also enables a company to endure market downturns  Most importantly  a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening Based in Hunt Valley  MD  Sinclair Broadcast Group  Inc   Nasdaq       operates as a television broadcasting

Zacks Confidential  It may come as a bit of a surprise  but the individual merits of a particular company are NOT the leading driver of a stock s price  Instead  investors would be wise to look at the performance of a sector industry first and THEN find a company  In this week s Zacks Confidential  Steve has asked Eric Dutram to shine a light on a resource here at Zacks that you can use to find the hot industries  Learn about the most impressive market segments and the ones to avoid  along with a couple of recommendations by clicking  How to Use the Zacks Heat Map to Find Hot Sectors  Momentum Trader   Last week I ended by telling everyone it was time to short WW3  This week  the world got the message  No incendiary comments over the weekend  well at least not sent North Korea s way  and volatility finds the floor  Funny what happens when the NASDAQ hits the 50 day isn t it   The recent interaction with the 50 day should be viewed as healthy and not as the beginning of the end of the bull market  Moves like this help to shake out some of the excess and push the weak hands to the sidelines  We ve got some geopolitical risk and more specific risk to tech stocks which is putting the NASDAQ on its heels here  This is more settling than the alternative  If the NASDAQ were screaming up through highs and ignoring the risks  that would be a market which made me nervous   The short WW3 trade worked again  I promise you  there will only be one time when that trade doesn t work  Let s hope we never have to see it for the obvious reasons  The moral of the story here is that you are right in being cautious but don t let your caution price you into hysteria      Dave Bartosiak

142589,364104,UNM,Is Unum A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Unum Group   NYSE UNM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Unum has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 65  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 99  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Unum s current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months However  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the Zacks classified Insurance   Accident and Health sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 11 43  This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Unum has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 36  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Unum stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Unum has a P S ratio of about 0 96  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 20 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years    suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Unum currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Unum a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Unum is just 1 62  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 92  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 20  which also lower than the industry average of 9 40  Clearly  UNM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Unum might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  V   This gives UNM a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past thirty days compared  while the full year estimate has seen one up and two down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate remained stable in the past one month  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Unum Group Price and Consensus

142617,364132,UNM,5 Dividend Growth Stocks To Beat The Market,opinion,"An investment strategy based on dividend growth seems to be one of the best options in the current market environment  which is ruffled by the presidential election  the OPEC deal talks  and the possible rate hike by the Fed in December  This is because investors can enjoy rising current income while awaiting capital appreciation irrespective of market conditions Significance of Dividend GrowthStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth act as a hedge against any market downturn and economic or political turmoil because these belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model  a long track record of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields  All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term Further  a history of strong

Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  

Brexit to Delay Rate Hike  Stay Safe with Insurance Stocks

	Britain s unprecedented decision to leave the European Union  EU   the world s biggest trading block  has shaken the global financial markets  The result of the voting  which calls for U K  exiting the EU after being with it for more than four decades  saw the resignation of British Prime Minister David Cameron and sent indices all over the world crashing 
	The Brexit event has flagged political and economic chaos in Europe  The domino effect of it may hurt the already fragile world economy and the spillover effect across the pond can be in the form of reduced earnings for U S  companies with large exposure to the U K Will Brexit Put a Brake on Fed s Interest Rate Decision  
	One of the side effects of Brexit is that it will most likely delay the next interest rates hike by the Federal Reserve  The Brexit event caused the pound falling to its lowest level in 30 years and even Euro saw a decline against the U S  dollar  The uncertainty induced by Brexit and the strengthening dollar may compel the Federal Reserve to delay its plans to raise short term interest rates  A strong U S  dollar hurts exports and makes imports cheaper  thereby widening the trade deficit 

	Also  continued appreciation of the dollar can flare up global market volatility  Moreover  a strong dollar can prompt China to weaken its currency  yuan  as it had done before  Earlier  yuan weakness had caused global market volatility which held back the Fed from hiking rates 
	After a no show at the June meeting  it now looks highly unlikely that the interest rates will be moved northward in the subsequent meetings at least until it becomes clearer how events in Europe will affect the U S  economy  Fed policy makers  projection of four hikes in 2016 has been pushed off the board till the global financial markets settle down  Traders are even considering chances of an interest rate cut by the Fed but the possibility of it remains too low How Will Insurers Tackle Low Rates  
	Low interest rates affect earnings and liquidity of the insurers and hence pose a threat to the insurance industry  Since investment income forms an important revenue component of insurers  a low interest rate compresses yields which in turn lowers investment income  Looking at it the other way  since insurance companies hold a large percentage of bonds in their investment portfolio  low interest rates cause an appreciation in the value of invested bonds 

	Moreover  insurers have managed to guard themselves against low rates by asset liability matching  Also  a broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes have provided some cushion amid low rates  though the results are way below their historic highs
