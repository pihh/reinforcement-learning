Prepared Remarks 
OperatorLadies and gentlemen  welcome to the Cognizant Technology Solutions Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call   Operator Instructions And I will now turn the conference over to Katie Royce  Global Head of Investor Relations  Please go ahead  Katie Katie Royce    Global Head of Investor RelationsThank you  Rob  and good afternoon  everyone  By now  you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company s fourth quarter 2019 results  If you have not  a copy is available on our website  cognizant com  The speakers we have on today s call are Brian Humphries  Chief Executive Officer  and Karen McLoughlin  Chief Financial Officer Before we begin  I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward looking statements  These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company s earnings release and other filings with the SEC  Additionally  during our call today  we will reference certain non GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors  Reconciliations of non GAAP financial measures  where appropriate  to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company s earnings release and other filings with the SEC With that  I d now like to turn this call over to Brian Humphries  Please go ahead  Brian Brian Humphries    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Katie  Good afternoon  everybody  As I stated on prior calls  Cognizant is in the midst of a multiyear project whose aim is to reposition the company to realize its full growth potential  And today  I d like to briefly cover our Q4 performance and then turn our attention to 2020  After a challenging start to 2019  we re seeing higher levels of engagement from our leaders and optimism as we rally behind client centricity and revenue growth  We re making progress  but there s more work to do in the quarters ahead  Q4 revenue grew 4 2  year over year in constant currency with  4 28 billion  Non GAAP EPS was  1 07  and we delivered strong cash flow  Macro demand remained stable but challenging  There is a distinction between traditional work versus digital  Legacy services are subject to meaningful pricing pressure at renewals  competition and  indeed  in sourcing  Meanwhile  clients continue to invest in digital to become modern  data enabled  customer centric and differentiated businesses  These trends are set to continue through our strategic posture  and operational and financial initiatives are aligned to address this market reality On the geographic basis Q4 revenue in North America grew 3 1  year over year  While revenue in a growth markets region grew 7 4  in costs and currency  In both geographies we are determined to accelerate growth  But the opportunity is especially significant in our international business  We remain under penetrated and we must do better  From an industry segments view  Q4 Financial Services global revenue grew 1 5  year over year in constant currency  Both banking and insurance were weak throughout 2019  Full year insurance revenue growth slowed primarily due to a modest decline in North America  albeit with a return in the second half of the year where we saw growth in Q3 and indeed Q4 year over year  In banking  we continued to see particular weakness in capital markets and commercial banking  offset by growth in payments and retail  with retail having benefited from the Samlink deal Both global accounts and local accounts declined for the full year  North America performance  while still declining  has been improving throughout the year  and we see that trend continuing  Europe remains weak with some macro uncertainty and some Cognizant specific issues  In Healthcare  we reversed two quarters of decline with constant currency growth of 1 8  year over year  I remain pleased with our performance in life sciences  which delivered double digit growth  However  this was offset by ongoing declines in our healthcare vertical  which continues to be impacted by contract renegotiations at some of our largest clients  following industry consolidation and by in sourcing at a large client  Our other two segments  Products and Resources and Communications  Media and Technology  posted high single digit revenue growth in constant currency year over year  down from double digits in prior quarters Revenue growth in the technology segment slowed meaningfully in the quarter  following our recent announcement to exit a subset of the content services business over the coming quarters  Later in our call  Karen will take you through the details of the quarter  Let s now turn to 2020  including executing the recommendations of the transformation office as they relate to strategy  operating and commercial models  our cost base and more  We enter 2020 with a two pronged strategy that aims to expose Cognizant to faster growing market categories  The first element is to protect and optimize our core business while scaling internationally  The second part is to invest to compete and win in four key digital battlegrounds  data  digital engineering  cloud and IoT  Our strategy leverages our technology services heritage while accelerating our position in digital where our brand recognition and commercial momentum can improve This strategy resonates well with our clients who ve always cited our strength in the run and operations side  who want us to further strengthen our digital portfolio to assist them in their innovation agenda  We re determined to help our clients become fully digital  data enabled  customer centric businesses  We will continue to use M A to execute this strategy  This week  we announced two acquisitions focused on expanding our cloud capabilities  On Monday  we announced the acquisition of Code Zero Consulting  a firm that specializes in helping companies digitally transform by providing strategy  implementation and migration capabilities to evolve legacy systems to cloud based  configure price quote and billing system  And earlier today  we announced that we ve entered into exclusive negotiations to acquire the French operations of EI Technologies  a Paris based  privately held digital technology consulting firm  Cloud has changed the way that IT is delivered across infrastructure applications and platforms Both of these acquisitions are Salesforce Platinum partners and will help us build upon one of our most strategic and fastest growing practices  In addition  in Q4  we closed our previously announced acquisition of Contino  a leading consultancy that specializes in enterprise DevOps methodologies and advanced data platforms  The transformation office also recommended changes to our operating and commercial model  After months of detailed analysis  on January 1  we implemented a series of measures to accelerate our commercial momentum as part of our sales transformation initiative  These include  a new customer segmentation that prioritizes account and ensures we get the right resources on the right accounts at the right time  new sales compensation plans that reward overperformance encourage greater upsell and cross sell in our existing accounts and increase our focus on new logos and the alignment of our specialist sales teams to our service line to increase our subject matter expertise by key practices To date  I m pleased with what we ve seen in our sales force initiative  We have renewed energy  and our win rates continue to improve  Our previously announced hiring of 500 revenue generating associates is on track and in line with modeled assumptions  In addition to these 500  we plan to double the number of associates supporting our most strategic alliances with all three leading hyperscale companies and SaaS vendors  Complementing these commercial changes  our recently appointed Chief Marketing Officer has been working diligently to better align our marketing spend to a growth priority  This includes strengthening our point of view by industry segment  improving targeting via account based marketing and digitizing our customer engagement strategy  Our marketing spend will increase in 2020 as we aim to support our revenue aspiration and better position Cognizant as a leader in digital  In parallel  we ve also worked to simplify the organization  empowering our client partners for speed of execution and account P L ownership and clarifying responsibilities and decision rights for all roles across the sales life cycle To ensure we have the right digital skills in a supply constrained environment  we ve doubled our investments in Cognizant Academy in 2020 to reskill and redeploy talent toward our digital imperative  To accelerate our digital momentum  we believe we need to hire or reskill approximately 25 000 resources in 2020 alone  and we started to operationalize this  Finally  as we make these investments in automation  training  marketing and sales  we ve been diligently reducing our cost structure to ensure we can be fit for growth  Karen will bring you through the details of our restructuring program later in the call  Engagement and confidence are essential in a people business  Therefore  we ve been energetically communicating and contextualizing the reasons for the changes we re going through and engaging the organization to rally everyone behind our goal  I m pleased to see the mood in the company continue to pick up  both at an executive level and throughout the broader organization Our annualized attrition rate fell three points sequentially to 21   Some of this can be accounted for by normal seasonality  so the fact that voluntary attrition rates declined year over year is actually even more encouraging  Of course  as we execute our restructuring program  we will remain diligent and stay focused on increasing employee engagement and reducing attrition  We also recognize that we need to rally the organization behind a common purpose that goes beyond financial returns  We ve therefore spent a great deal of time in recent months defining a compelling company purpose statement  which will serve as our north star that guides and inspires us to make the right strategic move in the years ahead  We ve also refined our company s values and behaviors that define what will be celebrated and tolerated  We will unveil this to the broader organization in the coming months  We re determined to stay true to the heart and soul of our company And having recently attended our annual global planning summit  one held in Dallas  the other in Dubai  where the executive team and I spoke to thousands of associates around the company s strategy and expectations for 2020  I can tell you that I came away from these summits filled with optimism about our collective ability to move the company forward  Let me conclude by saying that after a challenging first quarter  we ve become a more focused  determined and confident company as we move through 2019  There s a great deal of urgency in Cognizant these days  It starts with me  Any distractions we ve had are now behind us  Our team is energized by the clarity of our strategy  the magnitude of the market opportunity  our renewed client centricity and our increased employee value proposition focus  While our hard work in the past year will serve us well in 2020  there remains some important areas that require progress in the years ahead Pricing in our heritage business continues to pressure gross margin  We have efforts under way to address renewal pricing strategy as well as our cost of delivery efficiency  including pyramid management  automation and other measures  Meanwhile  as more work shifts to project based digital engagements  we are implementing refinements in our digital pricing strategy and continuing to optimize resource planning and allocation  The leadership team and I are fully aware that we have a multiyear project ahead of us  and we are united in our resolve to work with rigor and tenacity to achieve our goals and once again make Cognizant the industry bellwether  Before I turn the call over to Karen  I want to acknowledge a Cognizant co founder  former CEO and longtime director Frank D Souza had let us know of his plan to resign from Cognizant Board of Directors effective March 31  Along with his remarkable track record of success as Cognizant s CEO for a dozen years  Frank has served with distinction on Cognizant s Board since 2007 and Vice Chairman since June 30  2019  On behalf of the entire Board  I want to extend our deep gratitude to Frank for his pioneering leadership and quarter century of dedication to Cognizant  Today  we also announced that Vinita Bali will be joining our Board of Directors later this month  I look forward to her contributions and partnership And with that  I ll turn the call over to Karen who will give you an update on our operational and financial performance as well as a view of how we see the year ahead  Karen Karen McLoughlin    Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Brian  and good afternoon  everyone  For the full year 2019  revenue increased to  16 8 billion and represented growth of 4 1  year over year or 5 2  in constant currency  Fourth quarter revenue of  4 3 billion was above the high end of our guided range and represented growth of 3 8  year over year or 4 2  in constant currency  The revenue outperformance versus guidance was broad based across our industry  Digital revenue continues to grow above 20  year over year and represented approximately 38  of total revenues for the quarter  Moving to the industry vertical  Financial Services growth was up 1 5  year over year in constant currency driven primarily by insurance  However  the project based work that we benefited from in Q3 did not extend into Q4  We saw a modest slowdown in banking sequentially  reflecting typical year end seasonality and furloughs As Brian mentioned  within banking  our performance continues to be negatively impacted by a few of our global accounts as well as some slowness in certain regional and other clients  While macro uncertainty persists  we expect budgets within banking to be broadly stable in 2020  with North America banks better positioned relative to the U K  and Continental Europe given continued Brexit uncertainty and our ongoing challenges with a few of our largest accounts  Against that backdrop  we continue to have a muted outlook for banking  However  we are confident in the initial steps our new head of banking has taken to reposition us for growth  We expect his client s entrance centricity to drive deeper and more robust account planning and marketing  I partnering well with digital business to ensure we increase our relevance to banks  He has also implemented a solutions team to bring ease of repeatability ensure we develop more compelling thought leadership and better align with key partners Moving on to Healthcare  which returned to year over year growth  up 1 8  in constant currency  Life sciences again grew strong double digits year over year  benefiting from demand within digital operations and the contribution of Zenith Technologies  Additionally  we see continued momentum within our industry specific platform solutions  such as the shared investigator portal for clinical trials  which has users in over 80 countries across 14 000 facilities  covering over 400 active trials  Within our Healthcare vertical  revenue declined mid single digits year over year as performance continues to be impacted primarily by large clients involved in mergers and the continued shift of work through a captive at a large client  We expect similar year over year trends in Healthcare in Q1 and improvement in the year over year trends in the Healthcare vertical beginning in Q2 as we lap the headwinds that impacted the business in 2019 We expect continued cautious spend with healthcare payers as we approach the elections in the U S  later this year and so are maintaining a cautious growth outlook for the healthcare vertical  Products and resources grew 8 6  year over year in constant currency  As we mentioned on our last earnings call  we expected slower growth on a year over year basis in products and resources in the fourth quarter as we locked the ramp up of work with new logos and the contribution of acquisitions made in Q4 2018  We were pleased that the growth in the quarter continued to be broad based growth across our industries  Results reflect demand for core modernization services of enterprise applications and for digital engineering  cloud and IoT solutions  and we expect these trends to continue in 2020  Our Communications  Media and Technology segment grew 9  year over year in constant currency where we saw an acceleration in the communications and media vertical driven by an increase in demand for services in core modernization and cloud transformation services  We expect continued solid performance of telecom clients as traditional telco companies look to transform into digital service providers Additionally  we see convergence across media and communications companies  driving investments in technologies and services that hyper personalize consumption and create new and engaging experiences for consumers  In technology  growth was negatively impacted by our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business  This negatively impacted the year over year growth of the CMT segment by approximately 200 basis points or  11 million  I ll provide more color on the expected impact from our decision to exit certain parts of the content services business with my Q1 and full year 2020 guidance  Now turning to geos  We were disappointed with growth in Europe  which grew 5 3  year over year in constant currency  reflecting a slowdown in both the U K  and Continental Europe  A more cautious macro environment continues to weigh on spend across industries in the U K   while we also have some Cognizant specific challenges in a few large banking clients The rest of world grew 14 5  year over year in constant currency  the strongest performance in seven quarters  While our global banking relationships continue to pressure growth in Asia Pacific  we have seen improved traction in countries  such as Australia and Japan  in insurance and life sciences  Moving on to margins  In Q4  our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 14 6  and  0 72  respectively  Adjusted operating margin  which excludes restructuring charges  was 17   and our adjusted diluted EPS was  1 07  Before getting into more details on margins  I want to provide an update on the enactment of a new tax regime in India that enables domestic companies to elect to be taxed with an income tax rate of 25  compared to the current rate of 35   A company electing into the lower rate is required to forgo any tax holidays associated with the special economic zones and certain other tax incentives  including MAT credit carryforward  Our current intent is to elect into the lower rate once our existing MAT assets are substantially utilized As a result  we recorded a onetime net income tax expense of  21 million due to the revaluations to the lower income tax rate of our existing India net deferred income tax asset  This had a negative  0 04 impact on GAAP EPS in the quarter  Our adjusted operating margin was flat year over year  reflecting SG A discipline offset by continued pressure on gross margins  including a  25 million write off of certain capitalized setup costs for a large healthcare customer  The write off negatively impacted gross margins by 50 basis points and EPS by  0 04  Over the last several quarters  we have taken steps to start to rightsize our cost structure primarily focused on reducing overheads in the business  with those benefits evident in the year over year improvement in SG A  These savings are necessary to fund the planned additional investments in areas such as sales resources  branding  talent and lean and automation enhancements across the company However  gross margin declined year over year as we continued to face pricing pressure in the legacy parts of our business that require us to take additional actions in 2020 around pyramid optimization and pricing levers  such as COLA and aligning bill rates with promotions  We expect our 2020 Fit for Growth plan that we announced last quarter to drive improvements in these areas  I ll provide an update on the actions taken in Q4 under the 2020 Fit for Growth plan as well as additional details on the expected execution of this plan later in the call  Turning to our balance sheet  Our cash and short term investment balance as of December 31 stood at  3 4 billion  up approximately  350 million from September 30 but down  1 1 billion from the year ago period  reflecting the over  2 2 billion of share repurchases completed in 2019 and approximately  620 million deployed on acquisitions  As a reminder  our short term investment balance includes restricted short term investments of  414 million related to the ongoing dispute with the India income tax department  We generated  845 million of free cash flow in the quarter A DSO of 73 days improved three days sequentially due to strong collections  On a year over year basis  DSO improved by one day  In the fourth quarter  we made a change to our accounting policy related to DSOs to better align with industry practice and better reflect amounts due from our customers on our balance sheet  Beginning in Q4  we started to net certain amounts due to customers  such as discounts and rebates  with trade accounts receivables rather than reflecting those amounts as a liability on our balance sheet  This change does not have any impact on our operating results or cash flows  Our outstanding debt balance was  738 million at the end of the quarter  and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver  During the fourth quarter  we opportunistically repurchased approximately 2 5 million shares for approximately  150 million  and our diluted share count decreased to 548 million shares for the quarter  In 2019  we repurchased over 34 million shares for approximately  2 2 billion Today  we are announcing a 10  increase to our quarterly cash dividend  the second increase since we initiated the dividend in 2017  Additionally  the Board has approved a  2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization  Before I turn to guidance  let me provide an update on the progress of the 2020 Fit for Growth plan as well as the content work that we re in the process of exiting  Our 2020 Fit for Growth plan is expected to run for two years  This program is designed to simplify the way we work  improve our cost structure and fund investments aimed at accelerating our revenue growth  As previously announced  we expect to remove 10 000 to 12 000 mid  to senior level associates from their current roles  We will make every effort to identify productive roles based on client demand and continue to assume that approximately 5 000 associates will have the opportunity to reskill for new roles within the company In Q4  we incurred  48 million of charges  including  42 million of severance charges as part of the Fit for Growth plan  These charges relate to approximately 550 associates  most of whom we expect will exit the company by the end of Q1 and we expect will result in a cash impact of approximately  40 million in the first quarter with full run rate savings not achieved until Q2 for these associates  We continue to expect the majority of the remaining associates to exit the company by mid 2020  We are managing this process carefully as any time we make decisions that impact our employees  we take it very seriously  Additionally  we continue to review our real estate portfolio as part of the Fit for Growth plan and expect to take further actions related to real estate rationalization in 2020  These actions are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2020 and are expected to result in 2020 in year gross savings of over  450 million and annualized gross run rate savings of  500 million to  550 million in the year 2021 Additionally  in the fourth quarter  we began the exit of a subset of our content services business  Approximately  5 million of the  48 million Fit for Growth charges in the quarter related to retention and severance for approximately 1 100 of the expected 5 000 to 6 000 total associates to be impacted by the wind down of this work  We have updated our estimate of the number of associates to be impacted by the wind down from 6 000 to a range of 5 000 to 6 000 as we expect to retain more work with these clients in other content and technology services than originally estimated  We now estimate that we may lose revenues of  225 million to  255 million  down from our previous estimate of  240 million to  270 million on an annualized basis within our Communications  Media and Technology segment  We continue to anticipate revenues will ramp down over the next one to two years with an expected impact of  20 million to  25 million of revenue in Q1 on a year over year basis This is expected to be modestly dilutive to our adjusted operating margin rate  subject to the timing of the ramp down and other factors  We also continue to expect to incur wind down charges related to the transition of these associates and any related assets such as real estate and equipment  We are working with our partners to transition this work while continuing to meet our contractual obligations and providing impacted associates with a number of transition assistance programs  including retention bonuses  severance packages and the opportunity to participate in various reskilling programs  At the time of our Q4 earnings call  we provided an estimate of  150 million to  200 million in total expected charges associated with this Fit for Growth cost transformation plan  including the wind down of certain content work Based on our actions to date  attrition at the senior levels of the pyramid being slightly higher than our expectations and less impact from the exit of certain content services  we now expect to be toward the low end of that range while maintaining the annualized gross savings estimate of  500 million to  550 million  Before turning to guidance  I want to comment on a potential change in the dividend distribution tax that was announced as part of the India budget a few days ago  We are currently analyzing this proposal but believe it can  once enacted  significantly lower the cost of repatriating funds back to the U S  The proposal is not yet law  but the expected date is April 1  2020  I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and the full year 2020  For the full year 2020  we expect revenue to grow in the range of 2  to 4  year over year to  17 11 billion to  17 45 billion on a reported and constant currency basis as  based on the current exchange rates  we are not expecting a material impact from foreign exchange This includes our estimate of a negative impact of approximately 110 basis points to year over year growth from our decision to exit certain content work within our CMT segment  This guidance continues to reflect a muted outlook for Financial Services and Healthcare  We expect first quarter revenue growth in the range of 2 5  to 3 5  year over year to  4 21 billion to  4 25 billion on a reported basis  Based on current exchange rates  this translates to constant currency growth in the range of 2 8  to 3 8  year over year or  4 23 billion to  4 27 billion  reflecting our assumption of a negative 30 basis points for foreign exchange for the first quarter  This includes our estimate of a negative impact of approximately 60 basis points to year over year growth from our decision to exit certain work within the content services business  which will be reflected in the CMT segment  Revenue guidance for both Q1 and the full year assumes a cautious macro outlook in the U K   continued slow growth in Financial Services and Healthcare as well as the previously mentioned impact of exiting certain content work For the full year 2020  we expect adjusted operating margins to be between 16  and 17   which assumes incentive compensation to be a target payout  We expect Q1 margins to be slightly below the low end of the range as we are investing in sales hiring  training  tooling and automation and marketing and branding  while the timing of the savings from the actions taken under our Fit for Growth Plan and the return on our sales investments will not have reached the full quarter run rate  As a reminder  our full year 2019 margin rate reflects lower incentive compensation payout given our underperformance versus target  Our guidance assumes that in 2020  we ll perform as planned  and therefore  incentive compensations will reflect target payout rate  This is a margin rate headwind of approximately 120 basis points year over year that we plan to absorb  The midpoint of our 2020 margin guidance of 16  to 17  therefore reflects approximately 100 basis points of improvement over the 2019 margin normalized for incentive compensation We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of  3 97 to  4 13  Our EPS guidance anticipates a year over year decrease of approximately  30 million in interest income  reflecting a lower cash balance and reduced interest rate in both the U S  and India  This is expected to impact EPS by approximately  0 04  This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 548 million shares and a tax rate in the range of 24  to 26   Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes restructuring charges and other unusual items  if any  net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses  clarification  if any  by the Indian government as to the application of the Supreme Court ruling related to the India defined contribution obligation  and the tax effects of the above adjustments  Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes such as immigration or tax policies With that  operator  we can open the call for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And our first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank  Please proceed with your question Bryan Keane    Deutsche Bank    AnalystHi guys  I want to ask about the cadence of revenue growth in 2020  It looks like you guided    1Q  20 revenue guidance  3  to 4  constant currency  Full year fiscal year  20 growth is pretty similar at 2  to 4  constant currency  So is Cognizant expecting kind of steady revenue growth with no fluctuations  Or do you expect maybe a little bit of a drop in the middle of the year and a pickup in the fourth quarter  I guess another way to ask this is  do you see an inflection point in revenue growth on the horizon Karen McLoughlin    Chief Financial OfficerBryan  it s Karen  So the one thing I would say is nothing particularly unusual  There s no large deals  There s no    nothing unusual right now from a seasonality perspective  So I think it will be relatively a typical seasonality that will start to ramp as we get into Q2 and then Q3  The one thing I would say where the back half might be a little bit stronger is because of the sales investments that we re making now  right  So we launched that hiring program late last year  Those folks are coming onboard as we expected  And certainly  while we said we would expect to take about a year for them to start to ramp  but we should start to see a little bit of that benefit as we get into the back part of the year Brian Humphries    Chief Executive OfficerYes  And maybe the addition I d make to that  Karen  is obviously the content moderation ramp down will offset that somewhat as it grows throughout the course of the year OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi  Please proceed with your question Ashwin Shirvaikar    Citi    AnalystThank you  Hi  Brian  I can appreciate the detailed commentary  Brian  I was hoping you could give more information about the sales force transformation  Where do you stand on hiring  You mentioned the words on track but a little bit more color on what on track means would be great  And on the flip side  is there perhaps any heightened attrition you expect to see for the traditional sales force that was already there given maybe the new compensation schemes or any changes there  So a sales force update Brian Humphries    Chief Executive OfficerIt s very interesting because  as I said  we were at our global planning summit in the last month or so  and the sales force are actually very motivated by the compensation changes because they can actually make more money than they could in prior periods  So actually  on the contrary  I actually feel there s a great deal of optimism in the sales force  People are    when a CEO visits clients every single day  it leads to a certain cultural demand in the organization  And I think people are motivated to get the company back to an accelerated growth rate  so I feel good about where we are  I m not overly concerned about attrition in the legacy sales teams  We ve had great luck  I would say  fulfilling the pipeline of opportunities  We don t break out on a quarterly basis where we are versus that hiring  We re less than halfway through the 500  I will tell you that  but there s a lot of work still to do  But I track it on a monthly basis at the Executive Committee  and we re pretty much in line with what we anticipated in terms of cost  I ve also been keeping an eye not just on the accounts that these folks are assigned to but also the pipeline that they are building And in some cases  I ve been pleasantly surprised that the early pipeline builds have even been ahead of my expectations  So look  more work to do to continue to review that  but there s a lot of energy and urgency in Cognizant these days  And I think we re all very clear on what we re setting out to achieve  and I feel very good in terms of where we are to date  So the broader sales force update is consistent with what I said last quarter  that s not going to change  We ve implemented a RAD model  which is retention  acquisition and development  That s all about trying to get the right folks on the right accounts at the right time  aligning specialist resources  which are  by practice  such as big data or cloud  with a generalist client partner  The client partner is the quarterback on the accounts  They have decision rights  They own the P L for the accounts  They can move with speed and accountability within the framework of authority that we have delegated to them  and they are complemented by subject matter experts  solution architects and the like  We implemented that model on January 1  So far  so good  And we ve obviously got to continue to push that in the course of the year ahead  but I feel good about where we are OperatorThank you  Our next question is from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson  Please proceed with your question Lisa Ellis    MoffettNathanson    AnalystHi  good afternoon  guys  Hey  Brian  one of the things you mentioned was that you re doubling the number of people supporting Cognizant s major strategic alliances  And I know that that is also somewhere where you have been spending your own time as well  Can you just provide a little bit more richness on where you re focused there  where maybe Cognizant is already strong  where you think there s opportunity to improve and how that sort of fits into the overall updated strategy and Fit for Growth Plan Brian Humphries    Chief Executive OfficerYes  I will  And look  we have  Lisa  some really strong alliance partners and partnerships by key verticals  whether that s Temenos in Financial Services  Pega  Adobe or otherwise  But I ve really spent a huge amount of time in the last nine months trying to build that and foster a business plan behind Amazon  behind Microsoft  We re now working through Google Cloud practice as the hyperscale players  and it is really selectively aligning Cognizant to some of the leading SaaS type players  as an example  such as Salesforce or ServiceNow or  indeed  Workday to make sure that we go to market with the companies that are going 20   30   40  year over year  Not to say we won t continue to obviously partner with others  but we are putting    allocating even more capital to the winners in today s environment  That invariably means for us  just to be very clear  it doesn t mean hiring more alliance partners and having a bunch of coffee drinkers sitting around  feeling good about hosting meetings  This is a lot about building our business plans with solution architects and big data experts and the like aligned to each and every one of those companies I ve talked about It involves putting an operational cadence together on a rolling 4 quarter basis  So I know in a certain date  I ll be sitting in a room with the CEO of that company  reviewing not just what we re setting out to achieve as a company  which has our targets against it  which are intersected by country and vertical  but also looking at the pipeline shape  where we are in the funnel and really operationalizing that strategic alliance vision into day to day reality  which includes joint customer calls  joint in person visits to clients with the leadership of those companies  joint emails to clients or letters to clients and the like  So it s strategic  But to be very clear  it s also very operationally inclined and pragmatic with a view to successfully driving activity or cadence going forward with these clients and partners and making sure we show up better than we ever have in the past OperatorThank you  Our next question is from the line of Tien tsin Huang with JPMorgan  Please proceed with your question Tien tsin Huang    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  thanks a lot  everything looks  in mind  a little bit different  I know you mentioned  Karen  the 50 bps or the  25 million Healthcare writedown  Can you maybe quantify some of the pricing pressure you re seeing coming from the heritage work or anything else on delivery costs that might have surprised you  I know the Fit for Growth piece is coming in  too  so just overall  trying to get some more color on the quarter and then maybe how the year is going to play out here in 2020 for gross margin Karen McLoughlin    Chief Financial OfficerI don t think    in the quarter  Tien tsin  I wouldn t say there was any real change in pricing trends  But as we talked about on the prepared comments  we certainly are continuing to see pressure on renewals in the heritage or legacy IT side of the business  Right now  that s being offset by higher pricing on the digital side of the business  And    but certainly  we think we can do better on pricing in digital services and really make sure that we are pricing to the market and for the value that we are providing to clients  So that is certainly an initiative we have under way as well as do a far better job on things like COLA and getting adjusted bill rates when people are being promoted or rotating our staff to take effect of a more optimal pyramid Certainly  the savings that we ve seen so far has been primarily in the SG A bucket as we ve been focused on the top end of the pyramid  most of which was down in SG A  But as we move into Q1 and Q2 and further into the Fit for Growth program  we would certainly expect to see improvements in the middle to upper middle of the pyramid as well and also be able to drive improvement in some of these revenue levers  which will hopefully start to stabilize gross margin OperatorOur next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo  Please proceed with your question Edward Caso    Wells Fargo    AnalystGreat  Thanks  Brian  is your team now in place  I know you had one of your execs cycle out not that long ago  But do you have the people that you need down a level or two at this point to drive the transformation Brian Humphries    Chief Executive OfficerLook  I m a big believer  Ed  that A players attract A players  And the more we upskill and make sure we have the right team around me  those people  in turn  will make sure that they replicate that trend through the organization  I will say we have gems in Cognizant  really  really strong leaders  I talked about life sciences growing double digits  That s an internal promotion that happened in the last year  So it s always going to be a combination of complementing excellent internal talent with excellent additions from the outside and putting a system of meritocracy and a performance culture in place where everybody knows what we celebrate and what we condone versus what we don t tolerate  So of course  in the years ahead  there will always be refinements  I want to drive a performance culture  but we re getting there  But of course  there will be even  in the foreseeable future  ongoing refinements as we continue to attract better people from the outside to complement the internal talent I will say one thing that s very pleasing to me  There s no shortage of people reaching out to Cognizant at this moment in time  feeling both from clients and otherwise that there s a new vigor in the company  a new urgency in the company and a confidence that we can get back to being the great company that we have been in the past  So it s very encouraging to me to know that we can still attract great talent from the outside  And in the same vein  with a new Chief People Officer  Becky Schmitt  who joined this Monday  who almost spent two decades in Accenture and most recently had been in Walmart  we have a very strong people agenda program lined up in the coming years to attract  motivate  develop  retain and put very sophisticated talent management programs in place internally  And I believe that that will not just make us a very appealing place to come and develop your career  but it will also have intrinsically a direct impact on our attrition rate which  as I said in the call  I m pleased with  but we can always do better OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal  Please proceed with your question Keith Bachman    Bank of Montreal    AnalystHi  excuse me  Hi  Thank you very much  Karen  just for clarification  could you tease out the guidance from a revenue perspective in terms of isolating what M A contribution is expected to be  And particularly  the M A contribution  does that include some of the recent    very  very recent deals  And then  Brian  for you  if you could just revisit on Healthcare and how we should be thinking about Healthcare cadence  both this year and  frankly  exiting this year  As the deals anniversary in earnest in the June quarter  in particular  has the price activities of the M A client  will that    has that already played out  Or would that continue to play out for the year  But just more broadly  talk a little bit about Healthcare  both this year and kind of exiting the year  and how you see the opportunity there for Cognizant Brian Humphries    Chief Executive OfficerWell  I ll start with the Healthcare question  Keith  because actually ironically  I ve been on the phone with the leadership team of  as it happens  both of those combined companies as recently as this morning  so I m pretty current in terms of where we are in the accounts and  indeed  the opportunity  And I will say I continue to be pleased that we show up a little bit better than we have  and those executives and companies reassured me that the merger integration work is still there  And as they think about consolidating to preferred vendors  we are firmly and squarely in the go forward strategy as well  So I do feel there s lots of opportunity for us even in those larger accounts where we ve seen consolidation from four to two in the last year  and we have seen some pressure on rates as part of that  But we do want to get back  once we anniversary that  into a stronger growth trajectory in Healthcare  In the same vein  I just want to caution the amount of work that needs to be done We ve also had our Healthcare team today here in New York  about 20 people in the room reviewing last year  reviewing revenue pipeline  win rate  margin trends  a very strong call to action in terms of what we need to do in the coming years  So we re not out of the other side on that yet  but I choose to be glass half full here in terms of a lot of the actions we are doing are not specific to one vertical  Better aligning marketing spend  making sure we have the right customer segmentation strategy in place  upskilling our client partners  making sure we have the best specialists in the world to complement them  going to market with some of the hyperscale players in Financial Services or Healthcare  etc   etc   that will bear fruits in each and every one of our industries  Healthcare included  We do expect still some  I would say  modest    we still have modest expectations for Healthcare in the coming year  But as we go through the course of the year  I d like to think that we ll start to make some progress Karen McLoughlin    Chief Financial OfficerAnd Keith  it s Karen  Let me just comment on the guidance  So for the first quarter  there s about 120 basis points of inorganic revenue baked into the guidance  That includes only the transactions that have already been completed  so that would include Code Zero but not the EI Technologies transaction as that has not closed yet  And then on a full year basis  the guidance  similarly only for deals closed  is about 100 basis points of revenue growth year over year  And that s down from    if you recall in 2019  the impact was about 200 basis points OperatorThank you  Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity  Please proceed with your question Rod Bourgeois    DeepDive Equity    AnalystYes  Hey there  So on the last earnings call  you talked about a set of growth investments that would cost you about 150 basis points on margin  So I m just looking at the further needs to build into the digital era  And besides the growth investments you ve already articulated  are there additional growth related investments that you d like to start making in 2020 such that if you had more room in your margin plan  are there additional investments that you would like to make besides the ones you ve talked about Brian Humphries    Chief Executive OfficerRob  it s Brian  So listen  the way I think about it  this year  if you normalize for  let s say  target bonuses  as Karen has articulated in this call and prior calls  margins would have been in roughly mid 15   We ve guided 16  to 17  for next year  So call the midpoint  16 5   So    and we re assuming  by the way  next year that our bonus structure is a normalized part of our cost base  So hence  organically  if you will  100 basis points of margin improvement year over year  Now to your point  we ve made reference before of  250 million plus of investment back into the business  A lot of that  we call that explicitly like 500 head count related just to revenue generation  We re doing more on sales and marketing  We re doing more in training  etc   That s approximately 1 5 points  So had we not done that  margins naturally would have been higher  But I m not here to try to operationalize Cognizant from  17 billion to  20 billion  We re trying to make this a  25 billion   30 billion   35 billion company in the years ahead  And as part of that  I think it s always wrong to look at one element on a continuum and shine a spotlight there and think  well  Brian  had you not made those investments  could you deliver a higher margin rate And Rod  I ve known your investment thesis on the stock  I certainly know that s not your intent either behind your question  What I want to do is continue to reinvest into the business  So if we can prove a strong return in these investments we re making  including the sales force hiring  and we get win rates higher  if we get a good pipeline that we convert to TCV and revenue  my inclination will be to continue to deliver and apply more of the upside back into the business and get us back into the Cognizant that was tried and tested for many  many years that made this company a great success story over the years  So that s the intention that we re setting out to deliver here in the next five to 10 years  I m confident we re doing the right thing  I will tell you I m really pleased  and I spend a lot of my time with clients and partners  Our strategy is resonating  They see the renewed energy in the company  We have lots of work to do  but I m very pleased and optimistic with the progress we re making and know  nonetheless  that we still have more work to do in the year ahead OperatorOur next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America  Please proceed with your question Jason Kupferberg    Bank of America    AnalystHey  thanks  Thanks  guys Just a two pronged question on M A  First  I know that EI Technologies  you just said  is not in the guide at this point  But assuming that that closes in line with the timing you re expecting  roughly how much revenue would that add this year  And then can you just comment more broadly on your M A strategy  It feels like the frequency and intensity of M A is picking up a little bit  Brian  under your watch over the past year  Is that an accurate assessment in terms of where you intend to take that strategy as well  Obviously  these kind of tuck in  sized digital assets really stand out Brian Humphries    Chief Executive OfficerYes  So listen  a good question  I wouldn t say to date that the frequency has picked up that much  February 6 last year  I was announced as the new CEO  So I started on April 1  And since then  we ve done  until this week  two acquisitions  Contino and then  prior to that  Zenith Technologies  It just so happens that we were diligently working to review our strategy and finalize that  And only with that behind is that we absolutely go    now let s go and put our balance sheet behind us to make sure we position ourselves strongly behind our strategic intent  And as I said earlier  that s a lot about protecting and optimizing the core  including scaling internationally  but it s also about winning in e digital battleground  And both acquisitions we made this week are firmly behind the cloud ambition that we have  and you ll see more of the same on a go forward basis behind each and every one of those digital battlegrounds  To be very clear  I view M A as a means to an end to achieve the strategy While I m pleased with the  2 2 billion we ve spent on share repurchases last year  you will see an absolute conviction to returning capital to shareholders in the form of periodic dividend increases as well as share repurchases with a particular eye to offset dilution  But also potentially opportunistic  I will say that you will see us err more toward accelerating M A on a go forward basis as long as it is supportive of the overall company strategy  Share repurchases  while having value  do not reposition the company against the strategic intent  M A can enable us to do that  So with almost a year behind me under my belt here in Cognizant  getting my head around the company  the industry better  the operational rigor and control we have  with the team around me  we re absolutely inclined to accelerate M A a little more in the years ahead and make sure we use that as a means to accomplish our overall company strategy With regards to the details of EI Technologies  look  we ve entered into exclusive negotiations  Deal s not closed  It is material for France but is absolutely immaterial from a company perspective in terms of the dollar addition  So it s basis points in terms of growth as opposed to anything else  But as I said  that plus Code Zero is firmly behind our Salesforce ambition  And we ve been spending a lot of time  I personally have met with Salesforce CEO  I think  probably now 5 times in nine months  and these are very symbolic moves to make sure that we strengthen our capabilities behind the Salesforce practice that we re building out OperatorThank you  We have time for one final question today  which will be coming from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities  Please proceed with your question Moshe Katri    Wedbush Securities    AnalystHey  thanks for taking my question  Brian  you spoke about the need to potentially accelerate growth in international where you feel that the company is underpenetrated  Can you talk a bit about what sort of actions you re taking to kind of get there  Maybe some color there  that will be helpful  Thanks Brian Humphries    Chief Executive OfficerYes  it ultimately takes three portions  one is organic investments  one is partnership and another one is M A  To be very clear  Zenith Technologies  which was at the intersection point of life sciences as one of our really strategic verticals as well as IoT was a perfect illustration of hitting many birds with one stone  geographic expansion strengthening European footprint  aligning through our IoT digital priority and aligning to one of our strategic verticals  We also announced and closed Contino  which has got a very strong international footprint in the form of DevOps and data in Q4  So those are good illustrations  And of course  EI Technologies that we announced earlier today will be another good illustration of strengthening our footprint in Europe  in this case  in France  Organically  of course  we re strengthening our capabilities by building out more footprint and supporting that footprint with better allocation of resources globally  As an example  we will modify our marketing mix this year to shift much more toward our international expansion In prior years  our marketing spend was actually less in our international business than the actual current revenue mix  notwithstanding the fact that our growth opportunity was bigger there  So that seems to have been something that we wanted to rectify on a go forward basis and  of course  part of the 500 revenue generating head count that we ve approved  A good chunk of that is in Europe  and we want to continue to go scale that to make sure we have a bigger footprint in those geographies  And then on the partnership side  whether it s with AWS or Salesforce or otherwise  we ve been building out those linkages throughout the world  and Europe is no different with a view to go to market in a digital ecosystem aligned country by country I firmly view partners  Lisa asked the question earlier  as an extension of our sales force  We are working on some core banking deals at this moment in time where the CEO of Temenos has actually actively engaged and brought us into deals and been a huge proponent of Cognizant given our world class capabilities behind Temenos  So it s wonderful when a client hears not just from the CEO of Cognizant but also the CEO  in this case  of Temenos as to our capabilities and our referenceability in that regard  So we re full speed onboard  full speed ahead to go scale our international capabilities  It was a little bit disappointing this last quarter  some of it self inflicted  We got to get that right going forward  and it s certainly an area of focus for me in the coming years Katie Royce    Global Head of Investor RelationsOkay  With that  I think we will conclude today s call  Thank you all for your questions Operator Operator Closing Remarks  Duration  61

177809,399325,CTSH,Why Cognizant  CTSH  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Cognizant  CTSH   This company  which is in the Zacks Business   Software Services industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This information technology consulting and outsourcing firm has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1 97  
For the last reported quarter  Cognizant came out with earnings of  1 08 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 05 per share  representing a surprise of 2 86   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 93 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 94 per share  delivering a surprise of 1 08  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Cognizant  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Cognizant has an Earnings ESP of  1 28  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-cognizant-ctsh-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200497026,200497026
177810,399326,CTSH,Earnings Preview  Cognizant  CTSH  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Cognizant  CTSH  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 5  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This information technology consulting and outsourcing firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 04 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8  
Revenues are expected to be  4 22 billion  up 2 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cognizant 
For Cognizant  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cognizant will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cognizant would post earnings of  1 05 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 08  delivering a surprise of  2 86  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cognizant doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-cognizant-ctsh-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200502755,200502755

177830,399346,CTSH,Earnings Preview  Cognizant  CTSH  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Cognizant  CTSH  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This information technology consulting and outsourcing firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 05 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 8  
Revenues are expected to be  4 21 billion  up 3 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 11  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cognizant 
For Cognizant  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cognizant will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cognizant would post earnings of  0 93 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 94  delivering a surprise of  1 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cognizant doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-cognizant-ctsh-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200476770,200476770

Bajaj acknowledges that markets across Asia and the rest of the world have been choppy over the last year  Investors are weighing up the favourable backdrop of low interest rates and fiscal stimulus versus the less palatable slowdown in economic growth and this conflict is leading to stock market volatility  The manager says this environment is not uncommon for the later stages of a business cycle  In 2018  the broad Asian market delivered a below average total return  while small caps in aggregate declined  So far in 2019  larger companies  especially growth stocks  have performed better than small caps and value stocks  across the globe  not just in Asia   Bajaj says growth or value leadership in the market is  part and parcel of investing  and although it is difficult to forecast the magnitude of the swings in style  the trends always reverse 
The manager undertakes a quarterly review of the markets and notes there has been no material change in the macro environment  important drivers continue to be the stage of the US economic cycle  the property market and the level of credit in the China  along with unforeseen events such as the dispute between the US and its trading partners  All of these factors are contributing to stock market volatility  Bajaj suggests no one knows where we are in the US economic cycle and although recent Chinese data suggest the economy is stabilising  it is impossible to call the trend 
In terms of corporate earnings estimate reductions  the manager says it is important to determine when company valuations make sense  Global estimates have declined  in aggregate  by around 15  since the peak in May 2018  as economic growth has moderated  Bajaj notes that the shares of good quality companies are still being dragged down in the market  although there are pockets of relative strength in Asia  such as China A shares  Generally  small caps have suffered multiple compression  the manager says there are plenty of cheap stocks in the polarised market  with many companies trading on forward P E multiples of less than 10x  He emphasises that FAS s portfolio continues to hold high quality stocks  although its aggregate forward P E multiple of 8 9x is at the low end of the historical range of Bajaj s tenure  While the fund has a lower valuation versus the index  it also has an above index return on equity 
The manager says his investment philosophy  which has been built around years of practice and observation  remains unchanged  he buys good companies  run by good people  at a good price  There are c 140 names in FAS s portfolio and the manager says he has been able to deploy capital into small cap stocks that are being ignored by investors 
Asset allocation
Investment process  Bottom up stock selection
Bajaj favours undervalued smaller cap companies that can grow into  the winners of tomorrow  and have not been recognised by the wider market  There is an intense focus on avoiding large losses in the portfolio  to help achieve this  the manager seeks to invest in good businesses with robust balance sheets  run by competent and honest managers  at a price that provides a margin of safety for errors  There are c 18 000 listed companies in Asia  providing a deep pool of investment opportunities  The manager highlights three elements of the investment process 
The business  Bajaj says this is the first and most critical step  He and his team aim to understand the key drivers of each business  its industry structure  management team  history  a firm s competitive advantage and durability  The team analyses the last 15 20 years of a company s financial statements to understand its returns on capital over an economic cycle  This analysis is followed by many meetings with a firm s management team and other interested parties  including its customers and competitors  The manager is only interested in investing in companies with high quality management teams 
Valuation  Bajaj says the entry point for a new position is important  as it sets the base price for compounding capital and determines a margin of safety  Valuation metrics employed by the team vary  depending on which are the most logical for each company 
Downside protection  to help mitigate the risk of big losses in FAS s portfolio  the manager avoids companies with untested business models  or which have high levels of debt  He does not overpay for a good business or pay a reasonable price for a bad business and will not initiate a position during an industry down cycle 
Current portfolio positioning
At end September 2019  FAS s top 10 positions made up 22 6  of NAV  which was broadly in line with 22 3  a year earlier  three positions were common to both periods  The fund s small cap bias is illustrated in Exhibit 3  with a 54 6pp overweight in smaller companies with market caps up to  1bn and a 48 4pp underweight to larger cap firms compared with the current benchmark 





Over the 12 months to end September  the largest geographic change is a higher weighting to India   7 5pp  Exhibit 4   The manager s unconstrained approach is illustrated by the fund s meaningful deviations compared with the benchmark  such as its underweight in China   17 0pp  and overweights in India   12 5pp  and Indonesia   8 1pp  
FAS s underweight exposure versus the benchmark in China Hong Kong reflects the manager s cautious view on the Chinese housing bubble  he is avoiding Chinese domestic financial and real estate stocks due to their high levels of leverage  Within China  Bajaj focuses on market leaders that are trading on cheap valuations  such as condiments maker Fufeng  BOC Aviation  the largest aircraft lessor in Asia  and battery manufacturers Chaowei Power and Tianneng Power International 
The trust s US exposure includes IT services company Cognizant  NASDAQ CTSH   which has a significant presence in India  and generic drug company Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   which has production bases in India and Malaysia and is benefiting from higher volumes of generic drugs within the pharmaceutical industry 
FAS has modest exposure to frontier markets  including a recent new position in Vietnam  Vietnam Engine and Agricultural Machinery Corporation makes engines and farm equipment  but is also the largest car manufacturer in the country  with joint ventures with Ford  Honda and Toyota 
In terms of sector exposure  Exhibit 5   FAS s largest deviations versus the index are overweights in industrials   6 0pp   consumer discretionary   5 4pp  and utilities   5 3pp   with underweights in financials   5 9pp  and IT   5 6pp   Although underweight financials in aggregate  Bajaj has increased FAS s exposure to non bank financials in India  Over the last 12 18 months  there has been a crisis in the sector following a default from infrastructure financier Infrastructure Leasing   Financial Services  IL FS   one of the largest non bank lenders  This has led to extreme investor risk aversion and the manager says valuations in the sector have come down to attractive levels  He explains that non bank lenders provide essential credit within the Indian economy  as a large part of the population is under banked or unable to obtain credit from traditional lenders  Within the sector  Bajaj focuses on the companies he considers to have the best business models  with the best management teams and the best underwriting standards  he stresses that  in keeping with his investment process  valuation entry points have to provide enough of a margin of safety 











Performance  Outperforming over the mid long term





In FY19  to 31 July   despite the headwind of small caps underperforming the broader market  FAS s NAV and share price total returns of  8 2  and  12 3  were well ahead of the benchmark s  3 9  total return  Bajaj comments that although investor sentiment towards Asian equities has been negatively affected by the US China trade dispute  he is willing to hold high conviction positions through short term blips  Positive contributors include low cost airline Cebu Pacific  Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee Fast Food Indonesia and food additives maker Fufeng  whereas less successful positions include IT services company Cognizant  NASDAQ CTSH   which has undergone a change in management and has experienced client specific issues 





Exhibit 8 shows FAS s relative returns  Its NAV total return has outperformed the benchmark over one  five and 10 years  while its share price total return is also above the index s total return over three years  The trust s performance in recent months has been negatively affected by the continued rotation away from value stocks  and an underweight exposure to Taiwan  which has performed relatively well  FAS has outperformed the bellwether UK index in both NAV and share price terms over one  three  five and 10 years  particularly over the last five and 10 years 











Discount  Move from a discount to a premium
FAS s shares have rerated in recent years  Exhibit 10   The current 0 1  share price discount to cum income NAV compares with a 2 5  average premium over the last year and average discounts of 2 2   5 8  and 7 8  over the last three  five and 10 years respectively 
Approved annually  the board may repurchase up to 14 99  and allot up to 10  of shares in issue to manage a discount or premium  So far in FY20  0 2m shares have been issued  0 3  of the share base   raising  0 9m 





Capital structure and fees
FAS has 72 5m ordinary shares in issue and 11 1m subscription shares outstanding  The final exercise period for the subscription shares is the 25 business days preceding the last business day on 29 November 2019  at a price of 392 75p per share 
Bajaj believes the trust s performance is driven by stockpicking  so he does not employ high levels of gearing  when deemed appropriate  he uses long contracts for difference  which are a cheaper source of funding than bank debt  At end September 2019  net market gearing was 0 1  
FAS has a variable management fee  effective since 1 November 2018  based on the trust s performance versus the benchmark  The base fee is 0 7  of net assets per year  with a maximum of 0 9  and a minimum of 0 5   In FY19  the trust s variable management fee was 0 78   15bp lower than 0 93  in FY18  The FY19 ongoing charges will be released with the full annual report but are expected to be lower than the FY18 figure of 1 17  
FAS is subject to a five yearly continuation vote  with the next due at the 2021 AGM 
Dividend policy and record
FAS pays an annual dividend in December  from revenue rather than capital reserves  In FY19  the trust s revenue return was 10 7p per share   87 7  year on year   whereas the 8 8p proposed dividend is 60  higher compared with 5 5p in FY18  Despite this significant increase in the annual distribution  the board stresses that the fund s objective is long term capital growth and the dividend is a function of the trust s level of income in any financial year  Based on its current share price and the FY19 dividend  FAS offers a 2 2  dividend yield 
Peer group comparison
FAS is a member of the nine strong AIC Asia Pacific sector  Exhibit 11   Its NAV total returns are above the peer group average over five years  ranking fourth  broadly in line over 10 years  while lagging over one and three years  FAS is one of the two funds trading at the narrowest discount  Its ongoing charge  based on FY18  is the second highest  although no separate performance fee is payable  and it has an above average dividend yield  based on FY19   ranking second  0 6pp above the mean  
To enable a broader comparison  we also highlight the two funds in the AIC Asia Pacific Smaller Companies sector  which the board considers to be a more appropriate sector for the trust  given its large weighting in small cap stocks  Its NAV total returns are significantly ahead of this sector s average over five years and ahead over three years  while lagging over the last one and 10 years 





The board
There are six directors on FAS s board  all of whom are non executive and independent of the manager  Chairman Kate Bolsover joined the board on 1 January 2010 and assumed her current role on 9 December 2014  Philip Smiley was also appointed to the board on 1 January 2010 and has been the trust s senior independent director since 30 November 2015  Grahame Stott was appointed as a director on 24 September 2013  Michael Warren on 29 September 2014 and Timothy Scholefield on 30 September 2015 
The newest director is Clare Brady  a chartered company secretary and a graduate of the London School of Economics  who joined the board on 1 August 2019  she is also a member of the management engagement  nomination and audit committees  Brady has extensive experience as a governance professional in the banking and financial services sectors  previous employers include  Barclays   LON BARC  Capital   Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn   HSBC and Republic National Bank of New York   Brady has also held a number of positions in the public sector  including as a director at the International Monetary Fund  based in Washington DC 
FAS s board will continue to be refreshed over the next two years  Over time  it should revert to five directors  Smiley has announced his intention to retire in the coming year ",2019-11-01,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fidelity-asian-values-last-subscription-share-opportunity-coming-up-200481201,200481201

Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
CTSH currently has a forward P E ratio of 16 26  while QTWO has a forward P E of 540 25  We also note that CTSH has a PEG ratio of 1 61  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  QTWO currently has a PEG ratio of 27 01 
Another notable valuation metric for CTSH is its P B ratio of 3 36  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  QTWO has a P B of 10 05

What s Next for Cognizant 
While Cognizant has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

177870,399386,CTSH,Are Investors Undervaluing Cognizant  CTSH  Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One company value investors might notice is Cognizant  CTSH   CTSH is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value  The stock is trading with a P E ratio of 16 03  which compares to its industry s average of 20 72  Over the past 52 weeks  CTSH s Forward P E has been as high as 16 99 and as low as 12 23  with a median of 15 33 
Investors will also notice that CTSH has a PEG ratio of 1 59  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  CTSH s industry currently sports an average PEG of 1 93  Over the last 12 months  CTSH s PEG has been as high as 1 61 and as low as 1 03  with a median of 1 28 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is CTSH s P B ratio of 3 39  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks attractive against its industry s average P B of 9 82  Over the past 12 months  CTSH s P B has been as high as 4 47 and as low as 2 91  with a median of 3 63 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  CTSH has a P S ratio of 2 15  This compares to its industry s average P S of 2 85 
Finally  our model also underscores that CTSH has a P CF ratio of 15 06  This figure highlights a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook  CTSH s P CF compares to its industry s average P CF of 51 86  Within the past 12 months  CTSH s P CF has been as high as 24 94 and as low as 12 90  with a median of 16 36 
These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at  but they help show that Cognizant is likely being undervalued right now  Considering this  as well as the strength of its earnings outlook  CTSH feels like a great value stock at the moment ",2019-08-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-investors-undervaluing-cognizant-ctsh-right-now-200451413,200451413

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Cognizant and Guidewire Software are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that CTSH is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
CTSH currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 32  while GWRE has a forward P E of 72 14  We also note that CTSH has a PEG ratio of 1 52  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  GWRE currently has a PEG ratio of 7 62

Based on these metrics and many more  CTSH holds a Value grade of A  while GWRE has a Value grade of F

177872,399388,CTSH,What Makes Cognizant  CTSH  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Cognizant  CTSH  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Cognizant is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Cognizant  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Cognizant
This information technology consulting and outsourcing firm is expected to earn  3 95 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of  13 6  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Cognizant  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cognizant 
For Cognizant  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cognizant will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cognizant would post earnings of  1 03 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 91  delivering a surprise of  11 65  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cognizant doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-cognizant-ctsh-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200444020,200444020

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Cognizant has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Tyler Technologies has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CTSH likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than TYL has recently  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
CTSH currently has a forward P E ratio of 16 51  while TYL has a forward P E of 39 62  We also note that CTSH has a PEG ratio of 1 63  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  TYL currently has a PEG ratio of 3 96 
Another notable valuation metric for CTSH is its P B ratio of 3 76  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  TYL has a P B of 6 14 
Based on these metrics and many more  CTSH holds a Value grade of B  while TYL has a Value grade of F 
CTSH stands above TYL thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that CTSH is the superior value option right now ",2019-04-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ctsh-or-tyl-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200404713,200404713

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 2  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This information technology consulting and outsourcing firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 03 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 8  
Revenues are expected to be  4 17 billion  up 6 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts

Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
SNX currently has a forward P E ratio of 8 38  while CTSH has a forward P E of 14 61  We also note that SNX has a PEG ratio of 0 70  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  CTSH currently has a PEG ratio of 1 45 
Another notable valuation metric for SNX is its P B ratio of 1 46  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  CTSH has a P B of 2 95 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SNX s Value grade of A and CTSH s Value grade of C 
SNX sticks out from CTSH in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that SNX is the better option right now ",2019-05-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/snx-or-ctsh-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200421628,200421628

177949,399465,CTSH,Can Cognizant  CTSH  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Cognizant  CTSH   which belongs to the Zacks Business   Software Services industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This information technology consulting and outsourcing firm has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 6 75  
For the last reported quarter  Cognizant came out with earnings of  1 19 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 13 per share  representing a surprise of 5 31   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 10 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 19 per share  delivering a surprise of 8 18  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Cognizant  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Cognizant currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 94   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 6  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-cognizant-ctsh-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200380123,200380123
177950,399466,CTSH,Cognizant  CTSH  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Cognizant  CTSH  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This information technology consulting and outsourcing firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 07 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 9  
Revenues are expected to be  4 11 billion  up 7 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cognizant 
For Cognizant  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 94  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Cognizant will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cognizant would post earnings of  1 13 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 19  delivering a surprise of  5 31  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

What s Next for Cognizant 
While Cognizant has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

177979,399495,CTSH,Tokenbox Analysis Of ICO Projects  Imulsify  Matic Network,opinion,"1  Imusify  Germany 
Imusify is an open source music platform based on the NEO blockchain  The goal is a global reform of the music industry  which will mean removing intermediaries between the artist and the listener 
According to the founders of the project  the main obstacle to the process of introduction of new artists and the process of increase of the number of new high quality results is a centralized system of record companies  producing centers and distributors who receive the biggest part of the remuneration and hold the usage rights 
The project will integrate social networks such as Facebook and Instagram  crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo  and streaming services like SoundCloud and iTunes  as well as platforms for publishing video content such as Youtube and Vimeo  There will be two types of users within the Imusify platform   the artist and the user  The artist must receive a fee for the use of his creation  Using blockchain this is done instantly and without intermediaries 
Using IMU tokens  the user pays for listening and receives remuneration for active participation in the development of the platform  reviews  discussions  voting  etc   Musicians get paid for the use of their creations for commercial purposes  The system of distribution of rights and automatic deductions in accordance with these rights allows the possibility of eliminating the intermediary  the distributor or the label  and receiving a reward for participating in the creation of compositions directly from the listener 
The ecosystem also has a crowdfunding component that allows running a collection campaign in IMU tokens to support the creation of any product  be it an album  an audiobook or a video 
The founder of the project is David Walters  who worked for about 7 years as a financial analyst  including 4 years in Generali  a major Italian insurance company  Simultaneously David acts as a startup advisor  Being a well known musician in Germany  s he was the head his own production studio for 15 year 
The main project team also includes a developer with 15 years of experience at Siemens  CTO Tadej Krevh also has impressive experience in development  The team took prizes in competitions  for example in the City of Zion dApps competition 
The Imusify partner is the well known Crypto Valley association  which has active links with international blockchain innovation centers in London  Singapore  Silicon Valley and New York 
Project tokenomics  the Hard Cap is   25 000 000  ICO Token Price  1 IMU     0 0500  Token supply   1 000 000 000  The start date of the ICO is August 1  2018  The launch of the platform is  testnet Q1 2019  mainnet Q3 2019 
Summarizing  we can say that the project is based on a great idea  and  importantly  there is already an MVP  When it is done creating sufficient turnover and movement of IMU tokens  the team will be able to attract a lot of users to the platform  In addition  the project is supported by advisers from the music industry  However  the analytical department of Tokenbox recommends monitoring the project and investing with caution 
The preliminary estimate is 6 10 
2  Matic Network  Panama 
The Matic Network Project presents a solution that uses DPoS sidechains to increase scalability and speed of Ethereum payments  The developers chose Ethereum as the first platform for demonstrating scalability  There is already a part of Ethereum realization on Kovan Testnet for internal testing 
What are the advantages of this solution  It will allow instantly transferring  exchanging and converting digital assets  for example  cryptographic markers   The Matic Network strives to address scalability and usability issues without compromising decentralization and the use of the existing developer community and ecosystem  The project seeks to achieve a high degree of decentralization while providing almost instant transfers  low commissions and favorable savings for micro transactions 
The open source Matic Foundation intends to provide a Matic wallet  payment APIs and SDKs  identification products and other solutions that will allow developing  implementing and migrating DApps created on base platforms such as Ethereum 
The Matic Network team has already built high quality user interfaces  The roadmap of the project also provides support for cross transactions and third party decentralized exchanges 
The Matic Network solves the problem of slow and expensive transactions using a decentralized platform and an adjusted version of the PLASMA framework 
The project will also work with the 0x protocol to provide instant  decentralized and low cost transactions 
In terms of the competition of Matic  there is Dfinity  However  they will work separately  using the power of EVM  rather than using the Plasma contract system 
The project already has an alpha version of the wallet  
and an add on for dapps to interact with Plasma  
There is no current tokenometric information at this stage  Social activity is just starting to gain momentum  Decentraland can become a partner of the project  possibly 
There are only 3 members on the Matic Network team  CEO Jaynti Kanani  who has worked as a coder  a senior software developer at Housing com and a senior software engineer with Persistent Systems  Co founder Anurag Arjun  Chief Product Officer of Matic Network  was an analyst programmer with Cognizant Technology Solutions  NASDAQ CTSH   Scrum Master at SNL Financial  The operational director Sandeep Nailwal has extensive experience in product management and was a consultant to Deloitte  Apparently  the recruitment is still in progress 
Due to the lack of information on tokenometrics  token sale dates  partners and investors  Tokenbox analytical department recommends monitoring the project and making a decision to participate on the basis of future announcements from the Matic Network project 
The final estimate of the project is 6 10 ",2018-07-15,Viktor Shpakovsky,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tokenbox-analysis-of-ico-projects-200330906,200330906

investment strategies in a bid to book higher returns  But with ever changing market dynamics  this may not yield the desired results every time  Therefore  using conventional strategies  based on key fundamentals  to choose stocks is always a wise decision One such strategy is sales growth  Maintaining steady sales growth is the key to survival for any business  Sales growth as such remains a vital measure for any corporate house  as it is important to growth projections and strategic decision making So  when companies incur losses for a temporary period  they are valued based on their revenues  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance  Also  in contrast to price to earnings and price to book value ratios  which can turn negative and cease to be relevant  price to sales  P S  ratio is available even for companies that have hit choppy waters Additionally  profits and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation  significant charges and inventory  However  management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales  which further underscores the importance of P S ratio  Hence  P S ratio can serve as a more reliable metric for stock valuation  Focusing solely on sales growth is  however  not enough A consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales can be a more dependable strategy  Significant cash in hand and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments For the rest of this Screen of

177996,399512,CTSH,Has Cognizant Technology  CTSH  Outpaced Other Computer And Technology Stocks This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Computer and Technology space have likely heard of Cognizant Technology Solutions  NASDAQ CTSH   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  One simple way to answer this question is to take a look at the year to date performance of CTSH and the rest of the Computer and Technology group s stocks 
Cognizant Technology Solutions is one of 635 companies in the Computer and Technology group  The Computer and Technology group currently sits at  5 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors

178018,399534,CTSH,5 Best Stocks With Impressive Sales Growth Worth Buying ,opinion,Investors often fail to think through sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to picking winning stocks  This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum  However  betting on stocks completely depending on such a perception may not prove worthwhile It s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss  albeit transitorily  they are valued based on their revenues not earnings  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance  In contrast with price to earnings and price to book value ratios  which can turn negative and cease to be relevant  the price to sales  P S  ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters Further  a company can improve earnings by resorting to cost control measures while maintaining stable revenues  But superior profits could be achieved through continued revenue growth Also  earnings and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation  significant charges and inventory  However  management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales  which further underscores the importance of P S ratio A huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits  Hence  considering a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be more prudent  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening Based in St  Petersburg  FL  Raymond James Financial  Inc    NYSE RJF   is engaged in the underwriting  distribution  trading  and brokerage

T2108  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   underlined the bullish tone of the day  T2108 confirmed  support  at the threshold of oversold levels  20   with a massive 12 2 percentage point gain from 23 2  to 35 4  
Yet  the technical indicator remains locked within a 4 month downtrend now well defined by its 50DMA trendline 
While T2108 made a very bullish move  the 4 month downtrend remains a note of caution  Similarly  while volatility cratered with a 16 9  loss  the VIX is still well above the 15 35 pivot line  Still  it is at least below the 20 level which conventionally defines  high   This move should be the beginning of the end of the latest volatility spike  but I suspect the path back to and below the pivot line will not be nearly as straight as the path straight up to the recent high 
I took this opportunity to sell my puts in ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   The profits partially offset the losses I incurred last week trying to fade voalitility 
In the near term I plan to fade any further volatility spikes  Per the rules I laid out in the last T2108 Update  I have switched the short term trading call from cautiously bullish to bullish  I hope to buy a dip in the S P 500 and use the recent low and 200DMA as a clear stop  The first upside target will be the  declining  50DMA 
The week ahead likely has more surprises ahead  especially with a U S  Presidential election on tap  So I will end with just one stock chart  Cognizant Technology Solutions  NASDAQ CTSH   The information technology outsourcing firm soared on well received earnings  The 5 1  gain closed the September gap down which marks news of an internal invesitgation and the resignation of CTSH s president 
Cognizant Technology  CTSH  reversed all its post  bad news  loss and gapped up well above 50DMA resistance and its upper Bollinger Band  BB 
I assume CTSH is a buy on the dips going forward with the 50DMA as support  formerly resistance

178152,399668,CTSH,Will Groupon Surprise This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Groupon Inc  NASDAQ GRPN  is set to report second quarter 2014 results on Aug 5  Last quarter  the daily deals provider posted 42 9  positive surprise  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider this Quarter
Groupon is well positioned to gain from the rising e Commerce spending on mobile devices  a profitable domestic market and an underpenetrated international market  We expect these opportunities to continue to drive top line growth  Moreover  increased traction in the mobile business is an added positive for the company  For the second quarter of 2014  Groupon forecasts revenues in the range of  725 0 million to  775 0 million  Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  761 0 million  which is on the higher end of management s guided range  However  stiff competition  combined with a volatile macroeconomic environment  remains the major headwind  We believe that continued investments aimed at enlarging merchant base will hurt profitability in the near term 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Groupon is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP   Groupon has a  50 00  ESP  That is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 6 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is lower at a loss of 4 cents Zacks Rank  Groupon s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter   Cognizant Technology Solutions  NASDAQ CTSH   with an Earnings ESP of  5 08  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

178153,399669,CTSH,Will Zynga Inc  s Earnings Surprise This Quarter ,opinion,"Zynga Inc   NASDAQ ZNGA  is set to report second quarter 2014 results on Aug 7  In the previous quarter  the company reported a loss of 4 cents  a penny narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  On average  Zynga has delivered positive earnings surprise of 39 53  in the last four quarters  
 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter 
 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
 
Zynga is expected to grow in the near term on the back of its innovative product pipeline and improving position in the mobile gaming sector  Bookings are projected in the range of  175 0  195 0 million  The company expects to generate revenues between  140 million and  160 million in the second quarter  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  192 0 million 
 
However  intensifying competition from the likes of King Digital  Glu Mobile and Electronic Arts remains the headwind  The resurgence in physical game sales due to Next Gen consoles will be a significant headwind at least in the near term 
 
Earnings Whispers 
 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Zynga is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below 
 
Zacks ESP  Zynga currently has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 3 cents 
 
Zacks Rank  Zynga s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat  
 
We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum
