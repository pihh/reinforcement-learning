19860,241375,BSTC,Weekly Jobless Claims Lowest In Nearly 50 Years  5 Top Picks ,opinion,The Labor Department s jobless claims data for the week ended Apr 6 provides fresh evidence that the labor market is still robust  In fact  the metric dropped to its lowest level in nearly 50 years  The U S  labor market is a picture of health at the moment fueled by strong job additions and record low unemployment March 2019 witnessed significant job additions  indicating that hiring remains robust even as the economy nears full employment  The U S  labor market is the major driver of the bull run  which is more than a decade old  Boyed by a robust labor market  Wall Street is still raging forward withstanding intermittent volatilities and fluctuations Jobless Claims Continue to DeclineOn Apr 11  the Department of Labor reported that weekly jobless claims decreased 8 000 to a seasonally adjusted 196 000  below the threshold 200 000 level  on Apr 4  The figure was better than the consensus estimate of 212 000 and the lowest experienced since October 1969 The four week moving average of initial claims dropped by 7 000 to 207 000 for the week ended Apr 6  the lowest level since early December 1969  This metric is considered a better measure of labor market trends as it eliminates weekly fluctuations Additionally  the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased by 13 000 to 1 71 million for the week ended Mar 31  Furthermore  the four week moving average of continuing claims decreased 11 000 to 1 73 million Labor Market Remains RobustOn Apr 5  the Department of Labor reported non farm job additions of 196 000 for the month of March  signifying 102th straight month of non farm payroll growth  The figure was also higher than the consensus estimate of 184 000 Moreover  February s job additions were revised to 33 000 from 20 000  February s job market was affected by partial shutdown of the U S  government that continued for a record setting 35 days  Meanwhile  January s job gains were also revised marginally upward to 312 000  These revisions took the first quarter s average job gains to a solid 180 000 The unemployment rate remained at a 50 year low of 3 8   The real unemployment rate  including people forced into part time work and those only sporadically looking for jobs  also remained flat at 7 3   This indicates a strong decline from the year ago level of 7 9  Job data for March also revealed that average wage rate increased 0 14   below the consensus estimate of 0 2   The wage rate increased 3 2  year over year  below the consensus estimate of 3 4   Lower unemployment along with lower wage growth has eliminated inflationary expectations which will enable the Fed to stick to its stand of not raising interest rate in 2019 Health Care Services Lead Job GainsAccording to the latest report  Apr 5  2019  of the Department of Labor  the health care sector added 49 000 jobs in March  the highest amongst

Revenues at the International segment decreased 1  year over year on a reported basis  up 7  operationally  to  718 million  Livestock sales declined 6   up 2  operationally  in the quarter due to the negative impact of African Swine Fever in China and the divestiture of certain agribusiness products in Japan  The decline was partially offset by growth across poultry  fish and sheep

19863,241378,BSTC,5 Stocks With Recent Price Strength Despite Market Volatility,opinion, In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price   However  striking the right chord each time needs a fair amount of luck No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds good  Here s how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create the magic  Therefore  you need to

that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months  This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see  Average Broker Rating 1

19867,241382,BSTC,ImmunoGen Plunges As FDA Recommends New Study For Lead Drug,opinion,"Shares of ImmunoGen  Inc    NASDAQ IMGN   have plunged approximately 32   The downside followed after the company announced FDA s recommendation of a new study on lead candidate   mirvetuximab soravtansine 
Moreover  ImmunoGen s shares have significantly underperformed the industry so far this year  The stock has plunged 55 4  against the  s rise of 6  

 
Coming back to the news  the agency has advised the company to conduct a phase III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mirvetuximab soravtansine in patients with high folate receptor alpha  FR   positive  platinum resistant ovarian cancer 
The recommendation follows after a Type C meeting held this week 
We note that ImmunoGen requested the meeting to discuss the results of the phase III FORWARD I trial and a potential path for registration of mirvetuximab as a monotherapy 
The data from the trial  announced in March 2019  showed that the treatment with the candidate did not achieve significant improvement in progression free survival  PFS  in the overall patient population as well FR alpha high patient subset 
Based on these data  the agency concluded that data  assessing the secondary endpoints from the study  could not be used to support an application for accelerated approval and the company needs to conduct an additional trial 
The news was extremely disappointing for investors  An additional study will involve extra costs for this clinical stage biotechnology company  which focuses on developing the next generation of antibody drug conjugates  ADCs   The company had approximately  270 million on the balance sheet at the end of the first quarter 
ImmunoGen is currently conducting an operational review of the business with the objective of extending cash runway 
ImmunoGen plans to discuss the design of a new registration trial in the said population with the agency in the future 
Simultaneously  ImmunoGen announced mature data from the FORWARD II expansion cohort 
FORWARD II is a phase Ib II study of mirvetuximab in combination with Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Avastin  bevacizumab   carboplatin or Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda  pembrolizumab  in patients with FR  positive platinum resistant or platinum agnostic ovarian cancer  primary peritoneal or fallopian tube tumors as well as a triplet combination of mirvetuximab plus carboplatin and Avastin in patients with platinum sensitive ovarian cancer  The combination demonstrated significant anti tumor activity and favorable safety and tolerability in platinum resistant disease 
We expect further updates from the study

Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings  Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  And why not  If the company doesn t make money  it won t last over the long haul 
This metric is also considered a key variable in influencing the share price  Better than expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price  However  in addition to actual earnings  expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock 
Earnings Estimates Determine Share Prices
We have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings failing to meet market expectations 
Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm 
Investors  thus  should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Hence  it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates

19903,241418,BSTC,What s In Store For BioSpecifics  BSTC  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Shares of BioSpecifics Technologies Corp    NASDAQ BSTC   have increased 77 6  in the past year  against the  s decline of 16 1  

 
In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Moreover  BioSpecifics  earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missed in one  with the average earnings surprise being 17 04  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement of the upcoming fourth quarter and full year 2018 results 
Factors Likely to Impact Q4 Results
BioSpecifics develops collagenase based therapies  with a first in class collagenase based product marketed a Xiaflex in the United States and Xiapex in Europe 
The company is witnessing continued growth for the two marketed indications for Xiaflex   Peyronie s Disease and Dupuytren s Contracture  We expect this positive trend to continue in the fourth quarter 
BioSpecificsannounced positive data for Xiaflex  collagenase clostridium histolyticum  CCH   in two new potential indications in the fourth quarter  The company announced positive top line results from its phase I study of CCH for the treatment of uterine fibroids in October 2018  Also  BioSpecifics  partner  Endo International Plc    NASDAQ ENDP   announced positive data from the phase III studies of CCH for the treatment of cellulite in November 2018 
BioSpecifics is taking care of CCH sdevelopment in the uterine fibroids  indication and has the right to initiate the development of any new potential indication not licensed by Endo 
Investors  focus will be on pipeline updates in the fourth quarter 
What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for BioSpecifics in the to be reported quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  But that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  BioSpecifics has an Earnings ESP of 0 0  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a profit of 68 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  BioSpecifics currently has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of an earnings beat 
Note that Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement are best avoided BioSpecifics Technologies Corp Price and EPS Surprise

   Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some stocks you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
BioDelivery Sciences International Inc    NASDAQ BDSI   is scheduled to report fourth quarter results on Mar 14  The company has an Earnings ESP of  38 46  and a Zacks Rank of 1  You can see  
Tilray Inc    NASDAQ TLRY   is expected to report fourth quarter results on Mar 18  The company has an Earnings ESP of  7 41  and a Zacks Rank of 3

19904,241419,BSTC,4 Top Stocks To Buy For Superb Earnings Growth,opinion,"Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings  Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  And why not  If the company doesn t make money  it won t last over the long haul 
This metric is also considered a key variable in influencing the share price  Better than expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price  However  in addition to actual earnings  expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock 
Earnings Estimates Determine Share Prices
We have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings failing to meet market expectations 
Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm 
Investors  thus  should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Hence  it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions  we have added the following parameters 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only Zacks   Buys  and  Strong Buys  are allowed  With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there  this is a great way to start things off

19914,241429,BSTC,Theravance Pipeline Strong  Plans Yupelri Launch By Year End,opinion,"On Nov 28  we issued an updated research report on Theravance Biopharma  Inc    NASDAQ TBPH    The company had only one marketed product  Vibativ in its portfolio 
Vibativ is a once daily dual mechanism antibiotic approved in the United States  Europe and certain other countries for specifically difficult to treat infections  However  in November  Theravance announced that it has signed an agreement with specialty pharma Cumberland Pharmaceuticals to sell Vibativ  Per the deal  Cumberland is entitled to pay  25 million to Theravance besides tiered royalties of up to 20  on the product s future net sales in the United States 
Earlier this month  Theravance received a huge boost when the FDA approved its investigational product Yupelri  revefenacin  for the maintenance treatment of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  COPD   Theravance and Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   are collaborating on the development and commercialization of the drug with a launch expected before 2018 end 
Following the approval  Yupelri became the first once daily nebulized long acting muscarinic antagonist  LAMA  option for COPD patients to be approved by the FDA 
Shares of Theravance have lost 4 2  year to date narrower than the  decline of 9 9  

 
Apart from this  Theravance has a promising pipeline portfolio to focus on  The company has collaboration agreement with Johnson   Johnson s   NYSE JNJ   subsidiary Janssen for developing its JAK inhibitors  TD 1473 and TD 0714  for the treatment of inflammatory intestinal diseases 
Earlier this month  Theravance announced that it has dosed the first patient in a phase II study on its gut selective pan JAK inhibitor TD 1473 for the treatment of patients with Crohn s disease  The candidate is also being evaluated in phase Ib study for the treatment of ulcerative colitis 
Also  during the same month  the company dosed the first patient in a phase I study on its novel  inhaled  lung selective pan Janus kinase  JAK  inhibitor  TD 8236  The candidate is currently being developed to evaluate its potential for the treatment of various serious respiratory diseases 
Other early to mid stage pipeline candidates include TD 9855  neurogenic orthostatic hypotension   TD 6450  hepatitis C virus HCV genotype 1 and genotype 4   and TD 8954  selective 5 HT4 receptor agonist for gastrointestinal motility disorders  
Successful development and subsequent approval of these candidates will be a huge boost to the company 
However  with the potential sale of Vibativ  Theravance is now solely dependent on Yupelri for future revenues  However  the drug is yet to launch and it will take some time to generate revenues  Hence  any kind of regulatory setback for Yupelri could affect the company s growth prospects Theravance Biopharma  Inc  Price and Consensus

20026,241541,BSTC,Forget Mylan  Buy These 3 Drug Stocks Instead,opinion,"The healthcare sector has once again grabbed the spotlight due to exorbitant drug pricing  Generic drug maker  Mylan N V  s   NASDAQ MYL   shares crashed almost 12  after the company drew flak for over pricing epinephrine auto injector  EpiPen  which is approved for the treatment of severe allergic reactions 
Earlier this week  a couple of U S  senators raised questions about the company s massive price hike of EpiPen  While one of the senators asked for details of the massive price hike of the product in the recent years among other issues  another urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate into the company for a likely antitrust violation regarding the issue 
Mylan had acquired EpiPen from Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA  in 2007  following which the product s cost has skyrocketed over 400   As per news reports  Mylan has hiked the price of a pack of two EpiPens from  100 in 2008 to the present level of  500  with some customers reportedly paying  600 or more 
Making matter worse  Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton even posted a tweet  saying  EpiPens can be the difference between life and death  There s no justification for these price hikes   Reeling under pressure from the issue  the company yesterday announced plans to improve access to EpiPen by expanding the existing programs for patients who are bearing the high expenses  Under this plan  Mylan will double the eligibility for its patient assistance program  which will slash out of pocket costs for uninsured and under insured patients and families 
Similar Controversies Faced by Peers
But Mylan is not the first company to come under scanner for overpricing drugs  While exorbitant drug prices and the lack of affordability of prescription drugs have always been there  price hiking suddenly came to the forefront late last year  Privately held Turing Pharmaceuticals raised the price of Daraprim from  13 50 to  750 per pill in a single shot  thereby attracting public attention as well as criticism  The company had acquired the U S  rights to Daraprim from Impax Laboratories Inc  in Aug 2015 
The price increase didn t go down well with Hillary Clinton then either  whose  price gouging  tweet led to a major sell off in the healthcare sector  cutting short the phenomenal run of health care stocks  particularly in the biotech sector 
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  Inc    NYSE VRX   was another major company to fall out of favor with investors because of the same issue 
What s to Happen Next
It has been widely believed that lack of competition allowed Mylan to raise the price of EpiPen  Auvi Q has been off the markets since last October  while Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd    NYSE TEVA   failed to even receive an approval for its generic version of EpiPen earlier this year  On the bright side for Teva  the controversies surrounding Mylan could now push regulatory agencies to expedite the approval of generic versions of the drug Medical Sector Price Index
 Against this backdrop  Mylan currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Here  we have picked three stocks using our   Not only do these stocks have a solid VGM score   V  for Value   G  for Growth and  M  for Momentum  of  B   but they also have a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy

Philadelphia  PA based Lannett Company  Inc    NYSE LCI   develops  manufactures  packages  markets  and distributes solid oral and extended release  tablets and capsules   topical  nasal  and oral solution finished dosage forms of drugs  which target a wide range of therapeutic areas 
The company is also pursuing partnerships  research contracts and internal expansion for the development and production of other dosage forms including ophthalmic  nasal  patch  foam  buccal  sublingual  soft gel  injectable and oral dosages  This Zacks Rank  1 stock has seen its current year earnings per share  EPS  estimate move 11 64  higher over the past 60 days 
Wilbur Street Lynbrook  NY based BioSpecifics Technologies Corp    NASDAQ BSTC   is a biopharmaceutical company that develops injectable collagenase clostridium histolyticum for multiple indications  Injectable collagenase is marketed as Xiaflex in the U S  for the treatment of Dupuytren s contracture and Peyronie s disease by its partner  Endo International plc   NASDAQ ENDP    This Zacks Rank  2 stock s current year EPS estimate has moved up by 9 29  over the past 60 days 
Headquartered in Salt Lake City  UT  USANA Health Sciences Inc    NYSE USNA   is focused on the development and manufacture of high quality  science based nutritional and personal care products that are distributed internationally through a network marketing system  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has seen its current year EPS estimate move up by 4 92  higher over the past 60 days 
Bottom Line
Regardless of macroeconomic events  drug pricing will remain in focus among policymakers  the media and the public  But instead of focusing on finding someone to take all the blame  emphasis should be on striking a balance between innovation and affordability  With all eyes on the healthcare sector  companies will now become increasingly cautious about drug price hikes  While Mylan attempts to recover from the recent setback  investors could consider these top ranked drug stocks  which also have a superb Style Score ",2016-08-26,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/forget-mylan,-buy-these-3-drug-stocks-instead-200150346",200150346
