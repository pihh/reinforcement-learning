Prepared Remarks 
Sandeep Bakhshi    Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer
Good afternoon to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the Q3 2020 results  Joining us today on this call are Vishakha  Anup  Sandeep Batra  Rakesh and Anindya 
Our core operating profit increased by 23 8  year on year to INR70 17 billion in Q3 of 2020  The profit after tax was INR41 46 billion in the current quarter compared to INR16 05 billion in Q3 of 2019  We continued to see healthy growth in our funding  As we had indicated earlier  the growth in term deposits has outpaced the growth in CASA deposits reflecting the systemic trends  Term deposits grew by 23 6  year on year to INR3 8 trillion at December 31  2019  while average CASA deposits increased by 14 6  year on year in this quarter 
On the assets side  the domestic book grew by 16 5  year on year at December 31  2019  driven by retail loans  which grew by 19 3  year on year  The overall loan growth was 12 6  year on year  Expanding our digital capabilities and leveraging partnerships are key focus areas for us  We have recently launched India s largest API banking portal consisting of 250 APIs  which enables developers of businesses  fintechs  corporates and e commerce start ups to easily partner with the bank and co create innovative solutions in a frictionless manner  with the convenience of a single portal 
Coming to asset quality  gross NPA additions were INR43 63 billion this quarter  As you are aware  during the quarter  there were certain developments with respect to a broking company  Our exposure to the company has been classified as non performing and fully provided on a prudent basis  The corporate NPA additions in this quarter also include an exposure to a South India based industrial company where servicing is regular  but where a refinancing undertaken in 2018 has now been assessed to be restructuring  leading to classification as non performing by lenders to the company  The company is backed by reputed promoters and investors  Recoveries  upgrades and other deletions  excluding write offs were INR40 88 billion in Q3 of 2020  Recoveries and upgrades include a large steel account which was resolved under the IBC 
The annual supervision process of the Bank by RBI for financial year 2019 was concluded during Q3 of 2020  No disclosure on divergence in asset classification and provisioning for NPAs is required to be made in terms of the RBI guidelines  We had mentioned on our previous calls that credit costs in FY 2020 were expected to reduce significantly compared to FY 2019 and be in the range of 1 2  to 1 3  of average advances  The credit costs for nine months of 2020 was 1 79  or 41 1  of the core operating profit  As mentioned on our previous call  the credit cost guidance for financial    FY 2020 assumed a couple of large recoveries  including the steel account  which was under insolvency proceedings  While the steel account under IBC has been resolved  recoveries from other accounts have not materialized in line with expectations  Further  there was some impact on the credit cost due to unanticipated developments with respect to the broking company and the industrial company mentioned earlier  As a result  the credit cost for financial year 2020 is likely to be similar compared to nine months of 2020 
Overall on asset quality  net NPA declined from 2 5  at December 31  2018  to 1 49  at December 31  2019  Despite higher additions to NPAs in this quarter and write back of provisions on the steel account  the provision coverage ratio  excluding technical write offs  was 76 2   similar to the last quarter  We would continue to target a normalized credit cost of about 25  of the core operating profit  There have been a couple of press articles in the past few months about the potential capital raise by the bank  and we have also been getting queries from investors and analysts regarding the same  We have clarified that we are not in the process of raising capital  You would have seen that the current capital ratios are at a comfortable level with CET1 ratio of 13 62  at December 31  2019  We ll keep evaluating the capital position and requirements depending on the market conditions  growth opportunities and regulatory development 
As we have mentioned in the past  our focus is on growing the core operating profit in a risk calibrated manner and delivering consistent and predictable returns to the shareholders  With these opening remarks  I will now hand the call over to Rakesh 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
Thank you  Sandeep  I ll talk about the P L details  our performance on growth  credit quality  performance of subsidiaries and capital position during the current quarter 
Starting with the P L details  the net interest income increased by 24 3  year on year to INR85 45 billion  driven by both loan growth and an increase in margins  The net interest margin was at 3 77  compared to 3 64  in the previous quarter and 3 40  in Q3 of last year  Interest on income tax refund was INR0 16 billion this quarter compared to INR0 42 billion in the previous quarter and INR0 21 billion in Q3 of last year  The impact of interest on income tax refund and interest collection from NPAs was about 10 basis points this quarter compared to 6 basis points in Q2 earlier this year  The domestic NIM was at 4 04  in this quarter compared to 3 92  in Q2 and 3 72  in Q3 of last year  International margins were at 0 38  in the current quarter 
Total non interest income was INR45 74 billion in the current quarter compared to INR38 83 billion in Q3 of last year  Fee income grew by 17 4  year on year to INR35 96 billion in this quarter  Retail fee income grew by 25 5  year on year and now constitutes about 76 5  of the overall fees  Treasury recorded a profit of INR5 31 billion this quarter  compared to INR4 79 billion in Q3 of last year  Treasury gains this quarter were higher compared to the last few quarters  Dividend income from subsidiaries was INR3 67 billion in this quarter  compared to INR3 24 billion in Q3 of last year 
Coming to costs  the bank s operating expenses increased by 20 8  year on year this quarter  The employee expenses increased by 12  year on year  and non employee expenses increased by 26 1  year on year  The bank had 100 422 employees at December 31  During the quarter  there was a write back in provisions for retirals due to increase in yields on government securities  The increase in non employee expenses reflect the growth in franchise building in the retail business of the bank 
For the nine months ended December 31  2019  employee expenses increased by 23  year on year  and non employee expenses increased by 19 8   We will continue to make investments in people  technology  distribution and building our brand  Our endeavor would be to ensure that revenues grow at a faster pace than expenses 
Provisions declined by 50 9  year on year to INR20 83 billion in this quarter  compared to INR42 44 billion in Q3 of last year and INR25 07 billion in Q2 of 2020  This reflects the impact of full provision on the broking company exposure and provision on the industrial company that Sandeep mentioned  as well as recovery on the steel exposure under IBC  The growth in core operating profit and reduction in credit costs resulted in an increase in profit before tax from INR19 02 billion in Q3 of 2019 to INR54 65 billion in the current quarter  The profit after tax was INR41 46 billion this quarter  compared to INR16 05 billion in Q3 of last year  This also reflects the impact of reduction in corporate tax rates in the current fiscal year 
Now coming to growth  the domestic loan growth was 16 5  year on year as of December 31  driven by 19 3  growth in the retail business  Within the retail portfolio  the mortgage loan portfolio grew by 15  to INR1 96 trillion  auto loans by 5   business banking by 47   rural lending by 17  and commercial vehicle and equipment loans by 15  year on year  The personal loan and credit card portfolio grew by 49  year on year  off a relatively small base to INR583 48 billion and is now 9 2  of the overall loan book  The SME business comprising of borrowers having a turnover of less than INR2 5 billion  grew by 34  year on year to INR217 44 billion as of December 31  The relatively high growth in business banking and SME segment reflects the low base and market share  Our focus in these segments is on parameterized and program based lending  digital channels  granularity  collateral and robust monitoring  Growth of the performing domestic corporate portfolio was about 12  year on year  The bank is focusing on meeting the commercial banking needs of its corporate clients  including foreign exchange and derivatives  trade finance  payments and collections  as well as tapping opportunities across corporate ecosystems  including the supply chain and the employees 
The net advances of the overseas branches decreased by 15 7  year on year in rupee terms and 17 6  year on year in US dollar terms  The decline in overseas book reflects the maturity of loans against FCNR deposits  As a result of the above  the overall loan portfolio grew by 12 6  year on year as of December 31  Retail loans as a proportion of total loans were 62 6  at December 31  Including the non fund based outstanding  the share of the retail portfolio was 52  of the total portfolio at December 31  2019  The international loan portfolio was 8 9  of the overall loan book at December 31 
Coming to the funding side  average savings account deposits increased by 11 8  year on year  and average current account deposits increased by 23 6  year on year during the current quarter  The total deposits grew by 18 1  year on year to INR7 2 trillion at December 31 
Coming to the credit quality  the gross NPA additions during the quarter was INR43 63 billion  This includes the addition of INR24 73 billion from the corporate and SME portfolio  There were slippages of INR7 07 billion from corporate and SME borrowers rated BB and below at September 30  2019  including INR2 25 billion on account of devolvement of non fund based outstanding to existing NPAS  The balance corporate and SME NPA additions virtually entirely comprise the broking company and the South based industrial company mentioned earlier  The gross NPA additions from the retail portfolio was INR18 9 billion  The credit trends in the overall retail portfolio continued to be stable  The delinquency parameters across vintages in the personal loan and credit card portfolios have been stable and well within the internally defined thresholds  The increase over the preceding quarter primarily reflects NPA additions in the kisan credit card portfolio and the commercial vehicle loan portfolio 
As communicated on our previous calls  we typically see higher NPA additions from the kisan credit card portfolio in the first and third quarters of a fiscal year  After considering recoveries and upgrades of INR7 79 billion  there was net NPA additions of INR11 11 billion in the retail portfolio this quarter compared to INR10 02 billion in the first quarter of this fiscal  The KCC portfolio outstanding was about INR204 billion or 3  of our total loan book at December 31  2019 
Recoveries  upgrades and other deletions  excluding write offs  were INR40 88 billion in the current quarter  Gross NPA deletions during the quarter also include conversion of non performing loans of an account amounting to INR8 45 billion to compulsorily convertible preference shares as a part of the debt restructuring scheme  The gross NPAs written off during the quarter aggregated to INR24 6 billion  The bank did not sell any NPAs during the current quarter  The total net non performing assets were INR103 89 billion at December 31  compared to INR109 16 billion at September 30  2019  The net non performing assets declined by about 36   compared to December 31  2018  The gross NPA ratio declined from 6 37  at September 30 to 5 95  at December 31  2019  The net NPA ratio declined from 1 60  at September 30 to 1 49  at December 31  2019 
Net investment in security receipts of asset reconstruction companies decreased from INR32 76 billion at September 30  2019  to INR20 87 billion at December 31  2019  due to the redemption of security receipts related to the steel account  which was resolved under IBC during the current quarter  The loans and non fund based outstanding to borrowers rated BB and below  excluding NPAs  was INR174 03 billion at December 31  compared to INR175 25 billion at March 31  and INR160 74 billion at September 30  2019  of which the non fund based outstanding to non performing loans was INR39 19 billion as of December 31  compared to INR33 71 billion as of September 30  The bank holds provisions of INR11 34 billion as of December 31 against this non fund based outstanding The fund and non fund based outstanding to borrowers under RBI resolution schemes were INR38 94 billion as of December 31  compared to INR39 29 billion as of September 30 
The fund and non fund outstanding to restructured loans was INR1 96 billion at December 31  The balance INR93 94 billion of fund based and non fund based outstanding includes INR59 78 billion related to cases with an outstanding greater than INR1 billion  and INR34 16 billion related to cases with an outstanding of less than INR1 billion 
On Slides 22 and 23 of the presentation  we have provided the movement in our BB and below portfolio during Q3 and nine months of the current financial year  The rating downgrades from investment grade categories  excluding fund based outstanding to accounts that were also downgraded to NPA in the same period  were INR26 66 billion in this quarter and INR54 55 billion in nine months ended December 31  We had mentioned in our previous quarter earnings call that given the macro context  additions to the BB and below portfolio could be somewhat higher over the next couple of quarters  An account in the telecom sector was downgraded in Q3  pursuant to the Supreme Court ruling on AGR related dues in the telecom sector  Other downgrades were spread across sectors  including in the construction sector  There were rating upgrades to the investment grade categories and a net decrease in outstanding of INR6 3 billion this quarter and INR32 29 billion in the nine months 
Lastly  there was a reduction of INR7 07 billion in Q3 and INR23 48 billion in nine months due to slippage of some borrowers into the non performing category and devolvement of non fund based outstanding to existing NPAs  The builder portfolio  including construction finance  lease rental discounting  term loans and work capital loans  was INR230 99 billion at December 31  compared to INR225 15 billion at September 30  Our builder portfolio is about 4  of our total loan portfolio  The loans to NBFCs and HFCs were about 5  of our total outstanding loans at December 31  and the details are given on Slide 25 of the investor presentation 
Coming to subsidiaries  the details of the financial performance of subsidiaries is covered in slides 31 to 32 and 53 to 58 in the investor presentation  I ll briefly talk about the major highlights  Value of new business of ICICI Life increased by 24 7  year on year to INR11 35 billion in nine months of 2020  The new business margin increased from 17  in financial year 2019 to 21  in nine months of the current financial year  The protection based annualized premium equivalent increased by 65 7  year on year to INR7 64 billion and accounted for 14 1  of the total annualized premium equivalent in nine months of 2020  The new business premium grew by 19 7  to INR81 73 billion for the nine months of 2020  The Gross Direct Premium Income of ICICI General was INR101 32 billion in the nine months  compared to INR110 03 billion in the nine months of the last financial year 
Excluding the crop segment  the Gross Direct Premium Income increased by 13 2  year on year in the current nine months to INR100 58 billion  in line with the industry growth  The company s combined ratio was 100 5  in the nine months compared to 98 7  in nine months of the last financial year  primarily on account of long term motor policies and losses  which were there in the previous quarters  The return on average equity on an annualized basis was 21 8  in the nine months of 2020  The profit after tax of ICICI AMC increased from INR1 96 billion in Q3 of last year to INR3 05 billion in the current quarter  The profit after tax of ICICI Securities on a consolidated basis was INR1 37 billion in the current quarter compared to INR1 01 billion in Q3 of last year

We take the first question from the line of Mahrukh Adajania from IDFC Mutual Fund  Please go ahead 
Mahrukh Adajania    IDFC Mutual Fund    Analyst
Yeah  hi  Just had a question on your rating profile of the loan book  So the proportion of A  has increased significantly  and then AA  and BBB  has reduced  Is that a positive or a negative 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
So if you look at it  overall  the A  and above  that has increased from 66 3  to 69 8   and that would definitely be a positive  Within that    there has been some reduction in the BBB overall bucket  We have seen some upgrades on the    from BBB into the A category on the retail side where the ratings are based on the mapping of portfolios  So that would be a positive development in terms of the rating profile  A  and above being higher than the previous quarter 
Mahrukh Adajania    IDFC Mutual Fund    Analyst
So  it s the retail    it s mainly the retail portfolio 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
The improvement from BBB into the A bucket incrementally has happened on the retail portfolio  Overall  in the corporate portfolio also  the new    we have given that data that you see below that table  the 90  of disbursements in the nine months where the corporate trended A  and above  So that trend is continuing  In addition to that  this quarter  we also had these upgrades on the retail portfolio 
Mahrukh Adajania    IDFC Mutual Fund    Analyst
Okay  And any general understanding that you can share on telecom in terms of validity of annual spectrum guarantees  if the company is admitted to NCLT and if it is not 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
I think  Mahrukh  the way we are looking at it and we would urge you to look at it  is that there is a guarantee that has been given by the bank and that is the value at risk for the bank  so we will see how it kind of develops  Beyond that  very difficult to comment on this  So there s a guarantee which is there  and you should assume that entire guarantee to be at risk for all banks  not just for us 
Mahrukh Adajania    IDFC Mutual Fund    Analyst
Okay  That helps  Thank you so much

Thank you  Next question is from the line of Motilal Oswal from Nirmal Bang  Please go ahead 
Manish Ostwal    Nirmal Bang    Analyst
Hello 
Sandeep Bakhshi    Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer
Yes 
Manish Ostwal    Nirmal Bang    Analyst
Yeah  This is Manish Ostwal  not Motilal  Manish Ostwal from Nirmal Bang  My question on the other corporate slippages  The corporate slippage and SME portfolio  Slide number 20  In this quarter  we have reported INR16 86 billion  and these two accounts  we have shared broking account and one South Indian industry  Apart from that  any other major industry contributing to this number compared to last quarter  Because last quarter  the number was INR3 73 billion 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
The number that we have given on Slide 20  which is the other    the INR16 86 billion virtually entire amount will be these two cases  Other than that  it s a very small amount  One more case  it is a very small amount  But these two cases account for the    virtually the entire amount of INR16 86 billion between the broking company that we talked about and the South based industrial company  And as we mentioned on the broking company  we have taken 100  provision on that on a prudent basis 
Manish Ostwal    Nirmal Bang    Analyst
Sure  On the second piece on the retail NPA during this quarter  it is around INR18 9 billion versus INR13 23 billion  and you said the kisan credit card portfolio and the CV portfolio  So can you give the overall    as a percentage of CV portfolio  how much is NPA on that portfolio till date 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
We have not given separately  product wise  NPL numbers  So we can look at that in future  whether we would be giving that out  But I can say that the increase that you have seen in the gross additions on the retail side  you of course have to also look at the deletions  which have gone up somewhat  The net increase  which is there  has come from the kisan credit card portfolio  We gave the total number there of about INR3 billion that we have added on the kisan credit card portfolio in the current quarter  And in the commercial vehicle portfolio  we had income increase again  I think all the banks have talked about that  There is some stress on that portfolio 
Other than that  the trends have been very stable across the retail portfolio  which I mentioned in my opening remarks 
Manish Ostwal    Nirmal Bang    Analyst
Sure  On the last point  on the resolutions side  you said that resolutions during this year  first nine months  has been below our expectation and because of that  credit cost has increased  So now coming to the fourth quarter  with respect to power sector and the other than power sector resolution  how is the progress and what is our net assessment currently 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
As Sandeep mentioned  very clearly  that the credit cost for the current financial year is likely to be similar compared to the number that we have seen for the nine months  So to that extent  it s fair to assume that we are not very hopeful of any resolutions getting completed in the March quarter  And that is the reason why along with the fact that we indeed have taken higher provisions on the two specific accounts that I referred to earlier  So that is the outlook that we have currently  Hopefully  in future  we should be able to get recoveries  But for the March quarter  as of now  we don t see that happening 
Manish Ostwal    Nirmal Bang    Analyst
Sure  Thank you very much

Next question is from the line of Kunal Shah from Edelweiss  Please go ahead 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Yeah  Thanks for taking my question  Firstly  in terms of the recoveries  both SR and the power sector reduction  which is there in  say NPL and BB and below  is that also on account of recovery and getting reflected in the corporate recovery  And what would be the impact of it  say on the PPO PBIT  Any impact on NIMs and all 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
So on the    so if you look at    we have got recoveries in this steel account in the current quarter  So we have received the cash on that  and we also got redemption on the security receipts that I referred to  So going forward  as we deploy that cash  there will be some impact  improvement on the margins  But the overall number  of course  given our portfolio size  it s not something that will reflect in terms of a significant increase  but there will be a benefit that will come in  On the other side  there is a reduction    on the power sector  the decrease was mainly due to some write off of the non performing loans  which you are seeing  So there have really not been any recoveries per se in the current quarter on the power sector 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
So this INR2 000 crores  INR1 800 crores would be write off on the power sector side 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
That is not entirely only power sector  That s the total write off case for the quarter  INR2 000 crores 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Okay  So  INR11 000 to INR9 200 in power sector  so that is  you re saying  primarily write off 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
Yeah 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Okay  And so this improvement in margin  which is there  that is the core margin  that is what you are suggesting  There is no element of recoveries in there  So 3 64  to 3 77   that is largely the core margin  excluding the income tax refund 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
So we have said that there is about 10 basis point of benefit that we have got from the interest on NPL collections  and that would include some interest on the    from the accounts that we recovered during the current quarter  The income tax amount was negligible  So 10 basis points is there  like we said 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
So 10 bps is there  Okay  And the second  in terms of for BB and below  you highlighted the telecom and construction  So is this a telecom also getting reflected in the fund based more than INR1 billion  Or it is primarily in the non fund based exposure 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
So what we give the breakup of BB and below is the total outstanding  That includes fund based and non fund based  These numbers are including both  And of course  this will show up in the other borrowers with outstanding greater than INR1 billion on Slide 21 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Yeah  So I m saying telecom is not only non fund based  that s even in the fund based  more than INR1 billion  So it would be fund based as well  So INR600 crores is the non fund based exposure  and INR1 300 crores is the increase in the fund based of more than INR100 crores  So would telecom    what you are highlighting would have maybe the impact on both of them  or it is only non fund based 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
So Kunal  just to refer  you re talking about Slide 21 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Yeah 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
So the numbers on this table are all including fund based and non fund based outstanding  So other borrowers with outstanding greater than INR1 billion is both fund based and non fund based  So the INR46 62 billion and INR59 78 billion  Speech Overlap  
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Okay  Okay  OK  Sorry  Sorry  Yeah  So this non fund based is largely NPLs  OK  which telecom would not get reflected in that 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
 Indecipherable  telecom will be reflected in the   
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Yeah  I m sorry  Yeah  And any investments in BB and below  which have gone up compared to what it was last time  INR600 crores  INR700 odd crores 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
It is similar  I think last time we had mentioned it s around INR5 billion to INR6 billion  It is actually the same as the September 30  so there is no movement there 
Kunal Shah    Edelweiss    Analyst
Okay  Thank you  Thanks a lot

Thank you  We have the next question from the line of Mohit Surana from CLSA  Please go ahead 
Mohit Surana    CLSA    Analyst
Hi sir  good afternoon  Thanks for taking my questions  I m referring to the Slide number 19  I just wanted a clarification  The recoveries and upgrades in this quarter include INR845 crores  this thing non performing loans to    as a result of debt restructuring in one company  Is this a Karvy Data company that we are talking about 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
No  no  no  Not at all  actually  The broking company that we have referred to    obviously  we can t talk about specific companies  but the broking company that we referred to  that shows up in the gross additions  The corporate and SME additions of INR24 73 billion  that shows up in the addition  This INR8 45 billion is actually a non performing loan  which was already fully provided  which as a part of a debt restructuring scheme  it got converted into preference shares  So technically  it shows up in the movement table  and that s why I wanted to highlight it separately  that it is not actual recovery in the sense of a cash recovery or an upgrade  It is just moved from a loan to a preference share 
It was already 100  provided  There is no P L impact  nor it will show up in the preference shares  This is actually in the power sector  actually  So it s nothing to do with the broking company 
Mohit Surana    CLSA    Analyst
Okay  Because I checked your exchange filings and I did not find anything of this sort  Isn t this supposed to be disclosed to exchanges if you are acquiring any preference shares 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
No  Preference share    conversion is not required  Equity holdings beyond a certain level needs to be disclosed 
Mohit Surana    CLSA    Analyst
Okay  And just a small clarification on Slide number 22  So the downgrade to BB and below exclude the downgrade that can happen from investment grade and subsequently classified as NPL during the same quarter  right  And is there a deviation in the reporting from last quarter  Last quarter  we had INR20 72 billion number further downgrade  Yeah 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
 Indecipherable  this would be comparable to that number  The only thing is that  in addition to this INR26 66 billion  like we have said on Slide 20  INR16 86 billion of amount has lifted directly from investment grade into the NPA bucket  which is virtually entirely the two cases that we have referred  the broking company and the South based industrial company  So INR26 66 billion has slipped into BB and below  And separately  INR16 86 billion  as already highlighted  has slipped into the NPA bucket 
Mohit Surana    CLSA    Analyst
Okay  Got it  Thank you  Thanks for clarifying it

Hi  thanks for the opportunity  First of all  congratulations on the great set of numbers  The question is on the fee income part  In the retail fee income  what percentage of fee income in retail is from the credit card  And second would be on impact of the MDR waiver by the government  What will be the impact of the same  Because one of the peers had highlighted the same  Can you quantify the same  And the second question would be on the credit growth going forward  Assuming the macro environment doesn t change so much  what would be our threshold in terms of growth rate  Can we sustain current trends  both in corporate and retail  That will be all  sir 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
So on credit cards  we have not separately given the fee revenues  The retail income has indeed grown in overall  quite well for the quarter  And the growth has come across the credit cards  the retail liabilities business  debit cards  the lending linked  the fees that we earn on processing loans  So the growth has been well spread across 
On the MDR waiver  I guess we will have to see how it plays out  Of course  there will be some impact for all the banks because of this  But in terms of quantification  as of now  it does not appear to be a very material number per se  But there are definitely other challenges that banks will have with this MDR waiver  and not just banks but the entire system  We have some issues  and we ll have to see how that plays out  But just from a number perspective  as of now  it would not be a very material number in terms of the announcement  which has been made for the RuPay cards and the UPI transactions 
On credit growth  our sense continues to be the same that we have been saying that as long as we see opportunity for growth within our risk parameters  where the return of capital is assured in our assessment and we make adequate returns as per our requirement  we will be happy to grow that portfolio  And we don t have any specific loan growth targets or loan composition targets per se  So as of now  the opportunity was such that we were able to grow at about 16   You saw the growth on the retail side  Even on the corporate side  we have seen the performing portfolio growing at close to 12   This is after we had stayed away from some of the lending  which is very finely priced as well  So we are looking at it entirely from a contribution to the core operating profit across each of the businesses

Operator
Sure  thank you  Next question is from the line of Rakesh Kumar from Elara Capital  Please go ahead 
Rakesh Kumar    Elara Capital    Analyst
The question was related to the retail sector  the retail portfolio growth this quarter  As we see  the growth was quite high in the personal loans and the credit cards  And also if we see there is a rise in the gross NPA number sequentially  So it has come from kisan credit card  as you are saying  but given the scenario conviction  right now  and the overall leverage for the retail loans  which I think kind of coming from the RBI data  if you look at last 40 years data  so the customer    retail customer leverage is all time high  And we are still growing these books at a much higher rate  So just need your input on this  Thank you  sir 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
So the increase in the costs  retail NPLs that you have seen  as I said  it has come from the kisan credit card portfolio and from the commercial vehicle portfolio  in addition to the normal growth across the other segments  And as I mentioned earlier  the delinquency parameters across vintages in the personal loan and the credit card portfolios have been stable and well within our internal thresholds  A lot of the growth is also being driven in personal loans and credit cards from the existing customers of the bank 
And as you know  if you go back three years  we were not really growing this portfolio as much  So we clearly see an opportunity for growth to be there  And I would ask Anup to add on to this 
Anup Bagchi    Executive Director
So actually  if you see the absolute growth    absolute rupee growth between    in this quarter  you will see that it is very broad based in the sense that if you see personal loan and credit card unsecured  in Slide number 12  as the overall proportion of the total growth  you will see that it is a very  very    one third    it is less than one third  Actually  our collateral book  in absolute sense  has grown in size  and that should give comfort because percentages are looking slightly different because of the lower base  But actually  in absolute basis  the mix is very  very healthy  It would be one third  two third between unsecured and secured 
Rakesh Kumar    Elara Capital    Analyst
Hello 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
Yeah 
Rakesh Kumar    Elara Capital    Analyst
One more question  if I could ask  Pertaining to non capital borrowing book  which has come down quite drastically this quarter on a sequential basis  So does it basically has a relation with the credit growth number  what we are anticipating in the future 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
What    which number has come down very sharply 
Rakesh Kumar    Elara Capital    Analyst
This non capital borrowing number has come down to INR522 billion  from INR615 billion 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
Yeah 
Rakesh Kumar    Elara Capital    Analyst
So my question is that are we so    like  are we going to raise that non capital borrowing soon  Or are we not that excited about the growth  So how is the scenario 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
Well  I think we are more excited about the deposit growth that we are seeing in the sense that the deposit growth has been very healthy  And we have been able to bring down our reliance on the borrowings  If you look at the last 12 to 18 months  there has been quite a consistent trend of our borrowings not increasing  while we have seen the deposit growth being very healthy  So it reflects that  So where we are focused on the borrowings is  one  of course  are the capital instruments which comes as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital  Then to the extent that we access refinancing from some of the institutions  that is something which comes at a relatively lower cost 
Other than that  the other borrowings are generally either short term borrowings or would be slightly higher cost  So we are quite happy to bring that down and replace that with deposits  Also  because these numbers would include    on a period end  it would include borrowings which are short term in nature like repo borrowing or those kind of things as well  So we are seeing some decline in that    in the non capital instruments  So I don t think you should interpret this to mean anything from our aspiration of growth or expectation of growth  It is more from our balance sheet management point of view and cost of funds management point of view that we look at these borrowings

Thank you  We take the next question from the line of Ashish Golechha from Ajit Securities  Phonetic   Please go ahead 
Ashish Golechha    Ajit Securities    Analyst
Thank you very much  sir  for the good set of numbers  My question was with respect to BB portfolio  Our BB portfolio has been basically at INR17 403 crores compared to INR17 525 crores  So I wanted    what is our road map for coming next three quarters and next one year  First question  And second question was that in the call  you had said that with respect to the telecom exposure  you have already downgraded one account  So wanted to know your views that whether we are going to take any provisions with respect to the telecom exposure  Or what is our road map on that 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  So on the telecom  what we mentioned that    one account has been downgraded from investment grade to below investment grade  So that does not require any provision to be taken  That s what    that downgrade was also off an internal rating of the borrower based on the developments that happened during the December quarter  So that was on telecom 
On the BB and below portfolio  it s very difficult to kind of give a specific outlook on the INR174 billion of the outstanding that we have  But if you look at that portfolio  there is a part of it which is the non fund outstanding to non performing loans  which generally would be at higher risk because it corresponds to non performing loans  other than in a couple of instances where it would be doing fine  So that generally would be at a higher risk  The borrowers under RBI regulation scheme  again  typically because they have kind of undergone some sort of restructuring in the past and have continued in this bucket  So again  they would carry a reasonable amount of risk in terms of the performance of the portfolio  And one of the borrowers in that is kind of a large ish exposure that we have  which we used to disclose in earlier as well 
The other borrowers  less than INR1 billion  this granular portfolio  we ll keep on seeing movement on that on a quarter on quarter basis  And greater than INR1 billion  this quarter  the telecom addition came in  But otherwise  like we said in our previous call  and I think that situation still remains  is that we would expect just given the overall environment which is there  that there could be higher than the normal kind of downgrades into the BB and below category  So in the first couple of quarters of this financial year    in the first quarter  we had seen about INR10 billion of downgrades  September quarter  we had seen INR20 billion  and that s when we mentioned that for a couple of quarters  the numbers could be elevated  And that is    that continues to be our assessment as of now as well 
Ashish Golechha    Ajit Securities    Analyst
Sir  my question was that on the assessment part  where do you see this reaching a basically constant level  Or where do you see the reduction coming in this going ahead  Because in the last con call  you had said that next two  three quarters  you expected to see some elevated levels  Because generally  in banks  you would be doing assessment that where do you see this level is coming lower and lower quarter by quarter 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
No  so  it s very difficult to kind of estimate that on a quarter on quarter basis in a corporate portfolio  I think overall number    to give context also  at INR174 billion  if you look at it from our total loans perspective  total loans and non fund  it is less than 3   And at any point of time  there will be some portfolio which will always be below investment grade  So beyond that  it s very difficult to assess borrower by borrower or quarter by quarter 
Ashish Golechha    Ajit Securities    Analyst
Sir  thank you very much  One last question was  with respect to new engines of growth  with respect to business banking and SME segment  what is the future road map  Like how do we see our bank    ICICI Bank growing this segment with respect to business banking and SME segment 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
I ll ask Anup here 
Anup Bagchi    Executive Director
Business banking and small SME  which is the smaller    so our endeavor is to keep bringing down the ticket size  collateralize it very well  and have good visibility of cash flows  These are the three  and in a parameterized way  we want to move ahead  So that has been    we have been doing it for quite some time now  And even with the aging of the portfolio  because some part of the portfolio is well aged  it is holding up quite well 
Ashish Golechha    Ajit Securities    Analyst

Thank you  We take the next question from the line of Pavan Ahluwalia from Laburnum Capital  Please go ahead 
Pavan Ahluwalia    Laburnum Capital    Analyst
Thank you  Two questions  One  since it looks like    you ve been very candid in terms of portioning that economic volatility can obviously result in volatility in credit quality  Just curious to get your take  In a slightly rougher macro environment  what does that do to your growth targets  And what do you expect the growth engines to be  Specifically on SME and business banking  how is this growth actually playing out  Is this a function of your branch network expanding  Are you going in and taking over clients from PSUs because they re not getting their full limits elsewhere  What is actually leading to the strong growth in this segment  which you call SME  other people may call mid corporate because you re obviously one of the largest banks 
The second question is on your expenses  We saw a lower trend growth in employee expenses and much higher growth in operating expenses  I just wanted to understand what was going on there  And is this a classification issue where you may have changed where you classify some expenses 
Anup Bagchi    Executive Director
I think you might have had a chance to look at our investor presentations on the Digital Day that we did  And much of the answers to your questions actually lie in that presentation  And that is the two trends that we are certainly seeing  is that there is a capacity in banking as far as lending to good quality business banking customers are concerned  and they re certainly looking at a quick delivery  They are certainly looking at our holistic servicing  And with our wide footprint and with the digital solutions  I think they re quite liking the fact that they can save time  get greater efficiency into the businesses  And with decongested processes  we are able to deliver credit very quickly 
So I would say that these are the three big drivers of growth  Also  the fact is that our market share there is low  and our base is low  So the percentages look higher  But if you look at in absolute amount also  it is quite healthy  And we see that we are able to apply credit filters  apply a lot of underwriting parameters  which are there with us  all external signals of underwriting and originate to our branches  mostly because almost 100  is originated to our branches now  So originate to our branches  taken through credit filters  give higher credit delivery  service it through digital means  And if you see  there is a slide on InstaBIZ  You will see that it s quite a differentiated solution that we are giving 
I think clients are liking it and the clients are moving  also helped and aided by the fact that large part of banking system is also constrained in lending to these two equities  Yeah  and   
Pavan Ahluwalia    Laburnum Capital    Analyst
So is it safe to assume that most of your clients you re gaining from there are from PSUs or old private sector banks 
Anup Bagchi    Executive Director
No  no  I think we have studied this  I think it is quite widespread  So it is not just PSUs  It is PSUs as well as new private sector as well as old private sectors  And also  what we have done is using digital capabilities  our GST OD product and the current account OD product  they are also moving quite well  So actually  there is a mix  So when we look at our portfolio  the new to credit  we are able to do it  short term loans  using cash flow and    cash flow and digital underwriting  that is holding up also quite well  But it is actually quite widespread  It is not true that it is only PSUs 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
The other question on the expenses  I think on the non employee expenses  where we have seen 26  increase during the quarter  I think as we said during the beginning of the year that we are looking at incurring expenses on branch expansions and other business related expenses  So if you look at the nine month run rate  it s running at around 20  for both employee expenses and the non employee expenses  And this includes expenses which are almost entirely related to the business growth  so credit card business  increasing the reward point expenses  which have happened  We purchase priority sector lending certificates  PSLCs  That has some expenses which comes in 
So all of this    advertisement expenses  which are there  technology expenses  So all of these are expenses which we believe will drive or are driving the core operating profit of the bank  And the focus is to grow the revenues at a faster pace than these expenses

Thank you  We take the next question from the line of Kshitiz Prasad from Maybank  Please go ahead 
Kshitiz Prasad    Maybank    Analyst
Yeah  hi  Just wanted to understand your views on a certain macro parameters  One  that 135 bps cut in the repo rate  how does that has affected the liquidity in the banking system and the linkages of some of these retail products to evaporate  How has been your experience so far as one of the largest banks  Second is that are you seeing the stress in the NBFC sector easing out  Are you lending to them  Or what is your take on that sector as well  So please  if you can elaborate your experience and share with us  Thank you 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
So as you know  from October  all banks have been making loans  the home loans and other MSME loans  the floating rate loans linked to the repo rate  So of course  it is too short a time period to kind of fully assess the impact  Until now  of course  the repo rate movement  there has not been much of a movement which has happened in that sense  So we are quite fine with our experience till now  Our belief is that over the cycle  I think it will all average out and it should be fine  But there would be    there could be periods of time when the movement in repo rate and the underlying funding cost for banks may not be fully aligned  So there could be some quarters in which it could impact positively or negatively  That we will have to see how it progresses 
On the repo rate cuts by RBI  I think that has happened  And more importantly  over the last now six to nine months  RBI has also ensured significant liquidity in the system  So the system has significant surplus  and that has reduced the funding costs  the wholesale deposit costs  Banks have been able to reduce their retail deposit costs as well  And we have been reducing our MCLR  which is the benchmark rate as and when we review it on a monthly basis  That is something which will continue to flow through  Again  it s a function of how RBI assesses and decides on the rates and liquidity going forward 
On the NBFC and HFC portfolio  we have given our outstanding to these sectors in our presentation  So we are quite happy to link to NBFCs and HFCs because a number of them are doing pretty fine and extremely well  actually  And given any opportunity for lending that we see where the risk is within our threshold and returns are adequate  we are quite happy to make loans to them  So as I said  currently  about 5  of our loans would be to NBFCs and HFCs

Yeah  hi sir  good evening and thanks for the opportunity  Sir  if you can sort of give sectoral    at least if you name the sector in this INR174 billion book  apart from telecom and construction  so probably    and if you have the broad percentage 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
So it will essentially be power  telecom  so infrastructure  if you look at it broadly  Power  telecom  maybe some road or something like that  and construction  I think these will account for nearly two thirds of the INR174 billion  And then there will be borrowers across sectors 
Jai Mundhra    B K Securities    Analyst
Sure  sir  And sir  do you have any standard ICA pipeline or wherever you have signed or are likely to sign the cases for ICA for the standard category

Thank you  We take the next question from the line of Manoj Bahety from Carnelian Capital  Please go ahead 
Manoj Bahety    Carnelian Capital    Analyst
Hi sir  thanks for taking my question  First of all  congratulations to the ICICI Bank team for a decent set of performance  So I have a couple of questions  The first question is  like when I was hearing the con calls of other ICICI group companies  everybody was talking like the kind of higher synergy benefits which has started flowing in terms of their higher businesses and all from ICICI Bank  So is there some change which has happened recently  And how ICICI Bank is seeing these kind of synergy benefits flowing into the fee income 
Also  if you can quantify like what proportion of your fee income is coming from ICICI group companies 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
So I think the focus that the bank and the group companies have on leveraging the synergy  I would say that has got enhanced a lot in the last two or three quarters  And as we have mentioned earlier  in terms of our approach on the core operating profit and the One Bank  One ROE focus that we have  where we look at all the business groups and the group companies  and see how we can leverage relationship to make the maximum value for the group and the bank  So that has meant that all the teams are    within the bank and with the group companies  are working together in terms of all the products and services  So of course  from the bank s point of view  the focus is not just on third party distribution and making fees  So that is one of the elements which is there 
So as long as those products make good sense for the customer  we are happy to sell that and make revenues there  But that is not something which is a core driver  I would say  of fee revenues  So it s more about leveraging the opportunity which is there across the group 
Manoj Bahety    Carnelian Capital    Analyst
Okay  And my second question is like  if I look at the current state of economy  the kind of job losses which are happening and the kind of stress which is there across sectors  which are like job creators  and at this time  like when the retail loans are growing  so what early signals which you will be watching like while creating or writing or scaling up the retail book to ensure that the kind of credit cost guidance which you are giving    in that  I just wanted to understand like what kind of early signals you will be watching while writing the retail book 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
So from our point of view  we look at all the data that is available from the larger system  But we indeed focus a lot in terms of our own portfolio  We look at    so for each of the portfolio  each of the segments  we have internally defined thresholds and that we look at on a regular basis  on a month on month basis  And if we see any trends  which are not in line with our expectation  we take proactive steps for each of the portfolios  And this is happening at a product level  at a customer segment level  at a geographic level  And that is the best way to kind of look at it and look at the early bucket delinquencies as well  In addition to that  of course  one is able to get a lot of data from the credit bureaus also  and that gives an overall sense of how the portfolio for the market is behaving 
We also  of course  factor in that  like we discussed for our personal loan  credit card business  a lot of the business is coming from our existing customers where we have a lot more data on the customers compared to what you otherwise would have  And for the sourcing that we are doing from outside also  we would look at the various parameters that are available  And some of the partnerships that we have done  like  say the Amazon partnership  will help us source credit cards from new to bank customers with some parameters being available through that partnership  So that is how we are looking at it 
And I think as we mentioned earlier  as of now  we are seeing quite stable trends across most of the portfolios  other than the commercial vehicle and the kisan credit card portfolio 
Manoj Bahety    Carnelian Capital    Analyst
So as of now  you are not seeing any early signs of problem or trouble  right  on the retail or SME portfolio 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
As I said  excluding the kisan credit card portfolio and the commercial vehicle portfolio  we are seeing signs which are quite stable across the unsecured portfolio or the new car loans or mortgages 
Manoj Bahety    Carnelian Capital    Analyst

Thank you  We take the next question from the line of Saikiran Pulavarthi from Haitong Securities  Please go ahead 
Saikiran Pulavarthi    Haitong Securities    Analyst
Hi  The margins in the FY  20 has been more broadly in range between 3 9  to 4   Do you    what I can say  where do you see this stabilizing over a period of time  Do you see any further scope of improvement as such 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
So I think we would  of course  still be looking at  from a business mix perspective  if some improvement can come in  if from pricing loans in some of the segments in a better manner  we can come up with some improvement in the yields  On the funding cost also  we ll see if we can optimize further  On the flip side  I think a lot of the benefit on the funding cost has come in  I think if you look at the benchmark rates for us  it has come down a fair bit in the last few months  So going forward  in the next six to nine months  we will see some of the MCLR linked loans getting reset at a lower level  which would be about maybe 40 basis points lower level because of the decline in the MCLR  which has happened 
So there will be a lot of moving parts which are there  Of course  in this quarter  we also had about 10 basis point benefit from the NPL interest collections as such  So it s very difficult for us to give a number  What we can assure is that we are focused on the core operating profit and improving that  And as a part of that  margin is a key driver for that as well  But depending on how significant the liquidity in the system remains  how much the loan demand and competition which is there  we ll have to see all that aspects as well  And at some stage  what will also happen is that the deposit rate cannot reduced beyond a certain level  So already  I think we have reduced our deposit rates quite sharply even on the retail side  The peak rate that we offer is 6 4  
So from here on  it may not be as a rapid reduction that we would see  as we have seen till now  So that is the other flip side which is there  So these are the drivers  and we have to see how it plays out 
Saikiran Pulavarthi    Haitong Securities    Analyst
Got it  And the second question is  some of the select portfolios  especially in the last two  three years  came off from a low base  and then you were playing the penetration story  But even if I look at on the growth rate s perspective  they are pretty much high growth rates  How do you see this from the risk perspective  primarily on not being much seasoned and probably some of these customers came in for the first time in some of the select products  Would you like to take a pause  maybe lowering the growth rates  Or do you think that is not needed  and there is further long headway for the penetration to the existing customers in some of these products 
Anup Bagchi    Executive Director
I think two things  One is  I would still say that we have some way to go as far as optimal penetration of these products to our customers  If you look at a very large peer bank  on the liability side  our bases are quite similar  But if you look at the asset side  we are quite under penetrated  So that is one  The second one is that I think with the    in the last four  five years  I think there are a lot more signals on credit underwriting  So that may fit    I will not say safer  but it certainly gives a higher level of confidence on underwriting on the unsecured part  Third  I would say that base is low  and so percentages look high  But we have to look at absolute levels  And that would be a good way of looking at it because our objective is to create a very balanced book  Actually  if you look at our book  only one third will be coming from unsecured of the total incremental  While if you look at many other peers  upwards of 50   60  comes from unsecured 
To that extent  we want to create a book which is more broad based  which doesn t have concentration risk because each of our businesses have 3   4   Phonetic  of the overall book  actually  We don t have a book which is very  very high concentrated on one  We also look at capital allocation properly and low ROE businesses when NIMs are very low  That cannot absorb too much of credit costs  So we also look at lesser capital to areas where we think that the capital deployment will not give us adequate returns  So that means one must have some NIM plus fees  so that in a volatile situation  at least one can absorb it positively  Even when we look at our KCC portfolio  because it is priced properly  actually across the cycle  we make a decent ROE on the KCC portfolio as well  even though we are well aware that it hurts at this point of time and the costs are slightly higher  But over a cycle  we have seen that it works out well if we have enough margins to take the cushion 
Saikiran Pulavarthi    Haitong Securities    Analyst
Got it  One last question  Just there is  what I can see  improvement in the Tier 1  primarily the CET1  I think the risk weighted assets growth has been pretty lower than versus the balance sheet growth  Can you just explain what s the reason behind this 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
So on the CET1  of course  during the quarter  the profit also has got added  So this is including the profits for the nine months and for the quarter  So that has led to an increase in the CET1  On the risk weighted assets  there is nothing specific in this quarter which has changed between September 30 and December 31  It would just be based on the rating of the    on the corporate side and the portfolio on the retail side that we have grown 
Saikiran Pulavarthi    Haitong Securities    Analyst

Thank you  We take the next question from the line of Manish Shukla from Citigroup  Please go ahead 
Manish Shukla    Citigroup    Analyst
Yeah  good evening  What could be the CET1 threshold at which you would want to start evaluating a capital raise  will it be 13   or would it be lower 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
I think the evaluation of a capital raise  in that sense  happens at all points of time per se  But you would know that at what level private banks generally look at a capital raise  So we don t have a particular threshold in mind at which point of time we ll start evaluating or start raising capital  I think our response  which came in  was in the context of the press articles which had come out  And that s why we kind of clarified that we are not in the process of raising capital  And we have a pretty comfortable level of CET1 ratio at December 31  And like any bank  we will keep evaluating the capital position and requirements depending on the market conditions  growth opportunities and regulatory developments  Beyond that  it s very difficult to comment 
Manish Shukla    Citigroup    Analyst
And on consol ROE for the quarter  you already had 15 5   Would you like to give a new number there  which will you aspire for 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
In the quarter  I think we indeed have got some benefit from the write backs on the steel account  which happened  Of course  there was an offsetting incremental provision  which also came on a couple of accounts that we talked about  And the treasury income was somewhat higher than what you would expect in a normalized quarter  So I think from a run rate basis  maybe we are still a couple of quarters away in terms of being there  in terms of the number that we have talked about of 15   So we will stay with 15  for June 2020 as what we are looking forward to

Hi  thanks for the opportunity  One question  One is on the NBFC and HFC  Any of those basically turn NPA in this quarter  Like in our NPA formation  do we have NBFC  HFC 
Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
No  No  I think on the corporate side  we have talked about the two accounts actually  and that constitute the bulk of the addition which are there  the broking company and the other industrial company  And in terms of the other    on HFC  which is there  which has been under resolution and all of that  you would    that has been classified some time back  We didn t have a loan there  We had some investment  which is classified and provided for actually quite some time back

Rakesh Jha    Chief Financial Officer
I think we have a strategy there in terms of the growth that we are looking at  So of course  they would not be requiring any fresh capital  And if at any stage there is a surplus in terms of capital that we see there  they could look at repatriation  But as of now  there s nothing which is on the anvil  I would say

ICICI Bank Limited  NYSE IBN  decided to file an application in the National Company Law Tribunal against Innoventive Industries Ltd  NS INNV  in order to start a corporate insolvency process that covers the new bankruptcy law 
It has been said that this was the first case filed in India under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code  2016  in which a primer will be provided to help discuss the banking system s bad loans worth Rs 6 7 trillion

187367,408883,IBN,India s Essar Steel  Battling Weak Demand With Debt Tricks,opinion,A global producer of steel with a footprint in Canada  the US  the Middle East and Asia  India s Essar Steel has been riding some pretty rough weather as of late  The steel company has decided to change the denomination of its debt from rupee to dollar as part of its strategy to reduce its overall financial burden  Recently  the company raised about US  1 billion through the External Commercial Borrowing  ECB  route to repay its rupee denominated debt  The borrowing was done at London Interbank Offered Rate  Libor  plus 4 5 5 5 percent  The one year Libor is at 0 67 percent  Explaining the rationale behind the move  company Chief Financial Officer Ashutosh Agarwala told reporters here that the company earned approximately  800 million to  1 billion by way of exports  accounting for 25 percent of its total revenue  Of late  the company has been focusing on exports of value added steel  It only then makes sense to convert the outstanding elements to payment in US dollar  Essar pays interest of 12 12 5 percent on its rupee loans  and the new move may bring this down to about 6 percent  and help the company save about  74 million  Essar Steel  like any other global steel manufacturer  has been trying its damnedest to battle the global downturn and weak demand  Agarwala said it was imperative that the debt of the company was aligned to the earning currency  thereby reducing volatility in earnings  Further  as steel prices in India were also benchmarked to international markets  this would mean a higher correlation between the company s earnings and dollar movement   said the ECB had been subscribed by a large group of banks led by IDBI and ICICI Bank  Essar Steel s net loss has more than doubled in the last fiscal year to about  460 million as its performance was impacted by a host of reasons  including lower sales and a rise in interest payments  The company had recently expanded its steel production capacity to 10 million tons per year from 4 6 million tons per year  More Steel Company Losses Another Group company  the US based  privately held Essar Steel Algoma Inc   had reported a net loss of US  92 7 million in its fiscal 2013 fourth quarter ended March 31  up from a net loss of US  18 million in the same year earlier period  Sales for the quarter totaled  447 7 million  with shipments of 638 652 tons  down 1 5 percent from the corresponding quarter the previous year  Explaining the loss  the company had said it was primarily a result of lower volumes  lower selling prices and higher costs  and unrecognized tax losses for which no deferred tax assets were recognized  partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense  For the full year  the company reported a net loss of  203 3 million  compared with a fiscal 2012 profit of  38 1 million  Hopefully  the dollar linked earnings would serve as a natural hedge to reduce the risks associated with currency fluctuations  the company said in a statement  Another top ranking Essar official said they were looking at various structures  including securitization  to further dollarize the remaining portion of the debt by Sohrab Darabshaw,2013-06-30,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/india’s-essar-steel:-battling-weak-demand-with-debt-tricks-173409,173409

187369,408885,IBN,Foreign Banks Face Tough Road To Recovery,opinion,"Qualms across the globe and the consequent downgrade of the global economic growth forecast by the World Bank are expected to be reflected in the global banking space in the quarters ahead  The still recovering industry will take some time to deal with continuing geopolitical and political uncertainties  fiscal policy gridlock  and ever increasing regulatory restrictions  Overall  the industry s upturn is expected to soften to some extent  if not pause  in the near future  The ongoing requirement of keeping interest rates low to support economic growth is still felt necessary by central banks  including the U S  Federal Reserve  This will continue to restrict the industry s interest income  Not only are U S  banks losing their luster with too many mandatory defensive measures  the non U S  banking space is also facing similar obstacles in their path to growth The European Central Bank  ECB  announced additional rate cuts earlier this month  In fact  in a historic step  the ECB started charging banks for deposits so that they are compelled to create more loans  This would instill confidence in low interest rates among other developed nations    On the other hand  economic growth in China and some other developing countries has been put on pause  Following the same remedial course for better economic health would only pose a new set of challenges for the banks of these regions   Further  any action to lower interest rates would elevate inflation issues 
Actually  for the developing countries  it could be a catch 22 situation  If the central banks of developed nations let interest rates rise  investments in developing countries will be withdrawn  which will lead to contraction of liquidity in these economies  In any case  the proactive steps taken by the central banks of most developed and emerging economies will continue to keep non U S  banks afloat in the near term  But the global financial system is yet to show tidiness to ensure a steady backdrop for banks 
Fundamental Issues
Repositioning of business fundamentals to withstand any further crisis remains the trend of non U S  banks  Though defensive actions like limiting expenses are still in place and focus on noninterest income is increasing  margin compression and slothful loan growth are acting as major dampeners  As capital efficiency is the key to survival  most foreign banks are adopting reconstruction by asset sale strategies to strengthen capital ratios  While this will make their business safer  growth prospects don t look impressive with thinning sources of income 
Strained Top line Growth
A prolonged low interest rate environment is not expected to reverse any time soon as central banks of most of the countries will continue to prioritize growth over inflation control  This strategy is sustainable as inflation is the concern of only a few emerging economies  Thus  banks operating in a low interest rate environment will not be able boost revenue through interest income  On the other hand  non interest revenue sources will be limited by regulatory restrictions  On the other hand  banks in consumption driven economies will not face significant challenges related to interest income due to a not too low interest rate environment  Though these economies have been witnessing a sluggish growth rate  still high inflation will continue to force the central banks of these countries to keep interest rates higher than the low inflation economies  However  these banks will have no respite from nagging non interest revenue challenges 
What to Expect Down the Road 
Funding insufficiency  not so effective cost control measures  and limited access to revenue sources will keep bottom line improvement under pressure in the upcoming quarters  Moreover  the impact of tighter regulations is yet to be fully felt with many rules still to be implemented across jurisdictions  Continued attempts by regulators worldwide to agree on strict capital standards and clip the risk taking attitude of banks so as to prevent the recurrence of a global financial crisis will restrain the growth potential of some industry participants  The full implementation of the Basel III standards   the risk proof capital standard agreed upon by regulators across the world   is due in 2018  Though some non U S  banks have already started complying with the requirements  many are yet to make headway  To add to the difficulty  the latest changes indicate that banks need to hold more capital than what the Basel Committee mandated initially  Nonetheless  strict lending limits as well as greater transparency in regulations could strengthen the fundamentals of many sector participants  Eventually  these are expected to create a less risky lane for the overall industry 
What Fed Rules for Foreign Banks Mean
The Federal Reserve s stricter capital rules for foreign banking organizations  FBOs  sizably operating in the U S  could cripple their balance sheet  According to the new rules  the U S  operations of foreign banks need to hold various risk based capital  liquidity and leverage similar to their U S  peers with effect from July 1  2016  This will force foreign banks to transfer their costly capital from their home ground to the U S  So their overall profitability could suffer as they need to spend more on the same business in the U S  But for low margin businesses like repo and securities lending  in particular  transferring capital and liquidity to U S  operations will not be beneficial for FBOs  Given this concern  Deutsche Bank AG  NYSE DB  has already planned to reduce its U S  balance sheet by  100 billion  Other foreign banks could also follow suit by axing their low margin businesses in the U S      
Where Does the Eurozone Recovery Stand 
In order to accelerate the snail s pace of recovery in the region  ECB cut interest rates to record lows and introduced a number of measures to pump more money into the financial system earlier this month  Apart from addressing the rock bottom inflation rate in the continent  these measures are intended to ease pressure on the strong euro  which is holding back economic recovery  Reducing the euro s value with these measures will make European goods less expensive abroad  and thereby boost exports  Though economic growth in the continent was much lower than expected in the first quarter of 2014  the downside risk of the economy appears much lesser than what it was a year ago  While the economy advanced 0 2  sequentially last quarter compared with 0 3  in the final quarter of 2014  it marks the fourth straight quarter of growth following the end of an 18 month recession  A sharp recovery in consumer confidence  strengthening manufacturing performance and faster than expected growth in private sector business activities confirm the fundamental recovery of the economy  Global banks  concern about the Eurozone crisis has significantly eased  In fact  this has been translating into strength for some of the non U S  banking giants  The steps taken by European policymakers have significantly helped in stabilizing the economy  Primarily  the ECB s long term refinancing operations have helped in injecting liquidity into the system  Further  the continent is at the final stage of setting up a banking union in order to restore confidence in the continent s banks and stimulate lending  This will allow the ECB to intervene directly in large banks in countries that use the euro  This new approach should help banks to tidy up and ensure consumer protection in economically weaker countries like Spain  Italy and Portugal  This will in turn make banking activities more transparent and support the continent s economic recovery 
Behind Emerging Market Banks
China s economy has been witnessing a slowdown  The World Bank expects the growth rate of the world s second biggest economy to drop 0 1  every year until 2016  However  this is presumably a planned slowdown aimed at driving growth by focusing on consumption spending  Of course  this growth  if achieved  will be more sustainable than what exports  infrastructure development and investment in real estate have been leading to so far  However  the resultant slowdown in exports of China dependent developing countries could translate into challenges for the banks of these economies      Further  continued tapering of stimulus in the U S  will lead to gradual liquidity reduction in emerging markets  as the Fed pumped fund that overflowed to emerging markets will be withdrawn to meet the rising demand for money in the U S  economy  Now  with liquidity levels drying up  the banking sector in the emerging markets will face a deceleration  Moreover  the asset quality trouble is still obvious  But this is not as severe as the problems that many of the larger banks face in continental Europe and the United Kingdom  Hopefully  less exposure to property markets and steady interest income from a not too low interest rate environment will help these banks tide over to some extent 
Conclusion
Overall  a key determinant for a quick recovery will be the quality of risk analysis and risk awareness in decision making  So  we believe that accumulating larger capital buffers over the cycle and reducing pointless complexity in business will be crucial to performances of non U S  banks  Also  only cost reduction by job cuts and asset sales should no longer be considered enough  Instead  the aim should be to enhance operational efficiency through fundamental changes in business models  The capital goal of non U S  banks should not be restricted to simply obedience to regulatory requirements  On the other hand  policymakers should primarily pay attention on determining the span of fiscal stimulus  ensuring that it remains until a clear sign of transition from recovery to growth is visible

187400,408916,IBN,An Emerging Market That Could Go On A Major Run Very Soon,opinion,With just a quick glance  the whole  invest in India  craze appears to have run its course  India s stock market  the Bombay Stock Exchange Sensex Index  rallied more than 200  between March of 2009 and late 2010  Then  a rather nasty 25  pullback in 2011 doled out enough pain to make investors think twice about investing again  In fact  you could say Indian stocks are now completely out of favor    And that s exactly why now s the time to start digging in      The contrarian case  India has been one of those confusing markets recently  rewarding those who were willing to go against the grain and take on contrarian  unpopular stances    Take last November for instance  After more than a 20  decline pulled the Sensex down to a low 15 745  beaten up investors of India s stocks began to seriously entertain doubts about the country s future investment worthiness  Darashaw   Co  analysts had projected sub 15 000 levels were in the cards  based on bearish momentum and plenty of pessimism  Not only did the Sensex Index not slide any further below 15 745  but it was back to the 18 500 area by February    a 17  rebound right when investors had all but given up  On the flipside  in November of 2010  after the SENSEX had posted 12 month gains of 23   traders were understandably hot on the emerging market  As a Forbes article noted that month   Maybe it s the right time for outside investors to seriously think about joining the India bandwagon   Heeding the advice would have been a big mistake  as that was the beginning of a 23  sell off  So why does this matter now  Because the Indian market s 6 5  dip since February once again has India s investors worried There s an edge to a contrarian bullish stance this time around  though  Indian stock valuations are at historical lows  Indian brokerage firm Sharekhan says the current average price to earnings  P E  ratio for India s stocks right now is around 13  compared with a long term average of 18  Historically speaking  once Indian stocks become this cheap  a 65  to 70  advance materializes over the next two to three years If that s not convincing enough  then try this on for size  A hefty  9 billion worth of India s stocks have already been purchased by overseas investors so far this year  which is more than half of the total amount of foreign investment in India for all of 2011  Clearly  investors are beginning to see the opportunity  and there s plenty of reason for the interest  There are several ways to play such a rebound  One of them is the obvious    an Indian exchange traded fund  ETF  like the iPath MSCI India Index ETN  NYSE  INP   But for investors who want to up the ante  so to speak  there are two standout Indian companies that trade as ADRs  American depository receipts  in the United States right now    One of them is Tata Communications  NYSE  TCL   Tata Communications is a telecom infrastructure company that has fought its way to the front of the line for many emerging markets  In fact  it interconnects more than 200 different countries with its Tier 1 IP network  That footprint could get a lot bigger real soon  as the company has completed the world s first wholly owned  round the world  cable network ring    At the same time  Tata Communications is in a position to become more effective and efficient while marketing that network  Currently  it s a hodge podge of several distinct telecom entities  but it began to integrate all of them in February  It s also one of only a couple of known bidders for the United Kingdom s telecom company Cable   Wireless Worldwide  Bringing that established entity into the fold would further bolster the Tata footprint    The other Indian stock worth a closer look is ICICI Bank Ltd   NYSE  IBN   Yes  though the buzz is that asset quality for India s banks is weakening  ICICI has been seen as an exception to that norm  the state s credit rating agency still views the organization as still worthy of its  AAA  rating    ICICI shares trade at only about 16 times trailing earnings  compared with smaller competitors that trade at 20 times earnings or more  While those other stocks superficially seem to deserve a premium ICICI can t justify  there is flipside to the coin  Those other banks are also highly rate sensitive  whereas ICICI Bank drives a considerable amount of fee based revenue  If India s high interest rates start to creep lower  then ICICI will be standing on much more solid ground    Risks to Consider  There s always the possibility that political turmoil and policy changes can change the landscape of investing abroad  India is no exception    An ETF is the easy and safe way to play India s rebound  but the two stocks I mentioned are likely to be more potent  by James Brumley,2012-04-18,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/an-emerging-market-that-could-go-on-a-major-run-very-soon-120555,120555

187514,409030,IBN,UPDATE 2 Essar plans up to  3 bln London listing   sources,news,"  Plans to sell 20 25 pct stake in energy  power ops sources
   Listing seen in late April   sources
   Hires JPMorgan Cazenove  Deutsche Bank for sale
  Adds analyst s comments in paragraphs 6 7 
 By Surojit Gupta and Pratish Narayanan
 MUMBAI  March 8  Reuters    Indian conglomerate Essar Group
plans to raise about  2 5  3 billion by listing its energy and
power businesses on the London bourse in late April  tapping
new investors to fund its ambitious expansion plans 
 The company will sell a 20 percent stake in the operations 
one source said  while another said the company could sell
20 25 percent  Essar has hired JPMorgan Cazenove and Deutsche
Bank to handle the deal  said the two sources with knowledge of
the situation  They asked not to be identified as they were not
authorised to speak to the media 
 The sale would help expansion plans at Essar  controlled by
billionaire brothers Shashi and Ravi Ruia and whose interests
span telecoms and energy to steel and shipping 
 The group s energy and power operations are valued at about
 12 billion  one of the sources said 
 Essar Oil  a group firm  is in talks with Royal Dutch Shell
to buy three European refineries 
 The company  which runs a 280 000 barrels per day refinery
in western India and owns a 50 percent stake in a Kenyan
refinery  is pursuing the deal as part of plans to have a
refining capacity of 1 million barrels a day 
  The group may be thinking of listing abroad to reflect the
assets they might get abroad   Sonam Udasi  vice president at
BRICS Securities  said 
  Also  once they raise equity abroad  they may be able to
raise debt as well  which will be cheaper than if they were
doing it in India   he said 
 The offering could become the second biggest share sale by
an Indian firm  ahead of Reliance Power s  2 9 billion initial
public offering in 2008 and behind private sector lender ICICI
Bank s  4 6 billion follow on sale in the United States in
2007 
 Over the weekend  the group said it signed a deal to buy
U S  coal producer Trinity Coal Partners LLC from U S 
private equity firm Denham Capital for  600 million 
 The deal is part of the company s strategy to source raw
materials for its global steel and power operations 
 Trinity Coal will help fuel the company s North American
steel operations  including its Essar Steel Algoma facility in
Ontario  Canada 
  Essar Group is always looking at a range of different
funding options but has not yet made any specific decision with
regards to its future financing  The group works with a range
of financial advisors to assist the group   the company said in
a statement 
 It is the latest in a string of deals for the Essar Group 
 In February  Essar sold its tower unit to telecoms tower
firm American Tower Corp for about  432 million 
 In November  Essar Group agreed to buy a majority stake in
Dhabi Group s telecommunication businesses in Uganda and Congo 
 Essar is Vodafone s partner in India s No  3 mobile firm 
Vodafone Essar  It holds a 33 percent stake in Vodafone Essar
and holds less than 10 percent in another Indian telecoms firm 
Loop Mobile
