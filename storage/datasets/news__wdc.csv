You can see 
Estee Lauder s shares have outperformed the Zacks Cosmetics industry over the past year   72 3  vs   58 6    The Zacks analyst believes that the company has been gaining from growth across most brands and sales channels  The trend continued in first quarter fiscal 2020  wherein both top and bottom lines surpassed estimates and rose year on year 
Performance was supported by growth in emerging markets  travel retail and online sales  Further  management provided an optimistic view for fiscal 2020  However  the company is witnessing certain headwinds such as soft retail trends in the United States and the U K   costs related to Brexit and tariff impacts in China 
Additionally  challenges in Hong Kong s retail environment are expected to continue through fiscal 2020  Moreover  adverse currency movements are a concern

Shares of BNY Mellon have gained  14 8  in the past three months against the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry s rise of  12 6   The Zacks analyst believes that global diversification efforts and prudent cost management initiatives will aid the bank s financials 
The company has an impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  Moreover  earnings estimates have been going up ahead of its fourth quarter 2019 results 
Impressive capital deployment actions reflect a strong balance sheet position  Yet  the Federal Reserve s accommodative monetary policy along with reduced client activities and low volatility are likely to hurt revenues going forward  Concentration risk arising from significant dependence on fee based revenues could alter BNY Mellon s financial position if there is any change in individual investment preferences 
 You can  
Canadian Pacific Railway s shares have gained  6 3  over the past six months against the Zacks Rail industry s rise of  0 9   The Zacks analyst believes that this was mainly due to prudent cost management  With consistent cost containment  the company s operating ratio has been improving 
Its measures to add shareholder value are also appreciative  Under a normal course issuer bid  for which it received acceptance in December 2019   the company can purchase up to 4 8 million shares  Canadian Pacific s buyout of Central Maine   Quebec Railway is a further positive 
However  Canadian Pacific experienced weak volumes in the fourth quarter amid macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical tensions  Moreover  poor harvest weather in Canada is hurting grain volumes significantly  The company s high debt levels and capital expenditures also add to its woes  Capex is projected to have been C 1 6 billion in 2019

3872,225387,WDC,Top Analyst Reports For AbbVie  Union Pacific   CSX,opinion,"Wednesday  September 18  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including AbbVie  ABBV   Union Pacific  UNP  and CSX  CSX   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
AbbVie s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past three months   7 8  vs   5 5    The Zacks analyst thinks that AbbVie s key drug  Humira  is performing well based on strong demand trends despite new competition  Imbruvica has multibillion dollar potential 
AbbVie has been successful in expanding approvals for its cancer drugs  Imbruvica and Venclexta  Moreover  AbbVie has an impressive late stage pipeline  comprising several products with multibillion dollar potential that are expected to be launched in the near term  The acquisition of Allergan  NYSE AGN   if successful  should diversify AbbVie s revenue base and accelerate its non Humira business 
Sales erosion due to direct biosimilar competition to Humira in international markets is a big headwind in 2019  Also  costs to support expected new product line extension launches should hurt profits in 2019

Shares of Union Pacific have gained 3 9  in the past six months  outperforming the Zacks Rail industry s rise of 3 5   The Zacks analyst is impressed with Union Pacific s initiatives to reward its shareholders  Since November 2017  the company has raised its quarterly dividend payout five times 
It is also active on the buyback front  Initiatives to control costs in a bid to drive the bottom line are also impressive  The company s operating ratio has been improving mainly due to its cost cut plans  The metric is expected to improve further going forward  However  sluggish freight volumes  down 3  in first half 2019  represent a major headwind 
Anticipating the dull scenario to persist  Union Pacific trimmed its volume growth outlook for the second half of the year  Its high debt levels are an added concern  In addition  the massive capex might play spoilsport 
 You can   
CSX s shares have gained 14 6  year to date  underperforming the Zacks Rail industry s rise of 21 2  over the same period  The Zacks analyst believes that this was primarily due to sluggish intermodal revenues 
Dismal performance of the intermodal segment is affecting the company s growth prospects  Segmental revenues declined in the first half of 2019 due to lower volumes  In fact  this coupled with factors like weak domestic coal demand and sluggish crude by rail volumes forced the company to trim its current year top line forecast 
However  we are impressed by the company s efforts to control costs  CSX s operating ratio has improved in the first half of the year  courtesy of its cost reduction efforts  The company s initiatives to reward its shareholders are encouraging as well  During the first half of 2019  the company returned  2 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks

173875,395391,WDC,Better Buy  Western Digital vs  Texas Instruments,news,"Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC  and Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  both sell key components of electronic devices  WD is one of the world s top makers of platter based HDDs  hard disk drives  and flash based SSDs  solid state drives   and TI produces analog  embedded  and other types of chips for various end markets 
WD and TI have both been struggling with cyclical headwinds  WD faced sluggish PC sales  weak enterprise spending  and cyclically low flash memory  NAND  prices over the past year  TI s growth slowed as macro headwinds throttled spending from its automotive and industrial customers 

But some of those headwinds are gradually waning  and investors expect both companies  declines to bottom out in the near future  As a result  shares of WD and TI rose about 75  and 33  over the past 12 months  respectively  compared to the S P 500 s 24  gain 
WD was clearly a better buy than TI over the past year  but will it maintain that lead  Let s take a closer look at the growth of both companies to find out 
Western Digital s strengths and weaknesses
WD generated 60  of its revenue from HDDs last quarter  and the remaining 40  came from sales of SSDs and NAND chips  Its total revenue has fallen annually for five straight quarters 

YOY   Year over year  Source  WD quarterly reports 
Sluggish PC sales and data center spending hurt its HDD business  and tumbling NAND prices slammed its SSD and flash memory business  Lower NAND prices also reduced the price gap between cheaper HDDs and pricier SSDs  resulting in softer demand for lower capacity HDDs 
But during last quarter s conference call  CEO Steve Milligan declared that the NAND market had  passed a cyclical trough   and expects WD s revenue to stay nearly flat annually and rise 4  sequentially in the second quarter  Wall Street expects WD s revenue to stay roughly flat this year and rise 9  next year  which indicates that its business has finally bottomed out 
Texas Instruments  strengths and weaknesses
TI generated 75  of its revenue from analog chips last quarter  Embedded chips accounted for 19  of its revenue  while  other  chips accounted for the rest  TI s revenue has also declined annually for five straight quarters 

YOY   Year over year  Source  TI quarterly reports 
During last quarter s conference call  TI s investor relations chief Dave Pahl noted that the company s sales to the industrial  personal electronics  and communications markets dipped sequentially  automotive sales remained  about even   and enterprise sales rose in the  low single digits   However  Pahl also noted that demand was  stabilizing  across all sectors except the communications equipment market 
For the first quarter  TI expects its revenue to decline 10  annually and 3  sequentially  at the midpoint   That tepid guidance indicates that TI s declines are bottoming out  but it s not primed for a rebound yet  TI s revenue fell 9  for the full year  and analysts expect a 1  decline in 2020 
Margins and profitability
WD s non GAAP gross margin plunged from 38  to 24 8  between the first quarters of 2019 and 2020  due to the aforementioned pressures in the HDD and SSD markets  However  it expects its gross margin to expand sequentially to 25  26  in the second quarter 

TI s gross margin fell from 64 8  to 62 6  between the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2019  Its gross margin remains high since it shifted its analog chip production from the 200mm manufacturing process to the less capital intensive 300mm process  but it ll likely keep contracting until its revenue growth rebounds 
Analysts expect WD s earnings to decline 45  this year  but rebounding HDD and SSD demand could boost its earnings 153  next year  That growth is lumpy  but WD s low forward P E of 10 and forward dividend yield of 2 9  indicate should set a floor under the stock 
TI s earnings declined 6  in 2019  and analysts expect a milder drop of 2  in 2020  However  the stock s forward P E of 26 makes it significantly pricier than WD  and it pays a slightly lower forward yield of 2 8   Another key difference is that TI consistently repurchases its stock  while WD hasn t bought back any shares over the past four quarters 
The winner  Western Digital
WD should continue outperforming TI this year  for three reasons  Its revenue and margins are rising sequentially  it trades at a lower valuation  and it pays a slightly higher dividend  TI s diverse business and traditional of returning  all  its free cash flow via dividends and buybacks still make it a good long term investment    but investors should wait for clearer signs of a bottom before starting a new position ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmhgq,2067324

materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website With that  I ll now turn the call over to Steve Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Peter  and good afternoon  Western Digital delivered solid results in the second quarter as revenue came in at the midpoint of the guidance range and non GAAP EPS was at the upper end of the range  Our performance reflects strong execution in our product roadmap  success in increasing our hard drive gross margin and an improving flash environment  Notably  these results reinforce our prior comments that the June quarter marked the bottom of this flash cycle  We extended our capacity enterprise product leadership as we started sampling 18 terabyte and 16 terabyte CMR and 20 terabyte SMR drives in December  These drives feature our energy assisted magnetic recording technology  providing unrivaled aerial density and TCO benefits  We expect to commence revenue shipments of the CMR drives in the March quarter and ramp shipments through the rest of calendar 2020 Our 14 terabyte platform is performing well  And customer interest in our air based 10 terabyte drive is quite high  The capacity    the strength of our capacity enterprise product portfolio will continue to allow us to maintain our leading market share position  We achieved our goal of high single digit enterprise SSD market share and secured additional NVMe design wins  including at another major hyperscale customer  positioning us for continued revenue growth and share gains We made an important announcement this afternoon of our next generation 3D NAND technology  BiCS5 with 112 layers of vertical storage  BiCS5 joins a full portfolio of 3D NAND technologies as our highest density and most advanced 3D NAND to date  delivering exceptional performance and reliability  Our team executed well in the quarter  increasing our hard drive non GAAP gross margins to approximately 31  from 28 5  in the prior quarter  We now expect an accelerated recovery in our flash gross margins in the first half of calendar 2020 with continued improvement through the end of the year I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerThank you  and good afternoon  Our December results reflect solid product execution  an increase in hard drive gross margin in an improving flash market environment  Data Center Devices and Solutions  we executed well in delivering new products  positioning us for continued share gains and profitable growth in calendar year 2020  In capacity enterprise drives  close collaboration between our heads  media and mechanical design teams  allowed us to simultaneously introduce energy assisted magnetic recording technology and a triple stage actuator and our new 16 terabyte  18 terabyte and 20 terabyte drives  These innovations provide us with continued aerial density leadership and a greater design margin resulting in best in class product quality and reliability  Our focus on introducing the right technology at the right time  while delivering the best TCO and highest product quality to hyperscale and OEM customers makes us their trusted partner In calendar year 2019  the success of our capacity enterprise product line  led by our 14 terabyte drives drove over 40  year over year exabyte growth  We also started sampling our 18 terabyte and 16 terabyte CMR and 20 terabyte SMR drives and plan to commence revenue shipments of the CMR drives in the current quarter  As these drives ramp along with our 10 terabyte air based drives  we re well positioned for continued leadership In flash  we achieved our goal of high single digit enterprise SSD market share  as our NVMe based enterprise SSD revenue grew over 50  sequentially  Supply constraints limited our upside as demand was better than expected  I am encouraged to see the significant investments we have made in expanding our product portfolio over the past several years are enabling us to increase participation in higher margin  higher growth and lower volatility parts of the flash market We have secured additional design wins  including another major hyperscale customer  which demonstrates our success in broadening our product portfolio and diversifying our customer base  In calendar year 2020  we expect to double our enterprise SSD revenue as we move toward our goal of 20  market share  Our competitive position within the data center is unrivaled  built on the breadth of our product portfolio  strong customer relationships  technology leadership and superior product quality  We look forward to another year of strong growth in the data center market Client Devices  strong growth in client SSD and smart video along with growth in mobility and desktop hard drives  drove the sequential revenue growth in the December quarter  As we enter the March quarter  flash pricing continues to improve  Furthermore  starting in the June quarter  we expect to begin shipments into a new gaming platform  The gaming console market is expected to be a multi exabyte opportunity this calendar year Within Client Solutions  strong holiday demand for both our flash and hard drive solutions enabled revenue to grow on a sequential basis  At CES 2020  we demonstrated a range of innovative products  including the world s highest capacity  pocket size portable SSD and the world s first USB 3 2 SSD exclusively for gaming This afternoon we announced our 5th generation 3D NAND technology  BiCS5  Utilizing a wide range of new technology and manufacturing innovation  BiCS5 has significantly increased accelerated density horizontally across the wafer  These laterals scaling advancements in combination with 112 layers of vertical memory capability enables BiCS5 to offer up to 40  more bits of storage capacity per wafer compared to Western Digital s 96 layer BiCS4 technology  We have commenced shipping initial consumer products built on BiCS5 with mass production expected to begin later this calendar year We believe inventory in the flash supply chain has returned to normal levels  and with strong demand for our products  we are experiencing pockets of tightness  These dynamics combined with continued product execution in both flash and hard drives  position us well for continued profitable growth I will now turn the call over to Bob for details on our financial performance Robert Eulau    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Mike  and good afternoon  everyone  Revenue for the December quarter was  4 2 billion  up 5  sequentially and flat from a year ago  Please recall that the September quarter was a 14 week quarter  High end markets  Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue of  1 5 billion was down 3  sequentially and up nearly 40  year over year  On a sequential basis  growth in enterprise SSD is offset by a decline in capacity enterprise drives and the impact of our exit from the storage system business Client Devices revenue of  1 8 billion was up 11  on a sequential basis and decreased nearly 20  year over year  As Mike noted earlier  the sequential growth was driven by client SSD  smart video  mobility and desktop HDD  The year over year decline was primarily due to pricing in flash  our decision to limit our participation in mobility and a decreased TAM for notebook and desktop hard drives Client Solutions revenue was  948 million  up 6  sequentially and flat year over year  Sequential growth was driven by strength in hard drives  By product category  flash revenue was  1 8 billion  up 13  sequentially and down 15  year over year  Flash ASPs were down 8  sequentially  primarily related to our increased participation in mobility  Bit shipments were up 24  sequentially  Hard drive revenue was  2 4 billion  roughly flat sequentially and up 16  year over year  Average price per hard drive was flat sequentially at  81 and exabyte shipments were down 1  sequentially As we move on to costs and expenses  please note all of my comments will be related to non GAAP results unless stated otherwise  Gross margin for the December quarter was up 1 1 percentage point sequentially to 25 9   Our flash gross margin was 19 5   up slightly from last quarter as a better pricing environment was offset by our increased participation in mobile  The hard drive gross margin grew more than expected to almost 31  from 28 5  the prior quarter  This improvement was due to the full realization of the cost benefits of the KL  Phonetic  closure and a stable pricing environment as overall ASP per drive sequentially flat at  81 Operating expenses were  765 million  Operating expenses with normal incentive compensation expense would have been closer to  720 million  Operating cash flow for the December quarter was  257 million and free cash flow was  377 million  Capital expenditures  which include the purchase of property  plant and equipment and activity related to Flash Ventures on our cash flow statement were an inflow of  120 million  As previously noted  we are benefiting from the timing of the funds going back and forth between us and the joint venture For the full fiscal year  we expect cash capital expenditures to be close to zero  Gross capital expenditures  which includes our portion of joint venture leasing and self operating funding is expected to be between  2 billion and  2 5 billion  In an effort to provide greater transparency and clarity into our capital expenditures  we ve added a few new slides to our earnings presentation available on our Investor Relations website In the December quarter  we distributed  149 million in dividends to our shareholders  We reduced debt by  388 million  which included an optional  325 million debt pay down  From a capital allocation perspective  our first priority is to reinvest in the business to maximize long term shareholder value  After that  paying our dividend and reducing our debt are the next priorities  At the end of the quarter  we had  3 1 billion in cash and cash equivalents  Our  2 25 billion revolver remains unused  And our gross debt outstanding was just under  10 billion  Total inventory dollars were down  165 million on a sequential basis as both hard drive and flash inventory decreased Moving on  our non GAAP guidance for the third fiscal quarter is as follows  We expect revenue to be in the range of  4 1 billion to  4 3 billion  We expect gross margin to be approximately 28 5  to 29 5   Please note  that this range includes approximately  70 million in costs associated with the K1 fab  Operating expenses are expected to be between  740 million and  760 million  The midpoint of the guidance range assumes a return to normal variable compensation expense and selective new R D investments  We expect interest and other expense of  80 million to  85 million  And we expect the tax rate to be around    to be between 25  and 27   As a result of this detailed guidance  we expect earnings per share between  0 85 and  1 05  assuming approximately 305 million in fully diluted shares With that  I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q A session  Operator  we ll now take our first question Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Wamsi Mohan    Bank of America Merrill Lynch  US     AnalystYes  Thank you  and congrats on the strong guidance  When you speak of an accelerated recovery here in flash gross margins  can you layout the key drivers of that through 2020 and how you re thinking about the velocity of that recovery and any thoughts on where you might exit the calendar year Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Wamsi  this is Steve  I ll take that question  So there s really a couple of different things that I would say are going on in terms of the flash market  One  the first thing is  as we indicated in our prepared remarks  we believe that inventory levels in    from an industry perspective to the best of our estimation have returned in the balance or call it normal levels  So that s one thing that occurred  The other thing is  obviously we have been working very hard on improving our product line up  which is allowing us to sell into markets that carry higher gross margin profiles  as well as the stickier business and we believe that that will help us over time to manage the volatility that is associated with the flash business The other thing is that  as part of all of that is  is that there is an increasing awareness on behalf of our customer base that inventory supply and demand is tightening up  In other words  demand is going to exceed supply this year  And so we re seeing customers recognizing that  prices are improving  Right now that tightness is it s kind of in pockets  It s not necessarily across the board  So we re seeing pockets of tightness in the market  And as we move through the balance of the year  we expect that that tightness will increase And so what that means from a gross margin perspective  last quarter we said that we thought we would see modest improvement in our gross margins in the flash area  Now we re saying that our margin profiles will    it will accelerate in terms of that improvement  And I would expect as we move into the back half of the year  we ll see an increasing mark    more of that as the market tightens up even more in the back half of calendar 2020  What that means from a numeric perspective is that we would say that we have the opportunity for our flash gross margins to get into the 35  to 40  range as we get into the back half of the calendar year Wamsi Mohan    Bank of America Merrill Lynch  US     AnalystOkay  great  That s great  Steve  Thanks  I appreciate the color  And can you maybe just    you guys obviously executed pretty well in the quarter on the HDD side as you had guided to sort of have those margin step up as well  Can you talk about the path of the HDD gross margins from here as well  Thank you Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the way to think about those is we re in a range where we re comfortable going forward  So we will continue to operate around the range that we reported Wamsi Mohan    Bank of America Merrill Lynch  US     AnalystAll right  great  Thank you Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerWith a bias    Wamsi  I would add to that  With a bias for those margins improving over time as an increasing amount of our hard drive volume shifts to capacity enterprise  So what we ve talked about is something in the mid 30  range  We re not necessarily saying that that will happen in this calendar year  but that should be the bias over a period of time Wamsi Mohan    Bank of America Merrill Lynch  US     AnalystOkay  great  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo Aaron Rakers    Wells Fargo    AnalystYeah  Thanks for taking the questions  First  kind of keeping on the hard disk drive business  I know you talked about in the press release or the slide deck  a 100  plus growth year over year in near line HDD capacity shipments  But given the competitive landscape and the questions  I m curious  what did that    how did that perform on a sequential basis  And how are you currently seeing the competitive environment Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  So I think in general  we maintain our leading market share position  call it in the    kind of low to mid  50s  We ll see where this all settles out once everybody reports  We expect that to continue right through the first half of this calendar year  And then in the back half  we obviously think we have some opportunity to continue to grow slightly  So from a product positioning standpoint  we feel very good about not only our 14 terabyte  which continues to be the highest volume shipper  but the expected ramp of our 16 terabyte  18 terabyte and 20 terabyte  which will occur throughout the year  And as we noted in the prepared remarks  we will begin initial revenue shipments in the current quarter Aaron Rakers    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  And then on the gross margin on the flash side  mix can be a meaningful driver to gross margin  But I m curious is as    as you continue to execute on BiCS  I guess it would be BiCS4 and now we start to talk about BiCS5  Can you just update us on how we think about the cost curve relative to that mix shift effect to kind of take you back to that  as you said  35  to 40  gross margin  And just where are we at currently in the mix of BiCS4 in terms of bits shipped right now Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  BiCS4 is the overwhelming majority of bits  we re just starting the initial BiCS5 ramp  The way to think about  Aaron though  is really in this kind of 15  plus or minus annualized cost take down  and certainly we would expect that to continue as we move through this next product transition  Relative to mix  I would say both product and market segment exposure and then of course the broader ASP pricing environment are going to be the drivers of the margin enhancement through the calendar year 2020 Aaron Rakers    Wells Fargo    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG Mehdi Hosseini    Susquehanna International Group    AnalystYes  Thanks for taking my question  Two follow ups for Mike and Steve  First on the NAND side  and on a game console rather  a new game console  This is incremental as I imagine the prior generations are hard disk drive based and now is migrating to SSDs  and there are some figures out there  I m just trying to see what is your assumption for the kind of a NAND supply that the new game console is going to consume given the fact that this is incremental  And I have a follow up Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  I think you re right  It is all incremental  And from an industry standpoint and certainly from our standpoint because we were not participating in the gaming market in 2019 calendar year on the hard drive side  I don t think we want to go any farther than what we said in our prepared remarks  This is going to be a large multi exabyte market and we wouldn t want to comment any more specifically Mehdi Hosseini    Susquehanna International Group    AnalystOkay  fair  Moving on to hard disk drive  obviously you re introducing a new 18 terabyte  Can you help me understand how you re cost competitive  I understand your product has a fewer number of plates  And as we migrate from 16 terabyte to 18 terabyte  how that cost competitiveness is going to be used to increase market share Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  So I think from our standpoint  we think we have a significant time to market lead on 18 terabyte and 20 terabyte  And so the platter count to our understanding is system  Phonetic  with next generation  So our benefit relative to market share is always about bringing the right products to the market in a leading way  getting smoothly through customer qualification and ramping quickly  We ve been doing that generation over generation for several years  We will do that again on the 18 terabyte  16 terabyte and 20 terabyte product that we ll be ramping this year Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  And we    and Mehdi  we do have a cost advantage  And we would think that    I mean that s represented in our underlying hard drive gross profit performance  And one of the things that you re alluding to is that our capacity enterprise drive and this continues for 16 terabyte  18 terabyte and 20 terabyte drives that we are using aluminum media versus glass media and that is at a lower cost Mehdi Hosseini    Susquehanna International Group    AnalystGot it  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen Karl Ackerman    Cowen   Company  LLC    AnalystHi  Good afternoon  gentlemen  I have two if I may  The first question is regarding your NAND supply outlook  We re calling for 30  growth for the industry in calendar 2020  Is most of that coming from process conversions and what s sitting in inventory  Or is it going to be dictated by adding substantial greenfield capacity at the K1 facility  And in addition to that  your South Korean peer last night spoke about NAND demand  industry NAND demand growing kind of high 20s for 2020  How does that play in your capital planning process Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Hey  Karl  One thing I want to comment is when they were talking about high 20   I believe that was supply growth not demand growth  So    but anyway  I ll let Mike comment on the specifics Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  So all the growth  both ours and the industry is technology transition  So our K1 expansion is all about technology    room for technology transition  There is no wafer capacity in our plans going in  And that s really  I think that s the theme  Phonetic  across the industry  And just to comment further on where we think    we talked about low 30s in terms of supply growth  Steve commented on what Samsung s comments were  We believe demand growth will be in the 35  plus range for this year Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerHence  the shortage Karl Ackerman    Cowen   Company  LLC    AnalystVery helpful  Last one if I may  Your enterprise SSD market share opportunity is quite significant and I think impressive  But when we think about that  how much of that is driven by a new server architecture launched this year versus retrofitting existing servers  And I ask because a Tier 1 U S  based hyperscaler just announced after the close that the depreciation will be lower for them in March due to an increase in useful life of their server  So if I could just    kind of talk about that a little bit that would be great  Thank you Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  So  no  we re not dependent on any specific server transition  So what we are able to do with our NVMe products is win both new server and existing socket design wins in the NVMe space  And then of course similarly in SaaS  there will be a series of new products announced where we will be designed in  So we re not dependent on any particular server transition  And it s really the power of and strength of the product portfolio  as well as the customers  view of us as a preferred supplier that s driving that share growth Karl Ackerman    Cowen   Company  LLC    AnalystThank you Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays Tim Long    Barclays    AnalystThank you  Just going back    two for me as well  On the HDD side  could you talk a little bit about as 16 terabyte  18 terabyte and 20 terabyte ramp through the year  just for your near line business  what do you think the gross margin in ASP impacts will be there  And then on the NAND side there was a earlier comment  you talked a little bit about mix  Could you just give us a sense as to the dilution from mobile and should we expect more or less participation in that market as we move through calendar  20  Thank you Robert Eulau    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Tim  this is Bob  So the first one on the hard drives and we have not been giving specifics on capacity enterprise margins  but they are better than average  And as we ve said before  as our mix trends toward more and more capacity enterprise  we do expect our hard drive gross margins can get up into the mid 30  range  So that will be a benefit to us  And from    on the mix question  I mean we re not    also not able to get specific in terms of exactly what the numerical implication was at mobile  but it obviously was dilutive to us this quarter  And over time  we ll always participate some in the mobile market  But we ll continue to manage that Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  And as the flash supply demand situation tightens up  we will see the mobile market become more attractive for us from a gross margin perspective Tim Long    Barclays    AnalystOkay  Good point  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley Joseph Moore    Morgan Stanley   Co  LLC    AnalystGreat  Thank you  I wonder if you could talk about the planning process behind the capex at the JV level on NAND  To the extent that you guys are feeling better about the business and where profitability is going  do you feel the need to change capex at the JV  And then  I guess  second half of that question  You said earlier that earlier in the year that you can sort of get the industry bit growth without a lot of capex because you won t have the fab shutdown  you won t have the power outage  Could you just update us on your thinking of how that impacts your supply growth for the calendar year Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I ll comment overall on the capex in terms of bit growth and that sort of thing  I mean  from an overall philosophical perspective  I mean  we want to be adding bit supplied to the market that is consistent largely with the overall growth from a demand perspective  So we re not    as a result of the improving environment  we re not looking at accelerating or decelerating our plans  But over a longer period of time  we would want to try to manage our growth from a supply perspective to growth in demand  And so that hasn t changed Joseph Moore    Morgan Stanley   Co  LLC    AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Market Mitch Steves    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHey guys  Just two questions for me  I just want to try to clarify or at least get some numbers around this or any way to think about it  So when you look at the SSD opportunity  just trying to double your share there for the NVMe  the statement you guys made in the slide deck and you combine that with the gaming platforms coming in  How much of that is adding to kind of the overall demand  You guys gave out a 35  number  I m just trying to understand how much of this you guys have clean visibility on so we can get an understanding of how much that demand is gaming plus your share gains on the enterprise side Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerSo the broader sort of industry demand number we gave you is independent of our own share growth  right  So    in any one of these particular segments  So our view of 35  demand side growth on the year is an aggregate across the industry for bit  When we talk about segment share gains in enterprise SSD and in gaming  that s obviously product segment related gains  So we re not going to talk specifically about that  I think you can kind of calculate where we think we re going on the enterprise SSD side given my comment Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  And I d add kind of further context to that  I mean what we re trying to do is we re trying to place our bits in those markets that characterize  I call it  one or two elements  One  opportunities for us to add more value from a product perspective  thereby driving higher gross margin  Refer to that as  let s call it  enterprise market  And then also those areas of the market that are either stickier  less volatile so that we can manage the ups and downs that tend to occur in this kind of market  Gaming  yes  it s incremental from a flash perspective and also tends to be stickier business  more predictable  And so it has some of those characteristics that are attractive to us as we look to place our bits in more attractive parts of the market  as opposed to let s call it more transactional or price driven areas of the market Mitch Steves    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  Understood  And then just last one  You guys have mentioned like 40  kind of NAND gross margins kind of the goal you guys want to get to  I m just trying to get a better understanding for other RAM  Phonetic   So is that something you guys think you can exit at in calendar year or is it going to take a lot longer than that  Just looking for any sort of help on when you guys think you can get to the kind of 40  number you ve talked to in the past Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerWell  what I commented on is that given the trajectory of our business and where we see it playing out in calendar year  we expect that our flash gross margin rate will move into the 35  to 40  range as we get into the back half of the year  Now that s not being specific as that calendar Q3 or calendar Q4 want to see exactly how the market evolves  But we clearly continue to believe that 40  range is the right level for us  And we believe that we ll begin to approach that in the back half of the calendar year Mitch Steves    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystPerfect  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from C J  Muse with Evercore C J  Muse    Evercore ISI    AnalystYeah  Good afternoon  Thank you for taking the question  I guess first question  You talked about industry bit supply growth in the low 30s and you would be in line with that  Can you share with us what you expect to revenue on a bit basis  And as part of your thinking there  how are you contemplating bits for mobility versus elsewhere Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerWell  the one thing I ll say relative    we don t comment specifically  but we would expect to have our own inventory positions to be in being quite balanced state  We are entering the year and we expect to be exiting the calendar year  To the extent you want to calculate that that will give you a feel for it C J  Muse    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  And your thinking on the mobility side  Is that something that you re thinking maybe it will stick more to enterprise and consoles Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerNo  We like    yeah  the mobility side is not all created equal  And part of our effort over the last several years is getting more product diversification  as Steve talked about  some of the newer areas  But we will continue to maintain exposure to mobility  We will just manage that exposure and make sure we re making or we re able to make good choices as the market continues to evolve  So we see it as a long term area of investment  We see there are some very attractive parts within the mobile marketplace  So we ll continue to be investing there  We ll just be able to manage our bit allocation more broadly through this calendar year and into the future C J  Muse    Evercore ISI    AnalystExcellent  And as my follow up  another question on the NAND gross margins  shocking  But if you could  I guess  speak to the K1 charges  When you think they might roll off and how accretive that might be  And also given kind of the state of the industry today  are you running a 100  utilization  What kind of tailwind do you see there  Thank you Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  So in terms of K1  I mean  we re now having real production runs and we ll continue to have more production as we progress through the year  This last quarter we didn t have quite as larger charges without going to  I think it came in around  65 million  And I think we had said on this call last quarter to be around  75 million  In the current quarter  in the March quarter  we re expecting around  70 million in terms of a period expense charge  And that should start to go down after this quarter  And it s really a function of how we ran production and are obviously ability to absorb those costs  But it will start to get better I think from here Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  And one thing  just to comment on  when I talked about 35  to 40  flash gross margins in the back half of the calendar year  that is inclusive of any potential start up cost that still remain in the back half of the year OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Munjal Shah with UBS Munjal Shah    UBS Securities  LLC    AnalystYes  hi  Thanks for taking my question  So two questions  One  could you just update us on the CEO search  And then secondly on HDD exabyte  They were down 1  sequentially  but then you talk about 100  growth on an exabyte basis year on year  So if you could tie those two as to why on a sequential basis the exabyte could be down  And related to near line  what s the visibility into 2020 Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So I ll take the CEO search comment or question and then Mike can comment on capacity enterprise  So regarding the search  the search process is ongoing  And one of the things that I will add to that is  the board is very pleased with the progress that they re making to date  And so that s all the update we have for now Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerAnd relative to the capacity enterprise marketplace  our fiscal quarter one was a record shipment for us  Our exabyte share was around 57   We were operating to optimize both profit and maintain our kind of leading share position in this space  So some of that would be a little bit of a share drop  and I talked about that 53  to 55  depending on where things settle out  But as we look into the first half of this calendar year  we see demand across the breadth of the market remaining fairly strong  And we think we re in a good position to maintain this leading market share position that I just talked about  So visibility is good  Obviously different customers have different plans  but when we aggregate it  we feel pretty comfortable with continued strength of demand through the first half of the calendar year Munjal Shah    UBS Securities  LLC    AnalystYeah  Thanks a lot OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research Steven Fox    Cross Research    AnalystHi  Good afternoon  Just a couple of quick questions for me  First of all  you mentioned that you became supply constraint on the NVMe SSDs during the quarter  Can you just sort of talk about how you work that through and what it implies for future growth  maybe this quarter  next quarter  And then secondly  I was wondering if you could expand on your comment about the pockets of tightness you re currently seeing  What exactly would you call out  I guess besides enterprise  But anything that you can elaborate on there and where maybe those pockets expand to in the coming quarter  Thank you Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So I ll take the question on the NVMe supply constraint  It was not a flash supply constraint issue  Basically what happened is demand was better than we had expected and it was some of the components that we used in our NVMe SSD product  We ve worked to resolve those and it should not be an issue as we move forward through calendar 2020  And then the other question Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  So I think what we re seeing is in general demand has been very strong across client SSD  particularly in the performance categories  So in some parts of the world  there is constraints there and that s being reflected in the movement on pricing in a positive direction Steven Fox    Cross Research    AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with J P  Morgan Harlan Sur    J P  Morgan    AnalystHi  Good afternoon  and thanks for taking my question  Good to see the sharp growth in the enterprise NVMe SSD platforms  Given the strong momentum on these products in the strong cloud spending environment  do you think that you guys actually exited the calendar year tracking at low double digits percentage market share or are you still somewhat constrained on the supply exiting the year Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  To Steve s comment  we actually saw demand in excess of our availability of the actual other components  So had we been able to fully realize that  frankly we had been in the low double digits on share  That remedies itself as we re now inside lead time  We continue to see strong demand for those products  And as I talked about  we expect to double revenue in that category year over year Harlan Sur    J P  Morgan    AnalystGreat  thanks  And then on the HDD side  on the outlook for capacity enterprise exabytes shipments up kind of 35  year over year this year  Seems a bit conservative  I mean  we re hearing that it s more likely in the mid 40  range with 60  type year over year growth in the first half of this year just given the continued strong cloud spending trend  So wondering if you can kind of layout your assumptions may be here in the first half of the year for exabyte consumption  just given that cloud and hyperscale spending still seems to be quite strong Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  We haven t been too specific on that  I will say  I will give you a comment that we do see at this time a bias up in demand  So I think that s reflected in your comments  So relative to a 35  or so annual expectation  I think our current view is a bias up from there Harlan Sur    J P  Morgan    AnalystGreat  Thank you Operator Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital Ananda Baruah    Loop Capital    AnalystHi  Thanks guys for taking the question  Congratulations on the solid performance and it s good to see the guide really amplifying here  I ll just stick with near line  Steve  could you just give us a little more context about how you see the aesthetic  And then Mike as well  of the cloud cycle through the year  Mike  it sounds like you re saying you expected through the balance of calendar year  20 now to some extent  Stephen  like do you see it potentially continuing  Is there the potential  I m not asking for a guide  but the potential to continue exabyte demand going up sort of into the back half of the year or is this sort of one where it gets up to a peak sooner  but then maybe is sort of an extended kind of the cycle  Any context there would be great  I appreciate it Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerLet me try to clarify a little bit  We certainly see the first half of the calendar year remaining strong  I ll reference back to the comments I just made  On an annualized basis  we ve been talking about 35  annualized growth  We do see on an annualized basis a bias up from there  I wouldn t want to comment kind of any further on the way that    the way the full year or the shape of each of the individual quarters grow Ananda Baruah    Loop Capital    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  I appreciate that clarification  Thank you  guys OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities Srini Pajjuri    SMBC Nikko Securities America  Inc     AnalystThank you  Just a follow up on the previous question  Steve  I guess  we have had pretty strong two quarters from the cloud end market here and there is some concern that there may be a digestion period as we head into the first half  and I think Intel did say that they expect somewhat of a digestion period  I m just wondering  you tend to have a pretty long visibility in especially on the drive side  I m just wondering if you re seeing any signs of slowdown out there that causes you to kind of believe that there is going to be a digestion period Michael D  Cordano    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  So again all customers not created equal  There are some that are doing that  But when we aggregate it  the demand remains quite strong through the first half of the calendar year OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Vijay Rakesh    Mizuho Securities USA    AnalystYeah  Hi guys  Just wondering  I saw your capex is down for fiscal  20 keeping that discipline  I m just wondering  as you look at the rest of the ecosystem  are you seeing any aggressive capex or how do you view that  And also on the China side with YMTC continue to expand  what are your thoughts in terms of supply coming in with increased or aggressive capex given how NAND pricing has been trending  Thanks Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I ll comment in terms of overall industry to the extent that there is public information  But as Samsung indicated and others have indicated  we re all circling at a bit supply growth rate that s kind of in a similar neighborhood with Samsung talking about high 20  growth rate and we re talking low or mid  low 30s  And so we re kind of all aggregating  And we re not seeing anybody adding capacity from a NAND supply perspective that would concern us  Certainly not in the short term because it would take up to 18 months for that to become productive capacity  And so we re not seeing anybody behave in a way that we think that would upset the balance from a supply demand perspective  So we feel pretty good about that YMTC  no real change in terms of our expectations there  We do not think that    see them having any material impact in terms of the market for the next several years  And we ll continue to evaluate that depending upon their ability to ramp  not only from a pure production standpoint  but from a technology perspective  But certainly no concerns I would say over the next two to three years in that regard  And that s kind of within the planning cycle that we would have visibility to OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank Sidney Ho    Deutsche Bank Securities Inc     AnalystGreat  Thank you  My question is if you kind of look at your calendar Q1 guide being roughly flat quarter over quarter  which seems to be better than seasonal  especially on the NAND side  Can you talk about your expectations  maybe by products  hard drives  SLC  Phonetic  drives or by segment  Just curious how much of that above seasonal guide is a function of ASP improvement Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerYes  So let me    I ll comment at a really high level and then Mike or Bob can add a little bit more specifics  But I mean if you look at    first thing I want to answer it in kind of a back door sort of way  If you look at our gross margin improvement quarter on quarter  which is pretty significant in terms of 25 9 to 28 5 to 29 5 in terms of the range  almost all of that is driven by improving flash environment  So namely pricing  all right  And so    and yes  there is mix improvements and that sort of thing  And so that directly impacts revenue So when you look at an improving pricing environment that s helping us to keep our revenues  let s call it  flattish on a quarter on quarter basis  And then beyond that  we continue to see the overall demand environment to be solid  I mean  just kind of solid  not great  not necessarily    but not bad  And so it s just kind of there and that s both a flash and a hard drive statement  And so that s allowing us to kind of work against what would be normal seasonality drop in revenue in calendar Q1  So those are really kind of the two big factors OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group Nihal Chokshi    Maxim Group    AnalystYeah  Thank you  and great to see the accelerating NAND flash recovery in the gross margins  I did want to make sure I understand the dynamic that is going on there  Do you expect your own NAND flash inventory to decline Q over Q for the March quarter  which I think as Micron has comment that they were expecting their NAND flash inventory to accumulate  but for NAND flash prices to increase  So just wondering if you had some color there as far as your expectations on that Robert Eulau    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  This is Bob  I can make a couple of comments  and I don t want to start giving guidance for inventory by quarter  But we re still not satisfied with where we are on inventory in spite of the reduction that we saw this quarter  And our goal over the next few quarters is to get to at least five turns  and that s what we re focused on internally as a company  So it won t be strictly linear getting there  but we think we can achieve that fairly soon OperatorThank you  Our next question will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel Patrick Ho    Stifel    AnalystThank you very much  Maybe as a follow up to some of the questions about your 18 and 20 gigabit drive    terabyte drives that have been released  Can you discuss how the gross margin acceleration or the path to your target gross margin is impacted by your ability to get those out sooner in terms of the development of those drives  You talked about I think the last quarter that 9 platter was pulling somewhat in terms of development  How does that help in the acceleration of the gross margin progression Robert Eulau    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  This is Bob  I guess the first thing I would say is our gross margins are already very good in terms of capacity enterprise  And as I said earlier  as our mix tends more and more toward capacity enterprise that will pull up our overall hard drive mix  Our mix was not as good as prior quarters  as this past quarter  but you still saw the margin improvement  You saw that ASPs stayed flat in spite of a tougher mix  So overall I think margins are very solid on capacity enterprise  And I think as we introduce the new product that trend will continue OperatorThank you  And our final question will come from Mark Miller with Benchmark before we end with a short statement by our CEO Mark Miller    Benchmark Co     AnalystThank you  But I believe the questions I wanted to address about the second half strength in data center and also near line have been posed  so I don t need to pose those again Stephen D  Milligan    Chief Executive OfficerHi  Mark  Good to hear your voice  All right  So thank you all for joining us today  And we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming Goldman Sachs

173890,395406,WDC,Western Digital Sees Far Better Days Ahead,news,"Data storage specialist Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC  reported second quarter results last Thursday  The report was a breath of fresh air  as the maker of hard drives and solid state devices  SSDs  posted stable sales and pointed to a dramatic earnings jump in the next quarter 
Western Digital s second quarter results by the numbers

Data source  Western Digital  GAAP   generally accepted accounting principles 
This quarter ended a long stretch of falling revenues  The last time Western Digital reported anything other than a year over year decline on the top line was the third quarter of 2018  Trailing sales fell 29  between that report and the fourth quarter of 2019  bouncing back to a smaller 25  drop three months ago  Thanks to a stable year over year trend in the second quarter  Western Digital is still looking at a 25  decline in trailing revenues from the peak in 2018  but the trend line is starting to point upward

Market trends
Management offered a handful of explanations for the solidifying top line trends  Western Digital s hard drive manufacturing operations are more cost effective than ever  new product launches have gone off without a hitch  and the market environment for flash memory chips    which Western Digital uses to build SSDs    is  improving  
The successful product launches included several high capacity hard drives with 16 terabytes or more of magnetic disc storage space  The company also introduced a fifth generation 3D flash memory technology  dubbed BiCS5  Sporting 112 stacked layers of storage space and tighter traces per layer  this architecture is 40  more space efficient than the previous generation s architecture of 96 layers  Western Digital will sample these modules in small quantities later this quarter  followed by mass market production and BiCS5 based SSD products near the end of the calendar year 2020 
 As we enter the March quarter  flash pricing continues to improve   COO Mike Cardano said on the earnings call   We believe inventory in the flash supply chain has returned to normal levels  and with strong demand for our products  we are experiencing pockets of tightness  These dynamics  combined with continued product execution in both flash and hard drives  position us well for continued profitable growth  

What s next for Western Digital 
The midpoints of management s third quarter guidance pointed to revenues near  4 2 billion and adjusted earnings in the vicinity of  0 95 per share  These targets compare favorably to the year ago period s results  adjusted earnings of  0 17 per share on sales of  3 67 billion  Western Digital also set its targets above the current analyst views  which called for earnings near  0 73 per share on sales of roughly  4 06 billion 
The company is heading into a period of high demand and tight supply in the flash based SSD market  paving the way to both wider profit margins and rising sales  Meanwhile  traditional hard drives continue to stick around as a lower cost solution for consumers and enterprises in need of massive storage spaces where data transfer speeds are less important 
These trends should do wonders for Western Digital s share prices over the next few quarters  lifting the stock from bargain basement valuation ratios such as 8 8 times forward earnings while the earnings themselves also head higher  The same market trends also support the equally undervalued memory chip giant Micron Technology  NASDAQ MU   which is trading at 9 8 times forward earnings today  As a shareholder of both Micron and Western Digital  I m looking forward to the upcoming era of tighter flash chip supplies ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqzt8,2075703

173935,395451,WDC,Pope urges Silicon Valley to avoid slide toward new  barbarism ,news,"By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY  Reuters    Pope Francis urged Silicon Valley giants on Friday to make sure technological advances such as artificial intelligence do not lead to a new  form of barbarism  where the law of the strongest prevails over the common good 
Francis made his comments in an address to participants at a Vatican conference attended by executives from companies such as Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Mozilla  and  Western Digital   NASDAQ WDC  as well as Nobel laureates  Catholic ethicists  government regulators  internet entrepreneurs  and venture capitalists 
The three day gathering  which ends on Saturday  is discussing topics with tech jargon not commonly heard inside the Vatican such as algorithms and blockchain 
 The remarkable developments in the field of technology  in particular those dealing with artificial intelligence  raise increasingly significant implications in all areas of human activity  For this reason  open and concrete discussions on this theme are needed now more than ever   Francis told the participants 
They include Mitchell Baker  executive chairwoman of Mozilla  Gavin Corn  associate general counsel and director of the cyber security law team at Facebook  Western Digital senior vice president Jim Welsh and Reid Hoffman  co founder of LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  
Francis said technology needed  both theoretical and practical moral principles  
He warned of the dangers of the use of artificial intelligence  to circulate tendentious opinions and false data that could poison public debates and even manipulate the opinions of millions of people  to the point of endangering the very institutions that guarantee peaceful civil coexistence  
 If mankind s so called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good  this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest   he said 
The conference is taking place amid the rise of cyber espionage  online hate speech and misuse of private data  and signs the industry is struggling to respond 
It is the latest example of the Vatican trying to stay ahead of the curve on technology and social issues in order to influence the pioneers of the future  regardless of their religion 
Vatican officials said it could provide material for a possible papal document on artificial intelligence  much as meetings with scientists helped shape his landmark 2015 encyclical  Laudato Si  on the protection of the environment and global warming ",2019-09-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pope-urges-silicon-valley-to-avoid-slide-toward-new-barbarism-1987827,1987827

174022,395538,WDC,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Credit Suisse  Western Digital And Keysight Technologies,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  September 24  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Credit Suisse   NYSE CS    Western Digital   NASDAQ WDC   and Keysight Technologies   NYSE KEYS   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog Is the S P 500 Valuation Stretched  Global Week AheadA valuation top in U S  stock market indices can be signaled in a variety of subtle ways One way a stock market s broad valuation can come into question  When a frothy Initial Public Offering  IPO  market least expects it Case in point  In the last couple of weeks  a major Japanese investor SoftBank has lost faith in CEO Adam Neumann s ability to lead the U S  work sharing office space group called WeWork In the Global Week Ahead  traders expect Softbank s leader to call for a board meeting to demote the CEO of WeWork This comes after that trendy loss making U S  property group shelved its IPO  Prior to this  the CEO had to cut its IPO valuation steeply  over and over again Very secondarily  the WeWork CEO s volatile behavior and drug use came to light Lo and behold  The forward 12 month P E ratio for the S P 500 index is a rich 17 0  This P E ratio is now firmly above its 5 yr average  16 6  and well above its 10 yr average  14 8  Next  I list Reuters  five world market themes for this Global Week Ahead  They are kept in order of importance to equity market traders Chaos in the Repo RateThe sudden stress in U S  dollar funding markets in recent days has spooked people by stirring memories of the 2008 crisis A rocketing repo rate   the key measure of liquidity in the global banking system   and a jump in the U S  Federal Reserve s target interest rate to levels not seen since 2008  forced the New York Fed to intervene four times to maintain the Fed funds rate in the 1 75  2 0  range It is unclear yet whether the tightness was a one off  triggered by technical issues such as Treasury maturities and tax payments  or if there s a systemic issue waiting to roil global markets So far there s no sign of spillover overseas but investors are on the watch for any warning signals  given the dollar s dominance in cross border trade and investment  For instance  cross currency euro dollar swaps  effectively a reflection of dollar funding costs for offshore investors  are nowhere near levels seen even during last October s selloff  let alone during the 2011 euro debt crisis  This is where non U S  banks would go to source dollar liquidity if they find themselves shut out of U S  money markets If the repo chaos continues into coming days  offshore markets are likely to start feeling the heat  Watch this space  2  Fed  Dot Plots  Say No More Cuts in 2019  Traders Disagree After the U S  Fed s second  insurance  rate cut of 2019  officials  median rate forecasts hint at no more cuts this year The shift has come as a shock  given expectations prior to the Fed meeting were for several more cuts to contain the impact of U S  President Donald Trump s tariff tussles with China           New dot plot projections show Fed policymakers at the median expect rates to stay within the new 1 75  2 00  Fed funds range through 2020          Futures traders  meanwhile  see a better than 50 50 chance that the target rate will be another 25 50 bp lower by the year end          They will be watching for comments from Fed policymakers due to speak at various events in coming daysThe Fed judges the U S  economy can get on fine without further short term stimulus  Upcoming data may show us whether that view is accurate or if  in chairman Jerome Powell s words   a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate  August Durable Goods Orders will shed light on whether the trade war is eroding business investment  Orders for goods such as airplanes and toasters are seen having fallen 1  after rising 2  in July Of keen interest will be orders for non defense capital goods  excluding aircraft   a closely watched proxy for business spending plans that increased 0 4  last month  even as shipments posted the biggest drop since October 2016  Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate GDP  3  Judgment Day for Boris Johnson s Suspension of ParliamentBritain s Supreme Court has concluded hearings on whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully in suspending parliament for five weeks and a ruling is due in coming days A decision against Johnson may force him to recall lawmakers  giving them more time to challenge his plan to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct  31   with or without a divorce deal In fact  markets  moods have improved of late  first of all as parliament passed a law to avert a no deal Brexit by end October  More recently  comments by EU Commission President Jean Claude Juncker stirred hopes of a Brexit deal  sending the pound to its highest level since July and putting it on track for its best month this year There are positive noises from Ireland too  with Foreign Minister Simon Coveney acknowledging an improvement in  mood music   though he and Brussels have stopped short of saying a deal is within reach  An EU diplomat in fact described documents submitted by London as a  smokescreen   So  crashing out of the EU still remains an imminent possibility Meanwhile  the government has said it will abide by the Supreme Court s ruling  If that comes to pass  it could be the catalyst for the next leg of sterling s recent rally  4  A Big Week for Flash Purchasing Manager Indexes  PMIs While the Fed has been talking up the state of the U S  economy  ECB chief Mario Draghi has urged Eurozone governments to step on the fiscal gas pedal if they want to see economic growth speeding up Given that background and the Fed s promise to be  highly data dependent  while setting interest rates  flash Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI  readings are likely to be closely scrutinized   a strong number would tip the balance in favor of the hawks on the Fed board The ECB  on the other hand  has already pledged indefinite stimulus   and looking at depressed activity across the bloc  that seems justified  Monday s survey showed German private sector activity shrank for the first time in 6 1 2 years in September as a manufacturing recession deepened and the service sector lost momentum too  Hopes are that this will chivvy tight fisted Eurozone governments into loosening their purse strings  5  An Update on New Zealand Monetary PolicyAustralia and New Zealand have been locked in a dance of alternating rate cuts this year as the zest of two of the globe s better performing economies stales Markets are scrambling to price in extra easing on both sides of the Tasman Sea following a weak reading on Australian joblessness  which the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  says is crucial to its outlook  RBA chief Phil Lowe will speak on Tuesday  while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets in Wellington on Wednesday Markets don t expect RBNZ chief Adrian Orr to move rates this month  But then  they hadn t expected his 0 5  cut in August The bigger picture though  is that rates are heading downward  New Zealand s economy is growing at its slowest in six years and Australian growth is at a decade low All of Australia s big four banks have now brought forward rate cut expectations  That s a lot of doves to feed Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  Stocks Credit Suisse  The market cap is  32B when shares trade at a paltry  12

 year to date  outperforming the S P 500 s increase of 15 8  during the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks the company benefits from continued user growth across Asia Pacific  It is expected to benefit from solid mobile ad revenues  driven by impressive growth in Instagram Stories and Feed  as well as Facebook News Feed Facebook s initiatives to improve privacy  transparency and authenticity of ads and removal of fake accounts from the platform are expected to boost user trust and engagement  However  the company s rising regulatory headwinds  including the antitrust investigation  is a concern Meanwhile  the EU is investigating Libra  The integration of Libra backed applications into WhatsApp and Messenger is also being investigated  The unfriendly regulatory environment is expected to delay Libra s launch  which is a concern for investors  You can   Shares of Mastercard have increased  51 6  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry s rally of

company  Further  it expects strong sales results for fiscal 2020  driven by brand recognition  robust innovation pipeline  and positive response from Nike Direct and wholesale partners  However  NIKE

174058,395574,WDC,Western Digital  WDC  Flat As Market Sinks  What You Should Know,opinion,"In the latest trading session  Western Digital  WDC  closed at  51 49  marking no change from the previous day  This change was narrower than the S P 500 s 0 65  loss on the day  Elsewhere  the Dow lost 0 42   while the tech heavy Nasdaq lost 0 46  
Prior to today s trading  shares of the maker of hard drives for businesses and personal computers had gained 35 11  over the past month  This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector s gain of 5 63  and the S P 500 s gain of 4 11  in that time 
Investors will be hoping for strength from WDC as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be July 31  2019  The company is expected to report EPS of  0 17  down 95 29  from the prior year quarter  Meanwhile  our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of  3 69 billion  down 27 86  from the prior year quarter 
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for WDC  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
Ranging from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   the Zacks Rank system has a proven  outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks returning an average of  25  annually since 1988  The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 4 97  lower within the past month  WDC is holding a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now 
In terms of valuation  WDC is currently trading at a Forward P E ratio of 16 08  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 16 08  so we one might conclude that WDC is trading at a no noticeable deviation comparatively 
It is also worth noting that WDC currently has a PEG ratio of 8 04  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  The Computer  Storage Devices was holding an average PEG ratio of 3 2 at yesterday s closing price 
The Computer  Storage Devices industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector  This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 170  which puts it in the bottom 34  of all 250  industries 
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups  Our research shows that the top 50  rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1

174059,395575,WDC,Analysts Estimate Western Digital  WDC  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Western Digital  WDC  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of hard drives for businesses and personal computers is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 18 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  95  
Revenues are expected to be  3 69 billion  down 27 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 115 62  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Western Digital 
For Western Digital  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  45 71  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Western Digital will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Western Digital would post earnings of  0 49 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 17  delivering a surprise of  65 31  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Western Digital doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-western-digital-wdc-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200443931,200443931

The major indices pushed through a slow  pre holiday session on Tuesday to finish in the green  giving the S P a second straight record close and helping the NASDAQ to a fifth straight day of gains 
	Any advance would ve made history again for the S P  and the index didn t disappoint  It finished at its highs of the day with an increase of 0 29  to 2973 01 
	The Dow was up 0 26   or nearly 70 points  to 26 786 68  while the NASDAQ continued its winning run with rise of 0 22  to 8109 09 
	Both the Dow and NASDAQ are within 1  of reaching their own records 
	The market has been higher since this past weekend s trade truce with China  but it hasn t been exuberant 
	Part of the reason is that the G20 outcome was widely expected and didn t end the trade conflict  Though the two sides will get back to negotiating  we can see another setback at any moment 
	And it doesn t help that the U S  is threatening new tariffs on EU goods as part of an aircraft subsidies issue that stretches back over a decade and a half 
	In addition  questions about a rate cut later this month  concerns about a rough earnings season and the upcoming jobs report on Friday is giving the market a lot to think about heading into the Fourth of July 
	Nevertheless  the bulls remain in charge as they were throughout most of June  We ll have to get through what s likely to be a very slow rest of this week before we can tell if this momentum can be sustained

174214,395730,WDC,Earnings Preview  Western Digital  WDC  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Western Digital  WDC  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of hard drives for businesses and personal computers is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 53 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  61 3  
Revenues are expected to be  4 27 billion  down 20  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Western Digital 
For Western Digital  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Western Digital will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Western Digital would post earnings of  3 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 04  delivering a surprise of  0 65  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Western Digital doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-western-digital-wdc-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200376661,200376661

174272,395788,WDC,5 Low P CF Stocks Sure To Add Value To Your Investment,opinion,Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks  There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  ratio as one of the key metrics This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better  One of the important factors that make P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company s liquid assets  It gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening Western Digital Corporation   NASDAQ WDC    which develops  manufactures  and sells data

174276,395792,WDC,Toshiba still in talks over chip unit sale one day before deadline  sources,news,"Tokyo  Reuters    Japan s embattled Toshiba Corp  T 6502  is still in discussions with various parties over the  18 billion sale of its memory chip business just a day before its latest  self imposed deadline  people involved in the talks told Reuters on Tuesday 
Earlier on Tuesday  the Nikkan Kogyo business daily reported without citing sources that Toshiba has agreed to sell the business to a consortium led by U S  chipmaking partner  Western Digital  Corp  O WDC  for about 2 trillion yen   18 3 billion  
The newspaper said Toshiba will announce the agreement on Wednesday and sign after a board meeting on Sept  20 
Toshiba is desperate to sell the unit to cover billions of dollars in liabilities at U S  nuclear unit Westinghouse  The board wants the sale  beset by legal wrangling and revised bids  to be decided by Wednesday when it meets  separate people involved in the talks previously told Reuters 
The people on Tuesday declined to be identified because the talks were confidential 
A Toshiba spokesman said no decision has been made  and that the company will not comment on details of the bidding process 
The state backed Innovation Network of Japan  which is part of the Western Digital led consortium  held its investment committee meeting on Tuesday without making any decision 
Yoshimitsu Kobayashi  an external Toshiba director  said at a press conference on Tuesday at the Keizai Doyukai group of corporate executives  that though the deadline is important  it is also important that negotiations head in a good direction 
As well as the Western Digital backed consortium  which also includes KKR   Co LP  N KKR   Toshiba has said it is considering a bid led by Bain Capital LP and  SK Hynix Inc   KS 000660   and one by  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd  Foxconn   TW 2317  
Western Digital has offered to drop out of bidding and take a stronger position its joint venture with Toshiba instead  but still wants a stake in the chip business in the future  people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters 

The people also said Toshiba objected to the possibility of Western Digital eventually seeking control of the chip business  and so has sought a limit on any future stake ",2017-09-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/toshiba-set-to-pick-western-digitalled-group-for-chip-unit-nikkan-kogyo-527632,527632

174294,395810,WDC,Give Your Investing Power A Boost With 5 Low P CF Stocks,opinion,Warren Buffett once said   It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price    The strategy is very simple   find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So  chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential  Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company s business  One such ratio  Price to Cash Flow  or P CF   can work wonders in stock picking  if used prudently  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Why Price to Cash Flow You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  one of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  Then again  cash flow is quite reliable  Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder friendly moves  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening Western Digital Corporation   NASDAQ WDC    which develops  manufactures  and

174298,395814,WDC,WDC Vs  PSTG  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Computer  Storage Devices stocks are likely familiar with Western Digital  WDC  and Pure Storage  PSTG   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Western Digital has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Pure Storage has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that WDC is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
WDC currently has a forward P E ratio of 5 78  while PSTG has a forward P E of 167 63  We also note that WDC has a PEG ratio of 0 30  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  PSTG currently has a PEG ratio of 11 18 
Another notable valuation metric for WDC is its P B ratio of 2 23  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  PSTG has a P B of 10 48 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to WDC s Value grade of A and PSTG s Value grade of F 
WDC stands above PSTG thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that WDC is the superior value option right now ",2018-06-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/wdc-vs-pstg-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200322943,200322943

174336,395852,WDC,Tap These 5 Value Stocks With Enticing EV EBITDA Ratios ,opinion,The price to earnings  P E  ratio is by far the most widely used metric in value investing given its apparent simplicity  The idea of hunting stocks with a low P E is ingrained in the minds of many investors  However  even this ubiquitously used equity valuation multiple is not devoid of limitations What Makes EV EBITDA a Better Choice While P E enjoys great popularity  a less used and more complicated metric called EV EBITDA gains an upper hand as it offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA  also known as the enterprise multiple  has a more complete approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  P E  on the other hand  considers only its equity  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Simply put  it is the total value of a firm EBITDA  the other constituent  gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued    However  unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Moreover  P E can t be used to value a loss making firm  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of companies that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  the ratio allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels Then again  EV EBITDA has its flaws too  It varies across industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure requirements As such  a strategy solely based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired outcome  But you can combine it with the other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen value stocks  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It

Holdings  Inc    NYSE AXL   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 4 Low P CF Stocks Ready to Add Value to Your InvestmentValue style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks  There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  ratio as one of the key metrics This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better  One of the important factors that make P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company s liquid assets  It gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the

174428,395944,WDC,Tech industry asks who will lead Toshiba s motley white knights,news,"By Makiko Yamazaki TOKYO  Reuters    A hastily assembled group of investors looks set to win the bid for Toshiba Corp s prized memory chip business  but a lack of clear leadership or industry clout is raising questions about who will take tough decisions about strategy and investment  After a fiercely contested  months long auction  Toshiba on Wednesday said a consortium of Japanese government investors and private equity firm Bain Capital was the preferred bidder  aiming to seal a deal worth some  18 billion by next week  The sale will provide much needed cash for the electronics giant  which has been forced to divest part of its chip business to cover billions of dollars in cost over runs at its now bankrupt U S  nuclear power business Westinghouse   But the group of awkward bedfellows could struggle in the cash intensive and competitive tech sector  famous for hairpin swings in consumer demand and a brutally small margin of assembly line error  senior industry participants said  Flagging a lack of industry expertise and cultural differences  the disparate consortium would likely need to bring in a leader from outside to run the core unit to be spun off from the world s eighth largest semiconductor maker  they said   Chip chiefs must be someone like Carlos Ghosn  who exercised strong leadership in Nissan s turnaround   said Tsugio Makimoto  former Hitachi Ltd chief engineer  referring to the Brazilian born boss credited with reviving the fortunes of car makers  Renault   PA RENA  and Nissan   It will be hard for a patched together group like the Japan U S  South Korea consortium to achieve such leadership   STATE INTERVENTION Japanese policymakers are notoriously reluctant to let big business failures hurt the wider economy  but state led investors have a patchy history of turning around troubled corporates in the country  In addition to Bain  the group includes state backed fund  the Innovation Network Corp of Japan  INCJ  and the Development Bank of Japan  South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc and the core banking unit of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc are in talks to provide financing  A senior Toshiba executive said that anti trust concerns around SK Hynix s memory operations mean it would not participate in the management of the chip business   No one in the consortium knows the management of the memory chip business as SK Hynix would stay in the background   the executive said      SK Hynix declined to comment   Still  the group is seen by many analysts as being the most likely suitor as it would automatically gain an implicit stamp of approval from the Japanese government  which is keen to keep key semiconductor technology under domestic control  Toshiba is the world s No  2 producer of NAND flash memory chips that are increasingly in demand from electronics makers as consumers look for ever larger long term data storage  MIXED RESULTS INCJ s past record in bringing Japanese electronic component makers back from the brink and aiding wider restructuring in the sector has yielded mixed results  The group  a public private partnership  five years ago cobbled together Japan Display from the ailing display units of Sony Corp  T 6758   Hitachi Ltd and Toshiba  The liquid crystal display maker has posted three consecutive years of losses and is now considering deeper restructuring despite receiving 75 billion yen   685 million  in investment from INCJ in December  On the other hand  INCJ s bailout of Renesas Electronics Corp in 2013 is considered a win  with its share price more than trebling to trade around 1 000 yen  from 300 yen at the time of its rescue  However  Kuninori Hamaguchi  a semiconductor expert who is currently external audit and supervisory board member at Oki Electric Industry Co  warns Toshiba s investment requirements are incomparably greater than those of INCJ s past rescues   INCJ s investment in Renesas is considered a success  Their strategy worked because they narrowed down their target to the automotive industry and focused on automotive chips   Hamaguchi said   But Toshiba s memory business is massive in scale  Flash memory will be central to data servers in coming years  It would be a capital battle   An INCJ spokeswoman said the fund plans to proceed with detailed negotiations to clinch a deal as a consortium  but declined to comment further  The Development Bank of Japan declined to comment  while representatives Bain Capital could not be reached  A spokeswoman said Toshiba Memory plans to provide sufficient information to the consortium to allow the new management to make decisions in a timely and appropriate manner   NOT OVER YET Meanwhile  the consortium s bid is not over the finishing line yet  Rival bidder  Western Digital   NASDAQ WDC  says Toshiba is in breach of its joint venture contracts  The companies jointly operate a flash memory chip plant in Japan  Western Digital has requested a U S  court injunction and a hearing is scheduled for mid July  Terry Gou  the outspoken founder of Taiwan s Foxconn  the world s

174456,395972,WDC,Pick These 4 Low P CF Stocks   Sail Through A Volatile Market,opinion,The Wall Street is juggling with various macro and micro issues at the moment  including U S  China trade dispute  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  data breach  apprehensions about three or more rate hikes by the Fed this year and the recent airstrike on Syria  All these events have kept the market on tenterhooks with investors scurrying for a safe haven What s the Optimum Strategy Warren Buffett once said   It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price   The strategy is very simple   find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential  Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company s business  One such ratio  Price to Cash Flow  or P CF   can work wonders in stock picking  if used prudently  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Why Price to Cash Flow You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  one of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income

174518,396034,WDC,Canon unlikely to help Toshiba with investment in memory chip business,news,"By Kentaro Hamada and Tim Kelly
TOKYO  Reuters    Japan s Canon Inc said would be difficult to invest in Toshiba Corp s memory chip business  dousing hopes that the struggling conglomerate could count on its business partner for help as it scrambles for funds to offset a multi billion dollar writedown 
Toshiba said last week it plans to sell a stake of less than 20 percent in the business   the world s No  2 NAND flash memory producer after Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co Ltd and which accounts for the bulk of its operating profit 
But it needs the funds before the financial year end in March and it remains to be see how much interest will arise before then  Failure to clinch a deal would likely mean that shareholder equity   just  3 billion in the wake of a 2015 accounting scandal   would be wiped out by the charge 
Expectations that Canon could offer at least some aid were fanned this month when Chief Executive Fujio Mitarai told Kyodo news agency the camera and office equipment maker would be willing to consider support if there was a request  noting that Toshiba was an important buyer of its chip making equipment 
But Canon CFO  Toshizo Tanaka  was not enthusiastic at an earnings briefing on Tuesday 
 We need to prioritize investment on our own growth   he said 
Tokyo Electron is also not considering an investment  Kyodo reported an executive for Japanese chip equipment maker as saying  A spokeswoman for Tokyo Electron later said the comment had not been made at its earnings briefing earlier in the day 
Sources have said Toshiba aims to raise more than 200 billion yen   1 7 billion  from the sale and potential investors include private equity firms  business partner  Western Digital  Corp  NASDAQ WDC  and the government backed Development Bank of Japan 
But a sale to Western Digital  which operates a NAND plant in Japan with Toshiba  before March might be difficult as it would likely invite a review by anti trust regulators 
And while many private equity firms have signed non disclosure forms with Toshiba  they are also expected to be cautious as it is selling only a minority stake that would give them little say in the running the business and because of the capital intensive nature of the semiconductor industry ",2017-01-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/canon-unlikely-to-help-toshiba-with-investment-in-memory-chip-business-456810,456810

174552,396068,WDC,Enhance Your Investing Power With These 4 Low P CF Stocks,opinion, It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price     Warren Buffett  The strategy is very simple   find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential  Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company s business  One such ratio  Price to Cash Flow  or P CF   can work wonders in stock picking  if used prudently  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Why Price to Cash Flow You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  one of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  Then again  cash flow is quite reliable  Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder friendly moves  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening Western Digital Corporation   NASDAQ WDC    which develops  manufactures  and sells data storage devices and solutions  delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 8 4  in the trailing four quarters  The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 25 1  for 3 5 years and sports a

174582,396098,WDC,LPC  Dell s window wide open for EMC acquisition loan,news,"By Lynn Adler and Jonathan Schwarzberg
NEW YORK  Reuters    Computer giant Dell s decision to wait out months of extreme credit market volatility appears to have paid off as it launched the biggest US syndicated term loan since last November into a market eager for exposure to debt backing the US 67bn acquisition of EMC Corp  NYSE EMC  
The US 5bn Term Loan B  TLB   which hit the market more than seven months after the largest technology industry acquisition was announced  is US 3bn less than earlier planned  heightening demand for one of the few large new money deals this year 
Dell waited out months of market volatility before initiating its massive borrowing  Reflecting the broadly improved tone  leveraged loan prices have rallied to levels seen last November after slumping to four year lows in February 
Investor hunger for Dell s leveraged loan became clear after a blockbuster investment grade bond sale last week  Orders surged to more than five times the available bonds  leading the company to increase the deal size by 25  to US 20bn 
The size of the TLB was cut  as a result  This loan  similar to the bonds  carries investment grade ratings  The company s ratings  however  are below investment grade 
There has been a glut of technology sector loan issuance backing mergers  However  Dell s reduced loan size  investment grade credit ratings on the new loans  and overall secondary market rally likely will increase demand for the company s acquisition financing  investors said 
 Out of the gate  leverage seems reasonable and cash flow generation is strong   Jean Philippe Levilain  global head of leveraged loans at AXA Investment Managers  said of Dell   The company has demonstrated in the recent past that its focus was on deleveraging  and investors probably give them credit for this  
Dell s total adjusted leverage will be 4 0 times after the acquisition with secured leverage coming in at 2 8 times  according to sources  The company anticipates achieving investment grade corporate ratings within two years 
Also  leveraged loan issuance stood at US 160bn at the start of the month  down 25  in the same period last year  according to Thomson Reuters LPC data  Available higher quality assets are being sopped up 
Pricing on Dell s seven year TLB  led by  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN   is guided in the 350 375bp over Libor range  sources said  There is a 0 75  Libor floor and discount of 99 cents on the dollar 
Lender commitments to the loan are due June 2 
 Everything seems to be on schedule and in line with expectations   said another investor  noting he was satisfied with the announcement and terms included 
Price guidance is in line with a US 9 75bn loan backing chipmaker Avago Technologies  acquisition of fellow semiconductor company Broadcom  NASDAQ BRCM  that priced in November 2015 at 350bp over Libor with a 0 75  floor  The loan currently trades around par 
Avago s corporate rating was Ba1 BB  BBB   while the loan was rated Ba1 BBB BBB  This is comparable to Dell  which is rated Ba1 BB  BB  and its proposed senior secured debt  which is rated Baa3 BBB  BBB  
Dell s price talk  in contrast  is tighter than the US 3 75bn term loan and US 1bn equivalent euro denominated loan supporting Western Digital s acquisition of flash storage provider SanDisk Corp  NASDAQ SNDK  that priced at the end of March during more volatile market conditions 
Western Digital s corporate rating is Ba1 BB  BB  while the loan is rated Ba1 BBB  BBB  
The two loans priced at 550bp over their benchmarks with 0 75  floors  There was a discount of 97 cents on the dollar  and the loans have since risen to trade near par 
 Dell is probably handicapped slightly by the fact that there are already a couple of very large issuers in the electronics space  like Avago   Western Digital   NASDAQ WDC   NXP and others   said Levilain  But the underlying backdrop is robust  he said  including the smaller than expected size and the  investment grade rating at the loan level which is rare in our world  
In all  Dell expects to raise about US 43 2bn of debt financing for the EMC acquisition  The combined company will have approximately US 51 6bn of total adjusted debt on its books ",2016-05-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lpc:-dell’s-window-wide-open-for-emc-acquisition-loan-404730,404730

174606,396122,WDC,Chinese pitch big M A break up fees  small stakes to allay U S  regulatory fears,news,"By Denny Thomas
HONG KONG  Reuters    Chinese companies are offering to pay record break up fees and are willing to settle for minority stakes in U S  mergers and acquisitions in an attempt to assuage concerns of potential overseas partners about regulatory snags scuttling the deals 
The unprecedented concessions come as China pursues record M As abroad to offset slowing economic growth at home and a weakening currency  They also come as U S  scrutiny of Chinese initiated M A remains high  making its partners uneasy and forcing several deals to be abandoned 
 These are unusual behaviors and just show that the Chinese want to get the deals done   said one Hong Kong based technology banker  who declined to be identified because the person was not authorized to speak to the media 
The stakes for China are particularly high in the technology sector as Beijing seeks to become a global semiconductor powerhouse  relying mainly on offshore M As to achieve its goal 
The biggest concerns are about the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   an interagency panel that scrutinizes deals for national security concerns  CFIUS  which comprises 16 U S  government departments or agencies  does not publish its decisions or its reasoning for them 
Reflecting CFIUS worries  China s HNA agreed last month to a hefty  400 million in reverse termination fees for its  6 billion purchase of electronics distributor Ingram Micro  N IM   This was the first time any material break up fee was introduced in a U S  deal covering CFIUS  bankers familiar with the matter said 
The usual break up fee is about 1 1 5 percent of a deal s value  but HNA agreed to pay 6 6 percent  And China Resources Microelectronics and Hua Capital agreed to pay a total of  200 million in termination fees  or 8 percent of the deal value  to buy Fairchild Semiconductor International  O FCS  
The previous largest CFIUS related termination fee was  30 million when commodity trader  Glencore   L GLEN  offered  6 2 billion to buy Viterra in 2012 
PULLED DEALS
China s goal to become a global semiconductor powerhouse has meant prized U S  tech assets are a focus of its overseas deals  The value of China s announced outbound M A into the United States has already hit a record  23 billion this year  more than double that of the whole of 2015  according to Thomson Reuters data 
But in a sober reminder of the U S  regulatory hurdles  deals worth  10 billion involving U S  targets have been pulled just this year alone  That includes China s Unisplendour Corp s  3 78 billion investment in U S  hard disk maker  Western Digital  Corp  O WDC  
And  for a third straight year in 2014  China was the country whose planned U S  acquisitions and investments were the most scrutinized by U S  regulators for security implications  according to a report by CFIUS 
To mitigate the extra scrutiny  Chinese companies are seeking joint ventures as opposed to an outright purchase  bankers said 
 People are definitely talking about doing more non control deals   said James Lidbury  a partner with law firm Ropes   Gray 
 A minority stake buy is still doable  but a board seat is problematic  It would also help if you are privately owned  but still there will be a lot of questions from CFIUS in the course of the review   he added 
Yet another way to sidestep the added scrutiny is to aim for mid sized deals and focus on sectors which are less sensitive  M A bankers said  The recent  640 million deal by China s Suzhou Dongshan Precision Manufacturing Co to buy printed circuit board maker Multi Fineline Electronix  O MFLX  is a case in point  they said 
 You want to avoid the headline grabbing tech deals this year  I would think anything between  1 billion and  3 billion can still be done   said a senior Hong Kong based M A banker  who was not authorized to speak to the media ",2016-02-29,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chinese-pitch-big-m-a-break-up-fees,-small-stakes-to-allay-u.s.-regulatory-fears-387149",387149

NASDAQ WDC   and Willdan Group Inc    NASDAQ WLDN  Take the Road Less Traveled  Rising P E for 5 Winning StocksPicking undervalued stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio is a common investing strategy  The logic is simple   the stock s current price does not reflect its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside But very few believe that stocks with a rising P E are worth buying  Let s discuss this less favored strategy in details Strength of Increasing P EThe concept is that as earnings rise  so should the price of the stock  As forecasts for expected earnings come in higher  strong demand for the stock should continue to drive its price  After all  a stock s P E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to pay  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  Now if the P E ratio becomes 35 within a short spell of time  it means that the person is now ready to pay  35 for only  1 worth of earnings  It shows that the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future owing to strong fundamentals So  if the P E of a stock is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of its inherent strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains For the rest of this Screen of the Week

174625,396141,WDC,U S  lawmaker to introduce bill to broaden CFIUS mandate beyond security concerns,news,By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON  Reuters    A Democratic lawmaker will introduce a bill on Thursday that seeks to broaden the powers of a U S  government panel that reviews mergers for national security concerns  including giving it the ability to block a deal if it could cause job losses  but it faces an uphill battle in the Republican controlled House  According to a draft copy of the proposed legislation reviewed by Reuters  the multi agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  would be able to review a deal  to determine whether such transaction is of net benefit to the United States   If the legislation passed  CFIUS would consider a proposed deal s effect on employment  product innovation  and public health and safety  as well as national security  according to the draft reviewed by Reuters  It would also consider factors like whether a foreign company purchasing a U S  company abides by U S  rules concerning disclosure and transparency  But it is unclear whether the measure  which will be introduced by Connecticut Rep  Rosa DeLauro  has support from other lawmakers in the House  A spokesman for Republicans in the House Committee on Financial Services  which considered an earlier version of the bill in 2014  did not immediately respond to a request for comment  Even if the DeLauro bill passed the House  there would need to be companion legislation passed in the Senate and then it would still need to get signed into law by President Barack Obama  There is currently no companion bill in the Senate  according to a source on Capitol Hill  DeLauro introduced her previous bill following the U S  approval of China based Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd s  4 7 billion acquisition of pork producer Smithfield Foods Inc  but it never went to the full House for a vote  TALL ORDER While the House bill does not target China specifically  it could have most implications for the country  In 2014  the last year for which data is available  CFIUS looked at more deals involving China than any other country for the third year in a row  It comes amid signs of increased concerns in Washington about a flurry of proposed takeovers of American companies by Chinese entities  Still  such sweeping legislation could be a tall order for the administration at a time of already tense Sino U S  relations  Earlier this month  46 U S  lawmakers  most of them Republicans  urged CFIUS to take a hard look at a bid by a Chinese company  Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group  to buy the storied Chicago Stock Exchange because of fears that the deal would give China access to the data of U S  companies who use the exchange  In the past few weeks alone  CFIUS concerns have killed three proposed Chinese investments  On Tuesday   Western Digital  Corp  O WDC  said China s Unisplendour Corp Ltd  000938 SZ  backed out of buying a stake in the U S  company because CFIUS planned to probe it ,2016-02-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/u.s.-lawmaker-to-introduce-bill-to-broaden-cfius-mandate-beyond-security-concerns-386376,386376

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

4 High Earnings Yield Stocks for Marvelous Gains

	For investors wanting to gain exposure to stocks as well as bonds  a simple yet effective measure to use is earnings yield  The ratio is an inverse of the price to earnings  P E  ratio  which is usually utilized to find undervalued stocks  However  for the comparison of stocks with fixed income securities or the market at large  earnings yield may prove to be more apt 

	Earnings yield is calculated as  Annual Earnings per Share Market Price  x 100  Stocks with higher earnings yield are expected to offer better returns 

	Earnings yield may also be used to compare the performance of a market index with the 10 year Treasury yield  The market index is considered undervalued compared to the 10 year Treasury bill when market yield is higher than that of bond  In such a situation  value investors may choose to invest in the stock market rather than the 10 year Treasury bill 

	However  investors must remember that T bills are risk free  while stock investments come with a caveat  Thus  it would be a good idea to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing it with earnings yield of a stock or the overall market 

The Winning Strategy

	We have set Earnings Yield greater than 10  as our primary screening criterion but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential to generate solid returns  So  we have added the following parameters to the screen 

Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S P 500   This metric compares the 12 month forward EPS estimate with the 12 month actual EPS 

Average Daily Volume  20 Day  greater than or equal to 100 000   High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity 

Current Price greater than or equal to  5 

Buy Rated Stocks   Stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have been known to outperform peers in any type of market environment 

	Here are four of the eight stocks that made it through the screen 

Western Digital Corporation   NASDAQ       designs  develops  manufactures and markets a broad line of hard drives featuring leading edge technology  The company sports a Zacks Rank  1 and its expected EPS growth rate for the next 3 5 years is 4 8  

POSCO   NYSE       manufactures hot and cold rolled steel products  heavy plate and other steel products for construction and shipbuilding industries  The company holds a Zacks Rank  2 and its expected EPS growth rate for the next 3 5 years is 5  You can see     

Mobile TeleSystems OJSC   NYSE       aims to build an integrated mobile communications world  which will bring people together  both at work and home  This Zacks Rank  1 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 10 9  for the next 3 5 years

	Investing can be a tedious process unless one knows how to search for potential winners from the vast universe of stocks  In order to make this task easier  it s prudent to follow broker ratings 
	Brokers have deeper insight into what s happening in a particular company  They properly analyze the fundamentals of a company and place them against the present economic backdrop to figure out how the stock will fare as an investment 
	Also  brokers directly communicate with top management  attend conference calls and go through the company s publicly available financial documents  They even talk to customers to understand their likes dislikes for the products and services offered by the company 
	So  one can easily choose attractive stocks by following broker upgrades  But merely depending on it is not wise though  One must take into consideration several other factors to ensure strong returns Picking the Winning Strategy

	Chicago  IL   May 17  2017   Stocks in this week s article include Methanex Corporation  NASDAQ         POSCO  NYSE         Mobile TeleSystems OJSC  NYSE        and Western Digital Corporation  NASDAQ WDC   NASDAQ        

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Pick These 4 High Yield Stocks for Marvelous Returns 

	Earnings Yield is a simple yet effective measure to use for investors with exposure to stocks as well as bonds  The metric is an inverse of the price to earnings  P E  ratio  which is usually used to find undervalued stocks  However  if an investor wants to compare stocks with fixed income securities or the market at large  earnings yield may prove to be a more appropriate metric 

	Earnings Yield is calculated as  Annual Earnings per Share Market Price  x 100  Stocks with higher earnings yield are likely to offer healthier returns 

	Earnings Yield can also be used to compare the performance of a market index with the 10 year Treasury yield  The market index is considered undervalued compared to the 10 year Treasury bill when market yield is higher than that of the bond  In such a scenario  value investors should ideally choose to invest in the stock market rather than the 10 year Treasury bill 

	However  one must remember that T bills are risk free  while stock investments come with a caveat  It would be a good idea to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing it with earnings yield of a stock or the overall market 

The Winning Strategy

	We have set Earnings Yield greater than 10  as our primary screening criterion  but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential to generate solid returns  So  we have added the following parameters to the screen 

Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S P 500   This metric compares the 12 month forward EPS estimate with the 12 month actual EPS 

Average Daily Volume  20 Day  greater than or equal to 100 000   High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity 

Current Price greater than or equal to  5 

Buy Rated Stocks   Stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have been known to outperform peers in any type of market environment 

	Here are four of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen 

Methanex Corporation   NASDAQ       is a Vancouver based company engaged in the worldwide production and marketing of methanol  The company sports a Zacks Rank  1 and its expected EPS growth rate for the next 3 5 years is 15  

POSCO   NYSE       manufactures hot and cold rolled steel products  heavy plate and other steel products for the construction and shipbuilding industries  The company holds a Zacks Rank  2 and its expected EPS growth rate for the next 3 5 years is 5  

Mobile TeleSystems OJSC   NYSE       aims to build an integrated mobile communications world  which will bring people together  enrich their lives and open up new horizons  both at work and at home  through experienced personnel and innovative technology  It has an expected EPS growth rate of 10 9  for the next 3 5 years and carries a Zacks Rank  1  You can see   

Western Digital Corporation   NASDAQ       designs  develops  manufactures and markets a broad line of hard drives featuring leading edge technology  The company sells its products worldwide to computer manufacturers for inclusion in their computer systems or subsystems and to distributors  resellers and retailers  This Zacks Rank  1 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 4 8  for the next 3 5 years

174743,396259,WDC,Cooler Heads  Smaller Losses,opinion,"It s never a good thing when stocks lose ground over the course of a week  but you ve got to feel a bit relieved that this week s losses were not worse  Wednesday s selloff was nothing short of hysterical  but gains on Thursday and Friday limited the damage  As the closing bell rang on Friday  the Dow and S P each slipped by about 0 4  for the week  while the NASDAQ was off around 0 6  
For today s session  the S P was up 0 68  to 2381 7  the Dow advanced 0 69  to 20 804 8 and the NASDAQ increased 0 47  to 6083 7 
Moving forward  the problem is that the market could be at the mercy of news headlines from here on out  There s now more concern than ever about President Trump s pro growth agenda getting passed  and any negative stories will feed into that fear  As Jeremy stated in today s Zacks Counterstrike   I think next week is do or die for the bulls  They have to push over 2400 or the bears will take control   T he longer we sit under 2400 the better the chance for a larger sell off  
Unlike the past few days  the portfolios were very busy to close out the week  Some of the editors are just picking up stocks on the dip  while others are protecting their positions from any further volatility  Let s just get to it below 
Today s Portfolio Highlights 
Reitmeister Trading Alert  It was time for some  fresh blood  in the portfolio  so Steve swapped out three positions on Friday  He got rid of NUE  ACCO and AMC  and replaced them with a trio of Zacks Rank  1s that add diversification  impressive earnings momentum and are high on the Zacks Industry Rank  These new buys are 
  CSX Corp    NASDAQ CSX  recently showed just how successful its turnaround has been with an earnings beat of 18   Steve thinks this stock could make it to  60 by year s end  It was added with a 7 2  allocation 
  US Concrete  USCR  struggled for 18 months  but its recent earnings beat of 318     strongly suggests that its struggles are over  The editor thinks USCR could make it to  80  90 by the end of the year  with  100 as a possibility if the turnaround continues  It was added with a 7  allocation 
  Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC  is a leading storage provider at a time when we REALLY need its services  The company recently reported another  explosive  earnings announcement as estimates are now 37  higher for next year  It was added with a 6 8  allocation 
Read the full RTA write up for a lot more on today s moves 
ETF Investor  The mega caps are driving a lot of the money in the market right now  so Eric decided to add iShares Global 100 ETF  IOO  on Friday to get the portfolio more aligned with this trend  This fund has a decent level of exposure to Europe and is less concentrated in tech  which is good for the portfolio since it already has a sizable tech exposure  IOO may also provide some protection if volatility continues to take a toll on the small caps  Read the full write up for more 
Zacks Counterstrike  The recent earnings report from Children s Place  PLCE  was just  too good to ignore  and the high frequency traders surely didn t  Shares of the company dipped after it beat expectations by 30 cents and raised its full year guidance  Once the HFTs are done playing  Jeremy thinks this Zacks Rank  1 is heading back up to post earnings highs  So he bought it with a 12  allocation  Meanwhile  the editor also added another 3  allocation to its VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX  TVIX  position  as he believes volatility will remain active until the S P can get back to 2400  Read more in the complete commentary 
TAZR Trader  Despite the market s bounceback from Wednesday s selloff  Kevin believes that the odds for testing lower supports near S P 2300 have increased in the short term  As a hedge against this volatility  the editor added a 5  position in ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF  UVXY   The fund will serve to tighten up risk and protect this 75  long portfolio  Read more about Kevin s  2 Point Rationale  in the full write up 
Surprise Trader  With a choppy and headline driven market  Eric decided to lock in some gains on Friday  He sold parts of five positions and all of them were positive 
  Sold 25  of Deere  DE  for a 5 6  return
  Sold 25  of Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  for a 4 5  return
  Sold half of Western Digital  WDC  for a 3 9  return
  Sold half of Visteon  VC  for a 3 3  return
  Sold half of Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  for a 1 2  return
Options Trader    Was Wednesday a one and done scenario  Two up days does not tell the whole story yet  We ll find out soon enough  And I suspect we could see some more volatility  But I see strong support at 2 345  And then at the reactionary lows from last month at 2 322  But I d be hard pressed to make a case for anything much below there  
 Again  as I wrote earlier this week  politics aside  the economy is just too strong to make anything out of the recent pullback  Employment is at record lows for this bull market  new jobs are being created at a robust clip  countless economic reports are showing the economy picking up steam  Q1 earnings could not have been better  the recent GDP Now forecast from the Atlanta Fed is pegging Q2 GDP at a whopping 4 1   and Consumer Sentiment continues to log readings near record highs  
 Look  the market is in full on bullish mode  And there is a strong possibility  I think probability  that the current bull market will go down in history as the longest and largest bull market EVER  Remember  I m still expecting 2 600 by year s end  and for the S P to double within the next 5 years      Kevin Matras
Have a Great Weekend

Something strange happened to Wall Street s so called fear index on Wednesday The CBOE Volatility Index  VIX   widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market  broke below 10 for less than a minute Wednesday at 2 p m  ET  right after the Federal Reserve decided to keep  interest rates unchanged  While some experts questioned the significance of the move given its brevity  it did mark the first time since Feb  16  2007  that the index fell below 10  Experts who spoke to CNBC said the move could have come as a result of an algorithmic glitch or some other anomaly  but it s very difficult to pinpoint the exact cause 
SPX revisits the Broadening Top 

SPX revisited the upper trendline of its Orthodox Broadening Top  which began in July  but did not make a new high  A decline beneath the Cycle Top support at 2267 81 and Short term support at 2262 72 gives the SPX a sell signal  A break of those supports may send the SPX to its cycle Bottom at 1906 04  or possibly lower 
As we conclude week two of the new Presidential cycle  it certainly has not been dull 
The markets have started struggling with an Administration which is hanging up on heads of state  threatening to send troops to Mexico  discussing border taxes and thinking about doubling the required wages for HB 1 visas  Of course  those issues are still currently offset by hopes for a sea of infrastructure spending  tax cuts and reform and an increase in jobs and wages 
The  hope  is most clearly seen in the sentiment surveys  but remains elusive in the  hard data   As noted recently by Charlie McElligott via RBC 

The U S  data has been running at such a clip  as a matter of fact  it s an increasingly  and massively rhetorical  popular question asked by clients  when do analyst   strategist expectations begin to overshoot 

The NDX retests the Orthodox Broadening Top 

NDX retested the upper trendline of its Orthodox Broadening Top  but could not make a new high  It must cross beneath its Cycle Top support at 5015 49 to give it a possible sell signal  A further break of the weekly Short term support at 5008 41 confirms a sell signal

High Yield Bond Index bounces off Intermediate term support 

The High Yield Bond Index declined through its Ending Diagonal trendline to bounce off Intermediate term support at 161 40  High Yield Bonds are on a sell signal  A broken Diagonal trendline implies a complete retracement of the rally may occur  Is this the canary in the coal mine 
The great run for high yielding corporate debt may be ending  some strategists argue 
The High Yield Corporate Bond  NYSE HYG  has outpaced the 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  by more than 11 percent in the last three months  rising nearly 3 percent as the TLT got crushed after the U S  election  High yielding bonds are often called  junk bonds   as they carry higher risk of defaulting  along with low credit ratings 
As Erin Gibbs  equity chief investment officer at S P Global  points out  a significant chunk of the HYG s 1 034 holdings are concentrated in communications  the fund s top weighted constituents include Sprint  NYSE S   Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC  and French telecommunications company SFR Group  Energy names are also highly represented in the fund 
USB may be reversing higher 

The Long Bond may have put in its Master Cycle low on January 26  If so  the Cycles Model indicates another attempt at mid Cycle resistance at 158 77may be made in a zigzag formation  The Cycle Model suggests a probable terminal high in the next week or so 
It s an article of faith in the credit markets that certain fundamental forces propel the yields on government debt  specifically economic growth  state spending  inflation and central bank guidance 
Not so  says HSBC Holdings Plc  LON HSBA  fixed income analysts led by Steven Major  Instead  high debt levels  demographic forces and wealth inequality overwhelm the traditional forces cited for the feared unravelling of the bond market s 35 year bull run this year 
 We show that many of the common rules of thumb or  heuristics  that are applied to bond yields are simply false   Major wrote in a client note this week 
The Euro rally fizzles 

The euro revisited the Lip of the cup with Handle formation before surging above Intermediate term support resistance at 107 08  This appears to be the last probe higher  as it is due for a decline in the next week as it ventures toward parity or below 
In an attack on Germany  U S  President Donald Trump s top trade adviser said the euro was  grossly undervalued   a charge which may ring true for the German economy but not for the 19 member currency zone as a whole 
The adviser  Peter Navarro  said Germany  the euro zone s economic powerhouse  was exploiting the euro exchange rate for trade purposes  a charge rejected by German Chancellor Angela Merkel 
There s no clear method of establishing how much a currency is under or overvalued but many economists think that some economic measures show the German economy could easily cope with a stronger euro  It hit a 14 year low of  1 0339 EURO  last month 
EuroStoxx finds support 

The EuroStoxx 50 Index tested weekly mid Cycle support at 3228 81 on Tuesday that may be a Master Cycle low  Normally a 2 3 week rally follows  However  the Cycles are compressed  which allows a resumption of the decline much sooner  A decline beneath mid Cycle support confirms the existing sell signal 
Building on an earlier report that signalled a stronger euro area economy  the Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0 6 per cent to 364 07 in a broad based rally  Only the basic resources sector lost ground  with mining stocks dropping along with metal prices following lower than expected China macroeconomic data 
The Euro Stoxx 50 Index added 0 6 per cent  moving further away from a key support level representing its 50 day moving average 
The euro area economy started the year on a solid footing  with rising orders bolstering job creation  according to IHS Markit 
The yen breaks out 

The yen broke out above its three week consolidation It may have put in a Master Cycle low at 86 67 on January 27  allowing it to surge higher next week  The strength of the rally may be determined by the yen s behavior at Intermediate term resistance at 89 61 
Japan fiercely denied Donald Trump s claims of yen manipulation on Wednesday as the presidential remarks triggered a slide in the dollar and raised one of Tokyo s worst fears for the new U S  administration 
Officials from prime minister Shinzo Abe downwards said Japan had not intervened in the yen for years and respected its G7 and G20 commitments not to devalue the currency for competitive advantage 
Tokyo s robust response highlights its fear that the Trump administration will target Japan because of yen weakness linked to easy monetary policies of the Bank of Japan 
The Nikkei loses its mojo 

The Nikkei declined beneath Short term support at 19244 90  reinstating its sell signal  This week s action left an inside candle that must break below 18650 00 to confirm the sell  A loss of the next supports suggests a potential decline to the Cycle Bottom at 15094 59 
Leaked fuel in a reactor containment vessel is believed to be releasing deadly radiation within the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant  the Nikkei Asian Review reported Friday 
The discovery was made in January when plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company  Tepco  conducted an inspection of the containment vessel in the No  2 reactor  Nikkei added  A camera used in the inspection captured images of a 1 square meter hole melted into a walkway below the pressure vessel 
The Fukushima Daiichi plant was badly damaged after a massive quake struck the north eastern coast of Japan in March  2011  knocking out its cooling systems and causing a meltdown  However  a recent study showed that radiation levels at the plant were lower than previously expected and plenty continue to live in close proximity to the disaster site 
U S  dollar has the worst start of the year in 3 decades 

USD continues to decline beneath Intermediate term support at 101 53 confirming the sell signal  The ensuing decline may continue to be described in superlatives 
Speculators reduced bullish betson the U S  dollar for a fourth straight week  as net longs fell to their lowest since late October  according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday and calculations by Reuters 
The value of the dollar s net long position totaled  18 47 billion in the week ended Jan  31  down from  20 04 billion the previous week 
The U S  currency has slumped this year  undermined by the Trump administration s weak dollar rhetoric  driving its worst January performance in three decades  This week was no exception as the dollar continued to trend lower  posting its largest weekly percentage fall in more than six months 
Gold breaks out 

Gold broke out above its mid Cycle and Intermediate term resistance to make a new high  It appears that the Long term resistance at 1264 54  or higher  may be within reach  It may be ready for a spirited rally to its intended target in the next week or so  However  the rally does not appear to be a lasting one 
Gold futures rose  capping the biggest weekly gain in more than seven months  as slower U S  wage growth eased concern that rising inflation will spur the Federal Reserve to move more aggressively in boosting interest rates 
The jobless rate rose to 4 8 percent and average hourly earnings grew 2 5 percent from January 2016  the weakest since August  a Labor Department report showed Friday in Washington  January s 227 000 increase in payrolls followed a 157 000 rise in December  The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 180 000 advance 
Bullion has rebounded in 2017 after the biggest quarterly drop in more than three years  helped by speculation that the Fed will be more cautious in raising interest rates amid uncertainty over the impact of President Donald Trump s policies  Traders see a 28 percent chance that policy makers will tighten monetary policy in March  That s down from about 30 percent before the U S  data was released  Fed fund futures data showed 
Crude continues its narrow consolidation 

Crude continued its fourth week of a narrow  sideways consolidation after its January 3 high  A decline beneath Intermediate term support at 50 57 produces a sell signal for crude  The Cycles Model suggests a potential low may be overdue  The Cycles are compressed here  making sudden  dramatic moves highly probable 
Crude oil prices surged in Asian trade on Friday  supported by Reuters report that Donald Trump could execute fresh sanctions on Iran  enhancing prospects for lower Iranian oil exports  Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf States could also support Trump s decision  amid their rivalry with Iran  According to the Reuters report  the new U S  administration is all set to impose restrictions against Iran after their ballistic missile test 
Brent crude oil prices surged 0 5  from their recent settlement  while U S  crude oil increased 29 cents over the prior close 
Although oil prices struggled to make big gains in the last couple of weeks due to the threat of rising U S  production  Trump s fresh sanctions against Iran could offer significant support to crude oil prices  Iran has aggressively ramped up their production above 4 million barrels a day since the Obama administration and Iran agreed on a nuclear deal 
Shanghai Index may have slipped through the Pennant trendline 

The Shanghai Index may have slipped through its year long Bearish Pennant formation at 3160 00 as market participants returned from a week long vacation on Friday  A doubly indicated period of strength may have ended on Friday  The fractal Model suggests the Shanghai is due for another 1 000 point drop  The index is now on a sell signal 
With the yuan suffering its largest annual decline ever and avenues for capital flight surging in value  Vancouver homes and virtual currencies   it is perhaps not entirely shocking that  according to the Institute of International Finance  capital outflows from China surged last year to a record  725 billion  Furthermore  IIF warns  outflows could accelerate further if U S  firms face political pressure to repatriate profits 
As Reuters reports  the Washington DC based group  one of the most authoritative trackers of capital movements in and out of the developing world  estimates net Chinese outflows last year were  50 billion higher than in 2015  dwarfing the inflows other emerging economies received 
The Banking Index had an inside week 

BNK  TO BKX  attempted a second rally after last week s retracement  but stayed inside the prior week s boundaries It resumes itssell signal under Short term support at 92 02  The period of strength extended last week  but may have expired on Friday  BKX may embark on a choppy decline through the end of February or early March 
So what do you do if you re a European banking regulator faced with the task of maintaining a safe  sustainable financial system amid a concerning growth in bank leverage  Well  if you said sell down risk assets then you re just being silly or completely ignoring your implicit obligation to engineer higher banking profitability at all costs 
If we can get serious for a moment  like in the early 2000 s  when all else fails you turn to synthetic CDO s which  courtesy of some magical  if completely incomprehensible  math  slashes the risk of bank balance sheets while having a negligible impact on profitability  It s called the Synthetic Collateralized Loan Obligation and it s all the rage in Europe 
As previewed   moments ago President Trump signed two executive orders aimed at starting the process of rolling back the regulatory system put in place after the financial crisis 
Among the targets are rules that protect against predatory lenders  force brokers to lower fees for retirees and ban proprietary trading  Specifically  Trump took executive action ordering the review of Dodd Frank rules enacted after 2008 financial crisis  and halting the  fiduciary rule  that would require advisers on retirement accounts to work in the best interests of their clients 
The future of cross border co operation on bank regulation in the Trump era has been thrown into doubt  with domestic pressure mounting on the  and a senior member of the House of Representatives calling on the central bank not to negotiate new rules at  secretive  international bodies 
Ralph Hamers  chief executive of Dutch bank ING  told the Financial Times that he feared the U S  could pull back from a global agreement on   which has been delayed because of divisions on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
 We don t know the position of the Americans any more   Mr Hamers said   That does mean further uncertainty and uncertainty is never good  it holds back investment and restricts economic growth  ",2017-02-05,Anthony M.

4 High Earnings Yield Stocks to Scoop Up Right Away 

	For investors with exposure to stocks as well as bonds  Earnings Yield may be a simple yet effective metric to use  The ratio is the inverse of the price to earnings  P E  ratio  which is commonly applied to find undervalued stocks  However  when one looks to compare stocks with fixed income securities or the market  earnings yield is a more apt ratio 

	Earnings Yield is calculated as  Annual Earnings per Share Market Price  x 100  While comparing similar stocks  the one with the higher earnings yield is likely to provide better returns  other factors remaining constant 

	Moreover  Earnings Yield can be used to compare the performance of a market index with the 10 year Treasury yield  When the yield of the market index is more than the 10 year Treasury yield  stocks can be considered as undervalued in comparison to bonds and vice versa  In such a situation  investing in the stock market is a better option than in the bond market for a value investor 

	However  it is important to remember that T bills are risk free  while stock investments come with a caveat  It would be a good idea to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing it with earnings yield of a stock or the overall market 

The Winning Strategy

	We have set Earnings Yield greater than 10  as our primary screening criterion  but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential to generate solid returns  So  we have added the following parameters to the screen 

Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S P 500   This metric compares the 12 month forward EPS estimate with the 12 month actual EPS 

Average Daily Volume  20 Day  greater than or equal to 100 000   High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity 

Current Price greater than or equal to  5

174802,396318,WDC,Gains Of 1   For Everyone,opinion,"SPECIAL NOTE  Does this rally have enough legs to last all the way to the presidential inauguration  Or will it take a break along the way  This is one of the topics that Steve Reitmeister and Dave Bartosiak will be tackling in the final Zacks Ultimate Live Webinar of 2016  The duo will also be discussing their outlooks for 2017  their top recommendations  and some Zacks Rank pointers  And as always  they ll be taking questions from ZU subscribers like you  Send your questions to mailbag zacks com  but remember that you must participate IN THE LIVE EVENT to get answers from Steve and Dave  So join these editors right here tomorrow  December 8 at 12 00 noon ET 
The market just had its best day since the presidential election  And that s really saying something  Stocks have been on an upward trajectory ever since the votes were cast  which was a month ago tomorrow  There was a bit of a lull last week  but the rally has come roaring back 
The S P jumped 1 32  today to 2241 4  while the Dow surged 1 55   which is just shy of 300 points  to 19 549 6  Both of these indices hit records on Wednesday  as did the Russell 2000 with its 0 88  advance to 1364 5  The NASDAQ didn t finish at a new high but it s really close  It did participate in the 1   rally with an increase of 1 14  to 5393 8 
 The market is sending you a message   said Steve in RTA   And that is to stay invested when the long term trends are bullish  Too often those market timing moves have you on the sidelines just as the next rounds of profits unfold  
The editors surely plan to take advantage of this post election rally for as long as it lasts  The portfolios were full of activity on Wednesday  Reitmeister Trading Alert added a company that s in turnaround mode  and made room for the new move by taking two double digit profits  Zacks Counterstrike has a real winner on its hands with Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC   but Jeremy still decided to sell half of it for a solid return  while letting the rest ride  Meanwhile  Options Trader  Insider Trader and Momentum Trader all found stocks to add on the day  Let s get right to it Big Winners for RTA and Counterstrike
  Burlington Stores  BURL  looks priced for perfection to Steve  which means it would have to keep reporting impressive beats or risk a plunge  Instead of hoping for the best with this lucrative position  the editor decided to sell it and move his money elsewhere  He got out of his remaining BURL shares in Reitmeister Trading Alert for a solid return of 13 1  
However  to make room for a new addition  Steve had to trim another position  Given its recent surge in shares and its large allocation in the portfolio  he decided to sell some Foot Locker  NYSE FL  and make nearly 18   FL will now have a 6 5  allocation  Read about the new addition below 
  As Jeremy likes to say   nobody ever went broke taking profits   Though up more than 8  today with strong bullish sentiment  the editor of Zacks Counterstrike sold half of his Western Digital  WDC  position  The sell brings a nice return of 16 3  to the portfolio in less than a month  And there s still half of this position to capitalize on the momentum Today s Portfolio Highlights 
  The  Trump Trade  has made it difficult for Steve to find good value since so many stocks have been bid up  So he went outside the box a bit and found an out of favor  name that s ripe for a turnaround  Groupon  GRPN  had an epic plunge from its days as a  25 stock and one of the hottest IPOs in the market   Today it s less than  4   However  the editor believes that management is steering the company into a healthy turnaround  as evidenced by its status as a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  after a couple of good quarters  Basically  Steve feels it s worth the risk to add a stock that could easily double in the next 12 24 months  So he bought GRPN for Reitmeister Trading Alert on Wednesday with a 6  allocation 
  There are only 9 days left for the Option Trader s bull call spread in Arrow Electronics  ARW  and Kevin wants more time  Therefore  the editor got out of the spread with a small profit and immediately bought to open a March 72 50 Call in ARW  which has 100 days of time 
While the portfolio got rid of one bull call spread  it added another in the Russell 2000 Small Cap ETF  IWM  by buying to open an April 135 00 Call AND selling to open an April 145 00 Call  Options Trader made a 135  profit on a similar spread in IWM last month  so Kevin is trying it again  If IWM moves up approximately 7 3  to  145 or higher by its mid April expiration  this spread will increase 140   Read the complete commentary for more on these moves 
  Shares of Versum Materials  VSM  are on a hot streak   and yet three insiders  the CFO and 2 directors  still picked up shares this week  Tracey likes to see insiders picking up companies with rising shares  since it s a signal that they re buying on momentum  VSM is a specialty chemical company that makes advanced materials and delivery systems for the semiconductor industry  which means it combines Tracey s two favorite industries of chemicals and semis  So it was an easy choice to add the stock to Insider Trader on Wednesday  VSM is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  mid cap company that should see earnings growth of 10  next year  Furthermore  some believe it will start paying a dividend in 2017 due to its strong cash flow  Read more in the complete commentary 
  Believe it or not  but Dave thinks that a  bigtime turnaround story  is developing for Sodastream  SODA   This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  maker of home beverage carbonation systems is breaking out to 52 week highs on serious volume  The editor doesn t like to  fall in love with the stocks of yesteryear   but its Price Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart is intriguing enough for him to take a 12 5  allocation in SODA for Momentum Trader  Read more in the full write up    Overall  the bullish trend continued in the market for Wednesday s session as the vast majority of the major market sectors gained over 1  on the day  Tech was a star that gained about 2  while industrials and consumer discretionary were right around that level too 
 Broad based optimism continues to infect the market and drive additional buying in a number of key segments  with little chance of an end in sight  There appears to be a bit of a fear of missing out effect hitting sectors now too  People were just on the sidelines for too long for this not to happen eventually  and with the sudden burst of optimism and solid jobs market  there is more reason than ever for some to dive in  driving prices higher across the board   said Eric in Surprise Trader

174820,396336,WDC,Western Digital  Shoe Carnival  BASF  Tilly s And Big 5 Sporting Goods Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   December 06  2016    highlights Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC   NASDAQ      as the Bull of the Day and Shoe Carnival  LON CCL   NASDAQ      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on BASF  OTCMKTS     Tilly s  NYSE     and Big 5 Sporting Goods  NASDAQ      

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

  

Western Digital   NASDAQ       develops  manufactures  and sells data storage devices and solutions worldwide  The company s hard drives are designed for the desktop PC market and the high end hard drive market and  recently  for the emerging market for hard drives specially designed for audio visual applications  such as new video recording devices  The company was founded in 1970  is based in Irvine  California and now has over 72 000 employees  The stock is the Bull of the Day after it recently became a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  

	Western Digital has a market cap of  18 Billion with a Forward PE of 12  The stock sports Zacks Style Scores of  B  in Value and  C  in both Growth and Momentum  The company sits in an industry ranked 15 out of 265  Top 6   of the Zacks Industry Rank 

	Last quarter s earnings have put a charge into the stock  Since the report back in October analysts have been raising estimates and price targets  Moreover  the company has an analyst day this week  which have investors excited that the stock could head to  80 

  

Shoe Carnival   NASDAQ      is a high volume  value oriented retailer of family footwear  The company provides various dress  casual  and athletic footwear products for men  women  and children  and accessories  including socks  belts  shoe care items  handbags  jewelry  scarves  and wallets The stock is the Bear of the Day after it recently became a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  because of a poor earnings report last week 

	Shoe Carnival has a market cap of  500 million with a forward PE of 18  The company was founded in Evansville  Indiana in 1978 and has 412 stores as of August 31st 2016  The stock sports a Zacks Style Score of  A  in value  but  D  in Growth 

	The low growth is the problem for the stock price and after the recent EPS report that took the stock down 15   investors are starting to run away  It doesn t help that the company sits in an industry ranked 198 out of 265  Bottom 25   of the Zacks Industry Rank 

Q3 Earnings 
	The company reported Q3 earnings on November 28th  with EPS coming inline  However  revenue came in a little weak as the company missed by  1 5 million  The real issue was the guidance to fiscal year 2016  The company slashed expectations and now sees  1 46  1 51 versus the expected  1 59 

	November same store sales were down 3 3  and gross margin fell to 29 9  form 30 1  year over year  Same store sales was a big disappointment  forcing the company to guide Q4 down to  1  versus the  1  expected 

	CEO Clifton E  Sifford had some comments on the quarter 

	 Our third quarter operating results were below our expectations due to slower sales of seasonal merchandise in the second half of the quarter    We generated a comparable store sales increase in athletic merchandise in each month of the quarter  although this was offset by a high single digit comparable store sales decline in our boot categories     The slow sales of boots and other seasonal merchandise continued through November  While we achieved high single digit comparable store sales increases in our athletic categories in November  the decline in sales of boots and other seasonal merchandise resulted in a comparable store sales decline of 3 3  for November  We now expect our fourth quarter comparable stores sales to range from a decrease of 1  to an increase of 1   We will accelerate our promotional activity on seasonal merchandise with the goal of driving sales and ending the season with inventories in line with our plan  

Stock Reaction

	The stock was trading over  30 a share  but earnings sent it down to  26  right where the 200 day moving average resides  There has been a bounce since  but investors need to be cautious with the 200 day  If it fails  expect lower prices

Snoozing While Rome Is Burning

	Lately  it seems to me  government events take a front seat  Global macro data takes a back seat 
	Equity traders continue to read striking political headlines  one after another  Primary government actors are falling and rising across the globe in 2016 
	However  equity traders seem to take each political event in stride  One after another  a shock vote has been eventually shrugged off  At the same time  traders playing other global markets   namely currencies    are not sanguine 
	This Global Week Ahead should be no exception  Don t expect stock traders to notice anything but the money printing fun    coming gratis the ECB s Mario Draghi  He speaks to us on Thursday  Expect FX traders to be wide awake    acting on all headlines 
	Over the weekend  Italians emphatically said NO to government reforms  Prime Minister Matteo Renzi stepped down on Monday  His proposed constitutional reforms included a Senate amendment to weaken its influence Exhibit A  The main trading action was in Italian debt  and secondarily  the euro  Equities took that Italian decision in stride 
	In the U K   the sitting government s appeal against a lower court decision requiring a parliamentary vote to trigger EU Brexit begins on Monday  The president of the U K  Supreme Court warned us of  threats of serious violence and unpleasant abuse  against those who brought this case 
	Expect the U K  pound to move on that decision  Equities  Maybe hit the snooze button again 
	On Thursday in the Global Week Ahead  traders should expect the ECB s Mario Draghi to extend its 80 billion per month asset purchase program by 6 more months 
	Europe and the USA remain divided by relative macroeconomic weakness and strength  The Eurozone has a 9 8  unemployment rate  The USA has a 4 6  unemployment rate  In the Eurozone  there is also little to no consumer inflation  Mr  Draghi wants to see  sustained  increases in the CPI to get comfortable about the path up in underlying wages 

What of the ECB decision  Perhaps global equity traders wake up then 
	Before the U S  market opens on Thursday  the latest Chinese trade data gets released  This data should show a pickup in exports for NOV and confirm an improvement in global demand from the USA and Europe 
	Look even further ahead  There s another big political event later this month 
	Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will make a historic visit to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii  He will remember the dead of WWII alongside outgoing U S  President Barack Obama  This will be the first sitting Japanese PM to visit Pearl Harbor in the 75 years since that war began  It follows up on President Obama s historic visit to Hiroshima All of us in stocks should remember this from Pearl Harbor  Not all political events can be shrugged off so easily Top Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  Stocks 
	BASF   OTCMKTS         This is the big  79 billion market cap German based and European trading diversified chemicals company  It gets a Zacks  1 Rank and a Zacks VGM score of A Tilly s   NYSE       This is a small  420 million market cap West Coast retail apparel and shoe company  Surfers will know this name well  The shares get both a Zacks  1 Rank and a Zacks VGM score of A Big 5 Sporting Goods   NASDAQ       Tis the season to talk up retail stocks  Here s another West Coast small cap name  with  400 million in market cap  This sporting goods stock garnered a Zacks  1 Rank and a Zacks VGM score of A  There s a 3 3  annual dividend to collect here too

174839,396355,WDC,The First 100 Days  Global Week Ahead,opinion,"In the Global Week Ahead  markets likely trade on guidance President elect Trump supplies about his 100 Day Plan priorities    and on his initial cabinet choices  
First term U S  Presidents are often judged by their First 100 Days  The term was coined in a July 24th  1933  radio address by U S  President Franklin D  Roosevelt Mr  Trump begins his presidency on Jan  20th  2017  What he wants to get done is a lengthy 2 page sheet  
100 day Action Plan to Make America Great Again 
Trump cannot achieve everything in his 100 Day platform  
After promising so much to so many    in populist fashion    will Trump get caught up in the same broken promises he railed against  and tagged as the pattern of DC s ineffective establishment  Or will he overestimate support for his policies  and attempt more than the electorate is comfortable with  
Perhaps Trump strikes a balance  It is premature for markets to judge his policy choices well  But judge they do  
Last week  Trump stock market losers were companies doing business in Mexico  those heavily exposed to global trade  or those that rely upon U S  regulation  The Mexican peso got killed too  
Winners were found in Pharma   Biotech  Oil   Gas and Defense sectors  and the Banks    with an expectation for higher interest rates and inflation coming from the new Federal spending and tax cuts he could implement  
Talk is cheaper than action  We all know that  Successfully running for U S  President is vastly different than governing the country well for 4 years

	Many times management talks a good game by saying that they will reduce debt while increasing revenues  but that rarely happens in the real world  Yet  once in a great while  it does happen  The Zacks Bull of the Day  Forestar Group  NYSE      had  293 3 million in net debt at the end of 2015  and was able to end Q3 16 with  9 8 million in net cash 
	This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company formerly known as Forestar Real Estate Group Inc  operates in three business segments  real estate  mineral resources  and other  The real estate segment owns directly or through ventures real estate  The mineral resources segment manages acres of oil and gas mineral interests  The other segment primarily sells wood fiber from its land primarily located in Georgia  and leases land for recreational uses 
	According to management     At third quarter end 2016  we own directly or through ventures interests in 55 residential and mixed use projects comprised of approximately 7 000 acres of real estate located in 11 states and 15 markets  The company also owns approximately 590 000 net acres of oil and gas fee minerals located in Texas  Louisiana  Georgia and Alabama  The company has water interests in 1 5 million acres which include a 45 percent nonparticipating royalty interest in groundwater produced or withdrawn for commercial purposes or sold from 1 4 million acres in Texas  Louisiana  Georgia and Alabama  and 20 000 acres of groundwater leases in central Texas  The company s non core assets include about 75 000 acres of timberland and undeveloped land  and commercial and income producing properties which consist of three multifamily projects and two multifamily sites    Recent Earnings Results
	Last Wednesday  management posted Q3 16 results where they crushed both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates  Specifically  FOR posted a  700  positive earnings surprise  and a  94 7  positive revenue surprise  The company saw year over year gains in Total revenues  46 7   Total segment earnings  210 5   and Cash and cash equivalents  29 3   Management also saw General and administrative expenses decline by  46  compared to Q3 2015 Management s Take
	According to Phil Weber  CEO   In one year    we have made significant progress transforming Forestar through the execution of our key initiatives to divest non core assets  reduce outstanding debt  reduce SG A costs and focus on maximizing shareholder value  Key highlights include selling  425 million in non core assets  reducing outstanding debt by over  320 million  and reducing annual interest expense by approximately  23 million going forward  Once non core asset sales are fully executed  projected annual SG A costs are expected to decrease by over  50 million compared with 2015 actuals  In addition  we have transformed our capital structure by significantly reducing leverage  which has strengthened our balance sheet and created flexibility    

  

	Decreased volumes  and higher net operating and administrative expenses are big drags on a balance sheet  and these are just some of the issues facing the Zacks Bear of the Day  Hertz Global Holdings  NYSE      
	This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  company operates car rental business  The company s product and services consists of Hertz Gold Plus Rewards  NeverLost R   Carfirmations  Mobile Wi Fi and unique vehicles offered through the Adrenaline  Dream  Green and Prestige Collections  It operates primarily in North America  Europe  Latin America  Asia  Australia  Africa  the Middle East and New Zealand Recent Earnings Data
	Last Tuesday  management posted Q3 16 financial results and they missed both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates  Specifically  the company reported earnings of  1 58 per share  which was below Zacks consensus earnings estimate of  2 81  On a year over year basis  the company saw U S  Rental Car declines in Total revenues  2 0   Income from continuing operations before income taxes  42   Adjusted pre tax income  30   Adjusted corporate EBITDA  30   Adjusted corporate EBITDA margins  470 bps  and Revenue per available car day  4  
	On the International Rental Car side  the company saw year over year losses in Total revenues  1 0   Adjusted pre tax income  6   Adjusted corporate EBITDA  7   and Revenue per available car day  2 0  Management s Take
	According to John Tague  President and CEO     We are making progress in foundational aspects of our long term business improvement plan  implementing new systems  improving customer service levels and launching new products  However  our near term financial performance continues to be uneven  A customary vehicle depreciation rate review near the close of the third quarter resulted in a substantial depreciation adjustment  particularly on compact and mid sized vehicles  that together with rental volume at the low end of our expectations as well as higher net operating and administrative expenses impacted our performance   While we remain on pace to deliver  350 million of cost reduction in 2016  we fell short from a timing perspective on our internal stretch target for cost reduction  Considering this and the potential for an additional depreciation rate adjustment in the fourth quarter  we are updating our 2016 outlook and taking incremental actions to reduce costs and drive revenue

The First 100 Days  Global Week Ahead

	In the Global Week Ahead  markets likely trade on guidance President elect Trump supplies about his 100 Day Plan priorities    and on his initial cabinet choices 

	First term U S  Presidents are often judged by their First 100 Days  The term was coined in a July 24th  1933  radio address by U S  President Franklin D  Roosevelt 
	Mr  Trump begins his presidency on Jan  20th  2017  What he wants to get done is a lengthy 2 page sheet 

100 day Action Plan to Make America Great Again

	Trump cannot achieve everything in his 100 Day platform 

	After promising so much to so many    in populist fashion    will Trump get caught up in the same broken promises he railed against  and tagged as the pattern of DC s ineffective establishment  Or will he overestimate support for his policies  and attempt more than the electorate is comfortable with 

	Perhaps Trump strikes a balance  It is premature for markets to judge his policy choices well  But judge they do 

	Last week  Trump stock market losers were companies doing business in Mexico  those heavily exposed to global trade  or those that rely upon U S  regulation  The Mexican peso got killed too 

	Winners were found in Pharma   Biotech  Oil   Gas and Defense sectors  and the Banks    with an expectation for higher interest rates and inflation coming from the new Federal spending and tax cuts he could implement 

	Talk is cheaper than action  We all know that  Successfully running for U S  President is vastly different than governing the country well for 4 years

174919,396435,WDC,Western Digital Corp Stock Climbs On Equity Agreement,opinion,"Western Digital Corp  NASDAQ WDC  
Western Digital Corp is having an incredible day in the market after announcing that it has reached an equity agreement with the Chinese company  Unisplendour  Unis   Today  we ll discuss the terms of the equity agreement  how the market is reacting to the news and what we can expect to see from WDC moving forward 
Western Digital Corp Reaches Equity Agreement
Western digital corp has announced that they have reached an agreement with Unis  Under the new agreement  Unis will make an equity investment in WDC in the amount of  3 775 billion  The agreement sets a price on the equity of  92 50 per share  which represents a premium of about 34  over the previous session closing price on the stock  As a result of the agreement  Unis will hold about 15  equity in the company 
How The Market Reacted To The News
First  I would like to say that this is a great deal for WDC and its investors  Any time we see good news about a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the market  That s exactly what we re seeing  Currently  1 31   WDC is trading at  78 51 per share after a gain of 14 00  following the news 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I m expecting to see more overwhelmingly bullish activity out of WDC  However  it is worth mentioning that price movements in the market tend to happen through a series of overreactions  While the news of the equity investment is positive news  the stock is seeing dramatic gains today  So  we can expect to see a bit of a correction tomorrow that will bring WDC down to a more sustainable rate  However  after the correction  I m expecting to see slow and steady gains  The reality is that the new equity agreement gives WDC more capital to work with that will allow them to fund further projects  Also  through the equity agreement  the company has proven that its shares are worth quite a bit more than what they are trading for  All in all  I believe that this disk drive maker and its investors have plenty more by way of good news ahead 
What Do You Think 
Where do you think WDC is headed and why  Let us know your opinion in the comments below ",2015-10-01,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/western-digital-corp-(wdc)-stock-climbs-on-equity-agreement-266702,266702

174930,396446,WDC,Lower Profit  Flat Sales Expected From Red Hot Western Digital ,opinion,"Western Digital Corp   NASDAQ WDC  is set to report FQ3 2014 earnings after the market closes on Wednesday  April 30th  Western Digital is a seller of hard disk drives  integrated circuits  and data storage products  Western Digital is one of several companies trying to get involved in hybrid storage  the combination of traditional data storage technology and cloud storage offerings  Over the past 2 years Western Digital has beaten Wall Street s expectations in every single quarter  This quarter Wall Street is expecting slightly lower revenue than FQ3 of last year  and for EPS to fall by 22c per share  Here s what investors expect from Western Digital on Wednesday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Western Digital to report  1 88 EPS and  3 731B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 11 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  1 96 EPS and  3 771B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Western Digital to beat Wall Street s expectations by a considerable margin on both EPS and revenue 
Over the past 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Western Digital s EPS and revenue in every single quarter  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a moderate to large differential between the two groups  expectations on Western Digital s earnings 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  1 87 to  2 17 EPS and from  3 736B to  3 850B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a wide range of estimates on Western Digital s EPS and moderate range of revenue predictions 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

This quarter the Wall Street EPS consensus slipped from  1 89 to  1 88 while the Estimize consensus fell from a high of  2 02 to  1 96  Meanwhile Wall Street raised its revenue consensus from  3 695B to  3 731B while the Estimize consensus also increased from  3 762 to  3 771B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and upward analyst revenue revisions going into an earnings report are often a bullish indicator  Here the Wall Street consensus was flat going into the report while we saw slightly rising analyst revenue expectations from the Estimize community alongside a slightly declining EPS consensus 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects  1 92 EPS and  3 747B in revenue  turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is ranked 3rd overall among over 4 300 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 59  and 54  of the time respectively throughout over 2000 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case turbinecity is making a bullish call expecting Western Digital to beat even the Estimize community s expectations on both EPS and revenue 

Western Digital s stock has pretty much just been on a straight climb up over the past couple years as they have outperformed expectations from both Wall Street and the buy side for 8 quarters in a row  Revenue and earnings have both been quite flat over the past few quarters and EPS and revenue are expected to come in slightly below last years numbers on Wednesday  But the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community still expects Western Digital to beat the Wall Street consensus by 8c per share in EPS and  40 million in sales

174988,396504,WDC,Western Digital Earnings Reports Effect On WDC Stock Since 2005,opinion,Western Digital Q4 2012 earnings report is coming out tomorrow after market s close  Analysis forecast an EPS estimate of  2 47  the best consensus EPS during the last 7 years and a much improved figure over last year s Q4 actual EPS of  0 81  I suppose that is due to the gradually increasing supply of hard disks during 2012 as a consequence of Thailand s flood back in November  By examining the past earnings reports since 2005 I noticed that Western Digital reports almost always beat the estimates in the last 35 earnings releases  The hard disk company missed the EPS estimate just once  Q4 2010   Thus  I decided to take a look of the WDC stock performance on the earnings release day and the day after  to find out whether positive news have an immediate impact and perhaps consider Western Digital stock for day trading The result of my research came up with the following facts  data used from earnings com and yahoo com  Western Digital always reports earnings after market s close  Therefore the report cannot shock the market  unless there s insider trading involved WDC stock gained in 18 out of 35 days that the report was published on market s close WDC stock gained in 19 out of 35 days when the earnings report was released the previous evening WDC share price went up on both days  before and after the report  17 out of 35 times WDC shares declined both on the earnings report date and the following one when the EPS estimate was missed The two highest beatings of the consensus EPS include the Q3 and Q4 2009 earnings reports  when the actual EPS that was reported beat the EPS estimate by more than 150  I entered the data in Excel that helped me to create the following graph  The left Y axis is the miss beat   of the EPS estimate and Y axis on the right is the actual gain or loss of WDC stock  The red line represents the stock performance on the earnings date and the green one shows next day s performance of Western Digital stock Technical analysis at Western Digital stock graph Western Digital shares have been trending upwards for ten years   47 44 has been the all time high since January 2010  A key support level was confirmed in 2011 when share price bounced at  23 and hasn t retested the level ever since  Lately WDC stock dropped below the 200 day moving average and retraced back to the average when the downtrend slowed down at  28  Can tomorrow s earnings report fill traders and investors with confidence to trade the WDC stock  Given the high consensus EPS and Western Digital s trend to beat the estimates  it would be a surprise to experience a downfall  Still  almost half the time WDC stock experienced losses during earnings dates In the meantime  and points out the downward revision in analysts  estimates during the last thirty days ,2012-07-25,Jim Makos,https://www.investing.com/analysis/western-digital-earnings-reports-effect-on-wdc-stock-since-2005-130754,130754
