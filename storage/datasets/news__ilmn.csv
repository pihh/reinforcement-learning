15000,236515,ILMN,EBS Vs  ILMN  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Medical   Biomedical and Genetics stocks have likely encountered both Emergent Biosolutions  EBS  and Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Right now  Emergent Biosolutions is sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Illumina has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that EBS has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
EBS currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 09  while ILMN has a forward P E of 46 73  We also note that EBS has a PEG ratio of 0 75  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  ILMN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 23 
Another notable valuation metric for EBS is its P B ratio of 2 70  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ILMN has a P B of 10 92 
Based on these metrics and many more  EBS holds a Value grade of B  while ILMN has a Value grade of D

15001,236516,ILMN,Illumina  ILMN  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 29  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This genetic testing tools company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 59 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20 5  
Revenues are expected to be  945 97 million  up 9 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 46  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Illumina 
For Illumina  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 23  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Illumina will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Illumina would post earnings of  1 40 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 93  delivering a surprise of  37 86  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Illumina doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/illumina-ilmn-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200500705,200500705

15031,236546,ILMN,Will Illumina  ILMN  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry 
This genetic testing tools company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 10 84  
For the last reported quarter  Illumina came out with earnings of  1 35 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 32 per share  representing a surprise of 2 27   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 34 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 60 per share  delivering a surprise of 19 40  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Illumina lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Illumina currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 52   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-09-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-illumina-ilmn-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200469553,200469553

21 30    Taleb s Black Swan and the Limits of Standard Deviation 27 10    Discovering Probability  Where Did It All Start  36 35    Expected Value  A Simple Yet Powerful Equation  41 20    Crazy People Who Play Powerball  Visualizing The Odds 52 25    Episode Roundup  Welcome back to Mind Over Money  I m Kevin Cook  your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics I have a special interest in helping kids with math  That s because I struggled in high school with algebra and trigonometry  and certainly never made it to calculus And my prospects for learning higher math didn t begin to change until I walked onto the trading floors of CME Group   NASDAQ CME   and entered the world of financial markets at the age of 29 I also read books by and about great traders and one message they all had for me was that I needed to learn the basic mechanics of probability While equations still intimidated me  it was the stories and games of chance  like poker  that pulled me into math  I went from still being  allergic to algebra  at 28 years old to diving in at 30 and creating a career for myself as an institutional currency trader handling over  100 million per day More on my story based approach to learning math coming up And so I spent most of my 30 s teaching myself probability and statistics  which are inseparable from some aspects of finance like options pricing and trading After I learned about behavioral finance and some aspects of neuroscience  and applied those fields to my studies of  why traders fail   I realized that probability is also inseparable from being a generally intelligent person outside of finance I ve written much about this over the years and was recently inspired to make a podcast about it after seeing a casual post on Twitter in late August from Maya Sen  Professor of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School    Maya Sen5 12 AM Aug 26  2019Early morning hot take  We would be a lot better off if we taught teenagers basic statistics and causal inference instead of trigonometrySen is also the author of Deep Roots  How Slavery Still Shapes Southern  NYSE SO  Politics Her tweet struck a chord with me because whenever I ask myself what would I do with my free time    and for free    to help somebody  my answer always revolves around teaching kids science and math Then  this Labor Day  I was inspired yet again to get moving on this podcast because I saw a 4 minute video on Twitter about labor unions by economist Robert Reich It s a good short lecture from the professor that I recommend to every thinking person who cares about the intersections of politics and economics  In the comments section of my re tweet  I also post my 5 point reaction to Reich s  5 Big Lies About Unions  In the podcast attached to this article  I explain a graph that Reich uses comparing data since 1970 for the decline in labor union ranks with the decline in the middle class share of aggregate US income What immediately struck me is that while there is definitely correlation between these two trends  I m not sure how much causation there is  which seems to be what Reich is implying In my view  the causes of both trends are found in the bigger forces that have driven manufacturing jobs overseas  namely technology innovation and free trade    or what some economists would just label the process of  globalization   And this disruption is happening at faster rates across all industries Look at companies changing the world in technology like Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA    and in medicine like Illumina   NASDAQ ILMN    Gilead  NASDAQ GILD   Vertex  NASDAQ VRTX   and CRISPR Therapeutics   NASDAQ CRSP    The technologies of the 21st century    machine learning  AI  robotics  immuno oncology  gene and cell therapies    will disrupt more companies and careers than anything to do with government policies and labor unions They will also continue to create more wealth than just about any previous technological innovation surge  from gold and railroads to crude oil and the military industrial complex Be sure to tune into the podcast to hear me explain my thesis in more detail  Until you do  make a mental note as you watch Reich s presentation and ask yourself   Is he playing fair with that chart  The Power of MathWhen it comes to the fields of economics and politics  there is no shortage of people trying to persuade you with statistics  if not outright deceive you And it s easy to be fooled by fancy  colorful charts with crisp  clean labels  But successful deception with slick graphics and internet posts is at least as old as the 1954 book How to Lie with Statistics  by the journalist Darrell Huff In presenting an introduction to statistics for the general reader  Huff did not need to be a statistician  He was simply an astute observer of the ways that facts and figures  especially in graphic form  could be used to influence people  even trick them intentionally What I did not know about the author of the most famous stats book in history is that he was nearly hired by  big tobacco  to do exactly what he knew so well how to do  lie with stats From Wikipedia   In the 1960s Huff was funded by the tobacco industry to produce a follow up book titled How to Lie with Smoking Statistics that attempted to use statistical arguments to undermine claims that smoking was harmful to health  The book was never published but Huff has subsequently been criticized by statisticians for his involvement and the arguments advanced in draft copies In the podcast  I go on to discuss several other examples where a big industry trade group goes out of their way to fund or promote research and data that are beneficial to their bottom line  These include several examples from  big food  like the dairy and beef industries and the sea change we have gone through in the past 50 years over whether fat or sugar is the bigger culprit in heart disease I also talk about  big energy  and their incentive to promote only that environmental science which absolves fossil fuels from contributing to any greenhouse effects or eventual climate change These types of discussions are critical because we need science and math    and STEM savvy minds    more than ever to help us inform decision making from the kitchen table to the board room to Congress The Big Short and The Black SwanThis was probably my longest podcast ever at over 45 minutes and in the first half I m still wrapping up with fascinating ideas and encouragement to get everybody from age 10 to 100 more interested in probability and statistics Not only will today s teens need more data analysis career skills than the generation before as corporations become immersed in oceans of information being generated and processed by machine learning  but they will need this knowledge just to survive the daily onslaught of those trying to persuade them  or deceive them We all had a big lesson to learn after the financial crisis of 2007 2008 that nearly sent the economy into a severe collapse  Still  many are doomed to repeat those lessons unless they learn more about financial risk management and leverage One gentleman scholar who has tried to teach us is Nassim Nicholas Taleb  author of The Black Swan  In fact  because that book was published in 2007  he all but warned us that a crisis was quite imminent  I wrote a review of his book in 2008 as the crisis was unfolding and am forever grateful for what I learned about the limitations of standard deviation and the bell curve     that great intellectual fraud     in modeling the risk of financial instruments and leveraged portfolios on Wall Street  I don t think any mathematician could have explained it so well And we needed someone to explain both the toxic leverage of subprime mortgage derivatives and the phony models valuing them  Thankfully  Michael Lewis was on the job after the crisis to sort out how the housing bubble popped and who the very few winners were in the wreckage His 2010 book  The Big Short  Inside the Doomsday Machine  later became the basis for a 2015 film directed by Adam McKay starring Christian Bale  Steve Carell  Ryan Gosling  and Brad Pitt I took a look at the film in 2016 and put together a quick synopsis  also tying in Taleb s prescient warnings  I did this to help anyone understand the financial crisis  especially if they found the film confusing  or annoying  Here s the video clip with a short article below it   The Big Short and The Black SwanProbability 101  How far can you throw a quarter In the second half of the podcast  I share a few quick and fun lessons on probability to get kids from 11 to 111 interested in the math that makes our world go around  from Wall Street to Las Vegas  My first story is about the birth of probability in France over 350 years ago  Understanding that Renaissance tale literally opened up new worlds for me Since I struggled with math in high school and college  and now make my living with numbers and equations  I am passionate about helping kids learn how picking up some  quant  skills could be fun and useful for each of them in their own unique way Did you know that 75  of high schoolers graduate below 12th grade proficiency in math  And it s a shame because everyone can use  appreciate  and be enriched by math if they are only taught in a way that engages and serves them I call my approach  story based math  and I think it could work for millions of kids who aren t naturally inclined to love math and get scared away from it by intimidating text books and insensitive  static teaching methods That s an epidemic I m fighting to change with dynamic  individualized  interactive story based math  My vision is to create an entire library of stories and experiential learning that can be accessed through augmented reality and artificial intelligence modules and take any kid on a math and science adventure he or she can customize to their needs and interests and changing pace Here s another video I made over ten years ago to help you see where I ve been and where I could go with this project   How Not to Be a Sucker  Part 1In the podcast  after some fun with games of chance like the Powerball  I describe a simple thought experiment I designed to get kids imagining how hard it is to win a any lottery I call it  How far can you throw a quarter  Take a listen and shoot me your comments and questions on Twitter

15722,237237,ILMN,Illumina  GW Pharmaceuticals  Paycom  Zscaler And Square Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   July 24  2019    GW Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ GWPH   as the Bull of the Day  Illumina   NASDAQ ILMN   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Paycom Software  Inc    NYSE PAYC    Zscaler  Inc    NASDAQ ZS   and Square   NYSE SQ   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  GW Pharmaceuticalsis the  5 billion biotechnology company with the first FDA approved cannabis derived drug  Epidiolex was created and tested starting four years ago for the treatment of two rare forms of childhood epilepsy and launched commercially in November I last wrote of GW Pharma as the Bull of the Day on March 4 after they released initial launch sales numbers for Epidiolex  The company surprised investors and analysts with the launch which achieved  4 7 million in Epidiolex sales just for November and December  far surpassing the consensus of  2 5 million even with the holidays  Fast forward to May 6 and Q1 results  and the first full quarter of Epidiolex sales also crushed expectations with revenues of  33 5 million vs the  20M consensus  Other key metrics in the press release             Over 7 600 patients have received Epidiolex prescriptions since launch          Over 1 900 physicians have generated dispensed prescriptions since launch          Pharmacy distribution network now includes over 145 distribution points          Approximately 75 percent of 900 patients in expanded access program and open label extension now transitioned to commercial product  Remaining patients expected to transition by end of Q2 GW Pharma also relayed data on rapid and encouraging payer coverage  including over 90 percent of all U S  lives now covered   65 percent of which have either Prior Authorization  PA  to indication or less restrictive The insurance reimbursement factor is extremely important as doctors may choose Epidiolex for their patients but payers may not have fit cannabinoid medicines into their approved protocols yet  After all  GW s Epidiolex was the first so it s completely new territory for all healthcare players  We ll come back to these issues again A Cannabis Drug Success 20 Years in the MakingGW Pharma was founded in the UK in 1998 by two physicians  Geoffrey Guy and Brian Whittle  Their mission right from the start was to research and develop cannabinoid medicines  with particular emphasis on ailments of the central nervous system  CNS  In 2010 they achieved approval in the UK for the first cannabinoid treatment for Multiple Sclerosis  This long track record of success gave US regulators confidence in the science and R D of GW When the FDA approved Epidiolex in June of 2018 for Dravet syndrome  they called it an  important scientific advance   And this paved the way for the US Drug Enforcement Agency  DEA  to move the drug to the safest level in the controlled substance classification system This is important because marijuana itself remains a Schedule I drug which means it is classified as having little medicinal value and could be dangerous and or addictive With 3 4 million U S  patients with epilepsy  including approximately 470 000 children  Dravet syndrome and Lennox Gastaut syndrome represent two of the most difficult to treat epilepsy syndromes And Epidiolex  after making a believer out of the FDA and patients in 4 years of clinical trials  is on a mission to educate doctors and families world wide  Consequently  the first approved cannabinoid medicine is seeing sales estimates rise rapidly as other CNS health indications could be served by the GW pipeline  Some investment bank analysts see sales as high as  750 million for the company in 2020 That would represent a 5000  revenue ramp in just 2 years from 2018 s  15 million and means the GW pipeline could be poised for  blockbuster  status  or potentially worth at least  1 billion in annual sales While Epidiolex will be the main sail in this ascent to blockbuster status  the GW pipeline is still very important in terms of innovation  In May  the company also announced positive Phase 3 data in tuberous sclerosis complex  TSC  and GW plans to submit an NDA  New Drug Application  this year  Analyst Reaction to the Q1 Sales SurpriseBased on the rapid acceleration in Epidiolex sales  investment bank equity analysts were busy revising their forecasts higher in May  Here are some notable examples   SVB Leerink moved 2019 sales estimates from  133M to  205M and 2020 projections went from  369M to  403M  They also raised their price target on the stock from  185 to  198 Oppenheimer analysts moved 2019 revenues from  161M to  233M and 2020 vaulted  200 million to  444M  The bank raised their PT to  234 Piper Jaffray boosted their 2019 sales view from  170M to  304M  but revised down their 2020 outlook from  498M to  476 6M  Their PT went from  185 to  210 And the biggest GW bull on the Street  Stifel Nicolaus  jumped their 2019 sales estimate from  136 5M to  250M and their 2020 forecast from  497M to  761 5M  The analysts moved their PT up from  191 to  227  They see Epidiolex growing into a  1 5 to  2 billion drug While there remain concerns about prescription and payer trends  such as off label use  new patient starts  and compliance rates  there is some encouraging intel that can guide investors until we hear from the company again on August 6 Stifel analysts do quarterly surveys of about 30 epileptologists to get data on these trends  Earlier this month  the bank shared that nearly 1 3 of usage is already coming outside of Dravet LGS  which means that physicians are able to prescribe off label for their adult patients  Of the 678 Epidiolex treated patients from the recent survey  181 are adults  Of concern was that some physicians conveyed that reimbursement pushback has been significant but the Stifel analysts concluded that  Overall our survey projects substantial growth during the next 6 12 months that we think should drive shares higher  nearer term we think 2Q will be very good  well above consensus  The CBD Free for AllThere are over 100 cannabinoid compounds in the marijuana plant that could be used for medicinal research  In a sense  GW Pharma could be seen as an important trail blazer with its successful approval and launch of Epidiolex  In two investor presentations I did for Zacks followers before the GW February report  I emphasized this  trail blazer  role and also the significance of insurance companies as key partners in the patient physician payer alliance While there are over 20 FDA approved epilepsy drugs on the market  even the ones for orphan conditions like Dravet and Lennox Gastaut syndromes  the two that Epidiolex can treat  don t work for every family So for patients and physicians to have the flexibility from payers to try the new cannabinoid treatments is a tremendous opportunity for all  including GW The other larger issue I ve raised is that these stakeholders don t want to look for medical solutions in the wild west of CBD products now available on the internet without a prescription  For young children with specific diseases  there is  no supplement  for the tested and regulated efficacy  safety  and quality of a doctor prescribed dosage To wit  when Justin Gover  the CEO of GW Pharmaceuticals  was on CNBC s Mad Money after the company s February report he explained to host Jim Cramer that  Epidiolex is different from other CBD options   We do real science and produce medicines with safety and efficacy    Epidiolex is not marijuana  it is CBD approved by the FDA  We re only reporting two months of sales  so some caution is warranted    we re at the beginning of the journey with Epidiolex and looking at other uses for it  I have been telling long term healthcare investors for two quarters now that this is a stock to buy on every dip toward  150  This will be an investment to accumulate on pullbacks as the science and the sales have proven worthy of a blockbuster trajectory Disclosure  I own GWPH shares for the Zacks Healthcare Innovators portfolio  Illuminais the  45 billion leading developer of life science tools and integrated systems for large scale analysis of genetic function and variation  Their technology is responsible for generating more than 90  of the world s sequencing data Serving customers in the research  clinical and applied markets  their products are used for applications in the life sciences  oncology  reproductive health  and agriculture  You may have experienced Illumina technology if you ever ordered a DNA testing kit from a company like 23andMe or Ancestry A Shift in the DiagnosisIn May  ILMN was a Zacks  2 Rank because analysts were raising estimates after another beat and raise quarter and I was  because I believed strongly they were headed back to  350  Long from  288 in my Healthcare Innovators portfolio  thankfully we took our profits up there in June as I saw limited upside with the average Wall Street price target near  360 Then on the evening of July 11  Illumina pre announced disappointing Q2 revenues and forward guidance  From Bloomberg   Illumina reports preliminary Q2 revenue  835M  consensus  888 18MIllumina lowers FY19 revenue view to up 6  from up 13  14   consensus  3 77B We are obviously disappointed with our second quarter financial results  Our preliminary analysis suggests that these challenges are transitory and do not reflect a macro change to the fundamentals of our business   said Francis deSouza  president and CEO   Despite our shortfall this quarter  we remain as enthusiastic about the long term growth prospects for our markets as we have ever been  and are committed to setting the industry s bar for consistency and execution in the dynamic and rapidly growing world of genomics  This negative surprise took shares down 16  the next day on heavy volume of 8 5 million shares Most analysts quickly revised their estimate models and stock price targets lower in response  with the average Wall Street PT now below  320 3 Growth Focused Tech Stocks for Investors to Buy in JulyAll three major U S  indexes surged to new highs to start the second half of 2019  Mega cap technology powers from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  to Facebook  NASDAQ FB  once again helped drive more than their fair share of overall growth  This trend continues what has proven to be a solid investment strategy  find tech companies set to expand and you will likely land outsized returns   For years  many of Wall Street s most high performing growth stocks have emerged from the technology sector  Despite some volatility  strong earnings and impressive sales remain the story for many companies in the technology sector With that said  let s pair the proven Zacks Rank with our Style Scores system  This system includes a  Growth  category that helps us find tech stocks poised for solid growth  Investors should note that our Growth category values earnings and sales growth  as well as improvements to a company s financial statements  including strong cash flows and solid return on equity Now it s time to check out three tech stocks that came through our screen today that growth investors might want to consider as the second quarter earnings season ramps up 1  Paycom Software  Inc Paycom is a cloud based human capital management software firm that boasts it is  one HR and payroll solution for managing employees from recruitment to retirement   Shares of PAYC have skyrocketed 90  so far this year  which destroys the S P 500 s 17  climb and its industry s 22  jump  Paycom s recent climb is part of a much larger run that has seen PAYC stock soar almost directly up for over five years  The Oklahoma City based firm posted stronger than projected Q1 2019 results and that helped it raise its 2019 guidance   Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for the firm s adjusted Q2 earnings which are due out Tuesday  July 30 to climb over 20  to hit  0 71 per share  on the back of 27 3  revenue growth  Meanwhile  Paycom s full year fiscal 2019 EPS figure is projected to pop roughly 24   with sales up 27  to  719 87 million PAYC s valuation metrics shouldn t really be taken into consideration at the moment as it has proven itself to be a stellar growth stock  Paycom is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that sports  B  grades for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system  and could be poised to expand as more companies digitalize many of their back end office operations 2  Zscaler  Inc Zscaler is a cloud security firm that offers two main services  Zscaler Internet Access and Zscaler Private Access  The San Jose  California headquarter firm helps its customers use a single platform to  enforce business and security policy  across apps  services  the public cloud  corporate data centers  and more  The former tech unicorn went public in March 2018 and ZS stock has surged 154  since then to crush its industry s 20  average climb  Shares of Zscaler are also up 114  in 2019 and currently rest right below their all time high of  85 50 a share Zscaler saw its Q3 fiscal 2019 revenue  which it reported at the end of May  soar 61  year over year  The company also expanded its cloud capacity during the period and opened three new data centers in Beijing  Stockholm  and Atlanta  Plus  the company that currently boasts a market cap of  10 527 billion acquired browser based access technology firm Appsulate Looking ahead  the company s full year revenue is projected to jump over 56  to  297 53 million  with its adjusted EPS figure expected to climb from a loss of   0 13 a share in the year ago period to   0 17  Zscaler has seen its longer term earnings estimate revision activity trend heavily upward recently and its fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to climb 32  higher than our 2019

into a complete financial services firm  The company s offerings now include everything from business loans and peer to peer payment platforms to debit cards and more  Square has also  very critically  become more attractive to larger businesses as part of the broader fintech revolution Shares of Square are up 40  in 2019  despite a downturn from early March to the start of June  With this in mind  SQ stock still has plenty of room to climb before it reaches its 52 week highs  unlike the other two stocks on this list  Square closed regular trading Tuesday at  78 86 a share  down roughly 20  off

15726,237241,ILMN,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Invitae  Illumina  Pacific Biosciences And Guardant Health,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   June 21  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Invitae   NYSE NVTA    Illumina   NASDAQ ILMN    Pacific Biosciences   NASDAQ PACB   and Guardant Health   NASDAQ GH   
Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  
Genetic Testing   Giant Growth Market
I recently wrote a special report for Zacks Ultimate members where I picked my favorite stock to double in the next year  Here s an excerpt   
Invitaeis the  1 7 billion game changing genetic diagnostics company that is like a  Little Illumina  in terms of its proprietary genotyping technology and  network effects  in patient and care provider medical information 
Both companies are leaders at their respective levels markets in what is called Next Generation Sequencing  NGS   From the FDA guidance document on NGS in April 2018   
In the past decade  the cost of sequencing a whole genome has dropped 1000 fold  and the number of genetic tests has risen to more than 55 000 for over 11 000 conditions  Rapid adoption of NGS technology in medicine has led to the identification and curation of novel genetic variants that promise to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce unnecessary healthcare costs 
Without question  we have witnessed the greatest impact of genomics in oncology and cancer therapy  The diagnosis and management of several types of cancer   Hodgkin s lymphoma  breast cancer  and chronic myeloid leukemia   have made remarkable advances thanks to DNA sequencing technology  NGS has also benefited other fields like cardiovascular medicine 
Based on Invitae s quality growth trajectory into a very large TAM  total addressable market   I believe that NVTA shares will double in the next 12 18 months to the  35 40 area  Investors should continue accumulating shares in the upper teens  If you already have a partial position  consider waiting to see if shares will fill the Feb 20 gap down to  16 50 
But I m not even as optimistic as CEO Sean George who said in an interview in November that his goal is  to build a five to ten billion company over the next 3 5 years  I d say that s exactly where we are going  The faster we can do that the better  It s very clear to us  That s the head set  
 end of excerpt from my  Invitae to Double  report 
In the video that accompanies this article  I introduce both companies and several of their peers in genomic diagnostics including Pacific Biosciences and Guardant Health  More on these companies in a moment 
What I didn t emphasize enough in the video  though  was how big the potential market is for genetic testing 
Not only does Illumina design a nearly  1 million machine that is used for most genome sequencing and sold to biopharma companies  universities  and other genetic research labs  they also provide the science behind most of the consumer testing kits 
Their technology is largely responsible for the massive drop in the cost of sequencing and Invitae is one of their big customers for testing  Together  the two companies are staring into a massive market opportunity 
Consider that if only 500 million people across North America  Europe  and Asia seek some form of medical grade testing in the next 5 years at an average cost of  250    not merely the genealogy versions that cost only  99    that could equal  125 billion in revenue for these companies 
Currently  Illumina is on track to cross  4 billion in revenues in the next year  while Invitae is just on pace to break  300 million in trailing 12 month sales for the first time by next June 
Even if you cut my estimate of the TAM in half to   60 billion  that s still a huge market opportunity for both companies  And when you listen to these companies  especially Invitae CEO Sean George  you hear them describe a birth to death lifecycle of potential genomic testing for health conscious consumers 
And Invitae is developing many types and levels of medical inquiry for genomic insights  some that cost north of  500 for precision testing of specific genetic conditions 
In short  the average person could be a customer for several tests in his or her lifetime  whether self initiated or ordered by their doctor 
I became more interested in Invitae this April after the company just got some great news from giant health insurer United Healthcare who chose Invitae as just one of seven labs covered in a new group of diagnostics providers called the Preferred Laboratory Network  PLN  
This means insurance providers are becoming medical advocates of genetic testing because it helps doctors with screening  diagnosis and early detection of health issues for their patients  which saves money for everyone in the healthcare value chain 
I expect there also to be a rise in government sponsored campaigns to raise awareness of the value of genetic testing  encouraging citizens to be more proactive with increasingly available and affordable screening options 
Illumina s Planned Buyout of Pacific Biosciences Runs Into Opposition
On June 18  Reuters reported  Britain s competition watchdog said on Tuesday the planned  1 2 billion merger between gene sequencing company Illumina Inc and smaller rival Pacific Biosciences of California Inc may be a threat to competition in the country  
Pacific Biosciences specializes in a type of sequencing called  long read  which offers a comprehensive view of genomes  transcriptomes  and epigenomes  Its single molecule  real time    or SMRT technology    is an integrated platform for genetic analysis that uses the natural processing power of enzymes  combined with specially designed reagents and detection systems  to record individual biochemical events as they occur 
On November 2  ILMN announced it would acquire PACB for  1 2 billion to fill a gap in its technology offerings  The sequencing market centers around the short read technology from ILMN  which is both fast and economical  But the long read technology caters to more applications and more accuracy  albeit at a slower speed and higher price tag 
Some analysts like the team at Leerink believe that the PACB technology costs 12 15 times more vs ILMN  citing  1 000 for a full genome on ILMN vs  12 000 on PACB  In explaining its rationale for the buyout  ILMN management said it sees the long read market opportunity to expand from  600 million in 2017 to  2 5 billion by 2022 
While the UK snag raised uncertainty for both companies  it certainly creates opportunity for others  In the video  I discuss the other potential M A that could heat up in this space  including potential suitors for NVTA 
Supporting Wider Availability of Screening in Early Pregnancy
As the utility of genetic information expands  particularly in pregnancy and reproductive health  demand for high quality and highly affordable testing grows with it  NIPS is conducted in early pregnancy to detect chromosomal abnormalities and assess the health of the fetus via a simple blood test 
Invitae introduced its NIPS services earlier this year and recently announced reduced patient pay pricing of  99 to improve access to testing for the six million pregnancies in the United States each year  Historically  these tests have been expensive  and therefore offered only to women in certain elevated risk groups  By investing in technologies  including those developed by Singular Bio  Invitae is driving down the cost of testing to increase the number of women who can benefit from the use of NIPS testing in early pregnancy

15730,237245,ILMN,Why These Innovative Biotech ETFs Soaring,opinion,"We have seen very strong M A activity in the biotech space this year and the trend is expected to continue as big pharmaceutical companies are trying to gain an edge in the increasingly competitive cancer treatment market  
Last week  Pfizer    announced that it would buy cancer drug maker Array BioPharma    for about  11 billion  Pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers    is acquiring rival Celgene    for  74 billion  which however may be delayed due to FTC s anticompetitive concerns about the merger 
Merck    is acquiring cancer drug developer Peloton Therapeutics for  1 05 billion  The announcement came as Peloton was preparing for its IPO  Earlier this year  Eli Lilly    bought Loxo Oncology for  8 billion 
ETFs that focus on smaller biotech companies are outperforming the broader  market cap weighted biotech ETFs this year 
Investors should however remember that small biotech companies can be quite volatile  Further  many companies have products in clinical trials where chances of failure are high so these should be seen as high risk  high growth potential investments 
The ARK Genomic Revolution Multi Sector ETF    is an actively managed ETF that focuses on companies involved in the genomics industry  The product is up more than 36  this year  Its top holdings include Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN     and Invitae    
The ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF    holds mid cap and small cap biotech companies with one or more drugs in Phase II or III of FDA clinical trials  FibroGen    and ACADIA Pharmaceuticals    are its top holdings  The fund has gained about 28  in 2019 
The Principal Healthcare Innovators Index ETF    invests in mid cap and small cap healthcare companies developing innovative medicines  therapies  equipment  and facilities  It is up more than 22  year to date

15736,237251,ILMN,EXEL Or ILMN  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Medical   Biomedical and Genetics stocks have likely encountered both Exelixis  EXEL  and Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  Exelixis is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Illumina has a Zacks Rank of  5  Strong Sell   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that EXEL is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
EXEL currently has a forward P E ratio of 23 29  while ILMN has a forward P E of 47 81  We also note that EXEL has a PEG ratio of 0 51  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  ILMN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 64 
Another notable valuation metric for EXEL is its P B ratio of 4 73  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ILMN has a P B of 10 94

15738,237253,ILMN,What To Expect From Illumina Earnings After Preliminary Results Tanked ILMN Stock,opinion,"On July 11  Illumina   NASDAQ ILMN   released a preliminary revenue report for Q2  The extremely underwhelming report caused the stock to fall over 15  on the day and it has yet to recover  Until that point  the stock had gained 23  YTD  outperforming the S P 500 by 5  
Illumina is set to report its Q2 earnings on Monday  July 29 and investors are waiting to see if there is anything that might help the stock recover from its recent fall 

Overview
Illumina is a San Diego  California based company that develops and markets products for genome sequencing and related processes  Illumina s technology allegedly helped bring the cost of sequencing a genome from  100 000 in 2008 down to  1 000 by 2014  In 2017  Illumina announced its intent to develop a   100 genome   The project is still being developed and may be a few years away  but it would be a huge breakthrough in the genome sequencing industry 
ILMN is currently trading at a P E of 43 25  which is significantly below the industry average of 55 17  Although Illumina s P E did see a significant drop because of the recent stock price falling  ILMN s P E fell below its industry s average for the first time earlier this year  And ILMN s recent fall could be an opportunity to invest in a possibly undervalued company 
Q2 Outlook   Earnings Trends
In Illumina s preliminary revenue report  the company said it expects Q2 revenue of  835 million  just  5 million higher than the same period last year  This expectation is around  50 million lower than the company s original expectations and is  11 million below last quarter s revenue 
According to Illumina  a majority of the revenue decrease is associated with  a sizeable sequencing systems and consumables purchase that did not close as expected in the second half of June   The significant reduction in expected revenue for Q2 will also take a toll on expectations for fiscal 2019  Revenue growth for the year is now expected to be 6   according to the company  compared to original expectations of 13 14  growth 
The deal is still expected to be completed sometime in 2019  but because it wasn t closed in June it will have a major effect on Q2 revenue 

 
Although Illumina s revenue expectations are now significantly lower  Illumina is still projected to post year over year growth  as it has done every quarter since Q2 2012  This quarter s revenue growth  however  will be significantly below the expansion it has experienced and could be a sign of slowing revenue growth  But  looking further ahead  our Zacks Consensus Estimates call for 16 16  revenue growth in fiscal 2020 which could mean the slowdown in growth was just temporary 
Meanwhile  ILMN s adjusted EPS is expected to shrink 7 69  for the quarter  But  similarly to revenue  the faltering growth appears to be temporary as fiscal 2019 and 2020 EPS forecasts call for 10 84  and 15 82   respectively 
Bottom Line
Illumina needs to have a good earnings report to help the stock rebound  But  historically  ILMN has fallen following earnings  Illumina has surprised positively five of the trailing six quarters  yet the stock has also had a negative reaction to the earnings report in five of those quarters  This includes Q1 2018 when the firm posted a positive earnings surprise of 40 78   yet the stock fell over 5  
In general  price reactions to earnings are highly unpredictable and it often takes more than a positive surprise to boost a stock  That being said  since there is little optimism surrounding Illumina s earnings report  the stock may see a jump if the company reports something that is even slightly positive or provides optimism for the future

130637,352152,ILMN,3 Things We Might Hear From Illumina Next Week,news,"Gene sequencing titan Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN  usually uses its presentation at the J P  Morgan Healthcare Conference to make its biggest product announcements of the year  and the company is scheduled to take the podium Monday  Jan  13 
Three years ago  Illumina announced a new high end sequencer  NovaSeq  and the stock jumped 17  in a day  As the company went on to execute a flawless product rollout  this growth stock had an incredible year  ending 2017 54  higher than the share price the day before the conference  More recently the stock has stagnated  currently trading 10  below its peak in September 2018  
What might we hear from Illumina at this year s conference  and could it provide a boost to the stock in 2020  Here are some educated guesses 
1  What s next after a failed deal 
The biggest news in recent days was the failure of the attempted acquisition of Pacific Biosciences  NASDAQ PACB   The outcome had been clear to investors for weeks  so the stock barely moved when the companies made it official in a press release on Jan  2  As it was  PacBio probably needed the deal more than Illumina did  and analysts had mixed feelings about the deal anyway 

Illumina will no doubt provide some insight into where the company goes from here  PacBio s sequencers use long read technology  which can read an individual strand of DNA  whereas Illumina s technology chops DNA into segments and reassembles the DNA sequence data from the segments using computational tools  The short read technology is inherently cheaper and faster  putting Illumina s products in the sweet spot for most commercial applications  but long read technology is growing in importance for research 
When questioned last month about the possible failure of the deal  Illumina emphasized that the company has internal efforts under way to develop long read technology  but also granted that it could be open to some sort of distribution agreement with PacBio if they remained separate companies 
Illumina may provide some insight into a new strategy for the long read niche next week  Investors will also be looking for clues to its capital allocation strategy now  Share buybacks could increase  or the company could be on the prowl for other acquisition targets  such as businesses that could give it more complete end to end clinical solutions 
2  A new platform is in the works and could be announced
Illumina spends at least 18  of revenue on research and development  R D   with the highest priority being its sequencer platforms  So it s no surprise that about two out of every three years  there s a new sequencer announced at the J P  Morgan conference  There was no platform announcement last year  so this could be the year for one 
The obvious move for Illumina would be a replacement for the MiSeq line  the company s highest selling model among its small benchtop sequencers  The successful MiSeq family accounts for about half of the company s installed base of sequencers  but it s a little long in the tooth  having been launched in 2011  
The MiSeq sequencers cost about one third of the next platform up  the midrange NextSeq  but sequences at a much slower rate  The maximum run on a MiSeq takes twice as long as one on NextSeq and produces only one eighth the amount of sequencing data  Perhaps more important to Illumina and its shareholders is the fact that NextSeq instruments typically pull through between  130 000 and  160 000 in consumable revenue annually  whereas MiSeq instruments are expected to pull through only between  40 000 to  45 000 

Lately  the average usage of MiSeq units has been falling  The MiSeq variant that is specialized for clinical applications  MiSeq Dx  is producing growth  but as a family  the average consumable revenue from the MiSeq installed base fell below the  40 000 per unit target last quarter  Illumina attributed the decline to customers moving up to higher end instruments  which is a good thing  But what should be happening is that new customers attracted to the low entry price should be taking up the slack  A refresh of this part of the product line could drive an expansion of the overall sequencing market 
An announcement of a new platform is not a sure thing  Illumina s R D spending in Q3 dropped 5  from the period a year earlier  while it would typically increase ahead of the launch of a new platform as the company builds and tests prototypes  CFO Sam Samad explained the drop by saying it was due to delayed hiring and  program reprioritization and project spend that shifted from the third quarter to the fourth quarter   That would indicate that a platform launch has been delayed  so the company would have to decide whether to announce the launch before the product was available  potentially affecting sales of MiSeq in the meantime 
3  The next step to the  100 genome
Three years ago  the NovaSeq line was announced with the message that the platform will eventually bring down the cost to sequence the whole human genome to  100  a  big improvement over approximately  1 000 today  Even with the latest consumables  that figure is still nowhere in sight  Illumina has understandably been slow to bring down the price of consumables because if lower prices don t stimulate more sequencing demand  the company would hurt its business more than help it with aggressive price moves 
But with the lack of competition for NovaSeq  Illumina knows that its best opportunity for growth is to stimulate demand for sequencing  and analysts have been probing the company about the elasticity of demand at the high end and asking about the path to the  100 genome 
Illumina will probably use next week s presentation to give more clarity on the future of sequencing costs for its customers  The company could announce a new NovaSeq flow cell that enables higher throughput with lower cost per run  perhaps bringing down the cost of sequencing the human genome to  500 or less  That move would come just as several large population studies are starting to ramp up  and hopefully give a boost to NovaSeq placements and usage 
Could this get Illumina shares moving again 
Illumina will probably talk about end to end clinical solutions  such as its TruSight Oncology 500 kit and its collaborations with other companies to produce end to end diagnostic products  But the real needle movers for investors could be a new platform  a move with consumables that stimulates demand at the high end  a credible strategy for long read sequencing products for research markets  or a new merger or acquisition announcement  Announcements that reinvigorate investor interest in the long term story for the undisputed leader in the expanding market for gene sequencing could be a catalyst for the stock ",2020-01-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pget-,2056813

130643,352158,ILMN,Illumina and Roche Combine For Genomics Oncology Deal,news,"Top DNA sequencing company Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN  has signed a pact with global pharmaceutical giant Roche  OTC RHHBY  in the field of oncology  the Illumina s CEO Francis deSouza announced 
On Monday  deSouza shared the news at the high profile annual J P  Morgan Healthcare Conference that his company and Roche signed a 15 year non exclusive collaboration deal centered around next generation sequencing  NGS  diagnostics in the field of oncology 

The mechanics of the deal are that Roche will hold rights to  develop and distribute in vitro diagnostic  IVD  tests on Illumina s NextSeq 550Dx System  as well as on its future portfolio of diagnostic  Dx  sequencing systems  including the forthcoming NovaSeqDx   according to a subsequent Illumina press release 
For its part   Roche will in turn collaborate with Illumina to complement Illumina s comprehensive pan cancer assay  TruSight Oncology 500  TSO 500   with new companion diagnostic  CDx  claims  
Under the terms of their arrangement  Roche will have the right to develop  produce and sell IVD testing products to be used on the NextSeq 550Dx  The two companies will additionally collaborate to develop tests and CDx claims for oncology treatments on that system 
Neither Illumina nor Roche provided the financial terms of their new collaboration  The two also did not provide estimates as to how it would impact their respective businesses  They did tout the synergistic benefits of the tie up  In its own press release  Roche said the deal  leverage s  our combined expertise in clinical oncology and next generation sequencing

130644,352159,ILMN,3 Things You Can Count On With Illumina s Q4 Earnings Results,news,"Last year proved to be a disappointment for Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN  investors  Although the genomic sequencing pioneer s shares rose by nearly 11   it badly underperformed the S P 500 index  Illumina started off 2020 with bad news as well by throwing in the towel on its planned acquisition of Pacific Biosciences of California because of regulatory obstacles 
Illumina will announce its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter results on Wednesday  Jan  29  2020  There are three things that you can count on with the company s Q4 update 

1  Few if any surprises
Probably the most important thing about Illumina s Q4 update is that there s likely to be few if any surprises  The consensus Wall Street estimate is that the company will report revenue of  942 4 million with adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of  1 58  Illumina is likely to slightly beat those estimates    because the company has already hinted at its Q4 revenue 
CEO Francis deSouza s presentation at the J P  Morgan Healthcare Conference earlier this month revealed that Illumina expects Q4 revenue of around  950 million  He said that the company had a  strong close to the year  and generated  record revenue  
However  that s not surprising at all  Illumina CFO Sam Samad stated in the company s Q3 conference call in October that the fourth quarter tends to be its highest quarter for sequencing consumables revenue  If there s anything unexpected in Illumina s Q4 results  it will probably be related to expenses that impact the bottom line  However  the best bet is that the company will post numbers in the ballpark of what analysts have estimated 
2  Continued direct to consumer headwinds
Illumina s biggest challenge in the third quarter will almost certainly remain its biggest challenge in Q4  A weak direct to consumer  DTC  market weighed on the company s Q3 performance and will do so again in Illumina s next quarterly update 
DeSouza acknowledged in the October call that Illumina doesn t  expect DTC to return to growth in the near term   At the J P  Morgan conference  he said that the DTC market  continues to incrementally erode  
This weakness in the DTC market will show up in Illumina s microarray revenue total  In the third quarter  the company s microarray revenue fell 24  year over year to  102 million  The fourth quarter is usually the strongest quarter of the year for DTC sales as consumers buy kits from Ancestry  23andMe  and other personal genomics companies  However  don t count on a surge in sales this time around because of the headwinds that these DTC genomics companies face 
3  Strong system placements
There is one bright spot you should be able to bank on with Illumina s Q4 update    strong system placements  DeSouza said at the J P  Morgan conference that Illumina shipped around 320 NovaSeq systems and around 620 NextSeq systems in 2019    a record high for both products 
He stated that the company shipped over 100 NovaSeq systems in the fourth quarter  This played out pretty much as expected based on Illumina s previous comments 
While NovaSeq and NextSeq are the stars for Illumina right now  look for good news in the company s Q4 update related to its desktop sequencing systems as well  DeSouza mentioned in his J P  Morgan presentation that around 730 MiSeq systems  240 MiniSeq systems  and 510 MiSeq systems were shipped in 2019 
Looking farther into the future
It doesn t appear that Illumina will return to tremendous growth in 2020  The company projects that its revenue will increase by 9  to 11     solid but not overly impressive  DTC revenue will continue to languish for the foreseeable future 
Illumina should  however  continue to enjoy momentum as customers switch from HiSeq to NovaSeq  Its new NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000 systems should also boost sales  While some healthcare stocks could experience significant volatility in 2020 with the upcoming U S  presidential election  Illumina should weather any turbulence relatively well since its business wouldn t be as disrupted by potential changes to the U S  healthcare system as many healthcare companies would be 
Over the long run  the biggest opportunity for the company is in cancer screening  therapy selection  and recurrence monitoring  With this massive market potential  Illumina s long term future should be even brighter than its near term prospects ",2020-01-26,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pm-pr,2067910

Jacquie  Good afternoon everyone  Illumina had a solid end to 2019 with fourth quarter revenue of  953 million  up 10  from the fourth quarter of 2018  Highlights included 22  year over year sequencing consumable growth and stronger than expected IVD partnership and non DTC array revenue  This more than offset softer sequencing system revenue  and weaker than expected DTC revenue  While some variation of mix should always be expected in our dynamic industry  we are pleased to have delivered higher than expected revenue in the fourth quarter For 2019  we delivered revenue of  3 5 billion  up 6  and in line with the guidance we set in July of last year  We shipped more than 2 400 sequencing systems  the most in Illumina s history  We achieved our 2019 NovaSeq goal with approximately 320 shipments  slightly higher than 2018  Total sequencing consumable revenue grew 14   and surpassed  2 billion for the first time  including more than  1 billion of high throughput sequencing consumables  And total data generated by Illumina sequencers increased 50   highlighting the rapidly growing demand for genomic information Back to the fourth quarter  NovaSeq consumable pull through was at its highest level of the year and indeed the highest since the platform was launched  driven in part by the UK Biobank  which is now operating at scale  We shipped more than 100 NovaSeq systems in the fourth quarter  As we expected  this was more than twice the number we shipped in the first quarter of 2019 NovaSeq pull through per system for 2019 was approximately  1 2 million  And looking forward  we are targeting a pull through range of  1 1 million to  1 2 million per NovaSeq system in 2020 As we enter NovaSeq s fourth year  HiSeq consumables continue to decline as expected  and were below  100 million in the fourth quarter for the first time since the NovaSeq launch  At the end of the year  we completed a review of our HiSeq customer list  indicating an active HiSeq installed base of approximately 1 300  This review identified approximately 600 currently inactive HiSeq systems that had previously been included in our installed base  Outside of this review there were approximately 200 decommissions reported to Illumina in 2019 Moving to mid throughput  NextSeq delivered a record number of shipments in 2019  and now has a global installed base of about 3 600  Fourth quarter NextSeq shipments were lower than expected due to customer timing  Demand for NextSeqDx continues to grow  and represented almost a quarter of 2019 shipments  up from approximately 10  last year It was a record quarter for NextSeq sequencing consumable revenue  driven once again by oncology and NIPT  NextSeq pull through per system improved from last quarter and was at the lower end of the  130 000 to  160 000 target range  With the launch of our new NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000 systems  we will update our target pull through range when we have a sizable installed base of the new systems We expect to ship approximately 500 NextSeq 1000s and 2000s this year  While most NextSeq 550 prospects will transition to the new systems  we expect the NextSeqDx pipeline to remain strong  given the unique positioning of our regulatory approved system  We are looking forward to shipping the first NextSeq 2000s later this quarter  and are very pleased to announce that we have already received our first orders Moving to low throughput  system revenue was below our expectations in the fourth quarter  primarily due to MiniSeq  Demand for MiSeqDx continues to exceed our expectations  with particular strength in China where the system was cleared by the China NMPA in August of 2018  Earlier this month  the MiSeqDx was approved by the PMDA in Japan  which we expect to contribute to placements in 2020 Turning to low throughput consumables  it was a record revenue quarter  MiSeq consumable pull through grew closer to our target range of  40 000 to  45 000  and MiniSeq pull through was at the low end of the  20 000 to  25 000 range Back to sequencing consumables  total revenue of  2 1 billion grew 14  or over  250 million in 2019  Just over 40  of our sequencing consumable shipments were for clinical  which includes testing for oncology  reproductive health  and genetic disease and other In total  clinical sequencing consumables grew about 20  or approximately  130 million in 2019  to approximately  830 million  Oncology continues to represent about 20  of total sequencing consumables  and grew faster than total clinical consumables in 2019  due to increased adoption of panels  including Comprehensive Genomic Profiling  As more tests like FoundationOne CDx and Guardant360 receive coverage as companion diagnostics  demand for Illumina sequencing continues to grow Additionally  clinical trials  like Guardants LUNAR  drive increased sequencing consumable utilization in oncology testing  Reproductive health once again represented a little more than 10  of sequencing consumables  primarily reflecting continued growth in NIPT due to broader coverage in EMEA  where our VeriSeq NIPT solution had 80  sample volume growth  and growing adoption in China  Reproductive health continues to grow in the U S   at a more modest rate compared to EMEA and China Finally  within clinical  almost 10  of our sequencing consumable revenue is related to genetic disease testing  which grew slightly below the clinical average  Growth is driven by companies like Centogene  which has built a genomic repository of over 450 000 patients from over 125 countries  and is working to help diagnose patients genetic disease and collaborating with pharma partners to find cures  It also includes a portion of revenue from genetic testing companies like Ambry  who offer tests tailored toward genetic disease diagnosis  among other clinical tests Turning to research and applied  shipments of over  1 2 billion represented just under 60  of our sequencing consumable shipments  As a group  research grew over 10  in 2019 driven by genetic disease and cancer  Genetic disease research includes population genomics initiatives such as the UK Biobank and the Million Veteran Program Cancer research was also a strong contributor to growth  and includes projects like the cloud initiative at St  Jude Children s Research Hospital  The St  Jude team is building a database to access whole genomes of 10 000 pediatric patients and survivors  helping researchers to gain valuable insights into the genetic causes of pediatric cancer Other research categories include Cell and Molecular Biology Research  Microbiology  and Infectious Disease Testing  This includes projects like J GRID  the Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Disease  which is a collaboration between nine countries in Asia and Africa  and utilizes Illumina sequencing to research microbial diseases Moving to sequencing services and other  revenue of  124 million was up 19  from the same quarter a year ago  largely driven by upfront revenue from the Roche deal  partially offset by GeL which declined  as expected  to almost zero in the fourth quarter of 2019 ahead of the clinical ramp up later this year And finally  arrays delivered revenue of  116 million  down 12  from the same quarter in 2018 due to continued headwinds from our direct to consumer customers  offset in part by array growth in genetic disease research Before I hand the call over to Sam  I d like to comment on the novel coronavirus outbreak  Our immediate focus has been our colleagues in China  and our thoughts are with the families and communities impacted  Over the last few weeks  Illumina has been engaged in a number of ways to help manage the coronavirus outbreak  Scientists have already used Illumina sequencers to identify and publish the genomic profile of the coronavirus into the public databases  which is a critical first step to enable the development of diagnostic tests and ultimately potential vaccines Our team is actively working with Chinese CDC labs to prepare Coronavirus NGS Testing Protocols and provide the necessary training  We are also working with our supply chain team to ensure that systems and consumables are delivered to labs working with novel coronavirus as quickly as possible  We plan to share these NGS testing protocols with customers to support the global infectious disease community as it mobilizes to address this threat  Further  were exploring philanthropic programs and collaborations to ensure novel coronavirus sequencing is available by providing sequencing and consumables to those who need it to fight this epidemic With that  I ll hand the call over to Sam Sam Samad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Francis  As discussed  fourth quarter revenue grew 10  year over year to  953 million  driven by 14  growth in sequencing  offset by a 12  decline in microarrays  Total sequencing revenue of  837 million grew 14  from the fourth quarter of 2018 and represented 88  of total revenue compared to 85  in the same quarter last year  Sequencing consumable revenue of  572 million grew 22  or over  100 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  while sequencing system revenue was down slightly sequentially and down 12  compared to last year With regards to sequencing systems  we are reviewing installed base counts to proactively identify the active systems  We have completed the work for HiSeq  and are now reviewing NextSeq  MiSeq and MiniSeq  We will revise those installed bases in the next quarter or two as we complete the analysis  Importantly  this does not change the reported revenue in any way  However  we do expect system counts to decrease  while the pull through per system will therefore increase Sequencing service and other revenue of  124 million was down  14 million sequentially due to lower IVD licensing and milestone revenue and lower GeL volumes in the fourth quarter  but up 19  year over year  Fourth quarter results included an upfront payment associated with the recently announced Roche partnership  Arrays represented 12  of total revenue in the fourth quarter  compared to 15  in the fourth quarter of 2018 and to 16  in the fourth quarter of 2017 Array systems were up  2 million sequentially  but down  5 million from a particularly strong fourth quarter of 2018  Array consumables grew  18 million sequentially due to DTC seasonality with one customer ramping ahead of the holiday season  but were modestly down from the same quarter last year  Array services were down  6 million sequentially and down  8 million or 32  year over year due to lower demand from our DTC customer Moving to regional results  Americas revenue grew 5  versus the prior year quarter with growth in sequencing consumables and IVD partnership revenue  partially offset by DTC headwinds  EMEA delivered a record revenue quarter with 19  growth from the prior year quarter  including a strong contribution from the UK Biobank  which is now sequencing in full production mode  Greater China grew 21  from prior year quarter  with an easy year over year comp associated with tariff related stocking in China in the fourth quarter of 2018  The region grew 2  in 2019  with slower research offsetting very strong growth in clinical  Finally  APJ revenue of  73 million was up 4  from the fourth quarter of 2018  driven by genetic disease research and microbiology driving sequencing consumable growth both sequentially and year over year  For the full year  the region grew 6  Moving to gross margin and operating expenses  I will highlight non GAAP results that include stock based compensation  I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non GAAP measures  which can be found in todays release and the supplementary data available on our website  Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders Non GAAP gross margin of 70 2  was roughly in line with expectations and decreased approximately 230 basis points compared to the third quarter  with lower IVD licensing and development revenue  in addition to variances in production and lab service absorption partially offset by product mix  Year over year  fourth quarter non GAAP gross margin increased over 100 basis points primarily due to product mix and higher IVD licensing and development revenue  partially offset by lower DTC service volumes Non GAAP operating expenses of  372 million were up  42 million from the third quarter of 2019  largely reflecting the timing of opex spend weighted toward the end of the year and were better than expected  Non GAAP operating margin was therefore 31   down from 36 1  last quarter  The non GAAP tax rate of 18 5  was up from last quarter and higher than expected due to income mix in various tax jurisdictions  For the fourth quarter of 2019  GAAP net income was  239 million or  1 61 per diluted share  and non GAAP net income was  252 million or  1 70 per diluted share Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items  Cash flow from operations was  443 million  helped in part by a  58 million sequential decline in inventory  This is part of an initiative  led by our Operations and Supply Chain organizations  to optimize our working capital DSO of 55 days compared to 54 days last quarter  Fourth quarter capital expenditures were  57 million and free cash flow was  386 million  And we repurchased  63 million of stock in the fourth quarter  leaving  226 million available for share repurchases under our current plan  We ended the year with approximately  3 4 billion in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 148 million Moving to guidance  we expect full year 2020 revenue to grow in the range of 9  to 11  or  3 86 billion to  3 93 billion representing an increase of approximately  354 million at the midpoint  Given the new system launch  and ongoing weakness in DTC  we are expecting revenue linearity to be similar to 2017  which suggests just below 22  of revenue in Q1  approximately 24  in Q2  approximately 26  in Q3  and approximately 28  in Q4 For the full year 2020 and at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range  we expect sequencing revenue to grow approximately 14   This includes sequencing consumable growth around 17   And we expect sequencing system revenue to grow year over year reflecting our NextSeq 2000 and NextSeq 1000 launch more than offsetting the expected step down in NovaSeq shipments And we also expect sequencing service and other to be roughly flat year over year  We expect array revenue to be down approximately 15  reflecting ongoing weakness in DTC  Note that DTC revenue represented approximately 50  of total array revenue in 2018 and decreased to about 40  in 2019  For 2020  we expect DTC to represent approximately 30  From a regional perspective we expect China to grow in the high teens  driven by clinical sequencing  We expect full year non GAAP gross margin to be roughly in line with 2019  We expect operating margin to be approximately 30   and we expect the 2020 tax rate to be higher than full year 2019 due to a number of one time discrete tax benefits in 2019 that are not expected to repeat in 2020 We therefore expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of  6 45 to  6 65  and non GAAP earnings per share in the range of  6 80 to  7  And we expect diluted shares outstanding in 2020 to be about flat compared to Q4 2019 Note that  following the termination of the Pacific BioSciences merger agreement earlier this month  Illumina paid a  98 million reverse termination fee to PacBio  Additionally  Illumina will pay  34 million in continuation advances that may be repayable to Illumina if PacBio enters a change of control agreement or raises at least  100 million within a given timeframe  The impact of these payments is not reflected in our EPS guidance  pending the valuation of these amounts this quarter Moving to the first quarter of 2020  We expect total revenue to be between  850 million and  855 million as customers consider and adjust their plans following our NextSeq 2000 launch  Non GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase approximately 600 basis points as a percentage of revenue on a sequential basis primarily due to our bonus accrual reset at the start of the year  And we expect the first quarter non GAAP EPS to be between  1 20 and  1 25  and GAAP EPS to be  1 11 to  1 16 With that  I ll hand the call back over to Francis Francis deSouza    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Sam  Were off to a strong start in 2020  The UK Biobank is sequencing at scale  and we are contracted with GEL to provide sequencing services starting in the middle of the year  significantly strengthening our popgen visibility relative to where we were a year ago We launched our most innovative system to date with the NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000  The system offers the highest cluster density flow cell of any NGS system  driving down the cost per gigabase for mid throughput users  And we succeeded in our ambitious target to fully integrate the hardware accelerated  best in class pipeline that we acquired with Edico just 18 months ago  We re excited about our TruSight Software Suite  a potentially transformative solution that simplifies genetic disease diagnoses and reduces barriers to adoption  I look forward to sharing updates on it after launch We continue to extend our clinical portfolio  and both TSO 500 and TruSight NIPT are progressing through regulatory  And we are expanding our capabilities through partnerships with the world s leading clinical companies  including Qiagen  Roche and Adaptive  to deliver the most compelling IVD menu available on our clinical grade sequencing systems  As our customers discover more biological insights by sequencing at greater depths and volumes across new and emerging applications  the growing clinical utility of genomic information is becoming increasingly clear  This  coupled with growing community awareness and physician adoption  will enable more patients to benefit from the promise of genomics With that  I ll invite the operator  to start the Q A Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan  Your line is open Steve Beuchaw    Wolfe Research    AnalystHey  thanks  Ill try to ask just a couple of quick ones up front  On the fourth quarter  can you quantify the Roche milestone  It looks like the partnership fees stepped up  15 million to  20 million  So was that all Roche in the fourth quarter  And then looking ahead on instruments  coming off 4Q  where you relied on instrument revenues  Are you doing anything different in terms of NovaSeq pricing to try to catalyze the remainder of the HiSeq upgrade cycle  It looked like NovaSeq ASPs did decline a bit in the fourth quarter  So that s the first question And then on NextSeq  just curious  as you think about that  is it an upgrade cycle to the installed base or market expansive as those two new systems get rolled out into the market  ThanksSam Samad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  thanks Tycho  So this is Sam  On the Roche milestone  we didnt quantify that  It did come in better than expected  So the sequencing and another line came in better than expected in Q4  I would say  approximately  20 million or so better than expected in terms of sequencing and other  But we didn t quantify exactly how much of that was Roche  You can think about it as IVD revenues that we had in Q4 that the majority of which was driven by Roche With regards to your second question  so I ll take that one and then Francis can comment on NextSeq  With regards to your second question around the ASP on NovaSeq  it s not that we re doing anything special around reducing the ASP or giving    reducing the price or giving any discounts to customers  What we    this is natural and driven by a multiunit orders that we have across 2019 as well  You can look at it at the UK Biobank a number of placements that we have with the UK Biobank that usually have a lower ASP  We ve had some NovaSeq placements in emerging markets which also have a lower ASP  So it s natural dynamics there when you place multiunit orders with some of our customers  but nothing specific on lowering the price across the board Francis deSouza    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Sam  Hi  Tycho  In terms of the NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000 target base that we re going after  we are already focusing  as you pointed out  this to be an upgrade cycle for customers of the NextSeq 550 today  That s where we expect the bulk of the demand to come from for the NextSeq 2000 launches this quarter and then the NextSeq 1000 launches later in the year  We also expect a smaller bolus of orders to come from some MiSeq customers  We highlighted a couple of quarters ago that we expect    that we re starting to see MiSeq customers that are migrating up and buying bigger instruments  we expect those customers to be looking at the NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000 And so that s where we expect the bulk of the customers to come from  There s a chance that there might be a small number of HiSeq customers that look at the NextSeq 2000  But that s likely to be a very small number OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS  Your line is open Dan Brennan    UBS    AnalystGreat  thanks for taking the question  So I just wanted a little more color on kind of NovaSeqs  the center you re talking about placements being down in 2020  Can you give us some help on how much of the install base you expect to kind of have upgraded by the end of the year and kind of any more color on the level of it being down And then secondly  just related to HiSeq consumables since you are kind of giving more granularity there  What s kind of baked in within your consumable guidance by HiSeq consumables in 2020 Francis deSouza    President and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  so if we look at the the NovaSeq upgrade cycle  so here s how the numbers are playing out  We believe that under half of the HiSeq  HiSeq X customer base has started the NovaSeq transition  And so we still have over half of that install base to go  That s going to play out between now and 2024 when we end of life the HiSeqs  And so that s the numbers we expect to happen In terms of the number of NovaSeqs last year was a very strong year in terms of NovaSeq placements  which is something we re really excited about  especially given that it s the third year of the NovaSeq upgrade cycle  We expect that number to come down this year quite naturally and we expect that to play out similarly over the next couple of years Sam Samad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd with regards to HiSeq  Dan  we re not giving specific information on the level of consumables or what to expect even in terms of pull through  We ve backed away from giving pull through ranges on HiSeq and total consumables  What we ve mentioned for Q4  as you heard on the prepared remarks  was that consumables for HiSeq were less than a  100 million in the quarter  they continue to come down  obviously the expectation  I think  intuitively as you would expect in 2020 that HiSeq consumables will continue to come down  But we haven t given specifics on what that dollar number is OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research  Your line is open Steve Beuchaw    Wolfe Research    AnalystHi  good afternoon  And thanks for the time here  I want to ask one on China and one on the NextSeq launch  As it relates to China  I appreciate that you ve given a view dating back to a few weeks ago that there s an expectation for some recovery of growth in China  I wonder if you could speak to the balance of what you re seeing there between funding dynamics    as opposed to maybe just easier comps  And then of course the broader question that we have now around the environment given the viral outbreak to what extent that is or is not a factor that one considers And then secondarily  now that we re a few weeks into  and I appreciate that still early  the NextSeq launch  How are your higher throughput customers who might also be NovaSeq buyers or owners  How are they thinking about using this system  Is it fair to say that we were comfortable with the trajectory on NovaSeq orders being largely un impacted by the NextSeq given as a pretty attractive price per G dynamics on the P3 flow cell  Thanks Sam Samad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  so thanks Steve  I ll start with the China question and then I ll get to the NextSeq question  In terms of China and what we re looking for  we saw good growth from China in Q4 a little of it was based on a friendly year on year comp  but we are seeing growth and we knew that would be lumpy  In terms of this year  we are expecting  as we said  growth in China that s going to be primarily driven from the clinical markets and more specifically oncology continues to be a very strong area for us in China  And we expect that to continue to play out this year In terms of the coronavirus  I ll say first and foremost  our thoughts are with the families and communities that are impacted by the virus and are one of one of our top priorities to make sure we re doing everything we can to help and making sure that our teams stay safe  In terms of the financial impact of that it s too early to call the financial impact either in Q1 or for the year  And as we get more clarity  as this plays out  we ll certainly communicate transparently with investors As we thought through the impact it s possible that if the epidemic grows and if patients start to avoid going to hospitals  there could be an impact to NIPT and cancer testing in China  But it s way too early to call that impact  So we re going to continue to watch that situation  And again  we ll communicate with you what we see  We are deeply engaged in working on the coronavirus  We have teams working on that around the world with the Chinese CDC teams  as well as CDC teams around the world And then in terms of the NextSeq launch and how are our high throughput customers  especially some of the legacy HiSeq customers thinking about it  So as I said  we really expect the NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000 to appeal to existing NextSeq customers  That s going to be the bolus of the upgrade cycle  There s going to be some interest from MiSeq customers that are upgrading and a little interest from existing high throughput customers  but not much  The reason for that is if you look at the output of the NovaSeq and you look at the output of the NextSeq  what we ve done is we ve tried to cover the ground  but there s very little overlap So at the very high end if you go through the    if you go with the high output flow cell of the NextSeq 2000  you can get to an output of 300 gigabases  And at the low end of the NovaSeq with the prime flow cells  you can get a 500 gigabases of output  And so there s a clear gap there  And so you can    you self identify  And most of our high throughput customers  we think will go with the smaller flow cell on the NovaSeq and the NextSeq 2000 and NextSeq 1000 will continue to appeal to that mid throughput customer base OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Sandler  Your line is open Bill Quirk    Piper Sandler    AnalystGreat  Thanks and good afternoon everybody  So quickly thinking about the clinical oncology growth of the next couple of years  there s several very innovative noninvasive screening option as well as our current monitoring test coming online  How should we think about the business overall trending relative to 2019 did a possibly inflect back to the    I think  it was 30  maybe year or two ago  And then separately  on coronavirus  are there any analogous situations to other outbreaks  things like  MERS  for example  And if so  have you study the impact on what happens  say  in the middle of the east region to your business during that outbreak and taking to look at that relative to coronavirus  Thanks  guys Francis deSouza    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Bill  So Ill first talk about the clinical oncology market  specifically  touching on the potential impacts of the screening opportunity and emerging monitoring opportunities on the growth rate  And then I will talk about the coronavirus  So in terms of clinical oncology testing  today  the bulk of the revenue that we get from clinical oncology and the bulk of the growth  frankly  is coming from customers that are using NGS based testing  various types of panels for therapy selection And so that sort of the bulk of the revenue that we re see in clinical oncology  that s the most penetrated part of the clinical oncology market  But frankly  it s still at its early stages  It s still about 8  penetrated  As we look at the other areas in clinical oncology  we see really exciting opportunities and potentially much larger opportunities coming from monitoring and screening Both of them are in the very  very  very nascent stages  customers like Guardant and GRAIL and Phenom are doing some really exciting work there  The monitoring opportunity is starting to play out maybe a little bit further along than the screening opportunity today  where we re seeing the early use of liquid biopsies to monitor the effectiveness of a therapy to look for MRD and for recurrence of a cancer And so their customers like Guardant are starting to sell tests into that space  Again  very early stage  we re starting to see revenue from it and when we think this represents a potential large growth opportunity for us in the future years  Screening is a little bit earlier  again  super nascent  but hugely exciting  I don t know  if you ve had a chance to look at the results that companies like Phenom and GRAIL have been publishing over the last few months at ASCO and ESMO But the GRAIL results for example  show that they are able to    in those studies have very low false positive rates  So their numbers indicate maybe less than 0 5  false positive rates and high levels of specificity or over 20 different types of cancer  So they re still in the study stage  they re talking about having a test maybe end of this year  sometime next year  Obviously  that represents a very meaningful market opportunity in terms of impact on human life and represents a very big opportunity in terms of revenue for those companies and also for Illumina  But that s something that ll play out  not much this year  but in future years If you think about coronavirus and how that s playing out  And we looked at MERS played out and SARS played out  And it s a little bit different because the market is a little bit further ahead in terms of the state of the art NGS testing The way this will play out  we think is that NGS will play a number of critical roles and combating this coronavirus outbreak  While we believe first line testing of patients will be done with RTPCR  NGS will be used in a number of specific ways  One  we ve already seen it play out where NGS will be used to initially sequence the virus and create the publicly available reference needed to help develop diagnostics and then ultimately cures So we started to see that play out already with coronavirus and we saw that previously with SARS  And yes  we ll also be used to confirm the strength in patients  It ll be used for detecting novel mutations in the viral genome  We saw that in other outbreaks  not just MERS and SARS that we saw that with Ebola  And then also  it will be used for immunological surveillance  which will be very important in terms of tracking this outbreak And then finally  we expect NGS to also be used as last resort testing  patients with inconclusive tests  So for example  when a patient presents with suspicious symptoms  but the RTPCR tests are negative for coronavirus  And also for other viruses with similar symptoms like influenza  then we expect in NGS test to be used And that s our point of view based on what we ve seen with previous outbreaks  As I said earlier  our teams around the world are currently engaged and have been working  for example  in China with the CDC teams in December and we re working with CDC teams around the world now  We re also engaged with philanthropic organizations and collaborations to make sure that NGS testing is available globally to monitor this outbreak Sam Samad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd Bill  maybe to emphasize a couple of data points on the clinical business and oncology as well back to your initial question  So for 2019  for our comments earlier  our sequencing consumables in terms of clinical grew by approximately 20  and oncology    in terms of oncology  sequencing consumables grew above that  so over 20   And when we look at also our top customers in oncology  they grew also above that average    above the oncology average  so just some data points around the oncology in clinical growth  Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America  Your line is open Derik De Bruin    Bank of America    AnalystHi  Good afternoon  Hey  a couple of questions  The first one  can you talk a little bit more about the HiSeq decommissions  I m sort of surprised by the number and just sort of talk about the labs that are not using it  Are those customers now outsourcing more  Or did they buy NextSeq for something else and that sort of like leads into the next question  which is surprised to see that the NovaSeq consumable guide for 2020 was about  1 1 million to  1 2 million per box  So I m just wondering  if your HiSeq customer are    and those instruments are coming down  I m just surprised why that Novaseq number isn t higher than it is Sam Samad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAll right  So thank you  Derik  Let me start with the HiSeq decommissioning number  So that s the result of a focus we re putting on getting closer to our customers getting more visibility into how our customers are using the instrument  And so we spent some time really looking to the instruments  which instruments are active  which instruments are not active  So it s a new model for us understanding  what instruments are being used out in the field So the total number 800 isn t what got decommissioned last year  So that s about 200  The total number is sort of a catch out to say  OK  of all the instruments we have out in the field  How are they ve been used  which ones are being used a lot  which ones are being used less  And what we came down to is just about 800 that we feel are largely inactive It doesn t change anything in terms of the revenue we re getting from HiSeq to consumable  what it does mean is that  there are fewer active instruments in the field and the ones that our customers have using actually are being utilized more than the previous model had estimated and that pull through per instrument at those labs is actually higher than the old model had estimated  So those customers aren t doing anything different  they aren t outsourcing more  they still have both the active and inactive instruments that when we looked at it  they were using some instruments more And so that the dynamic of how it plays out  In terms of your second question  Derik  with regards to NovaSeq  so yes  our guide for 2020 is  1 1 million to  1 2 million pull through per instrument  We re very pleased in 2019 with the performance that we see in terms of the pull through on NovaSeq as we mention that was  1 2 million for the year was a record quarter in Q4 Our expectation now in the fourth year of launch in 2020  because as we start seeing some of those lower throughput customers convert and move over and even newer customers that are using NovaSeq with the S Prime and the S1 flow cell  You will start to see lower throughput from those customers impacting the average  That s natural in the fourth year of launch for the instrument  But that s the driver for the  1 1 million to  1 2 million pull through guide Francis deSouza    President and Chief Executive OfficerIn addition to Sam pointed out some of the smaller customers we expect to come online this year and part of the reason for the guide we gave  There will be an offsetting influence happening as you see some of these large popgen customers continue to sequence like the UK Biobank that s really running  that s really running in full force  as well as NHS commissioning coming online  And so that will be the offsetting factor that ll play on this year OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel  Your line is open Dan Arias    Stifel    AnalystGood afternoon  guys  Thanks for the questions  Apologies for a little bit of a cold here  But Francis on the NextSeq  can you just talk to the rationale for the launch of the 1 000 unit in the context of just thinking back to the Nova 6000 and 5000  Back then it seemed like customers that upgraded really wanted the higher capacity option and to not have to wait around to acquire it  So I guess I m just    I m curious about the way in which you see this being different  And then maybe relatedly  anything more specific you can say to the P3 flow cell launch later this year  in terms of timing  I m curious about how much we should expect demand for that configuration to be captured in 2020  Thanks Francis deSouza    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  And I hope your cold gets better soon  I will answer the NextSeq question first  So why do the 1000 if we expect the majority of customers to buy the 2000  and then I ll talk about P3  So the strategy of having  the higher and lower end instruments is one that we ve used many  many times  So you pointed out with the NovaSeq 5000  6000  we have the HiSeq 3000  4 000  We have a HiSeq 2000  2500  And what this allows our sales teams to do is it allows us to start the conversation with customers that are lower price point And some customers do buy the lower instrument  but as you pointed out  what happens in that conversation is the vast majority of cases they end up buying the higher priced instrument  And that played out in everyone of those instances  I talked about going back a decade  right  But it s important for our reps to be able to have that lower priced instrument  so they can start the conversation  And that s been the strategy In terms of the P3 flow cell  the way we set this to play out is that the customers for the first couple of full quarters of NextSeq 2000 are going to be excited about the fact that they can buy a flow cell who s output is comparable to today s NextSeq  So they can make    they can compare the new machine on an equivalent output using equivalent workflows from the old machine to the new machine But we do expect that a lot of our NextSeq customers are going to buy the instrument with an eye to their future business and will be very attracted by the higher output and the economics associated with the P3  In terms of timing  we said  we expect that to come toward the end of the year  Obviously though it s public now and the specs of that flow cell are public now  So it s something that customers know about we ve been planned for OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen  Your line is open Doug Schenkel    Cowen    AnalystHey  good afternoon  So just a couple of things on NovaSeq  First  just looking back  regarding guidance for consumable pull through per box of  1 1 million to  1 2 million per Nova  How does that compare to 2019  And I guess  the reduction in HiSeq consumable revenue below  100 million  which is a little bit below where I think you guys have been tracking the last few quarters  I m just wondering if that s indicative of larger programs on HiSeq access being largely completed at this point and some of those large customers with those projects now increasingly moving over to Nova  So those are the looking back topics I d like to cover And then looking ahead  is the assumption that NovaSeq placements are lower in 2020 versus 2019 a function of trying to hedge for the potential that there s some Nova cannibalization  A function of reducing the number of HiSeq s that are out there to replace  So maybe having a little bit more visibility on what the replacement outlook is  A function of being in year for the rollout or maybe just a little bit of all of the above  And finally  is there anything structural that would prevent you from implementing the blue green chemistry on a higher end platform like NovaSeq or actually on a NovaSeq in the future  Thank you Sam Samad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Doug for the question  So I ll start with the first one and I ll transition to Francis for the second and third  With regards to NovaSeq  so for the full year 2019  we communicated that pull through is  1 2 million per instrument  And going forward  we expect it to be in 2020  1 1 million to  1 2 million  So essentially  the high end of the range in equivalent to what we saw in 2019 And with regard to your question on HiSeq  I think it s exactly right  As we get deeper into this upgrade cycle  as we get deeper into this cycle where customers are transitioning from HiSeq to NovaSeq as some of this work transitions over and completes on HiSeq and moves over to the new instrument  You do expect to see consumables come down on HiSeq  which is what we ve indicated is that we expect in 2020 to continue to see HiSeq consumables come down and obviously  NovaSeq consumable stay free Francis deSouza    President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd then Doug you asked about a couple of other things  One  in terms NovaSeq placements  why are we expecting that to be lower this year  given that we ve had two back to back very strong years of NovaSeq placements  Is it being influenced  you asked  by NextSeq and cannibalization there  And then you asked is there a structural reason or any structural reason why the blue green chemistry couldn t in the future be implemented on NovaSeq So in terms of NovaSeq placements  as we looked at this year  the work we see to be done this year in terms of the NovaSeq upgrade cycle is to really go after the smaller core labs  right  So that s the upgrade cycle that got activated last year with S Prime  with S1 and then S2 s new pricing  And so as we look at the pipeline this year  we expect it to be a lot more full of the onesies twosies with the small core labs And so that s the dynamic we expect to be playing out in our customer base and in our sales teams  And so that will result in a total number that s smaller than some of the big multiunit purchases you saw last year in Q3  Q4 with customers like the UK Biobank for example  So instead of doing 10 units placements  we expect more deals to be one to two units  And that s frankly the biggest driver in terms of the placement number being down this year compared to last year We don t expect much cannibalization between the NextSeq and the and the NovaSeq  They target very different price points  both in terms of capital but also in terms of costs per g and there s no overlap in terms of the output  And so when you add those three variables together  it s very easy for customers to self select  If you have the sample volume to allow you to go purchase a NovaSeq  you will always do that because you get superior economics  And even with the new NextSeq 2000 running the P3 flow cell  you still get superior economics on the NovaSeq if you have the sample volume  And if you don t have the sample volume  it will never cost in so you to go to a NovaSeq  So there s very little overlap in terms of the segments that are targeting  So there maybe some  but we don t expect much And then your question about structural reason  why we can t use the blue green chemistry  NovaSeq  but frankly anywhere  And the answer is there isn t any  We view that as a core architectural component in our toolkit now  As we do other elements of things you saw in NovaSeq  for example  the hardware acceleration toolkit that we built into NextSeq 1000 and 2000 based on the Edico technology  that s also another core architectural component And there s no reason why that can t show up in any of our future instruments both up and down the portfolio  What will decide whether it does show up frankly  is the design point for the next instrument we put out  And if we have something better in the toolkit  and that s always sort of an active debate internally  So at any given point  we ll pick the best components we have the design print we re going  but there s absolutely no structural reason as you point out  why those components couldn t show up in a future version of a high throughput instrument or a lower throughput instrument OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink  Your line is open Puneet Souda    SVB Leerink    AnalystYes  Hi  Francis  Thanks  So my first question is  I was hoping to get a better view into the NHS clinical ramp and the level of visibility you have there  You made comments around clinical samples ramping in second half of this year  This is one of the largest project  if not the largest  And I appreciate that you were expecting 300 000 to 500 000 patients sequenced by 2025 target  How do we bridge that to the 5 million potential genomes that NHS had laid out earlier  And what should we expect in the second half this year And on NextSeq  I completely get your comments around 2000 uptake  Our checks are suggesting the same among academic customers  smaller labs  But I just wanted to understand  in terms of those that have diagnostic instruments or instruments in diagnostic settings NextSeq s and MiSeq s  what s your expectation for those customers to upgrade given the new chemistry  given that these instruments are validated and some of them are using NextSeq Dx  Any thoughts on NextSeq 2000 Dx  Appreciate it  Thank you Sam Samad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Thank you  Puneet  So I ve got three questions  One is  give you an update on the NHS ramp and how that s looking for the back half of the year  And then also comment on how to bridge the fact that we ve talked about 300 000 to 500 000 samples  whereas you have Secretary Hancock talking about 5 million genomes being done  so bridge that  You also asked about NextSeq and that upgrade cycle  especially talking about the Dx instruments  And whether the Dx customers for NextSeq will be part of this upgrade cycle So in terms of the NHS  we are happy with how things are progressing  frankly  Since over the last few months  we ve given you the update announced at JPMorgan that we have signed a contract with GeL to provide the lab testing services  the genomic lab testing services for the NHS  Our teams are deeply engaged  We hosted a leadership here in California to review plans going forward  So as of now we feel very good about how things are tracking in terms of the ramp for the NHS  So we expect to see that sort of midyear going forward The first phase is 300 000 scaling up to 500 000 genomes to be sequenced  And we ve done a bottoms up analysis that team on how you get there  And what we ve said publicly is that  genomic testing is going to be a standard of care for just over 20 genetic diseases and four different types of cancers  starting the middle of the year when we ramp up with the NHS  So standard of care for the UK population  55 million to 60 million people But obviously there are a lot more than 20 genetic diseases and a lot more than four cancers  And so Secretary  Hancock is really driving the NHS to be more ambitious about how we want to roll this out for the entire UK population  There are not 20 genetic diseases there are 6 000 genetic diseases and they re awfully lot more than four cancers And so as you start to do the buildup of what happens when you expand this across cancer indications  and across more genetic diseases  as well as other areas that genomic testing could be helpful for better outcomes at lower costs  that s how you get to a number like five million  That s not yet a committed path with a committed timeframe  but that s the ambition  So that s the NHS ramp In terms of NextSeq and the upgrade path especially around DX  the way we expect the DX market to play out is that if you are a NextSeq DX customer today or you are in the pipeline to buy a NextSeq DX  we expect that you will either keep using the one you have or you will buy a new NextSeq DX  And that more likely than not  you won t be purchasing the 2000 or the 1000 right now  And that goes to the point you made  which is look you have validated workflows in a lot of cases  you may actually have a cleared assay built on our cleared box  And so you ll certainly keep an eye out for when the 1000 and 2000 DX instrument gets announced and comes to market But for the foreseeable future  your capacity adds will be DX boxes  NextSeq DX boxes  And so we don t expect those customers to be driving the pipeline for NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000 right now OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi  Your line is open Patrick Donnelly    Citi    AnalystThanks  guys  Sam  maybe just on the guidance linearity you talked about maybe just a bit more color there  1Q obviously came kind of well below where the Street was only looking for 1  of growth on the revenue side  EPS pretty big year over year decline  So can you just talk through that a bit more And then on top of that on the guidance side  the full year visibility into some of the PopSeq revenues timing of some of those initiatives that have yet to start  Obviously in 2019  we saw some push outs  Let me just talk to the confidence level and the numbers  particularly that 200 000 from UK Biobank  How much can we see that shift  either upside or downside from that number  Thanks Sam Samad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  When we think about the Q1  and thanks for the question by the way  Patrick  When we think about the Q1 number  I mean  first of all  as we look across Q1  but also across all of 2020  this is not unlike other years where we ve had instruments launches  So going back to 2017  I know NovaSeq is a different instrument  but the linearity is very similar to what we saw in 2017 And when we think about Q1 if you re looking  if you re comparing versus Q4  obviously you have two or three big factors that drive the decline from Q4 into Q2  One is seasonality and the lower instrument placements  specifically NovaSeq in Q1 versus Q4  seasonality across most of the business across sequencing consumables as well  And then what we also have seen in the past where Q1 usually is a big step up because of the DTC business and some of the processing of samples that come back after the holidays  well that doesn t exist this year because we have obviously a very much weaker DTC performance for both Q1 and the year And then finally another key factor is the fact that with the launch of NextSeq 2000 you will have constrained NextSeq shipments in Q1 because customers are pausing  waiting for the new instruments to come out and the new instruments will not be available until late in Q1  So you will have much fewer NextSeq shipments overall in Q1  So those are the key factors that drive the sequential decline from Q4 into Q1 As we think about the rest of the year  obviously you will have the NextSeq 2000 launch that continues to ramp up  You have instrument placements for NovaSeq will ramp up across the year  You will have the population genomics opportunities that we talked about  So the UK Biobank is in full production mode and will continue to process and continue to process those 200 000 samples that we talked about across the full year  But then you have also the expectations that we shared at JPMorgan around all of us starting in the middle of the year  the NHS commissioning with GeL starting in the middle of the year So we have obviously confidence with the ramp that we expect over the course of 2020  but Q1 is constrained for the reasons that I mentioned  And obviously the NextSeq 2000 launch plays a big part in that  but it s not unlike other launch years that we ve had before OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo  Your line is open Dan Leonard    Wells Fargo    AnalystThank you  Just wanted to circle back on those PopSeq expectations  So Sam or Francis  how comprehensive is that disclosure meeting the three programs you flagged  the UK Biobank  All of Us and NHS  are those the three you ve gotten permission to offer some disclosure and there could be other ones that are material coming into the fold in 2020 or are those really the three that are going to drive numbers in 2020 Sam Samad    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerMaybe I ll start and Francis can chime in as well  So this is not about what we have permission to disclose  This is about we want to make sure we focus on the key PopGen projects and those three are the key PopGen projects that we talked about last year and we wanted to talk about this year and provide very specific visibility to them  So UK Biobank  which has started and we will continue to process all across all of 2020  All of Us  which was big talking points in 2019 and we want it to get clarity as to when we expect that to start and the number of samples associated with it  And obviously the NHS commissioning project  which was also a talking point last year  And now we re pleased to say that we have this agreement with GeL and the NHS and that s going to start as well And the UK Biobank has started too  There are other population genomics initiatives within our 2020 financials  We will not be specifically talking about those  Those are part of our business  Some of those have started in 2019  some of them we expect to start in 2020  but we really wanted to focus on the three key material ones OperatorYour next question comes    your final question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays  Your line is open Jack Meehan    Barclays    AnalystThank you  Good afternoon  Just maybe a round out  I was hoping  following the conclusion of the PacBio  potential deal  I was just hoping you could give us an update on Illumina s strategy in long read sequencing  It seems like Illumina is going to need to innovate their way into that market  So maybe just what s the strategy moving forward  How big of a priority is this in terms of R D  And can you maybe give us some comfort around the level of prioritization versus some of the other things you re working on like clinical  Thanks Francis deSouza    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  sure  Let me let me answer that Jack  So  we continue to believe that the long read market will be an adjacent market in the overall sequencing market representing about 5  of the overall sequencing market and that for the foreseeable future the two markets will intersect very little  to be honest  The big markets for us  whether it s oncology testing or NIPT don t really need the long read capability and the big markets for long read de novo sequencing  new species sequencing really need that long read capability and so short reads aren t a suited technology for that market  So we continue to believe that will be a complimentary market to the short read market representing about 5  of the overall sequencing market What we were excited about in the PacBio deal was that our engineering teams are fantastic at driving the price  the cost of a machine down we have terrific at engineering and operations teams and terrific technologists  And what we wanted to do is try and accelerate that market because we know that there is a knock on effect about what s good for that market is good for our market  because once you sequence a new species  for example  you do the bulk sequencing in that species on short read technology And so  we re going to continue to look for ways to move that market more quickly than it is moving now  But it s a small part of the overall sequencing market  It dwarfs in comparison to the clinical market opportunity  which is much  much larger than the long read market opportunities  So in terms of trade offs that we would do internally  it s not even close when we think about spending more to drive the oncology testing market forward  for example  versus the long read market Having said that  we ve been public about the fact that we have our own long read programs that we re working on internally  we re going to continue to work on those internally  But far and away  the higher priority for us continues to be  the short read core markets  both the research markets and the clinical markets OperatorThere are no further questions at this time  I will turn the call back over to the presenters Jacquie Ross    Investor RelationsThank you  As a reminder  a replay of this call will be available at the webcast in the Investors section of our website  Thank you for joining us today  This concludes our call and we look forward to our next update

130653,352168,ILMN,The 3 Most Important Things to Know About Illumina s Q4 Results,news,"A few days ago  I predicted that there would be few if any surprises with Illumina s  NASDAQ ILMN  fourth quarter results  This was an easy prediction to make  Illumina CEO Francis deSouza s presentation at the J P  Morgan Healthcare Conference earlier this month included some sneak peeks at the company s Q4 performance 
Illumina announced its Q4 results after the market closed on Wednesday  I was right that there wouldn t be many surprises  But there was one twist  Here are the three most important things to know about Illumina s Q4 results 

1  Revenue slightly above projections
Illumina reported Q4 revenue of  953 million  up 10  year over year  This figure was well above the consensus analysts  revenue estimate of  942 9 million  However  Wall Street analysts made their Q4 projections prior to deSouza s presentation at the J P  Morgan conference 
DeSouza told conference attendees that Illumina expected to report Q4 revenue of around  950 million  The company s actual revenue total came in slightly higher than that level 
Product revenue increased by 10  year over year to  812 million  with solid sales for NovaSeq and NextSeq  Services and other revenue rose by 9 3  year over year to  141 million  As anticipated  headwinds in the direct to consumer market weighed on Illumina s overall growth 
2  Much better than expected earnings
DeSouza didn t provide a hint about what Illumina s Q4 earnings would be  The average analysts  estimate projected that the company would generate adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of  1 58  Illumina handily beat that estimate  though  announcing Q4 adjusted EPS of  1 70    up nearly 29  year over year 
I wrote earlier this week   If there s anything unexpected in Illumina s Q4 results  it will probably be related to expenses that impact the bottom line   And that s exactly where the one surprise in the company s quarterly update occurred 
Illumina s total operating costs were basically flat year over year thanks largely to an 8 5  decline in research and development expenses  This  combined with a  15 million reduction in cost of service and other revenue  helped boost the company s bottom line 
3  No surprises with the full year 2020 outlook 
Illumina projects full year 2020 revenue growth of between 9  and 11   The company expects earnings per diluted share between  6 45 and  6 65 based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   with non GAAP EPS between  6 80 and  7 00 
The company s guidance didn t contain any surprises  DeSouza said at the J P  Morgan conference that Illumina expected to deliver revenue growth in the 9  to 11  range for full year 2020  Wall Street analysts were expecting full year adjusted EPS to come in between  6 80 and  7 00  with the average analysts  estimate slightly above the midpoint of the range 
Beyond 2020
Francis deSouza said that Illumina s management believes  that this is the decade that genomics becomes available to cancer and genetic disease patients on a mass scale and integrates into standard of care   That view could very well be right  Genomic sequencing is a critical part of personalized medicine  Increasingly more new drugs are being developed that target specific types of cancer and that rely on sequencing 
Illumina s dominant position in the genomic sequencing market and its decades of leadership make it the player to beat in capitalizing on the growth that should be on the way  However  the company has some vulnerabilities  notably including its lack of expertise in long read sequencing  The planned acquisition of Pacific Biosciences of California would have addressed this issue  but it s now off the table 
Perhaps the biggest challenge for Illumina is that  as a growth stock  investors expect higher revenue and earnings growth than the company will be able to deliver over the short term  This could put a damper on the stock at least temporarily  But if deSouza s optimistic view of the future proves to be accurate and Illumina can deliver on its potential  the one time high flying stock should take off yet again ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/powhv,2071586
130658,352173,ILMN,Why Illumina Stock Declined by 11  in January,news,"What happened
Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN  saw its stock decline by 11  last month  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence 
The move has knocked the stock down from the  300 mark  and it s still around 23  down from its peak of  378 back in July 2019  but investors should note that the stock has actually rallied hard since the start of 2017 and has more than doubled since then  and I believe Illumina still qualifies as one of the better biotech stocks to own 

So what
Sales have been falling for DNA testing kits amid concerns over the privacy of genetic data and the fear of it falling into the wrong hands  For its Q3 2019 earnings  Illumina had already flagged this  as declines in revenue were seen in microarray consumables  down 10  year over year  and microarray services  down 32  year over year   Both declines reflected lower than expected direct to consumer  DTC  volumes 
Investors should note that such DTC testing kits are mainly for the analysis of a select bunch of genes that have been identified as posing health risks  Therefore  the tests can be said to be one offs  making the current  100 price tag seem somewhat steep  With fears of an impending economic downturn looming due to the U S  China trade wars and now the outbreak of the novel coronavirus  consumers may feel hesitant to open their wallets to purchase what may be viewed as an unnecessary expense 
In late January  DNA testing company 23andMe announced that it was laying off around 100 employees  or 14  of its total workforce  as sales continued to slump for its DNA testing kits  23andMe is one of Illumina s customers  and the layoff seemed to send an icy chill down the spine of an industry that previously saw healthy and growing sales 
Now what
In Illumina s recent fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings release  microarray services revenue for the fourth quarter continued to show a steep decline of 32  year over year as a result of lower demand from a DTC customer  Full year 2020 guidance is for arrays revenue to be down 15  year over year  reflecting continued and persistent weakness in DTC 
Investors need to continue to monitor developments in the DTC DNA testing kit segment to assess if it will continue to cause issues for Illumina ",2020-02-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqntz,2075054
130659,352174,ILMN,Is Illumina Stock a Buy ,news,"DNA sequencing giant Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN  started 2020 off with what many might consider disappointing news  announcing that it had dropped the planned acquisition of Pacific Biosciences  NASDAQ PACB   That followed a lackluster year for Illumina s shares  which took a 19  hit in July  as the company reported lower than expected revenue in the second quarter 
But recent news should give investors reason to take a look at Illumina shares  The company reported fourth quarter earnings that topped estimates  announced a collaboration agreement with Roche  OTC RHHBY   and launched two new sequencing systems 

Before getting to why Illumina shares are looking attractive  we should add a bit of background on the failed Pacific Biosciences deal  Illumina and its smaller rival both sell devices to sequence genomes  Their devices read genetic material  and the results can be used in various areas of research including the identification of genetic links to disease  Illumina specializes in  short reads  of genetic material  while Pacific Biosciences focuses on  long reads   which involve longer portions of DNA  Illumina dropped the deal after regulatory agencies cited concerns  saying the operation would create a monopoly 
Loss of the long read
Though it would be ideal to have the best of both short read and long read capabilities under one roof  the loss of the long read isn t a huge problem for Illumina  because it doesn t need the longer read technology for its big markets  such as oncology testing  The short read and long read technologies are complementary  suited for different applications  instead of directly competing for the same projects  Furthermore  Illumina is developing long read technology in house  and it s already a leader in the overall sequencing field  According to Morningstar  Illumina holds an estimated 70  share of the sequencing market 
With that market share figure looking good  let s move along to more of the positives  The global next generation sequencing market for clinical oncology alone is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate of more than 13  to reach  1 5 billion by 2025  according to Grand View Research  Next generation sequencing  the business of Illumina  means sequencing genomes at a high speed and a low cost  And oncology is a growing and promising area for the company  In its recent earnings call  Illumina said oncology makes up 20  of its total sequencing consumables  which include items like test kits  and this segment grew some unspecified amount faster than the 20  growth in total clinical consumables  to an overall  830 million  in 2019    Illumina CEO Francis deSouza said that at the moment most clinical oncology revenue is coming from testing  but in the years to come  screening and monitoring may represent  potentially much larger opportunities  
Roche collaboration
Considering the possibilities in the oncology market  Illumina s recent deal with fellow biotech stock Roche offers more good news  In the announcement  Illumina and Roche said they would collaborate to boost the adoption of sequencing based tests in oncology  Roche will develop and distribute in vitro diagnostic tests on certain Illumina systems  and the two companies will collaborate on technology to complement Illumina s pan cancer assay  TruSight Oncology 500 
As for earnings  as mentioned above  the company stumbled in the second quarter  but the fourth quarter showed that things are back on track  Illumina reported a 10  increase in revenue to  953 million and a more than 28  increase in non GAAP earnings per share of  1 70  surpassing analysts  estimates 
The company expects revenue growth in the range of 9  to 11  for the 2020 fiscal year and forecasts non GAAP  adjusted  earnings per share of  6 80 to  7 00  up slightly from this year s  6 57 
So is Illumina a buy 
Though recent news is positive  the growth forecast for 2020 isn t wowing investors  and the company s agreement with Roche  the launch of two new sequencing systems    the NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000    and even growth in the oncology market will take time  Results of these efforts won t happen overnight 
The good news here is investors will likely find various attractive entry points to Illumina this year  With the shares down 38  so far  now appears to be one of them  Wall Street s average price target means about 15  upside from the current price  And with a price to earnings ratio of about 43  the shares are trading close to their lowest level since 2018 
Illumina won t necessarily bring great gains quickly  but it is a stock that is worth holding on to for the long term thanks to its position in the market and future growth opportunities  If you have the patience  it has the potential to illuminate your portfolio ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prdh-,2076607

130685,352200,ILMN,Better Buy  Illumina vs  Guardant Health,news,"Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN  is a giant in the field of DNA sequencing  Using its machines  biotech companies can design drugs to target specific cell receptors in the human body  Illumina s stock has been a monster for years  it s up 5 791  since the company s initial public offering in 2000  
Guardant Health  NASDAQ GH  is a fast growing oncology company that is replacing tissue sampling for cancers with a simple blood test  When a patient has an advanced cancer  doctors can use the company s liquid biopsy called Guardant360 to determine the cancer s genomic profile  This blood test is far simpler  easier  and safer than removing tissue from a patient s organs  Guardant s stock is up 165  since its initial public offering in 2018  dwarfing the S P 500 over that time span 
What s the better buy going forward  Illumina or Guardant Health  We ll look at valuation  market opportunity  and competitive threats to decide 

1  Valuation
Illumina is a highly successful company  with  907 million in revenue in its most recent quarter  and  234 million in profit  Its net margin was 26  for the quarter  Illumina is sitting on  3 16 billion in cash  with only  1 34 billion in debts  for a net cash position of  1 82 billion 
The bad news is that Illumina s revenue growth has slowed to a crawl  In its most recent quarter  sales were up only 6  year over year  The stock was hit hard earlier this year when the company slashed its growth estimates  And the stock is still priced for high growth  trading at 14 times sales and 50 times earnings  

Fast growing Guardant Health is unprofitable right now  spending money to achieve market dominance  The company had  60 million in sales in its most recent quarter  up 181  from this time last year  While the company isn t profitable yet  gross margins are quite high  hitting 70  in the third quarter   Illumina has gross margins of 72    Guardant has  522 million in cash and  8 million in debt  for a net cash position of  514 million 
Unlike Illumina  which cut its forecasts  Guardant Health has surpassed expectations and is increasing its estimates going forward  The only bad news is that Guardant Health has a sky high valuation  The stock is trading at almost 40 times sales  which is very high    nosebleed territory  Guardant Health has a price to sales ratio almost three times higher than Illumina s  On the other hand  Guardant Health is growing sales 30 times faster  
Winner  Guardant Health

Illumina controls an estimated 80  of the next generation sequencing  NGS  market for analyzing the human genome  Illumina has won its market dominance by focusing on short read data sequencing  which for many years has been the cheapest  fastest  and most accurate solution in the market 
By being a top dog and first mover  Illumina has a very large base of customers who have already paid a lot of money to buy one of Illumina s machines  Similar to Intuitive Surgical  Illumina uses a razor and blade model  The real money for Illumina is not in the one time purchase of its sequencing machine  but all the follow up revenues the company receives when the biotech or research lab uses the machine to sequence a genome  In its first three quarters of 2019  for instance  Illumina had  390 million in instrument revenue and  1 73 billion in consumables revenue 
Guardant Health has a lot of room to grow in its immediate markets  Guardant360 has a  4 billion opportunity among patients with advanced stage cancer  And the company s GuardantOMNI test    a broader test that looks at 500 genes instead of the 73 genes in the Guardant360    has a  2 billion opportunity in finding patients with a suitable genetic profile for a clinical study  
The company also hopes to compete in a couple of much larger markets  Guardant Health wants to use its liquid biopsy to test for cancer recurrence in survivors  a  15 billion market opportunity  And the company wants to use its liquid biopsy to do early detection of cancer in high risk individuals  a market the company conservatively estimates at  18 billion  
Right now it seems Guardant Health has a larger future upside than Illumina  On the other hand  Illumina s future revenues are far more assured 
Winner  Tie
3  Competitive threats
Both companies face serious competitive and regulatory threats  One big concern for Illumina is that the company has a pressing need to add a different kind of NGS technology to its solution  Many scientific researchers are finding that Illumina s short read machines    while fast  cheap  and accurate    are incomplete and insufficient for their needs  Illumina s sequence machines chop DNA into very tiny strands  say 150 base pairs in length  But some researchers are finding they need much longer strands to be analyzed  Pacific Biosciences  NASDAQ PACB  sells machines that can read strands up to 100 000 base pairs long  And private Oxford Nanopore claims that its machine can read DNA strands up to 1 000 000 base pairs long 
Illumina is seeking to fill this hole in its offering by acquiring Pacific Biosciences  And this is where Illumina s market dominance is now hurting it  State regulators in the U K  and U S  are blocking this deal out of fear that Illumina is too big and powerful already  and is on the way to becoming a monopoly  The Federal Trade Commission alleges that Illumina  is seeking to unlawfully maintain its monopoly in the U S  market for next generation DNA sequencing  NGS  systems by extinguishing PacBio as a nascent competitive threat     
It seems rather bizarre to claim that Illumina is a  monopoly  when it s competing with Roche  OTC RHHBY   a  274 billion mega cap that once tried to acquire Illumina  Nevertheless  Illumina s attempt to acquire PacBio appears stymied by the government  
As for Guardant Health  the fast growing company is also facing large and powerful competitors  Roche  for instance  has a subsidiary called Foundation Medicine  a company it acquired in 2018  Foundation is a direct competitor with Guardant in its immediate markets  And now Foundation has Roche s salesforce to expand its markets 
Another competitor with a liquid biopsy to detect early cancer is a private start up called Grail  spun out of Illumina  and backed by an all star roster of names including Jeff Bezos  Bill Gates  Alphabet  Johnson   Johnson  Merck  and Bristol Myers Squibb  Grail s test    which is designed to look for multiple cancers with one blood sample    was given a  breakthrough device  designation by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  which will help speed its way through clinical trials    
Winner  Tie
Conclusion
Both stocks are highly expensive  Guardant Health has exceptional growth right now  and as long as the company can continue to grow at its fast pace  the stock should continue to rise  Illumina has a dominant competitive edge in its market  but its revenue growth has stalled  Its high priced stock seems risky right now  Based on valuation  market opportunity  and competitive threats  it appears that Guardant Health has the advantage today ",2020-01-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pd5ru,2051982
130687,352202,ILMN,Here s Why Illumina Shares Barely Budged When It Gave Up On Its Takeover to The Tune Of  98 Million,news,"Genome sequencing company Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN   abandoning the takeover of smaller competitor Pacific Biosciences  NASDAQ PACB   lost it  98 million and a year of its time  One would have expected Illumina shares to sink like a stone after the Jan  2 announcement  but they didn t  Instead  the shares slipped only 1 3  in the trading session that followed  and have since gained about 2   

So what happened  First  a bit of background  Both Illumina and Pacific Biosciences are in the business of sequencing genomes  They develop devices that read genetic material  and these readouts can be used in many areas  such as helping researchers determine a genetic link to disease or better understanding livestock genetics to optimize breeding  Illumina is a specialist in  short reads  of genetic material  while Pacific Biosciences  specialty is sequencing longer portions of DNA for a  long read   Illumina is already a giant in the industry  with more than a 70  share of the sequencing market according to Morningstar  so this addition would have added to its strength 
In fact  it s this big positive that killed the deal  The Federal Trade Commission as well as an antitrust group in the U K  recently said the alliance would create a monopoly  Instead of continuing the battle to win over regulators  Illumina and Pacific Biosciences decided to drop the plans they had been working on for more than a year  As a result  Illumina must pay Pacific Biosciences a  98 million termination fee linked to the collapse of the agreement 
71  premium
The news is actually not all that bad for Illumina  One reason concerns the price of the acquisition  Illumina offered  1 2 billion  the equivalent of  8 a share  in an all cash transaction  That represented a 71  premium on the Pacific Biosciences  share price at the time of the offer  Avoiding this cost brightens Illumina s financial picture in spite of the penalty fee  Of course  growth comes at a price  and in some situations  companies must make massive investments to gain products and market share 
But in Illumina s case  here are some points to consider  As mentioned above  Illumina is the market leader  That s one major advantage  In addition  its short read technology is more accurate than the long read technique    therefore  Illumina has the benefit of owning the more reliable of the two  That said  there are times when long reads are essential and expertise in the area would indeed bring added value to the company  But Illumina has options  whether that s developing its own techniques in house  or searching for a smaller  less expensive company with technology it can buy and build upon 
Collaborations with Qiagen and Adaptive Biotechnologies
Growth in earnings and demand for Illumina s sequencing products are two more reasons why the loss of Pacific Biosciences won t have a significant impact on Illumina s future  In the third quarter  Illumina reported earnings per share of  1 93  surpassing analysts  forecasts for  1 40  and a 6  increase in revenue  The company also announced product collaborations with Qiagen  NYSE QGEN  and Adaptive Biotechnologies  NASDAQ ADPT   showing its ongoing interest in working with other experts in the field  Through 2023  Morningstar expects Illumina to grow revenue at a 12  compounded annual rate and earnings per share at a 14  rate 
Illumina will also benefit from increasing demand  According to a Global Industry Analysts report  in the 2019 to 2025 period  the DNA sequencing global market will grow by  17 6 billion  with a compound annual growth rate of 18  
For investors  all of this means that though the Pacific Biosciences acquisition would have brought quick access to a complementary technology had it been approved  Illumina didn t absolutely need it  By dropping the deal  Illumina avoided expenses and the uncertainty of a potential regulatory refusal months down the road  And the company can continue along its path of growth and market leadership  Looking at the share price reaction    or lack of reaction    investors clearly aren t disappointed in Illumina s decision to forge ahead on its own ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfdhn,2054799

130701,352216,ILMN,Qiagen CEO quits amid genetic sequencing U turn  shares tumble,news,"FRANKFURT  Reuters    Qiagen s  DE QIA  longtime CEO Peer Schatz resigned after the German genetic testing company disclosed a reversal of its genome sequencing strategy and a slump in its Chinese business  sending its shares tumbling 20  
In a surprise announcement late on Tuesday  the maker of diagnostic kits for cancer and tuberculosis said it would stop developing its next generation genome sequencing machines and instead collaborate with industry leader Illumina  O ILMN  
For the third quarter   Qiagen  cut its forecast for sales growth  adjusted for currency swings  to about 3   down from a previous outlook of 4  5   with its China business turning out significantly weaker than expected 
It expected to report adjusted third quarter earning per share of  0 35 0 36  in line with its previous forecast 
Qiagen plans to take a pre tax restructuring charge of about  260  265 million  mainly to write down assets linked to the development of next generation sequencing  NGS  instruments 
It also cited an overhaul of its global manufacturing network and possible job cuts for the writedown 
The company said Thierry Bernard  the head of the group s molecular diagnostics business  would now take over as interim boss until a permanent CEO was found 
Shares plunged 20  to 23 47 euros at 0848 GMT  with the group losing close to 1 4 billion euros   1 54 billion  in market value  after already shedding about 17  over the previous three months 
 The fall from grace of Qiagen shares since June suggests that the market was already positioning for an unfavorable Q3  but the CEO s departure will come as a surprise   said Berenberg analyst Scott Bardo  adding the business nevertheless held the promise of attractive underlying growth 
Qiagen s core work includes making diagnostics kits that test for a single genetic mutation to help decide on treatment  But in recent years the company has developed into a smaller NGS player  where a wider range or all genes are sequenced 
As part of a 15 year collaboration deal with NGS pioneer Illumina  O ILMN   Qiagen will rely on its genetic diagnostic products running on its new partner s hardware 




Schatz  who will become a special adviser to the supervisory board  had been with the company for 27 years  Since he started as finance chief in 1993  Qiagen has grown from  2 million in annual revenues to  1 5 billion in 2018 ",2019-10-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/qiagen-ceo-quits-amid-genetic-sequencing-uturn-shares-tumble-1993221,1993221

130742,352257,ILMN,Cashing in on DNA  race on to unlock value in genetic data,news,"By Ben Hirschler LONDON  Reuters    How much is your DNA worth  As millions of people pay for home tests to check on ancestry or health risks  genetic data is becoming an increasingly valuable resource for drugmakers  triggering a race to create a DNA marketplace  GlaxoSmithKline s  L GSK  decision to invest  300 million in 23andMe and forge an exclusive drug development deal with the Silicon Valley consumer genetics company crystallizes the value locked up in genetic code  The tie up is the biggest yet involving home DNA testing  a market dominated by 23andMe and Ancestry com  which charge under  100 for a saliva based test  but can also gain voluntary consent from customers for their data to be used by third parties   However a number of new start ups are beginning to offer people the chance to own their genetic information and sell it to data hungry drug researchers  Firms like EncrypGen  Nebula Genomics  LunaDNA and Zenome are using blockchain   the technology behind Bitcoin   to secure sensitive DNA records and create a transaction ledger  The new players all have slightly different models  with most simply provide data platforms  where people are rewarded for providing data  although Nebula also plans to offer testing   The idea of using genetic factors to hunt for better drugs has been around for more than 20 years   but it is only now becoming possible to gather a large enough sample to spot the rare variants responsible for many diseases  The number of people who have had their DNA analyzed with the main testing companies has taken off  since 2016 and now stands at around 17 million  according to entrepreneur and co founder of science website DNAGeeks com David Mittelman  By 2021  he thinks the figure could be north of 100 million   TESTING TIMES  For drugmakers like GSK  which announced its 23andMe deal last week  access to this data offers a way to accelerate drug development  since finding a drug target linked to a human genetic variant doubles the chance of producing a new medicine   The interest in home DNA tests  which can reveal genetic variants that may influence the chances of developing diseases including Alzheimer s  is part of a wider drive by drugmakers to tap into a range of anonymized patient data  Roche  S ROG   for example  has spent  4 3 billion this year buying out two specialists in cancer data  Foundation Medicine and Flatiron Health   The trend raises has worries among campaigners about data security and privacy  In a bid to alleviate concerns  Ancestry com  23andMe and other consumer genetic testing companies have now set out a  best practices  framework to ensure express consent  strong security and transparency on data use  Caitlin Curtis  a research fellow at the University of Queensland  estimates 23andMe has made around  130 million from selling access to about a million genotypes  prior to the GSK deal  implying an average price of around  130  Anne Wojcicki  23andMe s CEO  believes her customers simply want to help find new treatments for intractable conditions like Parkinson s disease   the focus of the first drug research project with GSK   and her company has no current plans to give customers rebates if their data is sold on    People who have a disease or a family member with a condition are really interested in what they can do to help come up with a solution   she said in an interview  A spokesman for Ancestry com said his group did not have any current relationships with for profit organizations  although it is working with some academic institutions  Ancestry com did have a 2015 deal with U S  biotech company Calico  the financial terms of which were not disclosed  but this has now ended  NEWCOMERS The ability of genetic testing companies to rake in cash twice rankles with some like geneticist George Church   the Harvard University scientist famous for wanting to resurrect the extinct Woolly mammoth   who is one of the founders of Nebula  Nebula aims to eliminate the personal genetics companies as middlemen between data owners and data buyers  a notion shared by rivals like David Koepsell  chief executive of EncrypGen   We think people are going to get savvy about how their data is being sold and they are going to want a piece of that action   Koepsell said in an interview   Our whole model is about creating a market  People can upload and set a price for their data  and then we will see what the market will bear    People selling data on EncrypGen s system will receive DNA tokens  a cryptocurrency  Other players have different plans  with LunaDNA s community owned database offering shares that will generate dividends as researchers pay to access data  Peter Pitts  president of non profit healthcare research group the U S  Center for Medicine in the Public Interest  agrees handing over DNA deserves financial recompense when the benefits flow to for profit companies   People need to realize that they are actually paying for companies to monetize their most personal information and they are getting nothing for it   he said   LunaDNA co founder Dawn Barry  who used to work at leading gene sequencing company Illumina  O ILMN   said she didn t expect people to make  life changing money  from selling DNA  But she added   People feel good about the transparency and control and respect that they get by being equitable partners in discovery research   SIZE MATTERS It won t be plain sailing for the new upstart companies  One of the main attractions for GSK in doing a deal with 23andMe is the fact that the Google backed Californian company has over 5 million customers  more than 80 percent of whom have consented to participate in research and share their data  EncrypGen  by contrast  which launched its first storage product earlier this year  has just 1 000 profiled users  of whom around 100 have uploaded DNA data so far  When it comes to using DNA to understand the links between genetics and disease  scale matters   To do the analyses that are required to understand these complex links between genetics and disease you need massive datasets   said researcher Curtis   It s hard to know how well these kinds of start up platforms will scale up as research projects aim for millions of participants

130832,352347,ILMN,EBS Or ILMN  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Medical   Biomedical and Genetics stocks have likely encountered both Emergent Biosolutions  EBS  and Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Emergent Biosolutions and Illumina are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that EBS is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
EBS currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 99  while ILMN has a forward P E of 46 29  We also note that EBS has a PEG ratio of 0 90  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  ILMN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 20 
Another notable valuation metric for EBS is its P B ratio of 2 76  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ILMN has a P B of 9 79 
These metrics  and several others  help EBS earn a Value grade of A  while ILMN has been given a Value grade of D 
EBS stands above ILMN thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that EBS is the superior value option right now ",2019-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ebs-or-ilmn-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200484994,200484994

130879,352394,ILMN,46 And You  Genetic Testing   Giant Growth Market,opinion,"I recently wrote a special report for Zacks Ultimate members where I picked my favorite stock to double in the next year  Here s an excerpt   
Invitae   NYSE NVTA   is the  1 7 billion game changing genetic diagnostics company that is like a  Little Illumina    NASDAQ ILMN   in terms of its proprietary genotyping technology and  network effects  in patient and care provider medical information 
Both companies are leaders at their respective levels markets in what is called Next Generation Sequencing  NGS   From the FDA guidance document on NGS in April 2018   
In the past decade  the cost of sequencing a whole genome has dropped 1000 fold  and the number of genetic tests has risen to more than 55 000 for over 11 000 conditions  Rapid adoption of NGS technology in medicine has led to the identification and curation of novel genetic variants that promise to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce unnecessary healthcare costs 
Without question  we have witnessed the greatest impact of genomics in oncology and cancer therapy  The diagnosis and management of several types of cancer   Hodgkin s lymphoma  breast cancer  and chronic myeloid leukemia   have made remarkable advances thanks to DNA sequencing technology  NGS has also benefited other fields like cardiovascular medicine 
Based on Invitae s quality growth trajectory into a very large TAM  total addressable market   I believe that NVTA shares will double in the next 12 18 months to the  35 40 area  Investors should continue accumulating shares in the upper teens  If you already have a partial position  consider waiting to see if shares will fill the Feb 20 gap down to  16 50 
But I m not even as optimistic as CEO Sean George who said in an interview in November that his goal is  to build a five to ten billion company over the next 3 5 years  I d say that s exactly where we are going  The faster we can do that the better  It s very clear to us  That s the head set  
 end of excerpt from my  Invitae to Double  report 
In the video that accompanies this article  I introduce both companies and several of their peers in genomic diagnostics including Pacific Biosciences   NASDAQ PACB   and Guardant Health   NASDAQ GH    More on these companies in a moment 
What I didn t emphasize enough in the video  though  was how big the potential market is for genetic testing 
Not only does Illumina design a nearly  1 million machine that is used for most genome sequencing and sold to biopharma companies  universities  and other genetic research labs  they also provide the science behind most of the consumer testing kits 
Their technology is largely responsible for the massive drop in the cost of sequencing and Invitae is one of their big customers for testing  Together  the two companies are staring into a massive market opportunity 
Consider that if only 500 million people across North America  Europe  and Asia seek some form of medical grade testing in the next 5 years at an average cost of  250    not merely the genealogy versions that cost only  99    that could equal  125 billion in revenue for these companies 
Currently  Illumina is on track to cross  4 billion in revenues in the next year  while Invitae is just on pace to break  300 million in trailing 12 month sales for the first time by next June 
Even if you cut my estimate of the TAM in half to   60 billion  that s still a huge market opportunity for both companies  And when you listen to these companies  especially Invitae CEO Sean George  you hear them describe a birth to death lifecycle of potential genomic testing for health conscious consumers 
And Invitae is developing many types and levels of medical inquiry for genomic insights  some that cost north of  500 for precision testing of specific genetic conditions 
In short  the average person could be a customer for several tests in his or her lifetime  whether self initiated or ordered by their doctor 
I became more interested in Invitae this April after the company just got some great news from giant health insurer United Healthcare who chose Invitae as just one of seven labs covered in a new group of diagnostics providers called the Preferred Laboratory Network  PLN  
This means insurance providers are becoming medical advocates of genetic testing because it helps doctors with screening  diagnosis and early detection of health issues for their patients  which saves money for everyone in the healthcare value chain 
I expect there also to be a rise in government sponsored campaigns to raise awareness of the value of genetic testing  encouraging citizens to be more proactive with increasingly available and affordable screening options 
Illumina s Planned Buyout of Pacific Biosciences Runs Into Opposition
On June 18  Reuters reported  Britain s competition watchdog said on Tuesday the planned  1 2 billion merger between gene sequencing company Illumina Inc and smaller rival Pacific Biosciences of California Inc may be a threat to competition in the country  
Pacific Biosciences   NASDAQ PACB   specializes in a type of sequencing called  long read  which offers a comprehensive view of genomes  transcriptomes  and epigenomes  Its single molecule  real time    or SMRT technology    is an integrated platform for genetic analysis that uses the natural processing power of enzymes  combined with specially designed reagents and detection systems  to record individual biochemical events as they occur 
On November 2  ILMN announced it would acquire PACB for  1 2 billion to fill a gap in its technology offerings  The sequencing market centers around the short read technology from ILMN  which is both fast and economical  But the long read technology caters to more applications and more accuracy  albeit at a slower speed and higher price tag 
Some analysts like the team at Leerink believe that the PACB technology costs 12 15 times more vs ILMN  citing  1 000 for a full genome on ILMN vs  12 000 on PACB  In explaining its rationale for the buyout  ILMN management said it sees the long read market opportunity to expand from  600 million in 2017 to  2 5 billion by 2022 
While the UK snag raised uncertainty for both companies  it certainly creates opportunity for others  In the video  I discuss the other potential M A that could heat up in this space  including potential suitors for NVTA 
Health Information for the Journey of Life
Two more companies I discuss are Guardant Health   NASDAQ GH   and Natera   NASDAQ NTRA    GH is an  8 billion provider of proprietary blood tests for cancer  including multiple liquid biopsy based tests 
Natera also harnesses the power of patient DNA info from a single drop of blood  They are pioneers in non invasive prenatal screen  NIPS  which uses a blood sample from the mother s arm to analyze DNA from the placenta for certain chromosome conditions  like 22q  as early as 9 weeks 
Panorama  their testing platform  is the leader in non invasive prenatal screening for 22q  with the highest commercially available accuracy for the most common 22q11 2 deletion 
22q11 2 deletion syndrome  or DiGeorge  is caused by missing genetic information on chromosome 22  22q occurs in an estimated 1 in 2000 births  which makes it almost as common as Down syndrome 
NIPS is also a big growth area for Invitae who announced this week their acquisition of privately held Singular Bio for  55 million to help increase access to genetic screening in early pregnancy 
The deal gives Invitae access to Singular s developing single molecule detection technology that enables lower costs and expanded use of high quality  cell free  nucleic acid analysis  initially for application in NIPS  From the Invitae press release   
Supporting Wider Availability of Screening in Early Pregnancy
As the utility of genetic information expands  particularly in pregnancy and reproductive health  demand for high quality and highly affordable testing grows with it  NIPS is conducted in early pregnancy to detect chromosomal abnormalities and assess the health of the fetus via a simple blood test 
Invitae introduced its NIPS services earlier this year and recently announced reduced patient pay pricing of  99 to improve access to testing for the six million pregnancies in the United States each year  Historically  these tests have been expensive  and therefore offered only to women in certain elevated risk groups  By investing in technologies  including those developed by Singular Bio  Invitae is driving down the cost of testing to increase the number of women who can benefit from the use of NIPS testing in early pregnancy

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Both Gilead Sciences and Illumina have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
GILD currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 28  while ILMN has a forward P E of 46 86  We also note that GILD has a PEG ratio of 0 75  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  ILMN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 18 
Another notable valuation metric for GILD is its P B ratio of 3 69  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ILMN has a P B of 11 31 
These metrics  and several others  help GILD earn a Value grade of A  while ILMN has been given a Value grade of D

130958,352473,ILMN,Analysts Estimate Illumina  ILMN  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This genetic testing tools company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 34 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 6  
Revenues are expected to be  833 04 million  up 6 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 09  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Illumina 
For Illumina  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 99  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Illumina will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Illumina would post earnings of  1 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 32  delivering a surprise of  2 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Illumina doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-illumina-ilmn-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200408349,200408349

announced that CENIC  a non profit network provider connecting California s education and research institutions with the world  has simplified its infrastructure leveraging Juniper s MX Series 5G Universal Routing Platform for current 10GbE and future 100GbE service growth Furthermore  Juniper announced that its advanced multicloud visualization and analytics platform Juniper AppFormix and

The telecommunications equipment provider expects Chinese tariffs not to have material impact on its fourth quarter results  However  customer buying behavior could be affected and gross margin may be adversely impacted Top Line ContractionDespite the positives  unfavorable global macro environment and weak investment patterns among customers are likely to have hampered Juniper s revenue growth  Ongoing consolidation in the telecom market is also expected to weigh on the company s financials  Moreover  Cloud revenues  which are expected to be  257 million in the to be reported quarter  is facing challenges due to slower pace of expected deployments from cloud customers     For the fourth quarter  net revenues from Routing are expected to decrease to  503 million from  510 million a year ago  Net revenues from Switching are expected to increase to  237 million from  233 million  and the same from Security is likely to decline to  87 million from  88 million The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Product segment  comprising Routing  Security and Switching products   which accounts for the lion s share of total revenues  is currently pegged at  823 million  It reported  830 million in fourth quarter 2017 Revenues from the Service segment are expected to decline to  403 million from  409 million  Consequently  total revenues for the quarter are likely to fall to  1 229 million from  1 240 million reported in the year earlier quarter  Adjusted earnings per share are pegged at 57 cents  The company reported earnings of 53 cents a year ago What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively show that Juniper is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess one of the two key components  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below Earnings ESP  Juniper s Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00  as both are pegged at 57 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Juniper Networks  Inc

131019,352534,ILMN,Illumina  ILMN  Is Up 1 45  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Illumina currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if ILMN is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this genetic testing tools company holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For ILMN  shares are up 1 45  over the past week while the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry is up 3 43  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 09  compares favorably with the industry s 13 82  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Illumina have increased 3 99  over the past quarter  and have gained 28 49  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  5 76  and  4 12   respectively 
Investors should also take note of ILMN s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  ILMN is averaging 987 101 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with ILMN 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ILMN s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 75 to  5 76 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that ILMN is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Illumina on your short list ",2019-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/illumina-ilmn-is-up-145-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200377192,200377192

131042,352557,ILMN,Here Is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Illumina  ILMN  Now,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this genetic testing tools company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Illumina is 21 2   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 12 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 3 5  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Illumina is 15 2   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 12 4  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 20 1  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 9  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Illumina  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2 7  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Illumina a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

131064,352579,ILMN,Stocks Still Angry At The Fed  Drop Another 1 5  ,opinion,"The market had 24 hours now to digest the Fed decision  and it still hates what it heard yesterday  The major indices each dropped by more than 1 5  on Thursday as this horrible month of December continues to get worse 
	The Dow fell by nearly 2   or 464 06 points  to 22 859 60  while the NASDAQ slipped 1 63   or about 108 points  to 6528 41  The S P is now solidly beneath 2500 after declining 1 58  to 2467 42 
	It s still all about the Fed  The market really wanted them to take this steep correction into account when deciding further rate hikes  but Fed Chair Jerome Powell doesn t seem as concerned as investors  The Committee sees one fewer increase next year than originally expected  but that obviously wasn t enough 
	Meanwhile  a higher possibility for a government shutdown isn t helping matters either  The U S  Senate approved a temporary funding bill to keep everything going until February  but President Trump said today that he would not sign it without funding for a border wall 
	Investors  though  are much more anxious about the Fed continuing to raise rates at a time of weakening growth across the globe  Each of the major indices have now dropped more than 3  in the past two sessions since the announcement 
	As you ll see in the highlights section below  a few of the editors decided to take a chance and add positions in preparation for a bounce back  Unfortunately  there was no rebound today as the market s sentiment continues to be ugly  Today s Portfolio Highlights Counterstrike  The market is way overdue for a relief rally  according to Jeremy  The editor mostly sat on the sidelines while stocks crumbled  but now it s time to gather some courage and buy while everyone else gives up  On Thursday  he bought the following four names 
	  Etsy  ETSY    a provider of online and offline marketplaces
	  Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN    a provider of DNA sequencing and array based tech
	  RH  RH    a luxury furniture company
	  Splunk  SPLK    a provider of software solutions
	These companies are all fundamentally solid and have reported strong quarters  but the correction has either pulled down shares or limited any improvement  RH is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while the other three are Zacks Rank  2s  Buys   Jeremy is adding each of these names with small  5  allocations and plans to buy more during better times  The complete commentary has specifics on each of these buys with charts TAZR Trader  With major technical damage running into a hawkish Fed  Kevin decided before the open this morning to drop all bullish biases and get net short with an initial target of S P 2400  And with little potential bullish relief in sight until Q4 economic data and earnings  institutions will likely remain in  sell the rallies  mode  So the editor added Direxion Daily S P 500 Bear 3X Shares  SPXS  on Thursday  Read the full write up for more on Kevin s outlook and todays  moves  which also include a couple of sells Insider Trader  Lots of changes in the portfolio today  As Tracey said yesterday  this deeper than originally expected correction demands a new strategy for the service  Therefore  she sold six names that have been getting killed and added a couple mid  to large cap positions that should perform better in tough times  Here are the new buys 
	PVH  PVH   Insiders at this apparel retail giant rarely ever buy their own shares  so it really caught Tracey s attention when the CEO and a director recently made moves  The CEO s play was especially bullish since it was likely a  confidence buy  meant to send a signal that its 35  drop year to date is way overdone 
	Chemours  CC   This specialty chemical company was spun off from DuPont  NYSE DWDP  in 2015 and the insiders were rewarded handsomely  So they don t often see the need for insider buys  And yet  earlier this month a director bought 10 000 shares despite the stock being down nearly 50  so far this year 
	Both names were added with 10  allocations  After today s moves  the portfolio has plenty of cash on hand to continue adding as we move into 2019  Read the full write up for a lot more on Tracey s strategy and today s moves

131065,352580,ILMN,3 Medical Stocks Likely To Emulate Illumina s Success In 2019,opinion,The new cohort of advanced genomic therapy has taken personalized medicines to an entirely new level  With increasing emergence of life threatening ailments across the globe  analysis of genetic variation and function has become crucial for the medical care market  This has enormously broadened the scope for companies like Illumina   NASDAQ ILMN   Under Jay Flatley s chairmanship  Illumina has redefined success in life sciences therapy and is one of the frontrunners in the field of genomic sequencing  The company has achieved success in genomic medicine in the past five years but Flatley considers this as just the tip of the iceberg Illumina Shines in 2018Year 2018 was particularly good for Illumina  thanks to several strategic investments and planned expansion  This year  the company s longstanding collaboration with Genomics England and United Kingdom s National Health Services sequenced its 100 000th genome as part of UK s pioneering 100 000 Genomes Project  According to Illumina  this achievement has huge significance for the future of genomic medicine Illumina  Inc  Price and Consensus   Internationally  the company achieved quite a few landmarks in 2018   In January  the company announced the regional availability of its BaseSpace Sequence Hub in China  Later  it announced a partnership with Chinese Medical Genetics Association  CMGA  of Chinese Medical Doctor Association  CMDA  to launch whole genome sequencing for children with birth defects and rare undiagnosed diseases in the country Illumina has also partnered with China s leading personal genomics company WeGene  This partnership has helped Illumina to establish an advanced microarray laboratory in Asia  thereby expanding its throughput capacity for consumer DNA testing in this emerging economy  The company also expanded its clinical portfolio in South Korea in 2018 In terms of new ventures  the company has invested in five new next generation sequencing startups this year  The company s NovaSeq kit has delivered robust revenues so far in 2018 and currently it expects full year NovaSeq shipments to remain between 330 and 350 The above discussion has already proven Flately s perspective beyond debate but does Illumina stock reflect the same  Of course  it does  having recorded a staggering 999  gain in the past 10 years  In 2018 alone  it has registered a significant 24 7  gain  thus keeping investors in high spirits Looking Beyond IlluminaIllumina s gains are indeed impressive  But is it the sole star in the firmament setting benchmarks for others to try and emulate  Factually  there are a number of stocks in the medical universe which are neck and neck

131066,352581,ILMN,Christmas Comes A Day Late,opinion,"We ve gone from the worst Christmas Eve session in history to the best Dec  26th performance ever  And the best part is that today s surge more than made up for Monday s selloff  reinvigorating hopes for a Santa Claus rally in the days ahead 
	For the first time in weeks  we can actually say it was a fun session in the market  The NASDAQ jumped 5 8   or about 361 points  to 6554 35  The Dow s surge of 1086 25 points was the greatest one day point gain ever  marking a rise of nearly 5  to 22 878 45  The S P rose 4 96  to 2467 7 
	The indices had their best single session in years  which shows just how oversold the market has been for the past few months 
	Stocks started the session solidly in the green  but then gave it all back and bounced around breakeven for a while  And right when we were all thinking  here we go again   the real rally started shortly before midday and didn t stop  Stocks rallied right into the close 
	All right  it was a great day in the market  but let s not get ahead of ourselves  The 1000 point rise today was still just a drop in the bucket of what we ve lost in December alone  not to mention the past three months  The problems that have been plaguing the market are not resolved  including the fear of rising rates  slowing economic growth across the globe  and the trade conflicts with China  Now there s even a partial government shutdown to contend with 
	So everybody is wondering if the bottom is finally in  or if this is just a normal bounce back rally in a bearish environment that will be picked away in the upcoming sessions  We ll have a better idea in the days to come 
	But for the moment  we should just enjoy this performance  It s still Christmastime and we ve been asking for a day like this for a while now  
	Today s Portfolio Highlights 
	Insider Trader  As she has said several times before  Tracey believes the selling in the energy space is way overdone  While shares could still fall from here  the editor thinks that a lot of the pain has already been priced in  Therefore  today s rally provided the portfolio an opportunity to add to its energy positions 
	Tracey bought Parsley Energy  PE  and Berry Petroleum  BRY  on Wednesday with 6  allocations each  Shares of PE are down 47  over the last three months  but that didn t keep three directors from buying shares of their own company over the past 30 days  Meanwhile  BRY actually announced a share buyback in the midst of the oil price plunge  That surely caught Tracey s attention  as it did two insiders who bought on the same day as the announcement 
	The portfolio also added about 2  each to its Encana  ECA  and Matador  MTDR  positions  These stocks have both gotten beaten up since Tracey bought them  which she considers to be a great opportunity to buy more in an oversold industry  Read the complete commentary for specifics on all of today s moves and the editor s energy outlook TAZR Trader  If there s one good thing about this sharp correction  its that many growth stocks have suddenly become more affordable again  Case in point is Twitter  TWTR   which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 50  in its third quarter and has been holding above its October post earnings lows around  26  Kevin therefore added TWTR on Wednesday with a starter allocation  Meanwhile  he also added to the portfolio s position in ProShares UltraPro QQQ 3X Bull  TQQQ   Again  he feels that the market has dropped enough for a significant bounce from here and he sees a 70  probability that the lows are in for the next few weeks and wants to capitalize on the relief rally  Make sure to read his commentaries for specifics on these moves and to look at his most recent  Scenarios and Probabilities Map   Momentum Trader  Ever since reporting a positive surprise of more than 16  in its third quarter  shares of Xperi Corp   XPER  have been showing good momentum  Earnings estimates also turned sharply higher in the past 30 days  underscoring its status as a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Dave likes what he s seeing in this stock  so he added XPER on Wednesday with a 12 5  allocation  The company  which was formerly known as Tessera  is a product and technology licensing company that manufactures semiconductors and related products for a variety of different areas  Read the full write up for more  Healthcare Innovators  Today s market rally has pushed Kevin to make a couple moves  First of all  he s getting back into CRISPR Therapeutics  CRSP   which is a name the portfolio took a tax loss on in October  But the correction has pulled the stock well under  30  Subscribers know how bullish the editor is on CRISPR technologies  so this looks like a great time to get positioned for the long term 
	Meanwhile  Kevin got out of Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN  a couple of weeks ago for a small profit because he knew the pounding that this company would take as the market continued to selloff  That was at about  335  He was certainly correct as the stock is now around  280  Time to get back in  Learn more about today s moves in the full write up Options Trader   Stocks soared with all of the major indexes gaining nearly 5  or more  while the Dow notched its largest point gain ever  In fact  today s rebound erased the last two down days and then some 
	 With stocks considered grossly oversold  especially given the robust economy  the market was due for a bounce  And word that large money managers and professionals were buying only fueled the rally even more 
	 The same old concerns are still out there  But there s a sense that they didn t warrant the kind of pullback that we ve seen  Who knows what the rest of the week will bring  But it s nice to be so decisively off the lows      Kevin Matras
	Have a Great Evening

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for ILMN  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   It has a remarkable  outside audited track record of success  with  1 stocks delivering an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Within the past 30 days  our consensus EPS projection has moved 0 4  higher  ILMN is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold

131070,352585,ILMN,Why Illumina  ILMN  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This genetic testing tools company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 25 21  
For the last reported quarter  Illumina came out with earnings of  1 52 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 25 per share  representing a surprise of 21 60   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 11 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 43 per share  delivering a surprise of 28 83  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Illumina lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Illumina has an Earnings ESP of  0 50  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 29  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-illumina-ilmn-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200373701,200373701

CVG revenues improved 4 4  at constant exchange rate or CER  up 3 1  as reported  to  2 86 billion  driven by high single digit growth in CSH and APV and low single digit growth in CRHF  all at CER 
CRHF sales totaled  1 47 billion  up 1 4  year over year at CER  up 0 3  as reported   This came on the back of mid single digit growth in Arrhythmia Management According to Medtronic  high single digit growth in Pacing driven by solid uptake of the Micra Transcatheter Pacing System and the Azure wireless pacemaker drove the top line at Arrhythmia Management  This apart  high twenties growth of the TYRX Absorbable Antibacterial Envelope and mid teens growth in AF Solutions also contributed to the growth 
CSH revenues were up 7 8  at CER  up 6 1  as reported  to  906 million on the back of mid teens constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong global uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform  Moreover  mid single digit CER growth in drug eluting stents  low double digit growth in coronary balloons and high teens growth in guide catheters drove mid single digit CER growth in the Coronary business

Guidance Revised
The company has raised its fiscal 2019 revenue guidance 
For the full year  organic revenue growth expectations have been raised to the range of 5 0 5 5  from the previous range of 4 5 5 0   Currency fluctuation is now expected to negatively impact the top line by  420  520 million  unchanged from the previous guidance   The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  30 44 billion 
Fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS view is reiterated at the range of  5 10 to  5 15  This assumes a neutral effect from foreign exchange  unchanged   The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 12 is near the high end of the guided range  Moreover  the company has reaffirmed its constant currency adjusted EPS growth expectations at the range of 9 10  
Our Take
Medtronic exited second quarter fiscal 2019 on a solid note  with better than expected earnings and revenue performances  The company demonstrated improved performances at CER on growth in all business segments  However  costs continue to escalate 
Moreover  all the major business groups contributed to solid top line growth at CER  which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions  in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets  We are also encouraged by the company s solid growth trend in the United States after adjusting for the divestitures as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies  Apart from product innovation  the company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses

a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  Receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater is the chance of the company utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have

131148,352663,ILMN,Go Beyond Earnings Growth  Bet On Beat With 5 Stocks ,opinion,"Before an earnings season  every investor searches for stocks that can beat market expectation  This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high quality in nature 
Why is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  after much brainstorming and analysis of companies  financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies  They in fact club their insights and a company s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
How to Find Stocks that Can Beat 
Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors  dream but not an easy job  One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company 
An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to 16 
Here are five out of the 16 stocks 
Illumina Inc     NASDAQ ILMN     The company is into biomedical and genetics  The stock comes from a top ranked industry  top 31    It carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

Democratic issues like price control on pharmaceuticals  increased spending on infrastructure projects and middle class tax cut  Democrats are also likely to co operate with Trump administration

The concerns were observed in a subset of patients being treated  with the oral disintegrating tablet formulation at 30 mg  taken three times a day  Shares of the company fell by 75  following the news 
Though FLX 787 had shown positive efficacy data in multiple sclerosis  MS  and ALS  but recent observations of oral intolerability at the current dose and formulation  in patients in both studies  indicate that more formulation and dose ranging studies are required  However  this is challenging for the company considering the availability of its current resources 
The company s Board of Directors and management are assessing strategic alternatives  including the potential sale or merger of the company  The company will continue to operate with a reduced internal team that will focus on assessing the potential of FLX 787 in dysphagia  difficulty swallowing  and operating the HOTSHOT consumer business  while the strategic review is ongoing 
Flex Pharma stated that it plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 60   The layoffs will be implemented by the end of this month  As a result  the company expects to realize annualized cost savings beginning in the third quarter of 2018  The company expects to incur one time costs of approximately  0 8 million to  1 1million under the restructuring plan 
Shares of the company have decreased 70 2  year to date  compared with the  s decline of 6 9

131188,352703,ILMN,4 Of The Best Efficient Stocks To Buy For Superb Returns,opinion,Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors  radar irrespective of market conditions  After all  efficiency is a potential indicator of a company s financial health Moreover  a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance How to Measure Efficiency  We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that it will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  Receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater is the chance of the company utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages Screening ParametersIn addition to the abovementioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable  You can see  Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater

131246,352761,ILMN,What Falling Estimates   Price Mean For ChromaDex  CDXC ,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is ChromaDex Corporation   NASDAQ CDXC    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  4  Sell  further confirms weakness in CDXC A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen one estimate moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revisions  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from a loss of 15 cents a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of 34 cents Also  for the current quarter  ChromaDex has seen one downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 13 cents a share from  a loss of 3 cents cents over the past 30 days   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 12 7  in the past month ChromaDex Corporation Price and Consensus    So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   Illumina  Inc    NASDAQ ILMN    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and may be a better selection at this time  You can see  The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-05-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-falling-estimates--price-mean-for-chromadex-cdxc-200318671,200318671
131248,352763,ILMN,Agios  AGIO  Progressing Well On Pipeline Amid Competition,opinion,"We issued an updated research report on Agios Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AGIO   on May 23 
Agios  only marketed drug is Idhifa  which received FDA approval for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia  AML  with an isocitrate dehydrogenase 2  IDH2  mutation  in August 2017  However  apart from Idhifa  Agios does not have any approved product in its portfolio yet  Hence  the company s top line mainly comprises collaboration revenues and milestone payments 
Year to date  shares of the company have increased 55 6   compared with the  s increase of 7 2  

The company has several interesting candidates in its pipeline  Its lead cancer pipeline includes Tibsovo  ivosidenib AG 120  under the priority review in the United States   the most advanced candidate targeting mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase 1  IDH1   In December 2017  Agios submitted a new drug application  NDA  to the FDA for Tibsovo  ivosidenib   which has been developed for treating patients with R R AML and an IDH1 mutation 
Subsequently  in February 2018  the FDA accepted the NDA under priority review for the given indication  The FDA has set an action date of Aug 21  2018  A regulatory filing for the candidate in the European Union is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the same indication 
Its other candidates include AG 881  which targets both mutated IDH1 and mutated IDH2  These mutations are found in a wide range of hematological malignancies and solid tumors including AML  chondrosarcoma and cholangiocarcinoma  where both the treatment options and prognosis for patients are poor 
The company s lead rare genetic diseases candidate  AG 348  is under evaluation in a phase II study on adult  transfusion independent patients with Pyruvate kinase  PK  deficiency  During the first quarter of 2018  the company initiated ACTIVATE T  a single arm pivotal study for AG 348  in adult PK deficiency patients who receive regular blood transfusions  In fact  the company plans to initiate another study  ACTIVATE  for AG 348 in adults with PK deficiency who do not receive regular blood transfusions in the second quarter of 2018 
Another candidate  AG 270  a first in class methionine adenosyltransferase 2a  MAT2A  inhibitor  is being evaluated in a phase I dose escalation study in patients with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase  MTAP  deleted tumors 
A potential approval for the pipeline candidates will be a huge boost for the company 
In May 2016  Agios and Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   announced a new global strategic collaboration for the discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapies utilizing Agios  innovative cellular metabolism research platform  Terms of the Celgene deal are lucrative as Agios is eligible to receive clinical  regulatory and commercial milestone payments plus royalties on net sales of products resulting under the collaboration 
However  the company depends heavily on Celgene for revenues  which it earns in the form of collaboration revenues  The company also faces stiff competition

131290,352805,ILMN,4 Top Efficient Stocks To Buy For Stellar Returns,opinion,Smart investors always opt for a plan that is likely to yield high returns irrespective of market conditions  Efficiency level  which measures a company s capability to transform available input into output  is often considered an important parameter used to gauge a company s potential to rake in handsome returns A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide stellar returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with price performance  Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company  This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks  These efficiency ratios are Inventory Turnover  The ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a four quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios  It indicates a company s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position  While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS  a low value shows that the company is facing declining sales  which resulted in excess inventory Receivables Turnover   This is the ratio of 12 month sales to four quarter average receivables  It shows a company s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit  A high receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or  debtor s turnover ratio  is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers Asset Utilization  This ratio indicates a company s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency

compared with the industry s 2 2  decline Quarter in DetailProduct sales increased 7  year over year to  3 6 billion driven by the immunology franchise  Royalties and other revenues were up 20  to  164 million primarily due to an increase in royalties acquired from Dyax and Sensipar The company s Ophthalmology franchise contributed  77 4 million to total product sales  up 34 8  sequentially  driven by strong demand for Xiidra The immunology franchise registered sales of  801 7 million  up 32 2  year over year  Neuroscience franchise sales came in at  691 1 million  up 12 1  driven by strong demand for Adderall XR amid generic competition  Moreover  Mydayis  which was approved in June for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder   ADHD   and has been available through prescription since late August in the United States  brought in sales of  10 2 million  Vyvanse sales increased 5  to  538 4 million Genetic disease portfolio sales were down 7 1  to  628 1 million primarily due

Elaprase sales increased 4 2  to  152 9 million The company may have lost some hereditary angioedema   HAE   patients to rival products due to this shortage  However  to avoid supply shortage in the future  the company is planning to manufacture Cinryze itself  An application for in house manufacturing facility has been filed in the United States Lialda sales were down 58 4  to  86 7 million due to the entry of generic competition  The company has launched an authorized generic version of its own to counter the competition  However  Gattex and Natpara showed impressive performance with sales

phase III study Our TakeShire s third quarter results were encouraging with the company beating bottom line estimates driven by the sales of immunology sales  The approval of label expansion of Firazyr in Europe is expected to boost sales going ahead  A potential approval of Lyophilized Oncaspar will provide further boost to its top line The availability of Mydayis boosted the company s immunology space  Its uptake has been strong with over 3 000 physicians prescribing to over 11 000 patients till Oct 17  The manufacturing issue related to Cinryze was also addressed with  100 million

Illumina  Inc   ILMN   a leading global sequencing technology company yesterday announced the NovaSeq Series  which is a new scalable sequencing that is expected to one day enable a  100 genome  NovaSeq is the most powerful sequencer to be launched to date 


Illumina  Inc  CEO s Comments


 The introduction of NovaSeq marks one of the most important inflection points of innovation in Illumina s history  In the same way that HiSeq X enabled the  1 000 genome with the HiSeq  architecture first announced in 2010  we believe that future systems derived from the NovaSeq architecture we are launching today one day will enable the  100 genome and propel discoveries that will enable a deeper understanding and better treatments for complex disease   said Francis deSouza  President and CEO of Illumina   The NovaSeq Systems enable the study of genetic links between health and disease at an unprecedented scale by making it possible to sequence more samples at greater depth and take on projects that would otherwise be cost prohibitive  By accelerating the trajectory of genomics with these systems  Illumina is making it possible to envision a future in which all people can benefit from precision medicine   



ILMN Technical Analysis



ILMN opened trading yesterday at  141 87 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  141 49  ILMN closed trading yesterday at  141 54 and spiked up after market to  166 00  equivalent to a 17  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time ILMN traded above these levels we have to go back to October 10th  2016 when it traded at  184 85  Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike up ILMN had been in an overall upward trend dating back to December 7th when it traded at  122 02 

ILMN has a float of 145 3 million shares and traded below the normal daily trading volume on Monday  For trading purposes  I would like to see ILMN open trading on Tuesday above  158 00 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  1 50 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up  Check out these links for more information on  and the  we implement in their chat room

131445,352960,ILMN,Illumina Rallies On Rumors Of Takeover By Thermo Fisher,opinion,Illumina Inc    NASDAQ ILMN   shares gained 2 7  to reach  173 75 yesterday  after a takeover rumor of this sequencing giant by healthcare conglomerate Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc    NYSE TMO   surfaced late last week  Following the release of this news  shares of Thermo Fisher dropped 0 4   as largely expected Reportedly  Thermo Fisher has made an all stock offer of  30 billion to acquire Illumina  which achieved revenue worth  600 million in the recently released second quarter 2016 results and currently has a market cap of over  25 billion Surprisingly  majority of the analysts across the market view this takeover rumour to have no future  although the companies themselves have remained silent on this speculative deal According to one analyst  not only does Thermo Fisher already have its own sequencing business  but currently is in the middle of a  4 2 billion acquisition of the microscope corporation  FEI Company  This makes this deal highly improbable Notably  Thermo Fisher has long been on an acquisition spree  In fact  majority of the company s business expansion involves rapid acquisition strategy  Considering this fact and the recent interest that Thermo Fisher has been exhibiting in extending its business in the next generation sequencing  NGS   particularly with the acquisition of DNA microarrays developer  Affymetrix  completed in Mar 2016   this rumour might not be worth dispelling at the moment Nevertheless even if this deal takes place in reality  this buyout transaction would face significant regulatory hurdles in its path of completion  As per one of the analysts from Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   the fact that Illumina holds a near monopoly in NGS and Thermo Fisher is the only current competitor with material scale in desktop sequencing  will make this regulatory hurdle even more complex Lastly  keeping aside all the aforementioned obstacles that this deal might face on the event of getting a go ahead  we believe if this deal does take place  it will surely benefit Thermo Fisher and help in its subsequent expansion in the multi million dollar worth NGS market  with Illumina being a pioneer player in this space However  since no confirmed news has been received from either of the two companies rumoured to be in this deal  we keep our fingers crossed and hope for more definite declarations to come forward Currently  both Illumina and Thermo Fisher have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked medical stocks worth mentioning are GW Pharmaceuticals plc   NASDAQ GWPH   and Quidel Corp    NASDAQ QDEL    Both these stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ,2016-08-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/illumina-rallies-on-rumors-of-takeover-by-thermo-fisher-200149626,200149626

131491,353006,ILMN,Illumina Not As Healthy As It Seems ,opinion,"Do you consider investing in the stock market  There are some well performing American stocks in recent years  Illumina Inc  NASDAQ ILMN  is definitely one of them  However  you might want to think twice before putting your money in it  
This article explains why 
In October 2011  Illumina fell below  28 per share  Less than three and a half years later  in January 2015  it climbed above  213  Such an explosive rally could easily convince you Illumina is a good choice  But  as Warren Buffett says  the investor of today does not profit from yesterday s growth  So  is yesterday s growth going to continue tomorrow 
The Elliott Wave Principle  a technical forecasting method  focused on collective market psychology  suggests otherwise  As visible on the chart  the advance from  28 to  213 takes the shape of a five wave impulse with an ending diagonal in wave 5  The theory postulates  that every impulse is followed by a three wave retracement  But this is not the only reason to be preparing for weakness  The Relative Strength Index indicator supports the negative outlook with a bearish divergence between waves 3 and 5  If this analysis is correct  Illumina is going to be far from well performing in the next couple of years  Do you still think it is a good investment choice ",2015-03-04,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/illumina-not-as-healthy-as-it-seems-243879,243879

131493,353008,ILMN,January 25  2016 Top Trades  ALL  DG  FISV  ILMN  WEB,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Allstate  N ALL 
Allstate moved lower sharply in August 2015  losing 20  of its value in about 3 weeks  It recovered and moved to the August 4th gap down but could not break through and ended up falling back lower  With the consolidation last week  there is a possible double bottom forming  as it presses against prior resistance  Look for a move above to follow  
Dollar General  N DG 
Dollar General had a long trend lower that started with the market sell off in August  That made a bottom in November is bounced  It met resistance at prior bounce highs and near the 200 day SMA and pulled back  but in a shallower move  Now it is back at resistance again with the RSI remaining in the bullish zone and rising and the MACD about to cross up  Look for a break higher to follow  
Fiserv  O FISV 
Fiserv has had a long trend higher over the past 4 years  Along the way it has pulled back to the 200 day SMA and bounced several times  something it did again last week  The RSI has quickly pushed to the upside and over the mid line while the MACD has crossed up  This leaves a trade opportunity on many timescales   
Illumina  O ILMN 
Illumina has pulled back from a high in July  finding a bottom 50  lower in October  Since then it recovered in a steady climb into the end of 2015  It pulled back then from a lower high but quickly found support at a higher low  Friday it started a push up from consolidation and has support for more upside from a rising RSI and MACD about to cross up   
Web com  O WEB 
Web com fell in a steady trend lower from the beginning of December  Two weeks ago it started printing some bottoming candles  with long lower shadows and added a Long Legged Spinning Top Doji Wednesday  It was confirmed higher to resistance the next two days  The RSI is also moving up off of oversold territory while the MACD is about to cross up  Look for a break of resistance to follow   
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the last week of January saw equity markets which seemed to have found some footing but still having to prove themselves 
Elsewhere looked for gold to move higher in its downtrend while crude oil bounced and will show us if it wants a reversal  The US Dollar Index was on the edge of a break out higher while US Treasuries were biased lower short term in the move higher  The Shanghai Composite was consolidating in the downtrend while Emerging Markets paused in their move lower 
Volatility looked to remain elevated but drifting lower keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETFs N SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  but loosening the vice grip  The ETFs themselves all looked to continue the bounce in their downtrends with some work left to show that the worst is over  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

131504,353019,ILMN,Illumina  Making A Killing Sequencing DNA,opinion,"There was a  published in Forbes Wednesday morning about how Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN  has been at the forefront of monetizing genetic sequencing technology  Illumina s efforts have driven down the cost of mapping a patient s DNA from about  100 million 14 years ago to just  1 000 today  Products sold by Illumina have the potential to save millions of lives by scanning individuals  DNA for irregularities in the genetic code to identify  detect  and treat genetic disorders 

 Graph above from ChartIQ Visual Earnings 
Advances in genetic sequencing have enabled medical professionals to quickly  accurately  and relatively cheaply map full strands of human DNA which contain over 3 billion lines of genetic code  Illumina has been cashing in on the breakthroughs  The Forbes article points out that since 2008 earnings and sales at Illumina have increased 147  while the stock price has ran up 617  

Illumina s fundamentals have been on an incredible run over the past 2 years  The company has beaten earnings estimates from Wall Street 6 times in a row  Revenue has also increased in each of the past 4 quarters by a minimum of 25   Last quarter sales jumped 29  higher  pushing earnings per share 5 cents above the Estimize consensus and 6 cents ahead of the forecast from Wall Street  In addition to skyrocketing fundamentals  this stock also has upward technical momentum  With these 3 factors going for it  Illumina is exactly the type of stock that a momentum trader might try to ride higher 

What makes the Illumina story even more impressive is the risk that CEO Jay Flatley undertook to get the company where it is today  Back in 2007 before Illumina was the dominant player in full genetic sequencing  Flatley was having doubts about the future of his company s business selling DNA microarrays  To brighten Illumina s outlook  Flatley made a massive bet 
Flatley spent  600 million in company stock  three times Illumina s annual sales  to acquire a company called Solexa which had an experimental DNA sequencer  By incorporating Solexa s technology and making incremental improvements over time  Illumina was able to drive the price of DNA sequencing down from  250 000 in 2007 to the going rate of about 1 000 bucks 
Illumina became the dominator manufacturer of DNA sequencers nearly 10 years ago and has maintained 80  market share since  But some of the largest opportunities in genetic sequencing may still lie ahead  The use of genetic sequencing to identify  research  and potentially treat cancer could become upwards of an  11 billion global market  dwarfing the company s current revenues of roughly  450 million  Illumina is certainly on a huge run  but all indicators suggest the uptrend may have plenty more room to run ",2014-08-21,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/illumina:-making-a-killing-sequencing-dna-223320,223320
131518,353033,ILMN,Illumina And The Importance Of Listening To The CEO,opinion,When the CEO of a public company speaks  it is often a good idea to hear what he or she has to say  Their commentary will often yield clues as to where a company is going  and what its stock performance could look like  The importance of listening is amplified many times when the CEO in question states openly that the company has no desire to be independent  Illumina s CEO was recently interviewed by Bloomberg  and their conversation touched upon a variety of topics  including Illumina s  ILMN  growth prospects in genomics  But  what we found most interesting were his comments regarding M A  Illumina s CEO Jay Flatley stated openly that the company does not have an entrenched view that it needs to be independent in order to succeed  which implies that there is a price at which the company would agree to a takeover  Flatley stated that Roche s hostile takeover attempts tied the board s hands regarding their ability to discuss a price at which they would agree to a deal  Comments like that imply that Illumina s board has a price  and that a potential acquirer simply needs to offer enough money to take control of the company Furthermore  Illumina s investor base is quite concentrated  with just 7 investors owning over 51  of the company  Morgan Stanley holds a crucial 10  stake  and we do not think that the investment bank has any particular loyalty to Illumina s management  They will support a deal if it gives them an adequate return on their stake  In addition  Illumina s takeover defenses suffer from a major flaw  a flaw that Roche has exploited  and a potential acquirer could exploit again  Illumina has a staggered board  and that provision is written into its corporate by laws  which means that it can be changed only by the consent of both a majority of Illumina stockholders AND the board  But  the size of Illumina s board is written into its corporate charter  which can be changed with the consent of a majority of investors  Ina given year  an acquirer can simply gather a majority of Illumina s investors to their side  nominate directors for the existing seats up for re election  and propose to expand the board  filling it with pre selected candidates  thus gaining control of Illumina We own shares of Illumina because we believe in the long term potential of this company  Illumina is the leader in the sequencing market  and its best days are still to come  And with recent chatter that Roche has made another bid for the company  M A speculation around this company is likely to heat up  But investors don t need us to tell them that  They can simply listen to Illumina s CEO ,2012-10-05,Helix Investment Management,https://www.investing.com/analysis/illumina-and-the-importance-of-listening-to-the-ceo-138762,138762
