140885,362400,BAX,South Africa s Ramaphosa holds crunch talks on power crisis,news,"By Alexander Winning
JOHANNESBURG  Reuters    South African President Cyril Ramaphosa holds an emergency cabinet meeting on Friday to try and resolve a power crisis that has dented growth in Africa s most industrialized economy and endangers its last investment grade credit rating 
Struggling state utility Eskom implemented the most extensive power cuts in more than a decade earlier this week  disrupting supply to businesses and households  It said it would reduce power for a ninth straight day on Friday 
Eskom is choking under a massive 450 billion rand   30 6 billion  debt burden and struggles to meet electricity demand because its creaking coal fired power stations haven t been maintained properly 
The power crisis is one of the biggest challenges for Ramaphosa  a former trade union leader turned millionaire businessman who has promised to fix ailing state firms and reverse years of mismanagement and stagnation 
But he has found it hard to overhaul Eskom and lift the country s growth rate due to entrenched opposition to his reforms  Another struggling state firm  South African Airways  entered a form of bankruptcy protection last week 
Ramaphosa said on Wednesday that Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan would present proposals on solving the power crisis to cabinet on Friday  after the outages forced some miners to temporarily cut output early this week 
EASE REGULATIONS
Some of those proposals include fast tracking applications of businesses seeking to generate their own electricity  bringing in temporary generators and connecting renewable energy projects to the grid sooner than initially planned 
Private firms have been clamoring for years for the government to ease regulations to allow them to generate more of their own electricity 
Roger Baxter  NYSE BAX   chief executive of industry group the Minerals Council  told Reuters that miners could bring online between 500 MW and 1 500 MW of their own generating capacity over the next few years  if regulations were eased 
 All our eggs are in one basket with Eskom  which is not delivering  Government and business need to work together to solve this problem   Baxter said 
Eskom  which said it would cut 2 000 MW of power from the national grid on Friday  has said the country needs an additional 5 000 MW of capacity for it to have a large enough safety margin to do proper maintenance on its plants 
As of Friday  Eskom had almost 12 000 MW of unplanned breakdowns  versus its nominal capacity of around 44 000 MW 
Power cuts are expected to ease from the middle of next week  as many local businesses shut down before the Christmas and New Year public holidays

140886,362401,BAX,Security worker killed in attempted robbery at Harmony Gold plant in South Africa,news,"By Helen Reid
JOHANNESBURG  Reuters    A security contractor was killed on Friday in an attempted armed robbery on a Harmony Gold plant west of Johannesburg  the latest fatal incident at a mining company in South Africa 
High gold prices are making processing plants a target for criminals in South Africa  leading to a spate of armed robberies at mining operations  and the head of the country s main mining industry body called for more police resources to tackle the problem 
No gold was stolen from Harmony s Kalgold plant  about 330 km  205 miles  from Johannesburg  in the attack in the early hours of Friday  the company said 
 A reaction unit supervisor employed by a contracted security company was fatally wounded in an armed attack on the plant    in the early hours of this morning   Harmony Gold said in a statement 
The South African Police Service  SAPS  was investigating the incident  the miner said 
The Minerals Council  an industry body representing mining companies  said there have now been nine  significant  attacks on the gold industry in the past year  in which employees and security personnel have been held hostage and assaulted  and in two cases killed 
Minerals Council CEO Roger Baxter  NYSE BAX  said a lack of police resources to prevent these violent assaults was a major threat to the industry 
 Essentially  the industry is under siege  These crimes are hurting South Africa s investment and economic prospects and urgent action is required   Baxter said in a statement calling for intervention from the Minister of Police and the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy 
In a similar incident in October  armed men broke into a metallurgical plant owned by DRDGOLD  killing the gold miner s chief security officer and stealing calcine concentrate containing an estimated 17 kg of gold 
The price of gold   in U S  dollars   has surged more than 15  this year  the strongest gain in the precious metal s value since 2010 
In a country on the brink of recession  with unemployment at an 11 year high  illegal gold mining and trading  and armed robberies of gold plants are on the rise 
Escalating violence targeting some of its workers drove Anglo Australian miner  Rio Tinto   LON RIO  to curtail operations at its South African unit Richards Bay Minerals  which mines ilmenite  rutile  and zircon  earlier this month 
Harmony said that due to the ongoing police investigation it would give no further information on the incident on Friday for the time being ",2019-12-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/security-worker-killed-in-attempted-robbery-at-harmony-gold-plant-in-south-africa-2045880,2045880

140889,362404,BAX,Eden far from a paradise as Australia bushfires hit economy,news,"By Jill Gralow and Swati Pandey
EDEN  Australia SYDNEY  Reuters    The peak summer holiday period should bring boatloads of cruise ship passengers and other holiday makers to the Australian coastal town of Eden  with visitors thronging stores like Lynn Baxter s newsagent 
This year  Eden is anything but a paradise for Baxter  NYSE BAX  and other business owners on the town s smoke filled main street 
Just days after the entire town  including tourists  was evacuated in the face of fierce wildfires  most shops remained shuttered  Dead birds and burned leaves littered the beachfront 
 It s a seasonal town   Baxter told Reuters from behind the counter of her shop  adding that income was down 85 90  
 This money  through this time of year  gets us through winter and we don t have it now  Don t know what we re going to do  
The situation in Eden is playing out in other towns across Australia where huge bushfires have burned through more than 10 3 million hectares  25 5 million acres  of land  killed 25 people and left thousands homeless 
Weeks into the crisis  the economic costs are mounting  potentially wrecking the central bank s hopes for a  gentle turning point  of renewed growth in gross domestic product this quarter 
 The fires have come at a time when there was already a lot of uncertainty about Australia s economic outlook   AMP s Sydney based head of investment strategy Shane Oliver said in a telephone interview 
Oliver estimated a minimum 0 4  hit on gross domestic product  GDP  in the March quarter  which could mean growth stalled completely in the period and prompt a further interest rate cut as early as February 
 The impact on tourism is expected to be more lasting while the impact on consumer spending is the biggest unknown   Oliver said 
Australia s A 1 95 trillion economy is already limping after 28 years of recession free expansion as cash strapped consumers shun everything from clothes to cars while a three year drought has hurt the farm sector 
The downturn prompted three rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  last year to an all time low of 0 75   Financial futures  now imply a 50 50 chance of a fourth easing next month   AU INT 
In signs of the early impact of the fires  data released on Tuesday showed a gauge of Australian consumer confidence slumped last week to its lowest level in more than four years 
Job advertisements suffered their largest monthly drop in seven months in December  a fall that ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch linked to the bushfire crisis 
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he expected the full economic impact of the fires to be  very significant  
 All those businesses in those communities who have been impacted  been hit at exactly the wrong time of the year  when they re the busiest time   he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 
SMOKE ON THE WATERFRONT
In Eden  the reopening of the town following the weekend evacuation and the fact that it escaped any major fire damage has made little difference to businesses 
At least two cruise ships have bypassed the port in the past week as smoke blankets the waterfront 
Eric Wolske moved to the town with his partner two years ago  buying an antiques shop as an investment 
 Well compared to last year this time  business obviously is down   Wolske told Reuters  adding he was banking on a cruise ship due to berth later this month 
Tourism accounts for more than 3  of Australia s annual GDP and many hotels and resorts have suffered extensive damage  while many national parks are closed 
In the cities of Sydney  Melbourne and Canberra the smoke has dented the country s clean and green image and led to the cancellation of some entertainment events 
Agricultural businesses have also been affected  with the sizeable dairy industry struggling to secure milk supplies 
Insurers have received 8 985 bushfire related claims in New South Wales  Victoria  South Australia and Queensland since Nov  8  The claims are estimated to have a loss value of A 700 million 
Still  Oliver said there was light at the end of the tunnel 
 We can see a revival from June quarter as rebuilding activity kicks in helped by insurance payouts and welfare payments   said Oliver  who still expects two RBA rate cuts this year ",2020-01-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/eden-far-from-a-paradise-as-australia-bushfires-hit-economy-2053715,2053715

It was also another big evening in the boxing ring for Cuba  who picked up four more golds after winning four from five finals on Thursday 
Despite those big days  no nation was able to keep pace with the United States  who smashed through the century mark and reached 101 total medals 
Not yet halfway through the Games schedule  the U S  have flexed their muscles to snatch 41 golds and leave the rest of the pack in their dust with Canada a distant second on 16 golds and 63 total medals 
Canada enjoyed their biggest single gold medal haul of the Games so far with their badminton team claiming four golds and three silvers from five finals 
Brazil s Ygor Coelho prevented the sweep by beating 18 year old Canadian Brian Yang in the men s single final 
It was an historic first for the 22 year old kid from the favelas of Rio de Janeiro as Coelho became the first Brazilian to win gold in the men s singles competition 
Canada s Michelle Li took the women s singles crown for the third straight Games  while Rachel Honderich and Kristen Tsai teamed up to win the women s doubles 
As dominant as Canada was on the badminton court  Cuba matched that and more in the boxing ring 
Of the 14 gold medals Cuba has accumulated  more than half of them have come from their boxers 
Olympic heavyweight bronze medalist Erislandy Savon  reigning Olympic middleweight champion Arlen Lopez and light welterweight Andy Cruz all successfully defended their crowns from four years ago at the Toronto Pan Am Games 
Bantamweight Osvel Caballero Garcia also took top spot on the podium 
Kim Rhode  a three time Olympic champion  claimed gold for the fifth time from six Pan Am Games in the women s skeet shooting 
The U S  has dominated on the shooting range and Lucas Kozeniesky added to the U S  haul with a victory in the men s 10 meter air rifle 
With one day remaining in the shooting events  the U S  has won 17 medals including eight golds  The only other country to reach the top of the podium has been Cuba 
The U S  began another gold medal run early in the day with Connor Baxter  NYSE BAX  winning the men s stand up paddle  one of newest events on the Pan Am Games roster  while the women s event went to Brazil s Lena Guimaraes 
While surfing will make its Olympic debut next year at the Tokyo Summer Games  stand up paddle  SUP  is yet to get on the program 
Baxter believes the evidence was there on Friday that it should one day be in the biggest sports event of them all

140924,362439,BAX,HRC Or BAX  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical   Products sector have probably already heard of Hill Rom  HRC  and Baxter International  BAX   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Hill Rom and Baxter International are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  This means that HRC s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
HRC currently has a forward P E ratio of 18 35  while BAX has a forward P E of 25 76  We also note that HRC has a PEG ratio of 1 83  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  BAX currently has a PEG ratio of 2 01 
Another notable valuation metric for HRC is its P B ratio of 4 16  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  BAX has a P B of 5 66 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to HRC s Value grade of B and BAX s Value grade of C 
HRC stands above BAX thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that HRC is the superior value option right now ",2019-10-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hrc-or-bax-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200472350,200472350
140925,362440,BAX,Baxter International  BAX  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Baxter International  BAX  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drug and medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 84 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 86 billion  up 3 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Baxter 
For Baxter  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Baxter will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Baxter would post earnings of  0 81 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 89  delivering a surprise of  9 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Baxter doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/baxter-international-bax-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200474682,200474682

141001,362516,BAX,CryoLife Enters Agreement With Endospan For Aortic Stent,opinion,CryoLife  Inc    NYSE CRY   announced the signing of a distribution and credit facility agreement with Israel based endovascular stent graft system developer  Endospan  The alliance will add NEXUS  the only endovascular stent graft system accepted for the repair of aneurysms and dissections in the aortic arch  to CryoLife s branched aortic stent graft portfolio The deal also provides an option of purchasing Endospan in the future Financial Terms of the DealThe deal  regarding the distribution rights and future purchase  has been finalized at an upfront payment of  10 million  CryoLife will additionally provide  15 million as debt financing to Endospan  depending upon the progress made by Endospan on the clinical trial to receive FDA approval for NEXUS  Endospan will receive  250 million after the FDA approval of NEXUS if CryoLife decides to exercise its purchase option within 90 days of receiving the nod  It will also receive guaranteed  100 million and up to an additional  100 million  depending on the commercial success of NEXUS in the first year of post option exercise Few Words About NexusThe aortic arch disease includes aortic aneurysms and aortic dissections  which occur suddenly and usually without warning  Currently  around 120 000 patients suffer thoracic aortic arch disease in the United States and Europe annually  This shows that the disease is currently spreading at an alarming rate  On the contrary  the treatment market has huge untapped potential as barely 30 000 patients are receiving treatment Till now  minimally invasive endovascular repair has been the typical care for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm  AAA  and Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms  TAA   Patients  with aneurysms or dissections  receiving aortic arch disease treatment  had to undergo open chest surgery and endure invasiveness and risks  long hospital stays  and extended recovery period due to the unavailability of a workable alternative On this front  Endospan developed NEXUS to treat aortic arch disease  thus altering a complex surgical aortic arch repair into an ordinary endovascular procedure  It has been designed to augment intra procedural and long term stability due to its proprietary geometrical design  thus reducing arch manipulation and risk of a stroke Per the experienced medical fraternity  NEXUS is more suitable for aged patients  who are not suited for open chest surgery  and those with a prior Type A dissection  which was repaired in an open surgical approach The addition of Nexus to CryoLife s existing portfolio of aortic stent graft branch will  thus  strengthen its position in the global arena How Strategic is the Deal The agreement between CryoLife and Endospan provides the former the exclusive distribution rights of NEXUS and immediate access to the highly lucrative endovascular aortic arch repair market in the European region  It will also open up avenues for cross selling of CryoLife s existing stent graft portfolio  JOTEC The deal also includes the option of CryoLife purchasing Endospan at a predetermined price  which will be valid for 90 days following FDA s approval for NEXUS  The deal will also open up the global market access for endovascular aortic arch repair  estimated to be around  800 million  pending regulatory approvals The deal positions CryoLife for accelerated revenue and adjusted earnings growth over the next five years  without even exercising the purchase option of Endospan Given the growing market potential  the deal has been struck at the appropriate time Industry ProspectsPer a report by   the global aortic stent graft market is expected to surpass  3 7 billion by 2024  growing at an impressive CAGR of around 6  between 2018 and 2024  The major factor driving the current market expansion is the commercialization of state of the art grafts such as fenestrated aortic stent grafts  further broadening treatment options

141002,362517,BAX,BAX Or BSX  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical   Products sector have probably already heard of Baxter International  BAX  and Boston Scientific  BSX   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Baxter International has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that BAX has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
BAX currently has a forward P E ratio of 26 03  while BSX has a forward P E of 27 06  We also note that BAX has a PEG ratio of 2 03  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  BSX currently has a PEG ratio of 2 53 
Another notable valuation metric for BAX is its P B ratio of 5 72  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  BSX has a P B of 6 24 
Based on these metrics and many more  BAX holds a Value grade of B  while BSX has a Value grade of D 
BAX sticks out from BSX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that BAX is the better option right now ",2019-09-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bax-or-bsx-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200464499,200464499

141142,362657,BAX,BAX Vs  BSX  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Medical   Products stocks are likely familiar with Baxter International  BAX  and Boston Scientific  BSX   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  Baxter International has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that BAX s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
BAX currently has a forward P E ratio of 26 04  while BSX has a forward P E of 27 41  We also note that BAX has a PEG ratio of 2 03  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  BSX currently has a PEG ratio of 2 56 
Another notable valuation metric for BAX is its P B ratio of 5 73  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  BSX has a P B of 6 32 
These metrics  and several others  help BAX earn a Value grade of B  while BSX has been given a Value grade of D 
BAX is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that BAX is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-08-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bax-vs-bsx-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200456775,200456775

 NYSE OUT   and ICF International  Inc    NASDAQ ICFI   5 Stocks Trading Near 52 Week Highs With More Room to RunA 52 week high generally serves as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners Notably  investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced considering the high price  While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless  all stocks hitting a 52 week high are not necessarily overpriced In fact  an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52 week high mark A stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs  So  one should take a more informed approach to understand if further upside is left Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing  this technique bets on  buy high  sell higher  52 Week High  A Good IndicatorMany a time  stocks hitting a 52 week high fail to scale higher despite having potential  This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending In fact  overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors  focus  or willingness to pay premium  has helped them reach the level  But that does not always mean an impending decline  Factors such as robust sales  surging profit levels  earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative  In other words  the momentum might continue Also  when a string of positive developments dominates the market  investors find their under reaction unwarranted  even if there are no company specific driving forces For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at

141197,362712,BAX,Baxter  BAX  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Baxter International  BAX   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4 4  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  86 81 in the previous session  Baxter International has gained 30 1  since the start of the year compared to the 2 5  move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 16 2  return for the Zacks Medical   Products industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 25  2019  Baxter reported EPS of  0 89 versus consensus estimate of  0 81 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 91  
For the current fiscal year  Baxter is expected to post earnings of  3 37 per share on  11 29 billion in revenues  This represents a 10 49  change in EPS on a 1 46  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 78 per share on  11 81 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 12 04  and 4 6   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Baxter may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Baxter has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 25 4X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 18 6X versus its peer group s average of 19 2X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 98  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Baxter currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Baxter passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Baxter shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Baxter Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Baxter have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including National Vision Holdings  EYE   NuVasive  NUVA   and Medtronic  NYSE MDT   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 25  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Baxter  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-08-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/baxter-bax-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200454581,200454581
141323,362838,BAX,Baxter International  BAX  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Baxter International  BAX  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drug and medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 81 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 2  
Revenues are expected to be  2 79 billion  down 1 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 13  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Baxter 
For Baxter  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Baxter will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Baxter would post earnings of  0 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 76  delivering a surprise of  11 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Baxter doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/baxter-international-bax-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200441529,200441529
141326,362841,BAX,Baxter International  BAX  Beats Q2 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Baxter International  BAX  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 89 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 81 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 77 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9 88   A quarter ago  it was expected that this drug and medical device maker would post earnings of  0 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 76  delivering a surprise of 11 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Baxter  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Products industry  posted revenues of  2 84 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 91   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 84 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Baxter shares have added about 27 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for Baxter 
While Baxter has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Baxter was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 85 on  2 84 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 32 on  11 22 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Medical   Products is currently in the top 33  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/baxter-international-bax-beats-q2-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200444637,200444637
141344,362859,BAX,What Makes Baxter  BAX  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Baxter International  BAX  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Baxter is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Baxter imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Baxter
This drug and medical device maker is expected to earn  3 27 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 7 2  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Baxter  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

141346,362861,BAX,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Baxter  BAX ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Baxter International  BAX   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Products industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this drug and medical device maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 7 48   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Baxter was expected to post earnings of  0 73 per share  but it reported  0 78 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 85   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 74 per share  while it actually produced  0 80 per share  a surprise of 8 11  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Baxter lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Baxter currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 68   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 25  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-baxter-bax-200410424,200410424
141347,362862,BAX,BAX Vs  CLPBY  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical   Products sector have probably already heard of Baxter International  BAX  and Coloplast A S  CLPBY   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  Baxter International has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Coloplast A S has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that BAX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
BAX currently has a forward P E ratio of 23 13  while CLPBY has a forward P E of 36 07  We also note that BAX has a PEG ratio of 1 81  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  CLPBY currently has a PEG ratio of 3 61 
Another notable valuation metric for BAX is its P B ratio of 5 22  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  CLPBY has a P B of 26 97 
Based on these metrics and many more  BAX holds a Value grade of B  while CLPBY has a Value grade of C

141351,362866,BAX,QDEL Vs  BAX  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Medical   Products sector might want to consider either Quidel  QDEL  or Baxter International  BAX   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Right now  Quidel is sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Baxter International has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that QDEL likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than BAX has recently  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
QDEL currently has a forward P E ratio of 18 89  while BAX has a forward P E of 23 42  We also note that QDEL has a PEG ratio of 0 76  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  BAX currently has a PEG ratio of 1 83 
Another notable valuation metric for QDEL is its P B ratio of 4 72  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  BAX has a P B of 5 18 
These metrics  and several others  help QDEL earn a Value grade of B  while BAX has been given a Value grade of C 
QDEL is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that QDEL is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-06-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/qdel-vs-bax-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200430989,200430989
141353,362868,BAX,Baxter  BAX  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Baxter International  BAX  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Baxter is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Baxter imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this drug and medical device maker is expected to earn  3 32 per share  which is a change of 8 9  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Baxter  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 4  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

141374,362889,BAX,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Baxter International,opinion,"Baxter International Inc    NYSE BAX   is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective  as the company is seeing favorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for BAX broke out above the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting a short term bullish trend

141375,362890,BAX,Baxter  BAX  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Baxter International  BAX   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  78 46 in the previous session  Baxter International has gained 19 2  since the start of the year compared to the 10 4  move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 14 3  return for the Zacks Medical   Products industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on January 31  2019  Baxter reported EPS of  0 78 versus consensus estimate of  0 73 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 45  
For the current fiscal year  Baxter is expected to post earnings of  3 27 per share on  11 22 billion in revenues  This represents a 7 21  change in EPS on a 0 83  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 7 per share on  11 76 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 13 09  and 4 8   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Baxter may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Baxter has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 24X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 17X versus its peer group s average of 18 2X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 97  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Baxter currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Baxter passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Baxter shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Baxter Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Baxter have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT   Stryker  SYK   and ICU Medical  ICUI   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 35  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Baxter  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-03-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/baxter-bax-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200400118,200400118
141377,362892,BAX,Analysts Estimate Baxter International  BAX  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Baxter International  BAX  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drug and medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 68 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 9  
Revenues are expected to be  2 62 billion  down 2 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Baxter 
For Baxter  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Baxter will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Baxter would post earnings of  0 73 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 78  delivering a surprise of  6 85  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

141408,362923,BAX,Can Baxter  BAX  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Baxter International  BAX   This company  which is in the Zacks Medical   Products industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This drug and medical device maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8 28  
For the last reported quarter  Baxter came out with earnings of  0 80 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 74 per share  representing a surprise of 8 11   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 71 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 77 per share  delivering a surprise of 8 45  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Baxter lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Baxter currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 77   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 31  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-baxter-bax-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200372632,200372632
141429,362944,BAX,Baxter  BAX  Soars To A 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Baxter International   NYSE BAX    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7  over the past month  BAX hit a new 52 week high of  75 62 in the previous session  Baxter International has gained 16 6  since the start of the year compared to the 1 7  move for the Medical sector and the 10 8  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 26  2018  Baxter International reported EPS of  0 7 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 62 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 13  
For the current fiscal year  Baxter International is expected to post earnings of  2 89 per share on  11 37 billion in revenues  This represents a 16 53  change in EPS on a 7 65  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 22 per share on  11 89 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 51  and 4 61   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Baxter International may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for BAX  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Baxter International has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 26 1X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 19 2X versus its peer group s average of 19 7X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 95  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Baxter International Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Baxter International currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Baxter International passes the test  Thus  it seems as though BAX shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Baxter International Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Baxter International have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including Surmodics   NASDAQ SRDX    Haemonetics   NYSE HAE    and Stryker   NYSE SYK    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
However  it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking  so it isn t all good news for Baxter International  Still  the fundamentals for BAX are promising  and it still has potential despite being at a 52 week high ",2018-06-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/baxter-bax-soars-to-a-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200324573,200324573

winners Often investors tend to worry if the stock is overpriced considering the high price level  While the apprehensions are not absolutely groundless  all stocks hitting a 52 week high are not necessarily overpriced In fact  in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near the 52 week high mark  an investor might miss out on top gainers A stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time  So  a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left is beneficial in these cases Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing  this technique bets on  buy high  sell higher  52 Week High  A Good IndicatorMany a time  stocks hitting a 52 week high fail to scale higher despite potential as investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending In fact  overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors  focus  or willingness to pay premium  has helped them reach the level  But that doesn t always mean an impending decline  The factors   such as robust sales  surging profit levels  earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions   that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative  In other words  the momentum might continue Also  when a string of positive developments

Sales of the Therakos immunology platform were  57 4 million  up 12 1  as growth was seen in both the United States and EU  driven in part by a new UK coverage policy for acute graft versus host disease 
Sales of Amitiza were  23 0 million  The drug was added to the company s portfolio following completion of the Sucampo acquisition in mid February 
BioVectra  the company s contract manufacturing business in Canada  generated net sales of  10 5 million  Other sales were  16 1 million due to the divesture of the Intrathecal business in the first quarter of 2017 
Adjusted selling  general and administrative expenses in the quarter decreased 12 4  to  189 2 million  Meanwhile  research and development expenses increased to  64 1 million from  45 million due to higher pipeline investment and inline portfolio data generation 
During the quarter  the company repurchased 2 9 million shares for  45 2 million 
The company is committed to reducing debt throughout the remainder of 2018   The company recently repaid debt of  300 million in April  The debt balance has decreased by approximately  215 million since Dec 29  2017 
Pipeline Update
In February 2018  Mallinckrodt acquired erstwhile Sucampo Pharmaceuticals for diversifying and reviving its beleaguered portfolio  The Sucampo acquisition added two approved drugs namely  Amitiza and Rescula to Mallinckrodt s portfolio 
Mallinckrodt also completed the sale of Hemostasis business   PreveLeak Surgical and Recothrom Thrombin topical products to Baxter International  Inc   NYSE BAX   in March 2018  The company had acquired these products from The Medicines Co    NASDAQ MDCO   
The company suffered a setback when the FDA s Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee and Pediatric Advisory Committee recommended in a vote of 21 to 3 that the risk benefit profile of stannsoporfin does not support approval for the treatment of newborns  35 weeks of gestational age with indicators of hemolysis who are at risk of developing hyperbilirubinemia  severe jaundice  
The ongoing terlipressin trial for the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome type 1 reached its midpoint for patient recruitment in the quarter  The trial is expected to continue to completion of the full 300 patients as designed and a decision on approval is expected in 2020 
The company continues to have ongoing discussions with the FDA and with the EMA to define a potential path for approval in Europe for StrataGraft  the company s regenerative skin therapy and development trials for treatment of deep partial  and full thickness burns 
2018 Guidance
The hospital franchise is expected to grow in the mid  to high single digits in 2018    Acthar sales are expected to cross  1 billion in 2018  The company expects to generate approximately  500 million in free cash flow in 2018 
Our Take
The earnings and sales beat in the first quarter relieved the distressed investors for Mallinckrodt which has been in troubled waters for quite some time now for high prices of its drugs and opioid misuse   While Acthar sales continue to decline  the hospital franchise  Inomax and Ofirmev  continue to register growth  Therakos also performed well in the quarter   
The company is currently streamlining its business to focus better on its innovative medicines and therapies like terlipressin and StrataGraft  While the Sucampo buyout to diversify the company s portfolio considering Amitiza s potential is commendable  it remains to be seen if it will be enough to bail Mallinckrodt out of its current crisis 
Zacks Rank   Stock to Consider
Mallinckrodt currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
A better ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis   NASDAQ EXEL   which currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

141559,363074,BAX,Can Hospital Products Unit Aid Baxter  BAX  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,Baxter International Inc    NYSE BAX   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 26  before the market opens  Positive tidings on the regulatory front  expanding product portfolio  strategic collaborations and strong presence in the international markets are key positives at the moment We expect the company to witness steady growth in Hospital Products sales   one of the major revenue components  While this is projected to drive first quarter 2018 earnings  an expected improvement in revenues in other sub segments will generate impressive results Last quarter  Baxter posted adjusted earnings per share of 64 cents  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents and improved from the year ago quarter s figure of 57 cents For the current quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  2 62 billion  reflecting a rise of 5 9  year over year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at 62 cents  indicating an increase of 6 9  year over year Baxter International Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s delve into other factors which are likely to impact Baxter s first quarter 2018 results Hospital Products to Drive Q1 ResultsBaxter has an impressive product portfolio with improved existing products and new product development  Recently  the company announced a distribution agreement for the U S  launch of the Arisure Closed System Transfer device In the last quarter  Hospital Sales were driven by solid demand for injectable pharmaceuticals and hospital pharmacy compounding services  Sales in the segment benefited from solid demand for the company s advanced surgery products and cytotoxic contract manufacturing services Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hospital Products revenues is pegged at  1 67 billion  This reflects an increase of 5 6  from the year ago quarter Here we take a sneak peek at the major sub segments within the Hospital Products and how are they poised to gain in the to be reported quarter Surgical Care Surgical Care  includes anesthesia and BioSurgery  sales recorded year over year sales growth in the last quarter  on low double digit growth for anesthesia and critical care products  driven by growing demand for inhaled anesthetics internationally as well as increased U S  sales of BREVIBLOC   a fast acting IV beta blocker On Mar 19  Baxter completed the acquisition of two hemostat and sealant products from Mallinckrodt  NYSE MNK  plc to expand the existing surgical portfolio of hemostats and sealants  especially for intraoperative bleeding  Notably  the company bought RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant product lines from Mallinckrodt Baxter s surgical portfolio includes products like FLOSEAL Hemostatic Matrix  TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant  COSEAL Surgical Sealant and VASCU GUARD Patch among others  The portfolio is composed of hemostasis  addressing bleeding   tissue sealing and hard tissue regeneration as well as soft tissue repair and microsurgery with products available in nearly 60 countries The company consistently strives to improve its Advanced Surgery business  For 2018  the company expects advanced surgery business to increase 3 4  on a constant currency  cc  basis Baxter announced plans to focus on launching advanced surgery products in Japan in the coming days The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s sales is pegged at  576 million  reflecting a rise of 1 1  from the year ago quarter Fluid Systems  Within Hospital Products  sales in Fluid Systems is expected to be solid on robust IV solution sales in the United States  We expect Fluid Systems to maintain the trend in the first quarter This is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fluid Systems of  621 million for the first quarter  reflecting 6 2  rise from the year ago quarter Integrated Pharmacy Solutions  IPS   Global sales of IPS  another sub segment within Hospital Products  increased by a formidable margin in the last quarter  partly on the back of increased sales for premixed injectable drugs However  Baxter s cyclophosphamide performance over the last five years has lacked luster  majorly  Lower cyclophosphamide sales pose threats to the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise business  For 2018  Baxter expects U S  cyclophosphamide sales to be approximately  95 million  reflecting a decline from  185 million in 2017  For the upcoming quarterly result  lower cyclophosphamide sales are expected to impact the top line by low single digits For the first quarter of 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IPS is pegged at  598 million  showing an increase of 8 3  from the year ago number Other Factors at PlayGuidance  Baxter expects first quarter adjusted earnings in the range of 60 62 cents  However  net sales in the first quarter is expected to be affected by approximately  25 million due to disruptions in the Puerto Rico facility  For 2018  Baxter estimates sales growth of approximately 6 7  at cc  Adjusted earnings for 2018 are expected in the band of  2 72  2 80 Regulatory Approvals  Baxter has been witnessing positive tidings on the regulatory front  Recently  Baxter announced the approval of Bivalirudin in 0 9 percent Sodium Chloride Injection  bivalirudin  Management confirmed that the FDA has granted two new approvals for temporary importation of certain drugs from the facilities in Canada and Mexico  With this development  Baxter now has four operational sites approved to address demand in the U S  markets Dull Projection for Pharmaceutical Unit  For 2018  the pharmaceutical business  which includes Baxter s broad generic injectables portfolio  anesthesia and critical care products as well as hospital pharmacy compounding services conducted outside the United States is expected to be flat on a year over year basis  The lackluster performance is primarily driven by increased competition for select products in the segment Further  in the Other business segment  which primarily includes Baxter s contract manufacturing services  management expects low single digit decline in 2018  Per management  sales in the segment benefited from a customer stockpile order in 2017  Baxter expects lower manufacturing revenues from Shire  which it acquired two years ago What

141593,363108,BAX,Top Analyst Reports For Nike  Eli Lilly   NVIDIA,opinion,"Monday  March 26  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Nike  NYSE NKE   Eli Lilly  LLY  and NVIDIA  NVDA   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Nike s shares have outperformed the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry over the last three months   2 7  vs   1 6    driven by strength in international business and the global NIKE Direct business which has been aiding its quarterly performance  Notably  the company delivered top  and bottom line beat in third quarter fiscal 2018 which also marked the 23rd straight earnings beat  
Third quarter results reflected significant progress on the Consumer Direct Offense  positioning it for strong profitable growth in the future  Nike closed the third quarter with expectations of a trend reversal in its North America business in the fourth quarter  backed by the introduction of new innovation platforms and differentiated customer experiences in the marketplace  
Consequently  it provided robust guidance for fourth quarter fiscal 2018 and initial view for fiscal 2019  However  its higher SG A expenses are likely to continue hurting results in the fourth quarter 
 You can   
Shares of Buy rated Eli Lilly have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry in the last one year   11 2  vs   2 8    However  the Zacks analyst thinks Lilly s presence across a wide range of therapeutic areas provides support in the face of generic competition  Lilly s new products like Trulicity  Taltz  Basaglar  Cyramza  Jardiance and Lartruvo have been driving revenues and the trend is expected to continue in 2018  
Lilly expects to launch 20 new products between 2014 and 2023  including at least two new indications line extensions on an average every year  The decision to sell or spin off the Animal Health segment  which has underperformed in 2017  is a prudent decision in our view  Also  competitive pressure on Lilly s drugs is expected to rise this year  
Meanwhile  challenges remain for the company in the form of loss of patent exclusivity for products like Cialis and the impact of generic competition for Strattera  Effient and Axiron  U S  pricing access pressure will also remain a headwind in 2018

NVIDIA s innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high end notebook GPUs remain the positives  The company s focus on GRID platforms can increase GPU adoption in data centers  giving it an advantage against its competitors

141625,363140,BAX,5 Of The Best Efficient Stocks To Strengthen Your Portfolio,opinion,A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with the company s price performance   Efficiency  which is the ability to transform inputs into outputs  is a potential indicator of a company s financial health However  it is difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company  This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks to build a profitable portfolio How to Measure Efficiency  We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough phase in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  Receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is the operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy    to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average  Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers      Zacks Rank better than or equal to  2  Buy  Only Zacks Rank  1 and Buy rated

5 Top Efficient Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio

	Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors  radar irrespective of market conditions as price performance is believed to be positively correlated with the efficiency level 

	Efficiency level  which measures a company s capability to transform its available input into output  is often considered to be an important parameter to find out whether a company has the potential to yield higher returns or not 

How to Measure Efficiency  

	We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns 

Inventory Turnover

	Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory 

Receivables Turnover

	This ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  Receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy 

Asset Utilization

	This is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio implies that the company is failing to use its assets effectively 

Operating Margin

	Another popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses 

	All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages 

Screening Parameters

	In addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy    to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable 

Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average 

	 Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers  

	The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7 906 stocks to only 13 

	Here are five stocks from the 13 that made it through the screen 

Baxter International Inc   NYSE        through its subsidiaries  provides renal and hospital products  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 17 14

MAM Software Group Inc   NASDAQ       is a technology holding company  The company is a provider of cloud based business and on premise management solutions for the auto parts  tires and vertical distribution industries  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 92 86

7 Stocks Near 52 Week High to Look Out For

	Momentum investing involves spotting of stocks which are racing higher  barring a few brief pauses  Admittedly  it is hard to ignore stocks that scale 52 week highs  or hit the lows  as such movements are tracked religiously by analysts 

	However  given the presumptive bias of investors  many a times  stocks near a 52 week high are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential  This is often because anxious investors and traders give up early on fears of a reversal or an impending crash 

	Meanwhile  only a handful of investors who stay invested get rewarded handsomely  Our 52 week high investment screen will help you place your money on a few handpicked stocks near a 52 week high with more upside potential 

	Let s take a look at how you could club these stocks with the right set of parameters to join the ranks of investors who are betting on this relatively new investment technique 

Scaling Beyond the 52 Week High Mark

	Stocks near a 52 week high often instill the presumptive  adjustment and anchoring bias  in the minds of investors  This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor  Psychological bias on part of investors prevents the 52 week high stocks from scaling higher 

	Prolonged under reaction makes these stocks remain undervalued  However  sooner or later  the markets get a whiff of it and investors realize that their lack of enthusiasm is unwarranted  A string of positive developments and renewed interest help stocks steer past the 52 week high bar and scale higher 

	The ones who get in before the positive developments and the pricing in of growth factors benefit the most  Also  research reveals that current price levels reflect a stock s momentum better than past changes  This implies that if a stock is trading close to its 52 week high  chances are that it will perform better in subsequent periods 

Choosing the Right Filter

	Our diligent screening technique has been deployed to find 52 week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries  The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations  sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum 

	These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales  which make us believe that they will continue their rally for quite some time 

Current Price 52 Week High     80

	This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading within 20  of its 52 week high range and is likely to touch the 52 week high mark soon 

  Change Price   4 Weeks   5

	It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks 

  Change Price   12 Weeks   5

	This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well 

Price Sales    XIndMed

	The lower  the better 

P E using F 1  Estimate    XIndMed

	This metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings  It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to their peers 

One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0     XIndMed

	This helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism 

Zacks Rank   1

	No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank  which has proved its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market  You can see     

Current Price    5

	This parameter will help screen stocks which are trading at  5 or higher 

Volume   20 days  shares     100000

	Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares that can be traded easily 

	Here are seven of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen

141713,363228,BAX,3 Medical Device Stocks With Solid Potential To Buy Now,opinion,"The Medical Device industry has been riding high on optimism of late  courtesy of the Senate s latest decision to lacerate the Affordable Care Act  ACA  by the end of July  In a bill passed on May 4  the House voted to eliminate the expensive Cadillac health plans and the  burdensome job killing  medical device taxes that had been enacted previously  under the ACA  widely known as Obamacare 
Secondly  the Patient and State Stability Fund  PSSF  amendment in the  Trump care  regime looks optimistic at the moment  Per the postulates of the PSSF  the government will set aside  100 billion for over 10 years as a  risk sharing  program to provide payments to health insurers for individual claims of the prospective patients 
We believe the sharing of the cost burden by the government  if anything  would result in lower premiums  broadening the customer base for the Medical Instrument companies that would have otherwise suffered owing to their exorbitant products and services 
Woes Still Remain
The  Trump card  has finally started to act in favor of the Republicans as it promised to exterminate the infamous 2 3  medical device tax  However  the latest revelation by some moderate senators to  keep some of its taxes   has once again started to create quite a stir in the medical device space 
Also  despite the solid prospects of the Obamacare pullback  the latest  Trump care  module has failed to impress Americans  thanks to a report by NBC News that reveals unfavorable poll results by the Kaiser Family Foundation  The poll suggests that 55  of the Americans have registered votes against Trump s latest healthcare module 
Meanwhile   Trump care  has proposed a hike in the U S  FDA medical product user fee  Under Trump s proposed budget  medical device user fees are expected to be around  439 billion in 2018  which is almost three times the current level  This is a huge burden for the digital health industry and small companies in the medical device space 
Under the existing schedule  the FDA is authorized to collect  999 5 million in user fees and inflationary adjustments from the companies  The usage fees are already sky high and a further hike would only have raised regulatory barriers  adding to the concerns of small to medium sized medical device companies 
Choosing the Winning Stock
Amid such a volatile backdrop  we believe stocks with strong fundamentals will make lucrative additions to your portfolio  We have taken the help of the  to select favorable stocks  To shortlist the stocks from the vast universe of medical devices  we have picked the ones that carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

141716,363231,BAX,2 Solid Medical Device Stocks To Scoop Up Right Away,opinion,"The current scenario pertaining to the U S  medical device sector is pretty blurred  While the players within the sector are eagerly waiting for the Senate to pass the final Obamacare Reform Bill in July  several recent comments by the Republicans are raising doubts over the consequences 
Some Republicans are thinking of retaining a few of the medical device taxes that were supposed to be abolished earlier  Another group of senators intend to retain all the taxes but reduce the proportion of those  According to a Breitbart report  they believe that a slower phase out of Obamacare taxes will generate enough revenues for a more generous health care bill 
So far  companies in the medical device sector were hopeful about the promised cancellation of major healthcare taxes  the Cadillac tax and the 2 3  MedTech tax  related to Obamacare under Trump s American Health Care Act  AHCA   Unquestionably  the latest political remarks have landed the MedTech space to more uncertain territories 
In spite of what the future may unfold  we would suggest investors to pick medical device stocks which are fundamentally strong at present  These stocks will make valuable additions to an investment portfolio in the wake of widespread volatility in the medical device market 
Top Two Picks 
We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to select favorable stocks  To shortlist the stocks from the vast universe of the medical device sector  we have picked the ones that carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   You can see  
Baxter International Inc    NYSE BAX    Headquartered in Deerfield  IL  Baxter International is a global medical technology company  The company offers renal and hospital products such as kidney dialysis equipment  infusion pumps  and intravenous  IV  solutions  Baxter International recently received guidance from the U S  FDA clarifying the regulatory pathway for its home peritoneal dialysis  PD  solution system to improve patient access to home dialysis 
In the past one year  Baxter International has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  The company represented a solid return of 30 3   comparing favorably with the industry s return of roughly 13   Meanwhile  the estimate revision trend for the current year remained favorable with nine estimates moving north in the last two months  compared to no movement in the opposite direction  As a result  current year estimates increased roughly 5  to  2 27 over the same time frame 

Of late  Baxter International has accelerated its pace of acquisitions and strategic collaborations that enhance its product portfolio  thereby opening up significant long term opportunities  We are also upbeat about the company s recently signed definitive agreement to acquire Claris Injectables  Recurring revenue stream  expanding product portfolio  impressive product pipeline and strong presence in the international markets are other key positives 
Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT    This IL based medical device major discovers  develops  manufactures and sells a diversified line of health care products  The company has a broad range of branded generic pharmaceuticals  medical devices  diagnostics  and nutrition products  Recently  Abbott received CE mark for its TactiCath Sensor and Confirm Rx ICM products  The company also launched science based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries 
Taking a glance at its share price performance  Abbott has been trading above the broader Medical products industry over the last one year  The company has so far gained 28 7   compared to 13 2  of the industry  Additionally its current year estimate revision is favorable  Over the last two months  there have been five upward revisions compared to no downward revision  As a result  the current year magnitude has inched up 0 8  to  2 47 per share 

Overall  we believe that the company stands to benefit from the ongoing integration and synergy achievement of St  Jude Medical which was acquired at the start of 2017  We are also looking forward to the company s plans to focus on selling core therapeutic products in the emerging markets of India  Russia and Latin America

Buy These 5 Efficient Stocks Right Away

	Efficiency or the company s ability to transform its inputs into outputs is an important measure to determine its financial condition  Companies with favorable efficiency levels are poised to be on investors  radar irrespective of market conditions  This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with the company s price performance 

Measures of Efficiency Level

	We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns 

Inventory Turnover

	Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory 

Receivables Turnover

	This ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  Receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy 

Asset Utilization

	This is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively 

Operating Margin

	Another popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses 

	All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages 

Screening Parameters

	In addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy    to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable 

Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average 

	 Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers  

	The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7 906 stocks to only 16 

	Here are five stocks from the 16 that made it through the screen 

American Woodmark Corporation  NASDAQ       manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 12 94

141756,363271,BAX,5 Top Efficient Stocks To Add To Your Portfolio,opinion,Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors  radar irrespective of market conditions as price performance is believed to be positively correlated with the efficiency level   Efficiency level  which measures a company s capability to transform its available input into output  is often considered to be an important parameter to find out whether a company has the potential to yield higher returns or not How to Measure Efficiency  We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  Receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio implies that the company is failing to use its assets effectively Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy    to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average  Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers      The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7 906 stocks to only 13 Here are five stocks from the

reflecting growth at IMS and the legacy Synergy CSD outsourcing business in Europe On the other hand  revenues from Applied Sterilization Technologies improved 4 8  to  115 7 million and organic

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Bet on These Stocks Near 52 Week Highs

	To make the most of the market s recent bull run  place your bets on winning stocks that are scaling new highs  In such a market  wagering on solid momentum stocks in a timely manner can help you make some quick bucks  In this screening article  we discuss the 52 week investment strategy  which loosely borrows from the basics of Momentum investing 

	One of the relatively new entries in the investing rulebook  the 52 week investment strategy  relies on the new investment mantra   buy high and sell higher   A wide group of investors are placing their bets on stocks which are hovering around their 52 week high mark  Also  they are opting for stocks that are currently undervalued but have strong upside potential 

	However  this touch and go strategy should not be followed blindly without a fool proof plan  To make the gamble worthwhile  it is imperative to club the 52 week high price criteria with a set of other parameters  Meanwhile  our 52 week high screen singles out stocks that can be counted on 

Crossing the 52 Week High Mark

	Many a times  stocks nearing 52 week highs are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential  Psychological bias on part of investors  who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending  prevents them from scaling higher  These investors use the 52 week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor 

	Prolonged under reaction makes these stocks remain undervalued  However  sooner or later  the markets get a whiff of it and investors realize that their lack of enthusiasm is unwarranted  A string of positive developments and renewed interest help stocks steer past the 52 week high bar and scale higher 

	The ones who get in before the positive developments and the pricing in of growth factors benefit the most  Also  research reveals that current price levels reflect a stock s momentum better than past changes  This implies that if a stock is trading close to its 52 week high  chances are that it will perform better in subsequent periods 

Setting the Right Filters

	Our screening technique has been deployed to find 52 week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries  The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations  sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum 

	These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers  in terms of earnings as well as sales  which make us believe that they will maintain their rally for quite some time now 

Current Price 52 Week High     80

	This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks  A value greater than 0 8 implies that the stock is trading within 20  of its 52 week high range and is likely to touch the 52 week high mark soon 

  Change Price   4 Weeks   2

	It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks 

  Change Price   12 Weeks   2

	This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well 

Price Sales    XIndMed

	The lower  the better 

P E using F 1  Estimate    XIndMed

	This metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings  It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to their peers 

One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0     XIndMed

	This helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism 

Zacks Rank   1

	No screening is complete without our Zacks Rank  which has proved its worth since inception  Stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have at all times managed to brave adversities and beat the market  You can see     

Current Price    5

	This parameter will help screen stocks which are trading at  5 or higher 

Volume   20 days  shares     100000

	Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares that can be traded easily 

	Here are 5 of the 17 stocks that made it through the screen

Bet on Relative Price Performance with These 5 Stocks 

	Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios  Simultaneously  it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average 

	On such comparison  if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples  it may be better to avoid it 

	However  those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio  since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns  Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands 

	Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth  and are the best ways to go about this strategy 

	Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains

quarter of fiscal 2017  up 5 8  year over year  Adjusted EPS also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny Per management  sales growth and an improved gross profit ratio  partially offset by SG A growth and a higher effective income tax rate  were the main contributors to the bottom line improvement Including one time items  the company reported EPS of 31 cents  reflecting a decline of 34  from the year ago quarter s 47 cents PHIBRO ANIMAL Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Net SalesIn the reported quarter  Phibro s net sales improved 0 4  year over year to  188 0 million The improvement was driven by volume growth at the Animal Health segment  which was partially offset by declines in Mineral Nutrition sales Sales by SegmentsNet sales at the Animal Health segment increased 4  to  124 5 million in the reported quarter on the back of volume increases in the nutritional specialty and vaccine product groups within the segment  Sales from vaccines increased 21   principally on volume growth  including products acquired from MVP Laboratories  Inc  in Jan 2016  Nutritional specialty products sales rose 18   owing to volume growth in the U S  for Phibro s dairy and poultry products On the other hand  sales at Medicated feed additives  MFAs  and Other  the biggest section of this segment  declined 2  primarily due to domestic volume declines resulting from adverse views regarding medically important antibacterials  partially offset by domestic growth in other products   International net sales declined slightly due to volatile macroeconomic conditions in Brazil  partially offset by growth in other regions Net sales at the Mineral Nutrition segment declined 5  to  51 6 million  Stable volumes from demand for trace mineral products were offset by lower average selling prices due to underlying raw material commodity price declines   Net sales at the Performance Products segment declined 5  to  11 9 million on lower volumes of copper based and chemical catalyst products and decreased average selling prices of personal care ingredients  However  higher average selling prices of copper based products partially offset the declines Operational UpdatePhibro s first quarter adjusted gross profit increased 3 4  year over year  excluding acquisition related cost of goods sold and acquisition related amortization  to  62 3 million  The adjusted gross margin also expanded 102 basis points  bps  to 33 1  Adjusted selling  general and administrative expenses increased 1 6  to  37 2 million  Adjusted operating margin expanded 80 bps year over

with  2 4 million in the year ago quarter  Capital expenditure amounted to  5 9 million in the quarter  reflecting a reduction from  8 1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 FY17 OutlookPhibro reaffirmed its fiscal 2017 guidance  The company currently expects to generate net sales of  750  770 million  reflecting 2  annualized growth for fiscal 2017  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of

decline of 3  to growth of 1   The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 41 for fiscal 2017 lies above the company s guided range Our TakePhibro started fiscal 2017 on a promising note  with its first quarter bottom line exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues expanding in low single digits on a year over year basis  Nonetheless  Animal Health remained the key contributing business  delivering positive growth on a year over year basis  The company s strong margins are encouraging However  management s reiterated guidance is quite a dampener  Segment wise  a persistent

177 5 million  However  it surpassed the company s guidance of  168  170 million  The top line also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  170 million The year over year decline in the top line was primarily due to lower than expected revenues garnered by Myriad s hereditary cancer test Segment wise  Molecular diagnostic tests  93  of total revenue  recorded total revenue of  165 1 million  down 3 9  year over year  mainly on account of Hereditary cancer testing revenues which dropped 11  to  139 3 million  However  Vectra DA testing revenues grew 2  to  11 6 million  Prolaris testing revenues surged 314  to  2 9 million and other testing revenues rose 4  to  2 4 million On the other hand  Pharmaceutical and clinical service revenues  accounting for the rest  in the first quarter

to 77 5   According to management  this decline was due to unfavorable product mix with more revenues coming in from lower margin segments such as pharmaceutical and clinical services along with reduced fixed cost absorption on lower hereditary cancer revenues  Additionally  the company witnessed an impact from the full implementation of long term contracts in hereditary cancer Operating expenses rose 26 6  to  131 million owing to a 29 3  rise in selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses  to  112 million   Research and development  R D  expenses rose 12 7   to  19 4 million

at 23 25 cents on total revenue of  188  190 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS at 27 cents and revenues at  193 8 million exceeds the company s guided range Our ViewOn a disappointing note  Myriad started the fiscal 2017 on a disappointing note with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate On a brighter note  Myriad made considerable progress in its recently released product line  Particularly  strong growth was observed in both Prolaris and Vectra DA testing revenues  This led to the rise in consolidated revenues  surpassing the company s revenue guidance and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Moving on to Genesight with Assurex Health  Myriad s revenues and volumes exceeded expectations  The integration of Assurex health is also awaited which

currency adjusted European revenue declined in the high teens during the third quarter primarily on poor performance in Germany due to academic and government funding weakness  Sales from North America sales were up in the high single digits while Japan was up in the low single digits  China revenue increased in low teens during the quarter Margin TrendsAdjusted gross margin in the reported quarter expanded 280 basis points  bps  to 48 9   owing to the company s improvements in its BIOSPIN Group  Optics  Nano Surfaces and semiconductor metrology businesses within CALID and NANO Groups

nine months  compared with free cash outflow worth  56 8 in the prior year quarter  This decline was primarily due to increased working capital During the reported quarter  Bruker repurchased 1 2

02  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 EPS stands at  1 00  much below the company s guidance Our TakeBruker ended the third quarter of 2016 on a mixed note  The company s quarterly earnings were much ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Revenues edged past the mark but declined on a year over year basis  Further  organic revenues suffered a formidable decline  adding to our woes  The reduced revenue guidance also indicates a gloomy operating scenario down the line On a brighter note  the company exhibited a solid cash balance position on the back of improved free cash flow compared to the prior year period  Further  a comparatively better performance delivered by Bruker s BioSpin group  optics and semiconductor metrology businesses as well as margin recovery

to  578 0 million on the back of persistent strong recent trends  On the other hand  international revenues dropped 9 6   down 7 8  at CER  to  148 9 million  due to inventory fluctuations in blood screening Segments in DetailSales at the Diagnostics segment  42 9  of total revenue  grew 2 5  year over year  up 3 1  at CER  to  311 9 million in the quarter  Growth was primarily driven by global

Health segment  40 2   rose 2 1   up 2 3  at CER  to  292 3 million  Growth was primarily driven by domestic sales of 7 2   which in turn was supported by an increase in service revenues and new

TakeHologic exited fiscal 2016 on an impressive note  with both its top and bottom line comfortably exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company s strong cash balance position also encourages us  However  Hologic witnessed a slump in its blood screening business this quarter  as per management s expectation  owing to higher orders received in the prior year period Moreover  we are impressed to note that despite the higher operating expenses  Hologic observed gross margin expansion  This improvement is because of strong domestic sales growth  favorable product mix  and

 confidence in the stock  However  despite the encouraging growth witnessed in Plasma and Haemonetics Management franchises  the underperformance at the other two franchises was quite a disappointment  The gross margin decline also added to the woes Nonetheless  to improve its performance in the Blood Center and Cell Processing franchises  management is currently focusing on simplification of the

142014,363529,BAX,Chemed  CHE  Lags Q3 Earnings  Tops Sales  EPS View Up,opinion,Chemed Corp    NYSE CHE   reported third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of  1 73  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 9  as well as the year ago adjusted number by 2 8  Including one time items  the company reported third quarter net earnings of  26 8 million or  1 66 per share  down 6 9  or 2 9   respectively  from the year ago period Quarter in DetailsRevenues increased 1 7  year over year to  392 6 million in the third quarter  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  389 million CHEMED CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Chemed currently operates in the form of two wholly owned subsidiaries viz  VITAS Healthcare Corporation   a major provider of end of life care  and Roto Rooter   a leading commercial and residential plumbing and drain cleaning services provider In the third quarter  net revenue at VITAS reached  283 million  down 0 8  year over year  The downside primarily resulted due to a 0 6  rise in average Medicare reimbursement rate and a 3  increase in average daily census  offset by acuity mix shift which negatively impacted revenues by 1 7   The recent alteration in the Medicare hospice reimbursement also impacted revenue growth by 2 1  Roto Rooter reported sales of  110 million in the third quarter  up 8 4  year over year  According to the company  revenue from water restoration increased 46 3  year over year to  11 9 million Gross margin contracted 129 basis points  bps  year over year to 28 3   Adjusted operating margin contracted 197 bps to 13 1  in the quarter  owing to a 6 4  rise in selling  general and administrative expenses to  59 4 million Chemed exited third quarter 2016 with total cash and cash equivalents of  21 3 million  up 21 7  from  17 5 million at the end of second quarter 2016  The company had total debt of  110 6 million at the end of the quarter  compared to  148 million at the previous quarter s end  As of Sep 30  2016  the company had approximately  288 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under its existing five year credit agreement On Mar 11  2016  Chemed s board of directors authorized an additional  100 million for stock repurchase under the company s existing share repurchase program  As of Sep 30  2016  the company had  50 2 million of remaining share repurchase authorization under this plan 2016 Outlook On Jan 1  2016  CMS implemented a revenue neutral rebasing to the Medicare hospice reimbursement per diem  Including the impact of rebasing  Chemed currently expects its full year 2016 revenue growth for VITAS  prior to Medicare Cap  in the range of 1  2    lower than 1 5  3  guided earlier   Average Daily Census is estimated to expand approximately 4 5  to 5   4  to 5    while Medicare Cap billing limitations are projected at  1 25 million  earlier estimate was  2 5 million   On the other hand  management anticipates full year 2016 revenue growth of 5  5 5  for Roto Rooter  up from the earlier guidance of 4  5   Including the impact of rebasing  the company expects to deliver adjusted EPS  considering stock option expense as a one time item  in the range of  7 20  7 30  for 2016  earlier guidance was  7 15  7 30   The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  7 06 for 2016  considering stock option expense as a regular item  Reimbursement Related UpdateCMS  implementation of a refinement to the Medicare hospice reimbursement per diem eliminated the single tier per diem for routine home care  RHC  and replaced it with a two tiered rate  with a higher per diem rate for the first 60 days of a hospice patient s care  and a lower rate for day 61 and after  In addition  CMS provided for a Service Intensity Add on  SIA  payment  which provides for reimbursement of care provided by a registered nurse or social worker for RHC patients within seven days prior to death  The current two tiered national per diem rate for RHC is  186 84 for the first 60 days and  146 83 for RHC provided to patients in hospice beyond 60 days According to Chemed  rebasing in 2016 would be revenue neutral to a hospice if it has 37 6  of total RHC days of care being provided to patients in their first 60 days of admission and 62 4  of total RHC days of care provided to patients after the 60 days  In third quarter 2016  VITAS had a 24 6 75 4 RHC Days of Care ratio and generated approximately  1 3 million in SIA payments  This resulted in  6 million less revenue than under the previous Medicare reimbursement methodology Our TakeChemed s third quarter 2016 results were a mixed bag  with its bottom line lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues exceeded the same  Issues related to declining units for admission remain a headwind  VITAS demonstrated a sluggish show  but we are optimistic about the strong segmental performances at the company  Furthermore  the raised outlook for both the Roto Rooter segment and bottom line results is indicative of the fact that the company anticipates improved operating results in the upcoming quarters  therefore inspiring optimism However  the reduced outlook for the VITAS segment displays the negative impact that CMS  recently modified reimbursement in the Medicare hospice space had on Chemed  Moreover  headwinds like seasonality in business  a competitive landscape and dependence on government mandate continue to be challenges for Chemed Zacks Rank   Key PicksChemed currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Some top ranked stocks in the broader medical space include GW Pharmaceuticals

products and the effect of currency exchange rates  organic revenues rose 9 5  year over year  marking the third consecutive quarter of 9  or higher organic growth INTEGRA LIFESCI Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   The third quarter s solid revenue growth was primarily driven by strong contribution from both the company s Specialty Surgical Solutions and Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies segments  Additionally  double digit increases in international sales contributed to the quarter s top line growth  This broad based strength stemmed from a number of different product franchises and geographic regions In terms of product categories  revenues from the company s Specialty Surgical Solutions rose 8 4   up 8  organically  to  159 4 million  aided by a strong performance in the dural repair franchise  which grew in low double digits in the reported quarter largely due to solid contribution from DuraSeal and DuraGen  Further  management noted broader acceptance of two recent Dural

front  in particular  is indicative of the company s healthy growth via organic and inorganic means across all its segments However  the company  in spite of posting a promising third quarter

drove the year over year improvement in the quarter s adjusted EPS Including one time items  the company reported net income of 5 cent per share  a deterioration from the year ago net income of 22 cents OMNICELL INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Revenues in DetailRevenues surged 41 1  year over year to  176 7 million  slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  177 million According to management  the company witnessed strong demand in the third quarter on account of both expansion and upgrades by existing customers  as well as new and competitive conversion customers  Strength has been noted particularly in the combined product portfolio  which offers tailored and scalable solutions for customers On a segmental basis  Omnicell s Automation and Analytics segment s revenues increased 48 1  during the quarter to  152 4 million  The year over year upside was driven by the recent buyout of Aesynt On a combined basis  new and competitive conversions accounted for approximately 34  of third quarter bookings  Meanwhile  revenues from the Medication Adherence segment improved by 9 5  to  24 3 million Operational UpdateOmnicell s gross profit during the reported

million compared with  5 9 million in 2015 OutlookOmnicell reiterated its full year 2016 earnings guidance  The company expects adjusted EPS in the  1 50  1 60 range  However  the previous revenue projection s higher end has been narrowed down to  700  710 million  The company also continues to expect product bookings in the band of  540  560 million during 2016 Our TakeOmnicell s third quarter 2016 performance has been quite heartening  We are encouraged to note that the Aesynt acquisition has driven Omnicell s share in the the medication automation and analytics market by 10   This quarter was strong in terms of bookings for the company s legacy products  It was a robust quarter for the Aesynt products as well Management expects this acquisition to widen Omnicell s product portfolio for the point of care and centralized medication management equipment and solutions  It should also expand Omnicell s presence in hospitals by adding world leading IV solutions  while also accelerating the development of enterprise software and real time analytics Omnicell s third quarter margin contractions are however disappointing  Nevertheless  post the Aesynt takeover  management s confidence in delivering significant revenue and earnings growth over the coming years  bolsters our confidence in the stock  Going forward  its recent Aesynt buyout is expected to be accretive to Omnicell s adjusted earnings in 2016  We believe such strategic acquisitions will add value to the company s growth profile significantly  apart from expanding its product portfolio and geographic presence Zacks

second quarter  At the end of the third quarter  the company had total long term debt of  5 42 billion  a marginal reduction from  5 68 billion at the end of the second quarter GuidanceBoston

severe currency headwinds  Boston Scientific posted a mixed third quarter 2016  with earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues ahead of the mark  While foreign exchange headwinds continue to pose challenges  we are concerned with the still sluggish defibrillator performance within the company s core CRM segment Nevertheless  Boston Scientific is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses and invest in new technologies and global markets  which accounted for the sales upside across all its geographies in the third quarter  Moreover  we are encouraged with the company gaining a number of approvals for its products  both in the domestic market and outside Among recent launches  ones worth mentioning are Resolution 360 Hemoclip  used in endoscopic procedures of the upper and lower gastrointestinal  GI  tract   the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  approval for the EMBLEM MRI Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator  S ICD  System  as well

macroeconomic turmoil in Brazil  Venezuela and Argentina spoiled overall growth  Foreign currency also remained a major challenge for the company across all regions  On a brighter note  lower dairy

   Guidance
Boston Scientific has provided its third quarter 2016 guidance with an update to its earlier provided full year 2016 forecast  The company raised its outlook for 2016 revenues to the range of  8 27  8 37 billion  annualized growth of 11  to 12  on both reported as well as operational basis  from the earlier provided band of  8 075  8 225 billion  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is  8 15 billion  falling below the guidance range

For the third quarter of 2016  adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 25 27 cents per share on revenues of  2 035  2 085 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS stands at 27 cents  while that for revenues is  2 04 billion 
Our Take
Amid challenging economic conditions  a competitive environment and severe currency headwinds  Boston Scientific posted a mixed third quarter 2016  with earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues ahead of the mark  While foreign exchange headwinds still continues to pose challenges  we are concerned with the still sluggish defibrillator performance within the company s core CRM segment 
Nevertheless  Boston Scientific is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses and invest in new technologies and global markets  which accounted for the sales upside across all its geographies in the second quarter  Moreover  we are also encouraged with the company gaining a number of approvals for its products  both in the domestic market and outside 
Among recent launches  ones worth mentioning are the FDA approval for the Precision Montage MRI Spinal Cord Stimulator System  the expanded offering of MR conditional products with FDA approval of the ImageReady MR Conditional Pacing System  including the INGEVITY MRI pacing leads and CE Mark of the EMBLEM MRI S ICD System among many others  The company also received FDA approval of the IntellaNav XP and the IntellaNav MiFi XP navigation enabled ablation catheters for the treatment of patients with Type I atrial flutter

Phibro sells the bulk of its products to a number of regional and national feed companies  distributors  co ops  blenders  integrated poultry  as well as swine and cattle operations  Significant consolidation of the company s customers may result in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage  This in turn might increase the product pricing pressures challenging Phibro s business 
The company is subject to currency risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which the company earns revenues  During the last reported third quarter  Phibro witnessed tough currency challenges in its Animal Health segment primarily owing to the movement of Brazil  Argentina and South African currencies relative to the U S  dollar 
Notably  Phibro manufactures some of its major products in Brazil and Israel  where production costs are largely denominated in local currencies  while selling prices are largely set in U S  dollars 
Phibro also faces competition from generic alternatives of some of its products that may weigh on its future financial health and operational performance 
However  Phibro is currently well poised in the fast growing food animal species segment of the animal health market with significant presence in poultry and swine  which are projected by Vetnosis to grow globally at compound annual rates of 5 9  and 5   respectively  between 2014 and 2019 
Further  Phibro has established direct presence in many important emerging markets  Outside the U S   Phibro s global footprint extends to key high growth regions including Brazil and other countries in South America  China  India and Asia Pacific  Mexico  Turkey  Australia  Canada and South Africa and other countries in Africa

142126,363641,BAX,5 Efficient Stocks To Ensure High Yields,opinion,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are poised to be on investors  radar irrespective of market conditions as price performance is believed to be positively correlated with efficiency level  Efficiency is the measure of a company s potential to convert its available input into output   
Key Ratios to Identify Efficiency
Sometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company  This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks to build a profitable portfolio  These efficiency ratios are 
Inventory Turnover The ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory is considered to be one of the most popular efficiency ratios  It indicates a company s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position  While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS  a low value indicates that the company is suffering from weak sales  which resulted in excess inventory  
Receivables Turnover   This is the ratio of 12 month sales to four quarter average receivables  It shows a company s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit  A high receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is desirable as it signals that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers 
Asset Utilization This ratio indicates a company s capability to convert its assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level  It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last 4 quarter average of total assets  Like the above two ratios  high asset utilization may also indicate that a company is efficient 
Operating Margin This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period  It measures a company s ability to control its operating expenses  Hence  a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers 
As efficiency level varies across different industries  it is best to select those stocks that have higher ratios compared to their industries  Along with higher ratios  we have considered only those stocks that have either a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  in order to make the strategy more profitable 
Screening Parameters
Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average   The values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers     
Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Only Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and Zacks Rank  2  Buy  rated stocks can get through 
The use of these very few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 21 
Here are five stocks from the 21 that made it through the screen

5 Efficient Stocks to Ensure High Yields

	Companies with favorable efficiency levels are poised to be on investors  radar irrespective of market conditions as price performance is believed to be positively correlated with efficiency level  Efficiency is the measure of a company s potential to convert its available input into output 

Key Ratios to Identify Efficiency

	Sometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company  This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks to build a profitable portfolio  These efficiency ratios are 

Inventory Turnover   The ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory is considered to be one of the most popular efficiency ratios  It indicates a company s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position  While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS  a low value indicates that the company is suffering from weak sales  which resulted in excess inventory 

Receivables Turnover   This is the ratio of 12 month sales to four quarter average receivables  It shows a company s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit  A high receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is desirable as it signals that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers 

Asset Utilization   This ratio indicates a company s capability to convert its assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level  It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last 4 quarter average of total assets  Like the above two ratios  high asset utilization may also indicate that a company is efficient 

Operating Margin   This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period  It measures a company s ability to control its operating expenses  Hence  a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers 

	As efficiency level varies across different industries  it is best to select those stocks that have higher ratios compared to their industries  Along with higher ratios  we have considered only those stocks that have either a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  in order to make the strategy more profitable 

Screening Parameters

Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average   The values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2   Only Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and Zacks Rank  2  Buy  rated stocks can get through 

	The use of these very few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 21 

	Here are five stocks from the 21 that made it through the screen

Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory 
Receivables Turnover
This ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  Receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio may indicate that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or it has quality customers  a low ratio may signal that the company has inefficient collection procedure or it has low quality customers or it has inefficient credit policy 
Asset Utilization
This is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater is the possibility that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio may signal that it is failing to use its assets effectively 
Operating Margin
Another popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses 
All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have these ratios higher than their respective industry averages 
Screening Parameters
In addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable 
Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average  Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers

year over year  The adjusted EPS figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 9  Despite witnessing  strong operating results  STERIS  adjusted EPS declined year over year on account of an increase in share count and higher adjusted effective tax rate  Geographic income mix and discrete item adjustments  which outweighed the tax benefit from the legacy Steris  combination with Synergy Health  primarily drove the tax rate However  STERIS  reported net income improved 39 4  on a year over year basis to  57 7 million in the quarter For full year fiscal 2016  Steris reported adjusted EPS of  3 39  up 11 8  year over year  However  adjusted EPS figure missed the Zacks Consesnus Estimate by 3 7  Revenues in DetailSTERIS plc generated revenues of  690 3 million  up a solid 38  year over year   The top line however missed with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  701 million  The year over year revenue upside was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Synergy Health  Black Diamond Video and GEPCO in addition to solid organic revenue growth Revenue growth declined 1  owing to foreign currency fluctuations of 6   Constant currency organic revenue growth was 5   driven by

Sterilization Technologies and Life Sciences Revenues from the Healthcare Products segment climbed 5  year over year to  335 1 million in the reported quarter  Consumable revenue growth of 25  and

Healthcare Products backlog increased 22  year over year to  119 4 million Revenues from the Healthcare Specialty Services segment improved 141 8  to  157 9 million  on account of 10  organic revenue growth and the addition of Synergy Health  On the other hand  revenues from Applied Sterilization Technologies segment grew 113 5  to  110 4 million  driven by the addition of Synergy Health and increased demand from the segment s core medical device customers Lastly revenues from the Life Sciences segment improved 31  to  85 5 million in the quarter  primarily driven by consumable revenue growth of 51   partly due to the acquisition of GEPCO and partially because of the mid teens growth in organic consumable revenues  Moreover  34  service revenue growth and 8  capital equipment revenue growth contributed to the improvement in the segment  Life Sciences organic revenues were up 11  in the quarter  Life Sciences backlog remained flat at  45 3 million MarginsAdjusted gross margin contracted 320 basis points  bps  year over year to 39 3  in the reported quarter  primarily due to additional costs related to the Synergy Health acquisition  which partially offset the effects of favorable currency translations  the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax and lower material costs STERIS witnessed a 14 6  year over year increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to  150 1 million  On the other hand  research and development expenses inched up 1  to  14 3 million  Consequently  adjusted operating margin expanded 100 bps on a year over

142286,363801,BAX,GNC Holdings  GNC  Q1 Earnings Lag  Cash Position Strong ,opinion,"GNC Holdings Inc    NYSE GNC   reported first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of 69 cents  reflecting a year over year deterioration of 8  on account of declining revenue growth  The quarter s adjusted EPS also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8   However  as per management  GNC Holdings  first quarter EPS was favorably impacted by the repurchase of  219 million of the company s common stock 

Including one time items  the company s reported EPS was also 69 cents  down 4 2  year over year 
Total Revenue
Revenues dropped 1 8  year over year to  668 9 million and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  671 million  This impacted revenue growth  primarily because of lower sales in the company s retail and franchise segments  which was partially offset by the sales improvement in the manufacturing wholesale segment  excluding intersegment sales 
Same store sales dropped 2 6  in domestic company owned stores  including GNC com sales  during the first quarter  while in domestic franchise locations  same store sales fell 5 6  
Segment in Details
GNC Holdings reports its operations in three segments  franchise  retail and manufacturing wholesale segments 
During the reported quarter  GNC Holdings  revenues from the franchise segment dropped 5 6  to  115 5 million  primarily on account of a decline in domestic franchise sales  Domestic franchise revenues declined 4 8  to  81 8 million  primarily due to lower wholesale sales and royalties  International revenues also reduced by  2 7 million  primarily due to reduced wholesale sales and royalties largely related to challenges in Turkey and Australia  partially offset by an improvement in GNC Holdings  business in China 
Revenues at the retail segment declined 1 5  to  496 million  partly due to the sale of Discount Supplements in the fourth quarter of 2015  which resulted in a  7 2 million year over year decrease in revenues  Negative domestic retail same store sales also played spoilsport on account of continued negative trends in the vitamin category  the timing of the Easter holiday and unfavorable weather conditions in January  However  the addition of 67 new company owned stores partially offset the revenue decline at the segment 
Revenues from the manufacturing wholesale segment  excluding intersegment revenues  improved 3 5  to  57 5 million 
Margin
Gross profit deteriorated 5 4  in the reported quarter to  235 8 million  Consequently  gross margin contracted 130 basis points  bps  to 36 9   owing to lower domestic retail product margin rate   a result of the expiring product and occupancy expense de leverage associated with negative same store sales 
Selling and administrative expenses grew 2 4  to  143 1 million  Consequently  adjusted operating margin deteriorated 220 bps to 13 9  during the quarter  owing to higher adjusted operating expenses 
Financial Position
GNC Holdings exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  61 million  compared with  56 5 million at the end of 2015  As of Mar 31  2016  the company generated cash of  142 3 million from operating activities  compared with  116 9 million a year ago 
During the first quarter  management bought back 7 6 million shares worth roughly  218 9 million  of this  17 9 million was settled in Apr 2016   Meanwhile  as of Mar 31  2016   208 0 million worth of shares are available for repurchase  The company also paid  14 3 million in cash dividends on its common stock in the quarter  Also  the company generated free cash flow of  132 1 million  reflecting a year over year improvement of 20  
Moreover  during the first quarter earnings release  GNC Holdings declared a cash dividend of 20 cents per share of its common stock for the second quarter of 2016  payable on or about Jun 24  2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business as on Jun 10  2016 
2016 Outlook
Assuming that the lower sales trend will continue in the remaining quarters of 2016  GNC Holdings has slashed its bottom line projection for 2016  The company currently expects to post adjusted EPS in the range of  2 80  2 90 for full year 2016  compared with the previous guided range of  3 15  3 35  excluding the net gain from corporate to franchise store conversions   The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 EPS is pegged at  3 23  above the company s guidance 
For the second quarter of 2016  the company expects to record a pre tax refranchising gain of approximately  20 million  which includes  17 million related to the sale of 84 stores to Sun Holdings  a new franchise partner for GNC   This refranchising gain is excluded from the guidance provided above 
Our Take
2016 started off on a disappointing note for GNC Holdings  with its first quarter results squarely missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Moreover  the company s failure to maintain the previous quarter s rebound in terms of positive domestic company owned same store sales  concerns us  The first quarter segmental performance was also disappointing  particularly as far as the retail and franchise segments are concerned   
On the other hand  despite the heavy investments in marketing  the returns were not up to management s expectations  Further  the trimmed EPS outlook for 2016 dims hopes of a turnaround in the near term 
Despite such adversities  GNC Holdings managed to make some significant progress through the launch of key proprietary products  including expansion in categories like Lean Shake Burn ready to drink shakes  Total Lean vegan shakes  Total Lean CLA powders and Total Lean Advanced Diet Cleanse  Encouragingly  before the effect of cannibalization  GNC Holdings had been able to multiply sales of the new products  reaching revenues to  6 million in Mar 2016 from  3 million in Jan 2016

Stocks Entering Period of Seasonal Strength Today 

Baxter International Inc   NYSE BAX  Seasonal Chart
 
The Markets
Stocks gained on Wednesday as investors welcomed the change in leadership of the Senate following Tuesday s Republican victory    Investors are betting that the Republican majority in the House and now the Senate will be more business friendly  fuelling optimism in equity markets    The S P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average broke to new closing highs as US benchmarks attempt to chart a new rising trend    Strength across the sectors was fairly broad based  however  the utilities sector topped the leaderboard as the market segment continues to chart a near parabolic move following the lows charted in August   Although typically weak in the month of November  Utilities remain seasonally positive into the end of the year as investors speculate on the upcoming winter weather    History suggests that Electric Utilities tend to perform best when investors anticipate colder than average winter weather  a bet on higher usage and greater revenues from companies in this industry    The S P 500 Electric Utilities SubIndustry Index gained 2 34   charting the highest level since 2008 


The Republican win not only gave a boost to equity prices  but the US Dollar strengthened as well    The US Dollar Index is now trading at the highest level since the end of QE1 in 2010  moving in on resistance at 89    The US Dollar Index continues to chart a long term basing pattern  suggesting a stronger US Dollar remains likely over the years to come    Coincidentally  the last bull market in the US Dollar Index was from 1995 through 2000 as the Republicans held a majority in the House and the Senate and a Democrat was in the White House    The Dollar strength in the second half of the 90 s pressured commodity prices lower by around 21   according to the CRB Commodity Index  during the five year period  material stocks suffered as a result    The US Dollar Index seasonally strengthens in the month of November  followed by strength through the first quarter of the year 


With the stronger dollar  metal prices took a hit  including significant declines in Silver and Palladium    Silver has shed nearly 70  of its value since peaking in 2011  charting a long term trend of lower highs and lower lows in the process    The commodity is now testing an important multi year rising trendline that stretches back to the turn of the century  perhaps the one last line in the sand maintaining some resemblance of bullishness in the longer term direction of the metal    Silver has also posted significant declines relative to the price of Gold over the last few years  but the relative value of the precious metal is quickly approaching long term support    This suggests that the relative trend may be close to shifting in favour of Silver  replacing its more defensive counterpart    The price of Silver relative to Gold enters into a period of seasonal strength around this time of year  accelerating into the first quarter of the new year     Keep in mind that even though these apparent ultra long term levels of support look enticing  the declining trend stemming from the 2011 peak continues to hold precedent  suggesting a declining path until some type of bottoming pattern is recorded  the ongoing rise in the US Dollar will continue to pose a threat to the trade for some time to come 
  



Sentiment on Wednesday  according to the put call ratio  ended bullish at 0 89

142309,363824,BAX,Forget Baxter  Grab These 3 Medical Stocks,opinion,"The first half of 2015 has not been great for the U S  stock market in general  As we enter the second half  the market is going crazier  The Greek crisis  Chinese doldrums  oil price slide and the speculations related to the Fed rate hike have added to the volatility this week 
Meanwhile  a recovering U S  economy driven by rising business and consumer confidence and improving job market scenario are expected to drive investor confidence in the second half of 2015  Moreover  expectations of a booming retail sector and better GDP numbers drive further optimism  These improving trends bode well for the Medical sector as well 
However  we note that an improving U S  economy that resulted in the strengthening of the U S  dollar  affected top line growth of a number of medical companies in the first half of 2015  The second half results are also expected to be impacted by the instability in the foreign exchange rates 
Nevertheless  there were a few stocks which outperformed the market during the same period  However  there were some major companies that performed below expectations  Baxter International Inc  NYSE BAX  being one 
This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock recently separated its biopharmaceuticals business into a new company Baxalta  However  the move did not positively impact the stock price  which was down 8 1  on a year to date basis  The company s senior unsecured ratings were downgraded by credit rating agency Moody s  citing Baxter s small  less diverse  lower margin business and higher leverage as compared to Baxalta

142310,363825,BAX,Undervalued Baxalta Shares Are Shire Acquisition Target,opinion,"Baxalta  NYSE BXLT  was recently spun off from Baxter International  NYSE BAX  on July 1st  2015  The company has 16 000 employees and around  6 billion in expected revenues 
Baxalta is expected to have around  2 15 in earnings per share in its first full fiscal year  The company has traded around  32 a share since the spin off  This translates to a price to earnings ratio of just under 15 
The typical biopharmaceutical stock trades for significantly higher multiples  Many of the company s peers trade for price to earnings multiples well over 20 
Baxalta appeared significantly undervalued  The stock inherited a long dividend history from Baxter and management confirmed it would continue making the dividend a priority  Baxalta s combination of value  solid growth prospects  and continued dividend payments made the stock a favorite of the Sure Dividend system 
Baxalta was the 2nd highest ranked stock in the July 2015 Sure Dividend newsletter  On July 5th the newsletter had this to say about Baxalta 

 Baxalta s high expected total returns and competitive advantage should give the company a P E ratio above the S P 500 s  Fortunately for shareholders  Baxalta s P E ratio is still low at around 13 3  The company s P E ratio is being suppressed due to selling from the recent spin off  Now is an excellent time to buy into this high quality pharmaceutical business  while the P E ratio is still low  

It was an excellent time to buy into Baxalta 
Yesterday morning  Shire Plc  LONDON SHP   they had offered to acquire Baxalta for  45 23 a share on July 10th  Baxalta s management did not accept the offer  At a price of  45 23 a share  Baxalta would have a price to earnings ratio of 21  which is closer to its peer average and around fair value for a high quality dividend growth stock 
Obviously  Shire would not offer more money than it felt Baxalta was worth  Shire s announcement confirms Baxalta s undervalued status 
News of the potential acquisition pushed Baxalta s share price higher  The company s stock price surged over 12  as investors take notice of Baxalta s potential and factor in the possibility the stock could soon be acquired 
Reason for Shire s Announcement
Shire did not announce its acquisition plans because it wants to push Baxalta s share price higher  Rather  the company is attempting to put pressure on Baxalta s management to accept an offer 
Shire s press release stated that  Baxalta has declined to engage in substantive discussions regarding the proposal  
Shire is attempting to force Baxalta s hand into negotiating to sell the company  It makes management look less than stellar when they refuse to engage in negotiations to sell a business   especially when the sale would be accretive to Baxalta shareholders 
The altruistic reason Baxalta s management would not sell is that they feel the offer did not reflect fair value  If this were the case  one would expect Baxalta s management to counter offer  It appears the company did not counter offer in any meaningful way 
The other reason Baxalta s management would refuse to negotiate to sell the company is they are looking to reap the rewards of running the business  If the business were acquired  Baxalta s management could potentially be unemployed  It is therefore in management s best interest to not sell the new company  This is a case were management appears to be acting in their own best interests rather than in the best interests of shareholders 
Baxalta s Response
Yesterday afternoon  Baxalta s management  to Shire  Some of the more important quotes are below 

 During our meeting this week  the Board unanimously concluded that it is not prepared to engage with Shire in a discussion about a combination of our companies based on the value you indicated in your proposal 
 A transaction at the exchange ratio you proposed significantly understates Baxalta s true value  
 Our board is mindful of its fiduciary obligations to Baxalta s shareholders  and we are confident in our standalone plan and our ability to generate significant shareholder value based on that plan  Baxalta s platform is well positioned to generate substantial value for our shareholders and proceeding with a transaction at this time presents a significant and real risk to that value creation  Our Board has evaluated your proposal in this context and concluded that it is not a basis for further discussions  

Baxalta s response is very clear  The company is not interested in being acquired as it feels it can generate more value for shareholders as a stand alone business 
One important note that stands out is that Baxalta s management only met this week to discuss the deal   even though it was offered on July 10th  2015  This shows the company was not interested in exploring the deal from the beginning  and may have only met to discuss due to pressure from Shire 
I too believe that Baxalta is undervalued  The company s management should explore selling the business for a higher value  but should not disregard Shire s bid for the company entirely  Certainly there is some price that Baxalta s management feels is fair value for the company 
Baxalta s CEO
Baxalta s CEO is Ludwig Hantson  Ph D  His bio from the  is shown below 

 Ludwig N  Hantson  Ph D   is President and Chief Executive Officer of Baxalta Incorporated and also serves on the company s Board of Directors  Prior to Baxalta s separation from Baxter in July 2015  he was Corporate Vice President and President  Baxter BioScience  having served in that capacity since October 2010  Ludwig joined Baxter in May 2010 as Corporate Vice President and President  International  From 2001 to May 2010  Dr  Hantson held various positions at Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation  the last of which was Chief Executive Officer  Pharma North America  Prior to Novartis  Dr  Hantson spent 13 years with Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  in roles of increasing responsibility in marketing and clinical research and development  

Hantson was CEO of U S  Pharmaceuticals for Novartis from April 2008 through April 2010  Baxter poached him from Novartis in April of 2010 to head up the company s international division  Hantson was quickly moved off of the international division to the BioScience division 
This is the first time Hantson has been the top CEO of a business  I do not known Dr  Hantson  but it appears he is not yet ready to let go of the reins in his new positions  This is understandable  given he has held the job for just over a month  Hantson  assuming it was he who Shire contacted  was contacted just 9 days after becoming the CEO to sell the business  I completely understand not wanting to sell so quickly  but a CEO s job is to do what is in the best interest of the shareholders  not what is in his best interest 
Expect Corporate Drama Ahead
It is possible that Baxalta s management could be attempting to significantly drive up Shire s asking price by remaining aloof to the deal 
If this is the case  we will likely see renewed engagement between the two companies  managements regarding an acquisitions 
A hostile takeover of Baxalta by Shire is not out of the question  either  Shire s management  that 

 it is our strong preference to immediately enter into a negotiated transaction to explore the full potential of the proposed combination and finalize the terms of an agreement   

This signals the company would much rather engage in a peaceful acquisition than a hostile acquisition 
Whatever the case is  the Shire announcement bodes well for Baxalta shareholders  The announcement sheds light onto the undervalued company  If an acquisition is completed  Baxalta shareholders will see even higher gains 
If an acquisition does not occur  the company still has received a boost and will likely trend toward a price to earnings multiple around 20 over time  which will result in rising share prices  Baxalta s management is also recently announced a   showing it strongly believes the company is undervalued ",2015-08-05,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/undervalued-baxalta-shares-target-of-acquisition-by-shire-plc-260655,260655
