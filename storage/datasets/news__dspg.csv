5 Great Breakout Stocks Offering Stunning ReturnsSelecting breakout stocks is probably one of the most favored techniques among active investors  The idea behind this kind of stock selection is to determine which stocks are trading within a narrow channel  These stocks are to be bought as soon as they move above this band and sold when they fall below  In case a stock moves above this band  it usually gains momentum Identifying Breakout LevelsThe key to this strategy is calculating the support and resistance levels of a stock  The floor of a stock s trading channel is its support level and it should be sold as soon as it threatens to fall lower  On the other hand  the resistance is a stock s breakout level and it can gain substantially if it breaks the resistance level When a stock is close to its support level  demand is literally hitting the floor  On the other hand  demand rises when it is breaching its resistance level  signaling the right time to make a lucrative addition to your portfolio  The idea is to pick stocks which have just broken above their resistance barriers or are very closing to doing so Has a Genuine Breakout Occurred The primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed  When a stock moves above the resistance level  it should be a highly prized commodity for traders  However  whether such a breakout is at all genuine is another matter altogether For a genuine breakout  the stock s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level  This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long term price trends The strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study  Despite the risk of misidentification  correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns  even at a price which may not seem attractive at first glance For the rest of this Screen of the Week

and thanks for joining us today I hope that you had the opportunity to read our press release  which we distributed earlier this morning  I would like to begin by reviewing our results for the fourth quarter and the full year  then commenting on the progression of our business plan  and finally  providing context for our outlook  In a short while  Dror will provide you with detailed comments about our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year  and our outlook for the first quarter of 2020 Our fourth quarter results were ahead of guidance on most financial metrics  Revenues of  29 3 million grew by 12  year over year  while declined by 6  on a sequential basis  We ended the quarter with record high revenues from growth initiatives  reaching  19 6 million and accounting for two thirds of our revenues  This accomplishment drove quarterly GAAP and non GAAP gross margin expansion to 50 9  and 51 2  respectively  Growth initiatives benefited from solid momentum across all product segments  SmartVoice  SmartHome and Unified Communications each grew by 21   63  and 17  year over year  respectively With annual revenues of  73 8 million from growth initiatives  representing 63  of total revenues and driving gross margins to a sustainable level of 50  plus throughout the quarters  2019 marks the year in which DSP Group succeeded in positioning itself as a leading voice AI and IoT technology company while maintaining solid engineering and financial discipline We ended the year with revenues of  117 6 million flat on a year over year basis and despite the demand shortfall in the Unified Communication segment that we experienced in 2019  growth initiative revenues still increased by 15  year over year  surpassing the revenue growth level in 2018 of 12  and driving annual GAAP and non GAAP gross margins to a record high of 50 6  and 51  respectively Lastly  during the year  we generated  10 5 million of cash flows from operations and ended the year with a cash balance of  131 million  We are thrilled by the momentum and acceptance of our new products and technologies and excited about the number of new engagements we have secured with strategic customers At CES 2020 in January  the voice user interface and AI took center stage and our solutions were are an integral part of that  During the show  we successfully demonstrated our leadership and best in class technologies for voice AI and IoT  Moreover  we presented a record number of newly launched products by leading consumer brands  Tier 1 service providers and leading OEMs integrating our SmartVoice  SmartHome  and Unified Communications products across IoT  mobile computing  enterprise  and hearables applications and here are a few examples  Today  ourOperatorOur SmartVoice solutions are driving voice UI and AI in a broad array of applications  with over 80 products by 40 plus vendors  including Tier 1 brands such as Arlo  Facebook  GoPro  Logitech  Lenovo  Samsung and TCL that leverage our voice and AI solutions to design and bring to market highly differentiated and innovative products In our SmartHome segment  three leading Tier 1 service providers selected our ULE product as their primary wireless IoT technology  including Orange in France and ADT in the US and driving more OEMs and ODMs to take an active role in the growing ULE ecosystem In the Unified Communications  we established our leadership position by securing engagements with all of the Top 7 leading enterprise OEMs  including Cisco  Avaya  Poly  Yealink  Mitel  ALE and NEC  These strategic achievements  along with our exceptional pipeline of design engagements  solidify our success and validate that our growth initiatives will continue their upward trajectory and become the primary driver of our business going forward Now  I d like to move on to the business update by segment  starting with SmartVoice  During the quarter  we generated revenues of approximately  4 9 million from sales of SmartVoice products  representing a year over year growth of 21  versus the fourth quarter of 2018  while representing a decline of 1  on a sequential basis  We are delighted with the performance of the SmartVoice segment in 2019 reaching record revenues of  19 3 million and growing by 78  versus 2018 During the quarter  we continued to expand our product reach and engagements with leading consumer electronic brands as demonstrated by the following new product launches  Facebook launched a highly innovative video conferencing system  its Portal TV  integrating our high performance advance audio and machine learning SoC  Leviton launched its Decora Dimmer with Alexa Voice Services support  leveraging our audio voice SoC coupled with our voice processing algorithms  featuring noise reduction  beamforming and echo cancellation  The hardware and the algorithms are optimized for small footprint far field performance and low cost  Nortek selected our SmartVoice products for its Numera Libris Personal Emergency Response System  supporting long battery life while adding always listening features  These achievements  coupled with the recent wins in the smartphone market  including the newly launched Oppo K2 smartphone  continue to demonstrate the depth  strength and diversity of our SmartVoice franchise and our ability to drive down power consumption  while raising the bar on quality and performance for edge devices At CES  we demonstrated how we are leveraging our voice expertise to create innovative AI solutions as the next frontier in machine learning is now applied to voice  As more AI processing gets performed at the edge to address privacy concerns  reduce latency and to make better use of available bandwidth  more efficient hardware and associated algorithms must be tightly coupled and optimized to meet consumers  requirements  We will continue to enrich our product portfolio with the suite of algorithms and hardware that address the rising need to create increasingly accurate AI solutions for edge devices  for applications such as sound detection  proximity  acoustic beaconing and more  all while maintaining the lowest power consumption  We believe that our SmartVoice business will continue to be a pivotal growth driver  powering a broad array of exciting new applications Moving on to the Unified Communications segment  In the fourth quarter  we achieved revenues of  10 million  representing a year over year increase of 17  while flat on a sequential basis  We ended the year with revenues of  38 1 million  representing a year over year decrease of 2  and while we are disappointed by this result and attribute the revenue shortfall mainly to a delay in timing of orders originating from uncertainties related to trade war concerns as well as weakness in enterprise IT spending  we remain highly confident in the recovery of this segment this year  propelled by the high volume design we secured into 2019 that already commenced mass shipment and is expected to contribute in a meaningful way to our 2020 revenues as well as additional designs we secured including Tier 1 OEM and two other ODMs that launched new lines of IP phones with dual color displays  Tier 1 OEM that launched a new series of IP phones for the UCaaS market to complement its own premise portfolio Based on our engagement pipeline  we are confident that we are positioned well for outperformance and revenue growth in the Unified Communications segments this year Turning to our SmartHome product line  During the fourth quarter  we generated  4 7 million in revenues  representing a year over year increase of 63  and an increase of 23  on a sequential basis  Full year Smart Home revenues of  16 3 million grew by 12  year over year  During the quarter  we accomplished a milestone event for DSP Group and secured our first significant win in the US which should pave the path for ULE s broad market adoption in the Americas  ADT  a leading US security service provider announced that it has selected our ULE technology as its primary connectivity for its new wireless security offering  The system  which was demonstrated at CES  includes a line up of IoT sensors  as well as a hub and camera  And moreover  some of these devices will also incorporate our SmartVoice technology  We are excited by the momentum of the ULE technology and expect this achievement to propel faster expansion of the ULE ecosystem with additional products and brands as well as adoption by additional leading service provider  This momentum is also evidenced by the following wins and new product launches Golden Mark selected our ULE technology  for its new line of wireless smart home devices  including an in wall dimmer  in wall switch  plug in dimmer  plug in switch and water leak detector  Ooma launched a Smart Security Keypad based on our ULE technology  The keypad allows control of Ooma s Smart Security system that already includes a siren as well as a motion sensor  door window sensor  a water sensor to detect leaks and a garage door sensor  all of which run our ULE technology  We re optimistic about the design momentum and growth of this product category in 2020 and beyond on the heels of a strong traction for ULE  both in Europe and the US And now  to an update on the cordless phone market  Our fourth quarter cordless phone revenue was in line with our expectations  Cordless revenues declined by 8  year over year to  9 7 million and accounted for only 33  of total fourth quarter revenues  For the full year 2019  our cordless business generated revenues of  43 9 million  representing a decline of 18  year over year  which is in line with the secular decline pattern of 15  to 20   We continue to prudently manage this cash leverage business and reinvest its profit to fuel future growth in our well performing growth initiatives Now  for an update on our outlook for the first quarter  Taking into account the focus we receive from customers and our own assessment  we expect our first quarter revenues to be in the range of  28 million to  30 million  The midpoint of this guidance range implies a year over year revenue growth of 3   The midpoint of the guidance also implies that growth initiatives should account for 60  to 64  of our first quarter revenues To summarize  we are excited by the market response to our products and technologies Products and technologies  as well as the growing number of Tier 1 engagements  We believe that these accomplishments will solidify our future success on the heels of a strong pipeline of design wins  which are expected to contribute to solid performance and revenue growth this year  Now  I would like to turn the call

like to open up the line for question and answers  Operator  please Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  sir   Operator Instructions  And your first question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen  Please go ahead  your line is open Matt Ramsay    Cowen    AnalystThank you very much  Ofer  it was    obviously  at CES as well  great to hear about the ADT design win and it seems like ULE is starting to get a little bit of a foothold  Maybe you could talk a bit about your expectations for the size of that design win as it rolls out And then secondly  if I m not mistaken  I think it s on there    DIY platform and maybe you could talk  if there s opportunities on  sort of  the mainstream platform at ADT and as well and what the differences might be in between our mainstream platform and the DIY one  Thank you Ofer Elyakim    Chief Executive OfficerHi  Matt  and thanks for your question  So  relating to the ULE momentum  indeed we are excited  For the last couple of years  the ULE was a phenomena that was mainly a European one where we were mainly addressing and designing the technology with leading both security and telecom  so its providers and today have both Verisure which is part of securitized direct and the entire SmartHome    Magenta SmartHome of Deutsche Telekom and also Maison Connect and Maison Protegee which are the smart home and secured home of Orange that are all based on the ULE technology  And actually during 2019  we ve made significant efforts to market and promote the technology in the US and we believe that the technology s unique characteristics in the form of its natural support for voice and voice is a key requirement for the security service providers  It is today a very important use case that will be deployed and used by all major security service providers And when we look at this domain  we do see in a way two different markets that are today addressed by many different security vendors  both coming from the do it yourself and this is the ability to purchase a security system    basically a complete security system in retail  install it  subscribe to a certain level of service with that brand and get a certain level of capabilities with respect to home monitoring and the ability to have access to all kinds of additional services versus the traditional professional security market and    when we look at a market like the US with about 120 million households  we see a great opportunity in security for ULE for our products and technologies  including SmartVoice and we believe that there will be a continued growth in this market by the adoption In this market by the adoption of more DIY as well as the existing professional security  We definitely see today that the DIY security market is burgeoning and we see a lot of the activity and a lot of new brands that are addressing this market initiative and there is also  of course  the professional side which is handled by a fairly stable and significant service provider such as ADT  From the expectations point of view  I would say that it is still too early to say what the impact would be  but we definitely have expectations to see that being a driver in our SmartHome revenues this year  As you could understand both from CES as well as from the prepared comments that  each system is shipping with numerous ULE chipsets that are basically existing in almost every sensor  as well as in many of the sensors at SmartVoice capabilities  So  the dollar content here is fairly rich and we do expect also to see the volumes  This product is now hitting retail and we will  of course  monitor it very closely and then try to provide you with as much information as we can  but in addition  we are also hopeful that we will see following the bellwether type of service provider that has chosen this solution for the DIY  that there will be also further opportunities to penetrate also the professional side as well as the ability to engage and leverage what we have done so far and what we can provide this market with this natural support for two way voice  voice activation  a lot of AI capabilities on the edge  we believe that this will be very highly applicable to many other participants in this market and this is definitely part of our operating plan for the next two years  So  we are very excited about the momentum and I think that you ve seen a lot of that at CES Matt Ramsay    Cowen    AnalystThanks  Ofer  for all the detail there  As my follow up  Dror  I wanted to ask about gross margin  obviously  mix helps  but I remember when we were having the conversation of how to get the Company out of the low 40s and now you re in the low 50s  So  well done on that front  I wonder if you could give us some commentary going forward how you think margins might trend and maybe remind us of the collection of your growth businesses  how far above the DECT business are those  just a separation of gross margin there on mix would be helpful  Thank you Dror Levy    Corporate Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  sure  Thanks for the question  Matt  So  first of all as you saw also  when you look into the first quarter of 2020  we already see the midpoint is at 51   that is better than we were in average in  19  So  we are already looking to improve margin and we believe that when we look throughout the year  we can even improve this number to maybe something which is like closer to 51   52   Overall as you rightly indicated  the two factors  The first  this is like the mix of the products were revenues and I would say  like  Unified Communications  SmartVoice and also SmartHome tend to have better gross margin  In the cordless as we see that from year to year and this is also something that is demonstrated in our presentation  One  we see that the proportion of these growth initiatives increase  we also    the margins went up into  say  from 40  something to about 50   This is one thing The other thing that we expect to see in 2020 is growth revenue  So  a portion of our gross margin  all of the cost of goods is also fixed and once revenue grow  this proportion of the fixed expenses decreases  So  we also expect this to have some impact on improvement on gross margins in the first quarter and also throughout the year  These are I would say the two main factors  the mix and the level of revenues Matt Ramsay    Cowen    AnalystThanks again  guys  Appreciate it OperatorThank you  And your next question comes from the line of Jaeson Schmidt of Lake Street  Please go ahead  your line is open Jaeson Schmidt    Lake Street    AnalystHey guys  thanks for taking my questions  Just want to start on the Unified Communications segment  I know excess inventory in the channel really impacted 2019  Do you think that inventory is now cleared out though Ofer Elyakim    Chief Executive OfficerHi  Jaeson  So  if I understood correctly  your question was on the excess inventory that we saw early last year or even fourth quarter of 2018  whether this has cleared or not  So  based on our understanding about the market dynamics  2019 as a calendar year was quite challenging for this category as you accurately mentioned  we started the year with this pile of inventory that originated from the trade war concerns and the need to perhaps get goods outside of China and have them offshore so that they won t be subject to any future tariffs  And then  during the year these concerns continued and actually in October  the tariffs were supposed to hit this category  And at the end of the day  there was a deal that was signed  so in a way these never tariffs never really took place  but we also saw during 2019  a much slower IT spending that also hit this category and in a way slowed down the depletion of that inventory From where we are today  and again  it s not that we have very clear visibility into the channel inventory because this market has multiple layers till you actually reach the end customer unlike retail  We are of the belief and based on our check that the levels of inventories are much  much lower than where they were when we started last year  meaning inventories are much  much closer to normal levels  And so right now  we don t see inventories or excess inventories as an issue for the execution during this year and we believe that with the good pipeline of new products that are now in mass production  we are well positioned for revenue growth this year and that new design win that was prolonged into very late last year is now fully ramped up and in mass production  and that basically builds a lot of confidence in our ability to actually mitigate if there will be any weakness with growth in this category throughout 2020 And I think that during this year  we are very hopeful that we ll be able to secure even more lucrative sockets that will  in a way  fuel up our expectations and our ability to outperform mostly in the next couple of years Jaeson Schmidt    Lake Street    AnalystOkay  that s very helpful  And then  just as a follow up  I think last quarter  non smartphone applications within SmartVoice was over 70   curious what it was in Q4 and if you expect that composition to remain relatively stable in 2020 Ofer Elyakim    Chief Executive OfficerYes  So  with respect to the SmartVoice product composition  smartphone versus the non smartphone categories  I believe that for the year  for 2019  it was roughly a 25  smartphone and 75  non smartphone  and actually  the 75  was quite evenly allocated toward tablets  cameras and entertainment vis a via the TVs  remote controls  and the over the top products And if I look at Q4  I would tend to assume that it was shy of 20  to smartphones and about 80  for non smartphones  And smartphones will fluctuate depending on their launch date and usually the life cycle is fairly short per model  So  I think there will be    there will continue to be fluctuations also this year  but I would assume that it will be about a 20 80 split in favor of the non smartphone side  There  we believe that we are actually building a lot of franchise businesses  As you saw for instance in the entertainment side  as well as on the camera front  and the tablet side  we believe there is a lot of value and a lot of ability to grow and to see many more products incorporating these capabilities  And I think that the next pillar of this growth over the next three years  a lot of which will be around the AI  so audio analytics or audio AI on the edge  and I think there will be a lot more value that will be driven there  And on the smartphone front  I believe that you know audio analytics and the capability to replace a lot of sensing elements inside the phone with the acoustics  this will be a major value proposition that will be well beyond whatever you can do with Wake on Voice and always listening element  the ability to do that at ultra low power  the ability to create a lot more value while supporting all of the new requirements for smartphones of    and edgeless screen and the lack of ability to install any hardware on the front of the device itself  So with that  we believe that our SmartVoice franchise will continue to play a key role in our growth going forward Jaeson Schmidt    Lake Street    AnalystOkay  thanks a lot OperatorThank you  And your next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson of Dougherty   Company  Please go ahead Charlie Anderson    Dougherty   Company    AnalystYeah  thanks for taking my questions  A couple of ones on the guidance real quick  It looks like based on how much growth initiatives will be as a percent of revenue that cordless will actually be up both sequentially and year over year  So  I wonder if you could maybe touch on what s going on there and maybe how that impacts the rest of the year if that s up And then  secondarily on the R D  thank you for the commentary that it will go back to more normal levels rest of year  but just kind of curious what was the boost that created the larger level in Q1  Thanks Ofer Elyakim    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Charlie  So  maybe we ll start with the latter part of your question first  So  with respect to R D and OpEx as Dror commented  we believe that Q1 will be temporarily high  mainly because of certain tape out expenditures that we have and we are basically doing a tape out during this quarter and this will basically take the Q1 R D expenses to be higher than average  and they are expected to go back to normal  So  these are more on the NRE fronts  the non recurring type of expenses  So  this basically takes care of the OpEx and R D expenditures in Q1 And your other question had to do with the guidance for Q1 and where cordless is  So  cordless will fluctuate and again there is very little control that we have vis a vis the kind of the trend line there  I believe that we are modeling  and I think you guys should also model this decline in the 15  to 20   So  right now  we do not see a change in the level of declines  And yes  there will be fluctuations  As you can appreciate  last Q4 was artificially low in a way the recovery was slow  maybe  that s kind of the mismatch with respect to the year over year comps So  it s just like an easy comp in Q4 and also Q1  but I don t see a change in the trend  I think that we are going to see this year  It s further increase in the proportion between the growth initiatives that should trend into 70 30 type of a mix or maybe more than that  I think these are the trends that we are expected to see this year and there would be these kind of quarterly fluctuations that are very hard to  kind of  understand why in Q1 we actually see good momentum in cordless and good backlog  but I have no way    real explanations for that  I can only allude that what we believe is the 15  to 20  decline is the right way to model this going forward and growth across our growth initiatives for the year  and this is kind of how we see gross margin expansion  and we believe that the healthy trends should also continue in 2020 Charlie Anderson    Dougherty   Company    AnalystGreat  thank you so much for that color  And then  for my follow up on Unified Communications  I know you have the large win for this year  but it also sounded like you re optimistic of potentially a few others as well  I wonder if something has changed in the pattern in terms of replacement cycle there  in terms of you guys replacing incumbents  or is it just so happened that things are sort of lined up well in the past 12 months  Just any commentary on sort of the trajectory of that business over time  Thanks Ofer Elyakim    Chief Executive OfficerSure  So  on the UC front  I do believe that we have seen a lot of changes in the market  First of all  we ve seen the UCaaS or the    the SIP trunking or the Unified Communication as a Service becoming a major part of the market and we see a lot of disruption there with new service providers both for rich media and collaboration solution as well as endpoints  a lot of new endpoints elements from headsets and two other conferencing solutions for personal desktop  in home conferencing etc So there is  I think  a lot of investment and change that is driving the market and perhaps also creating some opportunities for companies like us that have been investing in this market and today have the most comprehensive product portfolio and technologies that  in a way  meet all of those requirements and I think that we are really today  the one stop shop for this market  for any vendor that is looking for a high quality  high performing solution  So  what we are doing is in way a making sure that we re supporting our partners  our customers in this domain and enabling them to upgrade and build new capabilities  better voice quality  better video quality across the solutions  And as we ve seen  this has been a long type    a long tail type of a market where design and refreshes tend to happen once every couple of years and we ve waited patiently and hopefully a lot of that will pay off for us in the near future  So we re  I would say  very optimistic and we believe that we have all the right capabilities and merits to win the sockets that will be available for refresh Charlie Anderson    Dougherty   Company    AnalystGreat  thank you so much OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Your next question comes from the line of Raji Gill of Needham   Company  Please go ahead  Raji  your line is open  Please can you check you re not on mute  Okay  Moving on to your next question from the line of Suji Desilva of Roth Capital  Please go ahead Suji Desilva    ROTH Capital    AnalystHi  Ofer  Hi  Dror  Hopefully you can hear me  The non smartphone SmartVoice  can you rank order the Top 2 or Top 3 revenue contributors you expect in that segment in 2020 and which ones are going to be growing the fastest  Indecipherable  Ofer Elyakim    Chief Executive OfficerHi  Suji  I think the question was around the main contributors in the SmartVoice segment  right Suji Desilva    ROTH Capital    AnalystRight  outside smartphones  yeah Ofer Elyakim    Chief Executive OfficerSmartVoice outside smartphones  Yes  if you take the  19 3 million that we generated in 2019  about 25  of that was smartphones  So  75  was non smartphone  And in these sockets  in a way  we have three key franchises  One is the entertainment side which includes TVs  remote controls  This is close to 25   a little bit shy of 25  of revenues  Tablets are around 20  of those  19 3 million  maybe OperatorA little bit ahead of that  Cameras are about 25  and then we have other IoT  the other IoT category that will include smart speakers and the hearables  etc  I think that when we look at 2020  we do expect hearables and wearables to become more    a meaningful part of that business and to start generating revenues there as well and that we hope to make it one of the  kind of  the key five categories  including smartphones  entertainment  tablets and cameras  So  I would say these are kind of the five categories today we re focusing on  Our roadmap is targeted to solve a lot of future issues and provide a lot of capabilities and value added solutions as we discussed in terms of AI on the edge  the ability to really drop the power consumption considerably while elevating the performance  the ability to conduct far field in very high quality using battery powered device  the ability to run a lot of machine learning classifier in the same time  on chip  on a battery operated device  So all of that  I think  should bode very well for each of these five key categories that we re focusing on today  So  I hope I answered your questions  Suji Suji Desilva    ROTH Capital    AnalystYou did  Ofer  Thank you  And then  the inclusion of AI as a feature there and AI on the edge  that kind of upgrade if you would  is that an incremental revenue or ASP opportunity  Is that just the kind of feature upgrade that keeps you in these platforms and when does that layer in or is that really already being used by the customers Ofer Elyakim    Chief Executive OfficerYes  So first of all  it does basically increase the content  So  it does raise the ASP for the devices that we we re in  I think that also whenever there is a dilemma between we re just running software versus running it on a dedicated ultra low power machine learning type of a chip  then the more capabilities such chip can provide  the higher the likelihood of the selection of a dedicated processor just for that versus running software on the AP  And today  we do have  and we are running these AI on the edge capabilities  the ability to do a sound event detection and audio analytics are running today in production on our chipset Suji Desilva    ROTH Capital    AnalystOkay  great  All right  thanks guys OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And your next question comes from the line of Ari Shusterman of Needham  Please go ahead Ari Shusterman    Needham    AnalystHey  guys  Good job on the quarter  So this is Ari taking the question for Raji Gill  And my first question is about your Unified Communications business  Can you talk about where you re seeing the business go this year and a bit about on design win pipeline in this business  Thank you Ofer Elyakim    Chief Executive OfficerHi  Ari  and then thanks for the question  So  in the Unified Communication business for this year  I believe that we are optimistic that we are going to outperform this year  I think  we did see the shortfall that we experienced in 2019 due to the trade war as well as the lower demand  mainly related to business IT spending  We believe that today with the additional wins  with the additional products that we re shipping  we are well positioned to be able to generate a nice revenue growth from the UC product segment  I think that when addressing some of the comments that were made earlier  we believe that the inventory levels today are at closer to normal levels versus the significant or excess inventories that we saw just the year ago So  by looking at all the fronts  we do hope and believe that we are positioned well for outperformance and revenue growth in this business  mainly coming from our ability to shift and win a lot of new products that are shipping this year that were not in last year  So  just these are creating the revenue growth for us and I believe that they will be able to absorb even if there will be certain hiccups  which right now we don t anticipate  but we believe that the traction and our ability to generate revenue growth in UC this year  the chances are very  very good  We re very optimistic Ari Shusterman    Needham    AnalystYeah  And I had a follow up I wanted to ask if there are any new markets or verticals that you plan to target in the future that you believe will be beneficial to further growth and margin expansion whether that s through M A or through organic means targeting new verticals   Ofer Elyakim    Chief Executive OfficerAri  I m sorry  but we could not    we have some problems hearing you well  So  can you repeat the question please Ari Shusterman    Needham    AnalystOkay  Yeah  So  I was just asking if there are any new markets or verticals that you plan to target in the future that would be beneficial to growth and margins Ofer Elyakim    Chief Executive OfficerI think that    from new markets    new market penetration  I believe that today  we are focusing on the three segments of SmartHome with everything that comes behind    under this umbrella  IoT  consumer  service provider  professional  as well as industrial  Unified Communication which is the professional business market  SmartVoice  which also includes a broad array of many different consumer electronic products  We mentioned  I think  and also demonstrated a lot of capabilities around hearables at CES  which you saw from glasses to headsets  and I believe that this will be  as a product category  I think this product category will hold a lot of potential growth and the need to incorporate a lot more technology in order to create more differentiation in the market and I believe that DSP Group is well equipped with very relevant technology to meet the market requirements  We are serving for many years the markets of low power  voice  the ability to do low power processing of value added  to do sensing capabilities  So  if you re asking about a new product category  yes  that s definitely hearables does look as a promising new product category for us and we believe that we will be able to serve it with the several of the new products that we have launched that you ve seen at CES OperatorThank you  There are no further question at this time  I would now like to hand the call back over to Tali Chen Tali Chen
