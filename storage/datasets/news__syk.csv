171835,393351,SYK,Thailand to acquire 120 U S  armored vehicles,news,"BANGKOK  Reuters    Thailand s military plans to acquire 120 American made armored vehicles by 2020  with the first batch of 10 arriving next month  a Thai defense ministry source told Reuters on Wednesday 
The United States curbed military aid to Thailand following a 2014 army coup  but ties are improving after disputed elections this year that officially restored civilian rule under a government led by former junta leader Prayuth Chan ocha 
Army chief General Apirat Kongsompong told reporters that Thailand would receive 70 U S  made armored infantry carrier vehicles by the end of the year and 50 more next year  but did not give the value of the deal 
 The first delivery will consist of 10 vehicles and by the end of the year there will be 70 vehicles   Apirat said 
 There will be 50 vehicle in the next lot  
He said the armored vehicles would be deployed at a base in Chachoengsao  south of the capital of Bangkok 
U S  embassy officials were not immediately available to comment on the army chief s remarks 
A defense ministry source told Reuters that Thailand paid for 47 vehicles and the U S  would supply 23 free in this year s purchase  while 50 more will be bought next year  The U S  will also help the Thai army in the maintenance of the vehicles 
The source declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media 
In July  the U S  State Department said it had approved a government to government Foreign Military Sales deal for 60  Stryker   NYSE SYK  armored vehicles and equipment  at an estimated cost of  175 million

171838,393354,SYK,Wall Street hits record high on energy  tech boost,news,"By Arjun Panchadar
 Reuters    Gains in technology and energy shares pushed Wall Street s three main indexes to record highs on Monday  as hopes of a U S  China trade deal and an improving domestic economy boosted risk appetite 
Washington and Beijing said on Friday they had made progress in defusing an economically damaging trade war  with U S  officials indicating that a deal could be signed this month 
Adding to the optimism  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Sunday licenses for U S  companies to sell components to China s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd would come  very shortly  
Eight of the 11 major S P 500 sectors were higher  with the energy shares  SPNY  gaining the most on the back of higher oil prices  The sector along with technology shares  SPLRCT  provided the biggest boost to the benchmark index 
Helping the tech sector was a rally in trade sensitive chip stocks  which also drove the Philadelphia Semiconductor index  SOX  to a record high 
 Signing these deals take time  All that is needed for markets to be happy right now is for an agreement to be announced   said Rick Meckler  partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon  New Jersey 
 The earnings period was certainly enough to support current stock prices  It wasn t good enough to lead stocks higher but not bad enough for them to go any lower   he added 
The third quarter earnings season has been fairly upbeat  with 76  of the 360 S P 500 companies that have reported results so far beating profit expectations  according to Refinitiv data 
Last week s interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve  growing expectations of a trade deal and a better than feared October jobs growth report have been the main catalysts of the recent rally 
A report on Monday  however  showed new orders for U S  made goods fell more than expected in September and business spending on equipment was slightly weaker than initially thought  suggesting that manufacturing remains soft amid the ongoing trade war 
At 11 21 a m  ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  was up 136 74 points  or 0 50   at 27 484 10  the S P 500  SPX  was up 14 22 points  or 0 46   at 3 081 13 and the Nasdaq Composite  IXIC  was up 42 34 points  or 0 50   at 8 428 74 
The biggest drag on the blue chip Dow Jones index was a 2 6  drop in shares of McDonald s Corp  N MCD  after the fast food giant dismissed Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook over a recent consensual relationship with an employee  which the board determined violated company policy 
 Under Armour  Inc  N UAA  fell 15 4  as it lowered its full year revenue forecast for a second straight time  a day after it confirmed a federal probe related to its accounting practices

Participants  Prepared Remarks   OperatorWelcome to the fourth quarter 2019 Stryker earnings call  My name is David  and I will be your operator for today s call   Operator instructions  This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes  Before we begin  I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward looking statements  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company s most recent filings with the SEC  Also  the discussions will include certain non GAAP financial measures  Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today s press release that is an exhibit to Stryker s current report on Form 8 K filed today with the SEC  I will now turn the call over to Mr  Kevin Lobo  chairman and chief executive officer  You may proceed  sir Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Welcome to Stryker s fourth quarter earnings call  Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein  Stryker s CFO  and Katherine Owen  VP of strategy and investor relations  For today s call  I will provide opening comments followed by Katherine with an update on Mako  Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results  before we open the call to Q A  We finished 2019 on a particularly strong note with Q4 organic sales growth of 8  despite notably difficult year over year comparisons  This performance help propel full year organic revenue growth to 8 1   topping the high end of our most recently raised target of seven and a half percent to eight percent  2019 marks the seventh consecutive year of delivering accelerating organic sales growth which has consistently been at the high end of med tech  In 2013 and 2014  we grew in the fives organically  15 and  16  we grew in the sixes  And  17 and  18  it was in the sevens  Also this past year marks our 40th consecutive year of sales growth since Stryker went public in 1979  The performance in 2019 was balanced across divisions and geographies  reflecting the durability of our business model  Turning to the results by our three segments  Q4 was led by over 12  organic sales growth for neurotechnology and spine  with our neurotechnology businesses growing in the high teens  Orthopedics posted a 7 3  organic sales increase in the quarter  powered by impressive double digit growth in knees  Our orthopedics performance continues to reflect meaningful share gains fueled by Mako and our 3D printed implants  As Katherine will detail in her comments  Q4 delivered the strongest robot quarter since the launch of Mako  We finished the year with a healthy order book  demonstrating the commercial and clinical success of this highly differentiated technology  Med surg was up roughly 7  organically in the quarter  as endoscopy led the way  growing 10   All other divisions achieved mid single digit gains despite challenging comparisons  Med surg continues to be a strong and consistent grower year in and year out  International organic growth was 7 6  in Q4  and for the full year  matched the U S  growth rate of 8 1   Emerging markets led the way with strong double digit gains in Q4 and the full year  While it has taken some time  2019 was an excellent year in emerging markets and we are well positioned to continue this momentum into the future  Europe once again registered full year organic sales gains in high single digits as we make progress toward achieving similar market share levels  as we have in other developed market regions  This performance was well above the market and has significant runway as we continue to drive sales force specialization  Australia and New Zealand also had a strong Q4 across its portfolio  In the past years  we have strengthened our international businesses and have taken key steps to strengthen category leadership across our portfolio  The pending addition of right medical later in 2020 will address our last meaningful category leadership gap  upper extremities  We continue to make investments in our sales  marketing  and R D teams around the globe in order to support our goal of consistently growing at the high end of med tech  but with our focus on our cost transformation for growth initiatives  we are also delivering leverage  Op margin expanded roughly 40 basis points in the year which included absorbing approximately 30 bps of dilution related to acquisitions  We exited 2019 with nearly  15 billion in global sales and have demonstrated the ability to continue to drive high growth despite our larger size  We have expanded our offering through internal investments and acquisitions  and believe we are well positioned to achieve continuous success for our customers  employees and shareholders  Looking at 2020  we are on track to continue to achieve strong organic sales growth and leveraged earnings  In closing  the tremendous efforts of our 40 000 employees around the globe enabled us to once again achieve strong results and deliver on our promise to our customers and patients to make healthcare better  With that  I will now turn the call over to Katherine  Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations Thanks  Kevin  My update today will focus on Mako and the key data points that have allowed you to track our success in executing on our orthopedic robotics strategy  In Q4  we sold 89 Mako robots globally versus 54 in the comparable quarter a year ago  This includes 63 in the U S  in Q4  Globally  our installed base of robots is approximately 860  with close to 700 in the U S  In January  we received Japanese approval for the Mako partial knee indication  adding to the indications for the total knee and total hip procedures  We now have nine Mako robots in Japan and continue to believe this represents a significant market opportunity  Looking at U S  procedures  In Q4  Mako procedures increased nearly 50  to 36 600  bringing the full year total to over 114 000  Total knee procedures posted a roughly 59  increase in Q4 to approximately 24 000  while full year Mako knee procedure increased roughly 66   topping 75 000  Demand for Mako is being driven by the myriad of unique benefits of our robotic technology  multiple reconstructive applications and the ability to perform a cement less knee  Mako smart robotics have enabled surgeons to achieve a know more so as to cut less approach to joint replacement  which is driving improved outcomes for patients  These capabilities are clearly helping to increase robotic utilization rates  which achieved strong double digit growth  both year over year and sequentially  Lastly  it s worth noting that demand for our 3D printed cement less knees continues to climb  exiting the year at over 36  of our U S  knee procedures  We also continue to see growing demand for the Mako hip application  underscored by over 40  growth in hip procedures on Mako in 2019  Please note that going forward  we will no longer be providing quarterly Mako results  Since acquiring the company in early 2014  we have provided detailed Mako data for 23 consecutive quarters in order to allow investors to accurately track the performance of this differentiated robotic technology  As we are now six years since the acquisition and nearly five years since the initial launch of the total knee indication  we believe we have validated the strategic rationale and competitive advantage of Mako as witnessed by the roughly 600 basis points of U S  knee market share that we have gained since 2013  Going forward  we continue to expect to take meaningful market share in Knee  owing to Mako  along with our differentiated portfolio of knee products  including our 3D printed implants  We will continue to report on a combined basis both manual and Mako implanted knees in our knee line  while robot sales will be reported in other orthopedics to allow for accurate tracking of our Knee revenue  Looking at 2020  our Mako order book remains robust and supports our expectation for continued share gains in both hips and knees  With that  I ll now turn the call over to Glenn Glenn Boehnlein    Chief Financial Officer Thanks  Katherine  Today  I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers  Our detailed financial results have been provided in today s press release  Our organic sales growth was 8  in the quarter  As a reminder  this quarter included the same number of selling days as Q4 2018  Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable  0 6  from the prior year  while foreign currency had an unfavorable 0 6  impact on sales  For the quarter  U S  sales continue to demonstrate strong momentum with organic growth of 8 2   reflecting solid performance across our portfolio  International sales grew 7 6  organically  which was balanced across our international regions  Organic sales growth for the year was 8 1   which was slightly above our most recently raised full year guidance of 7 58   U S  international organic growth was also 8 1   2019 had one additional selling day  compared to 2018  And for the year  price had an unfavorable impact of 0 9  on sales  Our adjusted quarterly EPS of  2 49 increased 14 2  from the prior year  reflecting strong drop through on sales growth combined with good operating expense control  Our fourth quarter EPS was negatively impacted by  0 02 from foreign currency  which was in line with our expectations  Our full year EPS was  8 26 with growth of 13   reflecting strong sales growth and disciplined leverage  Now  I will provide some highlights around our segment performance  orthopedics delivered constant currency and organic growth of 7 3   including organic growth of 7 2  in the U S   highlighted by U S  knee growth of 10 5   This performance reflects strong demand for our Mako TKA knee platform  3D printed products  Trident 2 hip implants and continued ramping of our T2 alpha nailing system  Internationally  orthopedics delivered organic growth of 7 6   which reflects strong performance in Australia  Canada and Europe  Med surg continued to have strong growth across all businesses in the quarter with constant currency growth of 7 4  and organic gains of 6 8   which included an 8  increase in the U S  Instruments had U S  organic sales growth of 4 1   reflecting a strong prior year comparable  Full year U S  organic growth for instruments was 10 2   In the quarter  sales growth was driven by gains in waste management  steri shield and smoke evacuation  Endoscopy delivered U S  organic sales growth of 15 4   Endoscopy had strong performances across many product lines  highlighted by double digit growth in its video products  including the 1688 camera and accessories  insufflator  suction irrigation and booms and lights businesses  The medical division had U S  organic growth of 5 7   reflecting solid performance in its bed  including services and structure businesses  Internationally  med surg had organic sales growth of 2 4   reflecting strong comparable across most geographies  Neurotechnology and spine had constant currency growth of 18 2  and organic growth of 12 5  as K2M anniversary ed during the quarter  This growth reflects strong performance within our neurotech product lines  Our U S  neurotech business posted organic growth of 16 5  for the quarter  driven by strong demand for our hemorrhagic  ischemic stroke and our neuro powered instruments products  including Sonopet IQ  During the quarter  we continue to be ahead of our K2M cost integration plan and begin to see good momentum related to our sales integration efforts  For the quarter  we delivered an increase in sequential quarterly growth and on a full year pro forma basis  delivered low single digit increase across our combined worldwide spine business  Internationally  neurotechnology and spine had organic growth of 16 6   This performance was driven by strong demand in Europe and emerging markets  Now  I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter  our adjusted gross margin of 66 3  was favorable  approximately 60 basis points from the prior year quarter  Compared to the prior year quarter  gross margin expansion was favorably impacted by acquisitions and foreign exchange  which were partially offset by price and business mix  For the full year  our adjusted gross margin of 65 9  was unfavorable  approximately 20 basis points from the prior year  Compared to the prior year  gross margin expansion was favorably impacted by acquisitions  which were offset by price  foreign exchange and business mix  Adjusted R D spending was 5 6  of sales  which was 10 basis points lower than prior year quarter  For the full year  adjusted R D spending was 6 1  of sales  Our adjusted SG A was 32 3  of sales  which was favorable to the prior year quarter by 10 basis points  For the full year  our adjusted SG A was 33 5  of sales  which was favorable to the prior year by approximately 40 basis points  For both the quarter and the year  this reflects continued focus on operating expense improvements through our cost transformation for growth program  including key projects focused on indirect purchasing and shared services  This is offset by the negative impact of acquisitions and continued planned investments in other CTG program efforts like our ERP project  In summary  for the quarter  our adjusted operating margin was 28 3  of sales  which was 80 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter  Our full year operating margin of 26 3  was up 40 basis points favorable from the prior year  delivering on our commitment of 30 to 50 basis points op margin expansion  Our operating margin primarily reflects good leverage and continued operational savings offset by investments and acquisitions  the latter of which had approximately 30 basis points negative impact for the year  Next  regarding other income and expense  our expenses decreased from prior year quarter primarily due to favorable interest rates  Our fourth quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 16 3   Our full year effective tax rate was 15 8   These rates reflect a higher operating tax rate reduced primarily by the benefit related to stock compensation expenses  For 2020  we expect full year adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 15 5 to 16 5   Focusing on the balance sheet  we continue to maintain a strong position with 4 4 billion of cash and marketable securities  which includes the proceeds from our EUR 2 4 billion offering completed in December to partially fund the announced right medical acquisition  Including this funding  total debt on the balance sheet was 11 1 billion  Turning to cash flow  Our year to date cash from operations was approximately 2 2 billion  This reflects increased adjusted earnings  which are somewhat offset by increases in working capital and increased acquisition integration and restructuring spending  Turning to cash flow for 2020  we will not be repurchasing any shares  and we anticipate that capital expenditures will be flat year over year at 600 to 700 million  And now  I will provide 2020 guidance on a stand alone basis and further guidance  including right medical  Based on our momentum from 2019 and assessment of the current economic and market conditions  we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 6 5 to 7 5 for 2020  There is one additional selling day in 2020  compared to 2019  As you update your quarterly models  please note that Q1 has the additional selling day  and Q2  Q3 and Q4 have the same number of selling days  If foreign exchange rates hold near their current levels  we anticipate sales and EPS will be nominally impacted for the first quarter and full year  We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions of 1  to 1 5   which is fairly consistent with the pricing environment experienced in 2019  In addition  we expect to continue to deliver on our full year commitment to expand operating margin  Including the negative impact of closed acquisitions  we anticipate expansion of 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin in 2020  Finally  for 2020  we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of 9 to 9 20 for the full year  including approximately 2 0 5 and 2 10 for the first quarter  As it relates to right medical acquisition  we reiterate our previous guidance  Assuming an end of Q3 2020 closing  we expect the transition    transaction to be neutral to our 2020 EPS  For the full year 2020  we would not deliver on 30 to 50 basis points op margin expansion on a combined basis  However  we would still expect to deliver positive operating margin expansion  And now  I will open up the call for Q and A  Questions   Answers  OperatorThank you  We will now begin the question and answer session   Operator instructions  Your first call comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America  You may proceed Bob Hopkins    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Thank you  and good afternoon  My first question is for Kevin  I was wondering if I could get your perspective on the 2020 guide  You know  last year  obviously  you guided a six and a half to seven and a half  and ended up delivering over 8  This year  you re once again guiding to six and a half to seven and a half  Is there anything you re going to do different  Kevin  with your outlook for 2020 versus 2019  either from a macro market perspective or kind of a Stryker specific perspective Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  Thanks  Bob  I would say  as I sit here today  I feel very similar to how I felt at the beginning of last year   a really nice balance of headwinds and tailwinds  good operating performance across our businesses and our regions  But it s early in the year  and so we re giving a guidance that we feel very confident being able to hit  If things play out the way they did in 2019  obviously  there could be a scenario where things would improve  but we really had a great year across many areas in 2019 and not a lot of turbulence in the macroeconomic environment Bob Hopkins    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst OK  that s fair  And then I was wondering if you could just quickly comment on a couple of other quick things  First  from a pipeline perspective  are you guys still expecting a new bed and new physio launch sometime in 2020  And then  I know this is a tiny business for you  but I d love to get your perspective on coronavirus  and could that impact procedures in China Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK  Bob  I ll take the first part  just talking about some of the positives that we see  The pipelines are very strong across from all of Stryker  Robotic surgery adoption  as you saw with the big fourth quarter  continues to be a tailwind for us both in hips and knees  as well as Mako  We have year two of our camera launch in endoscopy  Our aspiration business in neurovascular will be another tailwind  We have acquisitions that are going to be turning organic  So  we have a whole list of those kind of tailwinds  And then across medical  there s a number of new products that we ll be launching in acute  emergency care and sage Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations Yeah  And Bob  maybe I ll just hop on to that  Really too early to get into details about coronaviruses  You probably know our exposure in emerging markets is low  and in China  it s even lower  It s low single digits  And that s one of the variables we often contemplate when we set out a range  So  at this point  recognizing it s early  no comments  And just building on Kevin s comments  as he mentioned  medical does have a really healthy pipeline of products coming  including a bed  And I should probably also note though  life pack  which is one of the physio products  as a PMA product  that is no longer expected to be launched this year  Again  that s    overall  there s a lot of products  so it s not impactful from a revenue standpoint  but that will not be launched this year OperatorYour next call comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley  You may proceed David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Good afternoon  Congrats on a nice quarter  Just two questions for me  one on sales and one on margins  So  Kevin  two businesses stuck out this particular quarter  knees and neuro  So just sort of curious  what drove those very significant Mako placements  And in any way  was there a change in sales strategy from capital to rental  And then in neuro  I m just curious what the drivers were in the fourth quarter  We ve sort of waited for that pipeline to come through  We re expecting a big year in 2020  Was the fourth quarter kind of the first beginning of that  And how you re thinking about neuro for next year  And then I had a quick follow up on earnings Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  So starting with Mako  This is just a continuation of the great success we ve been having  There was no new strategy  There s no change in the way we price Mako  We ve always been flexible in terms of different approaches to financing  whether it s leasing  whether it s rentals  And so  the mix didn t change dramatically  maybe a little bit more rentals but very  very similar to what we ve had in the past  I think it s just there s a growing realization that technology is here to stay  and that adoption rate  we expect to continue to increase in the future Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations Yeah  And David  on the neuro  it was really across the board  both geographically  strong double digit growth in the U S   in Europe and Canada  as well as other regions outside of time  And then the various business segments all had really healthy double digit growth  whether you re looking at hemorrhagic or ischemic  and that really is across the board  We launched some new products last year  a new flow diverter outside the U S  And part of our bullishness heading into this year is tied to the planned    having the full portfolio around the end of Q1 of our aspiration products  including the larger bore 074  So that should be a nice new product entry for us into that segment of the market  So  it was very balanced  both geographically and across the product portfolio David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    Analyst OK  And then just a quick one on earnings  You know  Kevin  investors are very focused on organic acceleration  and this was yet another year in 2019 of acceleration over  18  But what s interesting is this is the second consecutive year of earnings acceleration  which I think some investors have missed  So  I think you re right in the associated dilution has concerned investors on your opportunity for improving leverage or earnings growth for the company  So  your conviction in the minimum 9  is clear  but the question really is  can you do better  And is right integration going to delay your cost transformation initiatives  Thanks so much Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  Thanks  David  So four years ago  we gave 9  as a floor  And since then  we ve delivered 12 to 13  each of the four years  So  we saw it as a floor  and you can see we ve clearly surpassed the floor by a wide margin  We really believe we have our cost transformation for growth firing  and we re going to continue to be able to deliver very strong earnings  The point on op margin is obviously just a math issue  With the amount of growth that were coming in and the profile of their P L  it will take us time to work through the synergies that we need to work through for    to get back on to an op margin expansion  But as you heard from Glenn  we expect to still deliver positive op margin in 2020 OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse  Please go ahead  You may proceed Matt Miksic    Credit Suisse    Analyst Hi  Thanks so much for taking the question  and congrats on these really strong numbers  So  Kevin  I wanted to ask if you could  maybe Katherine  talk a little bit about  you know  where we should think about the sort of progress or the timing cadence around the upper extremities  given the  you know  that that is an important part of this right medical acquisition  It certainly fits well with the Mako platform  Maybe talk about how that deal fits and what it can do to maybe accelerate that program  And then I had just one follow up Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations Yeah  So  as we ve talked about on prior calls  we re continuing to prioritize in terms of next indications in spine and upper extremities  For Mako  we have independent R D teams working in collaboration with the Mako robotics team on those  It s too early to get into the time line  I think what right will do for us  as we ve said before  significantly bolsters our competitive position  so when we come to market  we will have a stronger portfolio of products  But it d be premature to comment beyond that in terms of timing around the robot launch for either of those additional indications Matt Miksic    Credit Suisse    Analyst Understood  And then maybe just a follow up on spine  What  if anything  if you can provide any color as to what you think has sort of gone well there  Obviously  you did a lot of things right  I think  But maybe where some of the challenges have been as things evolved last quarter or so and where in that portfolio do you think the integration is going really well  Any color you could provide would be helpful Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer This is Kevin  So certainly  we had some challenges early with the integration  with the overlapping sales forces and didn t do a lot of hiring  new products got delayed  The fourth quarter showed some real signs of positive momentum on the sales force side  clear targets  clear accountabilities  and then a number of new products being launched on our sales meeting  So very excited that we re sort of back on offense after going through the tricky parts of the integration  We were very aggressive on costs  and so those cost synergies were ahead  But now  I m looking forward to 2020 and in the future to seeing accelerated growth in our spine business  We re well positioned now  It was tough  certainly  in the first six months  but very encouraged by what I saw in the fourth quarter  and expect 2020 to accelerate OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank  You may proceed Pito Chickering    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Good afternoon  guys  Thanks for taking my questions  and really  really great quarter  So  digging into the spine question as well  Last quarter  we saw a demand supply imbalance coming from sort of K2M versus legacy spine  Can you give us a manufacturing update  Where are we on the supply versus demand at this point  and are there like any further tailwinds in the near term if demand remains at these levels going forward Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations Yeah  Thanks  Pito  I would say it s improved  and that s really the trajectory on spine  is there s still improvement to go  of course  because we still have legacy spine products in manufacturing that we re optimizing  But the fact that it is improving  you saw the sequential improvement  We feel great that we hit the revised target of low single digit spine growth  and we feel really confident that the trajectory will continue to improve to get us to that acceleration throughout 2020  And that part of that is having a better capability to meet the demand for the full portfolio of products Pito Chickering    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Great  And one margin question  So  as I m seeing that there s dilution from acquisitions in 2019  you guys have been very clear about  Going for 2020  how should we think about core Stryker delivering margin improvement with the organic revenue growth versus simply having less dilution to deal with in 2020 versus 2019 Glenn Boehnlein    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  I think on 2020  as we think about it and the way we ve always segmented and planned on it  even in spite of the right acquisition  is for the core business and maybe our smaller tuck in acquisitions that we would normally do in the course of 2020  we will still strive and we will still incentivize our people and our businesses to deliver the 30 to 50 basis points expansion  I think as Kevin explained  you know  just mathematically with what we ll average in on a combined basis at sales and at that op income line  we won t be able to hold 30 to 50 basis points expansion for 2020 when we close on right medical Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer But we do have continued dilution because of the mobius deal that we did at the end of the year and some other deals  maybe not to the same extent that we have this year  But we still do need to offset that dilution  and we are committed to continuing to deliver 30 to 50 in spite of that  And obviously  if dilution decreases  we expect to be at the higher end of that limit OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel  You may proceed Rick Wise    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Good afternoon  Hey  Kevin  Let me go back to Mako  and a couple of questions there  just particularly around Mako hip  You know  what s next there  Can you give us any color about drivers of  you know  adoption from here and your plans  And just help us appreciate some of the initiatives sort of ahead in 2020  Maybe  Katherine  you ll fill us in on the mix of Stryker accounts versus competitive  It s been 50 50  Does it continue at that kind of level Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure  I ll start off with Mako hip  Really excited about the progress  So  a lot of surgeons were initially interested in the knee  And then  as they got the experience with Mako  they start to look at hip  And once you try the hip application  it tends to be pretty sticky  We re very excited  In the second quarter of this year  we re going to be launching new software upgrade to our hip program  And that s going to be much more user friendly  The registration process and some of the software has been a little bit challenging from a change management standpoint  This is going to be much slicker and really exciting  Early feedback we ve had some surgeons has been very positive  So  I am bullish on continued expansion of Mako with hips Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations Yeah  And so  we ve seen very consistent hovering around that 55 to 60  of the robots we place are going into competitive accounts  and that was consistent again for the quarter and the year Rick Wise    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst OK  And just a follow up question  Kevin  you ve done amazing job in transforming Europe and had a great performance  It seems like there s a lot more to go based on your comments  And just at a high level  as we look ahead to 2020 and maybe beyond  you know  beyond some of your comments about spine  you feeling better  Are there other areas where you re turning special focus that we might imagine  you know  could  based on that focus  just like Europe  perform better as 2020 unfolds  or  you know  what are you less than satisfied with Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well  it was a terrific year  as you saw  overall  I would say that the emerging markets  this has been the best year we ve had since I ve been the CEO  very strong double digit growth  And to me  I would expect that that will continue hopefully for the next decade  We are so underrepresented there relative to our overall portfolio and market shares around the world  But I would say  hopefully  this is the first year of many years of very strong double digit growth in those markets  We ve made leadership changes  We struggled with emerging markets for the first four years or so  2018 was a good year  2019 was a great year  And that s the area that I think has the biggest upside in addition to Mako in both China and Japan  Japan now has all the applications approved on the robot  We re still waiting for the knee application to be approved in China  hope to have that sometime this year  But those will be very  very good markets for Mako as well OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan  You may proceed Robbie Marcus    J P  Morgan    Analyst Great  and congrats on a really nice quarter  Kevin  maybe first  I ll ask on the capex environment  What were you seeing exiting the year with business and consumer confidence rates so high  and what do you expect going into 2020 Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations Robbie  maybe I ll take that question  I would tell you based on our mix of capital  which runs a pretty big range from relatively lower ASP to obviously much bigger ticket items  the environment remains really healthy  We ve seen strong growth across the board for our capital businesses  And you know  Mako  I would tell you what we are seeing is while it s still a long selling cycle  we are seeing that kind of move up ahead of other capital requests in the queue with hospitals just given the growing demand and acceptance of robotics  So  we feel really good heading into this year in terms of the capital environment  particularly the environment  combined with the products that we re launching or continuing to build on prior launches Robbie Marcus    J P  Morgan    Analyst Great  And while there were a lot of great performances in the quarter  the two misses versus Street numbers that stood out were trauma and extremities and medical  I was just wondering if you could give a little more color on each of those and anything you saw in the quarter Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure  Starting off with medical  I mean  they had very  very significant comparisons if you look at last year s growth  And so  we re still very pleased with our medical business  And that has been a consistent performer  if you go back four  five years  a consistent grower  The sage and physio acquisitions have been terrific acquisitions for that business  So  I would say that s more of a comp issue and expect that to continue to be a strong performer  especially with a lot of new products coming in 2020  In trauma and extremities  again  we had a very strong year last year  So  a little bit of that was comp related  And we still believe that we have the leading market performer in trauma  It does vary sometimes from quarter to quarter  We ve seen that over the past two or three years  but the T2 alpha launch is starting to pick up steam  We also have a mini frag launch  which just occurred at the end of this year  which is pretty exciting  That s one of our soft spots in our portfolio  So we believe we re well positioned  and we expect to continue to grow above the market  It was a slight reduction versus what we ve experienced before but nothing that concerns me OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies  You may proceed Briana Warschun    Jefferies    Analyst This is Briana on for Raj  I just have a quick question on Mako  So  I m just trying to characterize these sites that are adopting Mako  Do you find any difference in sites that might have adopted some level of computer assisted navigation previously but not for robotics versus those that are mostly manual Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations Yeah  I don t think we have that level of granularity around  I would tell you we see across the board adoption by all types of customers  It can be high volume hospitals  It can be more rural hospitals  It really is wherever there s a surgeon champion  And increasingly  what we re seeing is increased demand given how long we are into the launch now  We re also continuing to see increase in the percent of hospitals that are now purchasing a second or additional robot  but I can t really tie it to navigation necessarily OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI  You may proceed Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    Analyst Hey  guys  Thanks for taking my question  and congrats on a nice print here  So  one housekeeping question here on the guidance  you know  below the line  You mentioned interest income came in above  I believe  The assumption for fiscal  20  Glenn  is that the new run rate now we re looking at  somewhere in 8 to 10 million per quarter on that line item Glenn Boehnlein    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  that would be  you know    let me go back  and I ll have one of our guys get back to you on that  I mean we basically will have more borrowings coming in if you think about what we re going to do for right medical  And so  if that closes in Q3  then that will obviously change that interest number Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    Analyst Gotcha  And then one on right medical  I know you won t comment on the timing  but the original deal model was no impact to EPS in fiscal  20 and  0 10 dilution in  21  Just given your cash balance  your free cash conversion  any change in your financing assumptions around the EPS contribution assumptions here on the deal Glenn Boehnlein    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Right  Right now  it s pretty early  And the guidance that we put out that you just mentioned is where we re at in terms of what we re willing to share at this point OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS  You may proceed Young Li    UBS    Analyst This is Young Li in for Matt  Maybe  first  on M A  After you address the last category leadership gap with right  what are your thoughts on expanding into additional verticals within med tech that you currently aren t in  And maybe just thoughts on M A for 2020 in general  How is the pipeline shaping up and views on valuation of targets Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  We continue to have a very strong pipeline  Obviously  with the size of the right medical deal  we re not going to be looking at targets of scale for the next year or two while we start to pay down that debt  but we will still keep the lights on in our business development engine  We still have significant opportunities to add to our portfolio  So  when I talked about closing the last major gap  it doesn t mean we don t have targets within all of our many businesses  Each business has business development people that are focused  and we continue to see attractive targets that can continue to add to our category leadership  But this was    if you think about five  six  seven years ago  sports medicine  spine and shoulder were the areas where we had the largest gap to category leadership  and we ve made huge progress in our sports medicine business  mostly organically but also with a series of tuck in deals  With K2M  we ve largely addressed our spine business  and then right medical addresses upper extremities  So those are the areas that we clearly were not in the top one  two or three in the category  and that will propel us into that category  But we don t really feel the need at this point to start to branch widely outside of the three segments  These are big segments  If you think about med surg  if you think about neurotech and spine and orthopedics  where there are still very  very active hunting grounds for acquisitions  But again  the target sizes will be smaller  at least for the next year or 2  while we digest this one Young Li    UBS    Analyst OK  That s very helpful  And I guess  just a follow up  The Mako international focus  pretty good quarter here  Can you maybe just talk about the opportunities in international  I know you highlighted Japan and China  maybe India longer term  And maybe at a high level  can you comment on utilization rates  U S  versus o U S  Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations No  we re not going to get into the latter part in terms of utilization rate because you saw we re seeing  across the board  a healthy increase  and that wouldn t be just in the U S  But the data we have tracked for you guys has been the U S   given that it was the largest segment of our Mako revenue right now  You re absolutely correct  There s significant opportunity outside the U S   markets like Japan  China  Latin America  We re selling robots  really  around the globe  Obviously  we re behind in certain markets versus others  I would say  near term  we re probably most excited about Japan now that we have all the indications  In China  once we get the knee indication  But there are a lot of healthy robot markets beyond the U S OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays  You may proceed Kristen Stewart    Barclays    Analyst Thanks for taking my question  and congratulations on a good quarter  Kevin  I just wanted to ask kind of a big picture question to you  and then I do have a follow up  If I look at the overall organic growth rate since you ve taken over  it s been this really impressive linear line up into the right  accelerating growth  really  each and every year  I m just curious on how you think about the growth profile of Stryker going forward  Should we continue to expect kind of this nice linear acceleration story  You know  going back to  I guess  one of the original questions  I think it was Bob who asked  Thinking about the guidance  I know you guys tend to give kind of conservative guidance at the onset of the year  I know you said last quarter you still felt very strongly  and you said it earlier  on this momentum  But should we just think about Stryker continuing to have this acceleration growth profile from here  or do you think that  you know  we should think about more of you being in a position to sustain kind of around the level of where we re at  And then we ll follow up Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Kristen  Obviously  you ve seen our focus has been on growth  We ve been very acquisitive  We ve focused on adding and splitting sales forces wherever possible  investing in R D at a healthy rate  which fuels the growth  And so  that s been our model  and that s continuing  And right medical  this pending acquisition  is another example where they re a very high growth business and a very large business  And so  that our actual model isn t changing  We continue to have the same offense  and we re growing big numbers on top of big numbers  And so that s what s been impressive  is for four years I ve been asked  you know  when is the growth going to start to slow down  And it hasn t  Now  can you take a line and draw a straight line forever  Probably not  We also have to look at the market  The market has been pretty healthy  We ve maintained our gap and maybe accelerated our gap versus the market in growth  But we think we have an offense in our operating model that s structured for high growth  The way we decentralized model  the dedicated sales  marketing  R D and business development in each division  we become a more global company  and that still has significant runway in emerging markets in areas like Europe  where we didn t have high growth  Year after year  we re growing in high single digits in Europe  which I think is rare  and that s not going to end anytime soon  So  I think we re structured to have high growth  you know  Putting a fine point on the actual number is difficult because you don t know what s happening in the macro environment  but I feel just as positive starting this year as I did at the beginning of last year Kristen Stewart    Barclays    Analyst OK  that s helpful  And then I was just curious  you guys made some changes  I guess  it was last summer to just move around some of the structure    reporting structure with spine and then neurotech as well to report up into orthopedics and med surg  Is that something that from an R D perspective or anything might have any implications from a growth perspective or anything like that  Maybe just talk through if there s anything there from also M A  if we should be thinking of it Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No  Sure  sure  That s just purely a reflection of the leadership changes  It s really a recognition of terrific performance by both Spencer Styles and Andy Pierce  These are two group presidents that are just shining  and so we ve given them additional businesses to manage  There is no change at the divisional level  So  the division presidents  who are also terrific  continue to run their business  But the change that we made was one level above that  how we aggregate the divisions  But the center of gravity of our company are the divisions  That s where the action happens in terms of R D  marketing  sales  So  don t read anything more into that other than it s a management structure change to give more businesses to Andy and Spence to manage directly  and it s a recognition of just how well they ve performed over time OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Matt O Brien with Piper Sandler  You may proceed Unknown speaker Hi  guys  This is Drew on for Matt  Thank you for taking the questions  I just have two questions here on Mako and  I guess  I ll ask both  I just want to follow up on the comment you made on the software update in hips there  Is that something that could kind of close the gap where you re actually placing the system organically for hip applications that is prior to knee  And then second question is  I guess  it seems like you guys have been talking about Knee being    or about cement less knee being a key growth driver for about two years now given integration with Mako  Just kind of trying to gauge what your feel of this as far as what any new  and product wise  especially with a larger competitor on the market  And then do you see any headwinds or tailwinds here as we think about 2020 Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK  There were a few questions in there  Let me start just with Mako and robotics in general  It s still early innings within orthopedics  And we see a huge runway ahead of us to continue to have a broad adoption of robotics  Cement less has been a steady grower  and we don t think that s going to slow down  It will continue  It probably won t have big step changes  It will be a steady gradual progression  And what we re seeing there are some new surgeons adopting cement less  but we re also seeing the surgeons that started with cement less  with  let s say  younger  healthier patients  now starting to realize that the benefits are so good that they re starting to put them in older patients  And even patients  let s say  whose bone quality may not be pristine but still adequate bone quality  So  you re seeing even surgeons that are using it who used to use it on a smaller percentage of the patients now seeing just how well it s performing using it on a larger percentage of their population  So  I think cement less will continue to run  and we re pretty excited about the potential for the future  And again  getting back to the technology  this has many  many years ahead of us  and we re very excited about the potential OperatorYour next call comes from the line of with Kaila Krum with SunTrust  You may proceed Kaila Krum    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst Thanks for taking our questions  And so  just one on robotics  and then another on trauma extremities  So  just to follow up on the health of the robotics business and just the strength of your order book there  Just kind of curious if you re really even seeing new competition in the market at this point  and I guess more importantly  how you re contemplating competition in 2020 Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations We re really continuing to focus on the strategy that s been under way for five years now as it relates to total knee  We have a very concerted effort of focusing on the organization  a capital sales force and a really unique robot with smart intelligence and the ability to really give surgeons some differentiation  and we have multiple indications across the joint replacement market  So  our focus is on the strategy that s been working  and that will continue to be the focus in 2020 Kaila Krum    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst Great  And then just early anecdotal feedback on the right medical deal from your sales team  And then just how you re modeling the trauma and extremities business leading into the deal closure  Are you assuming there s going to be maybe dislocation leading into the deal closure  or just how are you thinking about that business Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations Yeah  I apologize  I really can t get into any color there  I d refer you back to the comments we made at the time of the acquisition  We don t own the company  They re a publicly traded company  We re still competitors  so it would be inappropriate to say anything about that right now  We re obviously very excited about what it will do for our extremities portfolio  But beyond that  I would just refer you back to the comments that we made around assumptions tied to the synergies at the time that the deal was announced Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  but we still feel bullish about our own trauma business  We have new products that we re launching  We have a very strong brand  And the feedback we ve had from our sales force is  I would say  excitement  really  Excitement that we    that we re going to strengthen our position in extremities and become the really most attractive company for extremities  That s what our belief is  That s what we re telling our sales force  That s what we re hearing from them  So  there s always risks of deal    dislocation in every sales force that we have  But for the moment  it doesn t appear to be significant OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Craig Bijou with Cantor Fitzgerald  You may proceed Craig Bijou    Cantor Fitzgerald    Analyst Good afternoon  guys  Thanks for taking the questions  I just want to ask about the overall ortho and spine markets  Both seem pretty strong in the second half of  19  So  what do you see  Are you guys seeing any improvement in either of those broader markets  And then what are your expectations for those markets in 2020 Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frankly  the market seems very stable  and it s been pretty healthy for some time now  Not everybody has reported yet their fourth quarter  So  until we see the total numbers  we re not going to have a clear idea  But I would say the market is maybe modestly better  I think we said that at the beginning of the year  We thought it would be just a little bit better  but it s not that it s had a step change improvement  It s been a good  healthy market  We expect that it will continue to be a good healthy market Craig Bijou    Cantor Fitzgerald    Analyst Got it  And then just a follow up on Mako  In 2020  I mean  can we expect to see any clinical data  Or  I guess  what s the plan for the release of    or potential release of any clinical data during the year Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations Yeah  I m sure you know we always    we don t always have line of sight since we re not always the sponsor of the studies  But I would expect you ll continue to see data  Over what time frame or size of the study  that s harder to tell  It will be another focus of the academy meeting at the end of March  So  we will again have a booth tour  and we will be highlighting Mako and getting some insights around some of the new hip technology that Kevin referenced  But I would expect you re going to see continued data coming out  I just don t have specifics for you at this time OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink  You may proceed Richard Newitter    SVB Leerink    Analyst Hi  Thanks for taking the questions  Kevin  maybe just the first one  In Europe  where you re underrepresented from a market share standpoint relative to U S  share    dominant share positions  can you maybe just tell us where you re most excited about potentially  you know  closing the gap even faster as you look to 2020  Where do you see the biggest opportunities  especially as you move into the next 12 months  And where are you most excited there  And then I had a quick follow up Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure  I would start off with the med surg segment  so endoscopy  instruments and medical  Those are areas where we have the biggest opportunity for market share gains  We have terrific products  and as we specialize in med surg  we do expect to have a much more significant growth  The potential there is pretty significant  I also believe in knees  We ve sort of underperformed on a market share standpoint historically  Mako is a big help there as is specialization  So that s another area  And then I think spine  now that we have K2M  spine had a terrific year in Europe last year  And we believe that will continue going into the future  So those are the areas that I think we have a pretty good size hip business  We re pretty strong there  Our neuro businesses are very strong in Europe  So those are the areas that we still have growth potential but maybe not as much  But I would say med surg  knees  spine  significant runway Richard Newitter    SVB Leerink    Analyst Got it  And maybe just a follow up on cement less  Where does this category potentially get to  Is there a cap in your view from penetration of what should be done in cement less in knees  And just remind us what your estimation for the penetration today is into the market Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So  I think  Katherine  in her prepared remarks  mentioned that we exited the year at just over 36  of our U S  knees being cement less  We are seeing adoption around the world as well  not as fast as the adoption rate that we re seeing in the U S  I don t believe it will get to hips  which is virtually all cement less just given the knee joint being a weight bearing area  And with people s bone quality  there s always going to be some more conservatism  But there s no reason to believe why it won t continue to steadily rise  And I think it could exceed 50   Hard to know and hard to predict  but I wouldn t be surprised at all if it exceeds 50   Keep in mind that we have a very unique product for cement less  and that s why we re able to have this kind of spectacular growth rate and great clinical performance  And we ll see how that    whether that applies to the rest of the market  But we certainly love our position in cement less OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo  You may proceed Larry Biegelsen    Wells Fargo    Analyst Hey  guys  Thanks for taking the question  One on Mako  One on Japan  Katherine  I think I know the answer to this  but given the strength you saw in placements in Q4 and 2019  I think you placed about 220 Mako robots  if I m doing the math right  Can you still grow Mako placements year over year in 2020  And maybe color on how much you can grow Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations So  we don t model out how many full year targets we have  but obviously  it was pretty significant year over year growth  Given where penetration areas are and where we are in the launch and the increasing acceptance  we feel very comfortable that you ll see healthy year over year growth Larry Biegelsen    Wells Fargo    Analyst Perfect  And then Kevin  do you guys have visibility yet on the Japan bi annual price cuts  And what are you guys assuming in your guidance Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We don t usually provide exactly what we re assuming in our guidance  This is something that    it occurs with the regular frequency  Whatever we ve modeled  if the number is a little higher or a little lower  we just absorb that within our targets  and that s why we have a range OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord  You may proceed Kyle Rose    Canaccord Genuity    Analyst Thank you for taking the questions  Just two Mako related ones for me  Katherine  I think you ve kind of alluded to it at the beginning of the call  but can you maybe help us understand how you view enabling technologies in spine  I mean  obviously  you ve got Mako as a foundational technology there with your nav suite  but you also acquired Cardan and Mobius in 2019  I guess  trying to understand how we should think about that in 2020  And then  just with respect to Mako in Japan  you ve got the full indications across the portfolio  Just how should we expect adoption to ramp there given  you know  you ve had five years in the U S  market already and you ve got clinical data and things of that sort  Should we expect an accelerated adoption in some of these new markets internationally Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure  I ll take the first one  and then I ll ask Katherine to comment on Japan  Enabling technologies to us  we re big believers that this is going to be important for the future  We are very excited about Mobius  We launched that at our sales meeting  and we re very excited about the potential of that being part of the enabling solution portfolio  We re not ready yet to comment on robotics for spine  so we obviously have two options  One  with Cardan  which came with the Mobius acquisition  as well as Mako  We are working on those programs  but it s just too early to give you an idea of when that will launch  And once we have a more   firm date  we will let you know  But we are believers that that is an important part of the future Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations And then your first question was specific around how we are thinking about spine and Mobius in 2020 Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No  about Japan Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations Oh  sorry  Japan  Excuse me  It s been an exciting market  and we now have all three indications  which is obviously a big plus  We have nine robots there  We got to nine fairly quickly  It s a market that really embraces technology  And obviously  we re going to bring years of learnings on how to optimize the sale  It would be premature to tell you how big it can be  but it absolutely feeds into our conviction level around the fact that we believe we re well positioned to grow Mako year over year in robot and to continue to see significant market share gains in knees as we expand  not just in the U S   but globally Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  In general  Japan  it will grow  It doesn t tend to spike as fast as the U S  Just if you look historically and look at intuitive surgical  look at other businesses  But it will grow  And we re pretty bullish about it and excited for the future OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer and Company  You may proceed Steve Lichtman    Oppenheimer and Company    Analyst Thank you  Hi  guys  First question with K2 now more in the fold  Can you provide an update on the deformity opportunity that you see ahead  and how that portfolio maybe provides an opportunity for pull through of more traditional degenerative products for you guys Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations You know  it s certainly part of the rationale at the time of the deal  K2M are leaders in the deformity market  and the opportunity there to really leverage their call point and their relationships with key opinion leaders was absolutely part of the rationale for the transaction  along with the opportunity to refresh our portfolio  So that rationale was relevant then  and it s still very valid today Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  And obviously  it took time to cross train all of our salespeople  That was part of the integration challenges that we have  They are all cross trained on the K2M products  And you re right  That pull through is a key part of why our growth will accelerate Steve Lichtman    Oppenheimer and Company    Analyst Great  And then just secondly  on EU MDR  just curious on your thoughts for Stryker specifically  And obviously  as an industry leader for the market  how do you see that impacting cost  pace of innovation  and perhaps  product discontinuations as a result of those regulations Glenn Boehnlein    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  We  you know  continue to refine and expand how we look at EU MDR  We also have done a lot of work in terms of thinking about the value proposition that we offer in that space  More and more  our investors are becoming more interested in that and have asked us questions about it  When I was over in Europe doing fundraising in November  it pretty much came up in every meeting  So  it is something that we have a focus on  Our communications department is working and has hired someone full time to look at it  And so  I think you ll see more out of it in the coming years Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  I think one of the things Stryker did  and started frankly  before the MDR  was what we call a focus on power brands  And so  we ve been rationalizing our portfolio pretty significantly  and that ended up being a real blessing when the MDR came about because we had already decided to move out of a lot of  let s call them peripheral SKUs  And so  we feel very well prepared  There has slightly been    recently been a slight reprieve on the dates pre MDR  but we are all systems go ready for that  We don t really believe it s going to have any meaningful change to how we innovate given that we do have this kind of power brand focused mentality around our innovations OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen  You may proceed Josh Jennings    Cowen and Company    Analyst Thanks for taking the questions  and congrats again on a stellar year  I just wanted do two quick questions on Mako  First  I mean China  I know you re waiting on the total knee approval  Maybe you can just help provide us with some color just on that opportunity  Any details that you can give in terms of  I guess the TAM or a number of orthopedic synergies you could address with Mako in China  And then  secondarily  and with competition coming more into play this year  I understand that Stryker is not going to be standing still  But what can we expect over the course of this year to hear about in terms of iterative advancements for Mako total knee  Is there anything we could see at AAOS  Or anything    how should we be thinking about the advancement of Mako total knee Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations Yeah  I think I ll start with the latter  The capabilities  the functions  the clinical benefits that the current knee indication brings are increasingly being well established and received  So that remains our focus  Obviously  we have things in the R D pipeline as we do with all our capital base products  looking at ways to improve  But this is really a leading robotics technology with unique capabilities and indications across the portfolio of joint replacements  As Kevin referenced  I believe  on this call  and I m sure we ll talk about in academy  we do have some new hip software coming to help facilitate that procedure  And so that will be the focus  It s really hard    turning to your question about China    to give you a quantifiable answer there  It s a very large market  but it s still a developing market  It s around building out their orthopedics  But it s certainly one  once we get our knee indication approved  we have a lot of excitement around  But just keep in mind  o U S  is really a number of different markets  It s not all tied to one or a couple of markets  We ve seen great performance in Asia and Australia and parts of Europe and Latin America and now seeing Japan come online  So  it s the totality of that geographic offering that I think will help really power our o U S  Mako performance OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG  You may proceed Ryan Zimmerman    BTIG    Analyst Thanks for squeezing me in  Just two quick ones for me  Kevin  you guys have made a big push in ENT  both with the Entellus acquisition and Arinex  Just curious if you could kind of speak to how you view your ENT business today  whether you have sufficient scale in that business or what else you may need to do  whether it s further M A or additional hiring to kind of scale up in that space  And then  the second question is just around the instrument line  We ve seen that revert to more of a mid single digit growth rate relative to the first half of the year  And just love to get your thoughts on kind of how we should be thinking about that line into 2020 and beyond just given the cadence there Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  I think you saw we split our sales force in surgical  which is one the biggest part of our instruments division  had an incredible first half of the year  slowed a little bit in the second half of the year but still a double digit growth for the full year  Instruments has consistently  for the last decade  been a high single digit or low double digit growth kind of business  And we expect continued high growth out of our instruments franchise  so we are not lowering our expectations and thinking that instruments will suddenly become a slower grower  And frankly  if you look at a lot of the acquisitions we ve done  including more recently TSO3 and Invuity  there s a number of acquisitions  We keep feeding the instruments machine  and so you re going to expect to see continued high growth out of instruments  I m sorry  what was the other question  I think I missed the other one Ryan Zimmerman    BTIG    Analyst ENT Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Oh  ENT  We have sufficient scale now in ENT with    I mean  Entellus  we already have some products within Stryker  NasoPore and some smaller products  With the addition of Entellus  we have what we need  I would call Arrinex a tuck in  Could we do other smaller additions  Sure  Just like any of our businesses  we can always do little tuck ins  But I would say we don t need anything significant to be able to really win in ENT  And I was very pleased with the momentum that we have in that business as we exited the year OperatorYour next call comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James  You may proceed Larry Keusch    Raymond James    Analyst OK  thanks  Yeah  two questions  I guess  Katherine  clearly  you ve done a sizable volume of total knees on Mako  you know  2019 was a big year for you guys  As you start to expand into the other regions  what are the key benefits that you re hearing most from your Mako surgeons at this point  What I guess I m really trying to understand is what is driving the continued stellar adoption of the technology Katherine Owen    Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations I think it really comes down to several factors  The capabilities of the Mako robot with a CT scan that is specific to that individual patient and allows for a patient specific plan that can be changed inter operatively with technology that allows optimal balancing of the knee  avoiding soft tissue disruption  and it really helps improve outcomes  which  seeing data that shows patients are ambulating more quickly  they have less opioid use  they re getting out of the hospital more quickly  and that ties to having a better balanced knee and less tissue disruption  which is only possible with a patient specific plan that allows you to cut less because you have more knowledge specific to that patient  That s really resonating with surgeons  And I think that s probably the biggest driving force behind what is increasing utilization and adoption Larry Keusch    Raymond James    Analyst OK  perfect  And then I guess  just a financial question here  Look  you re going to have an increase in your leverage once the right deal is done  I think you ve mentioned you peaked around three times  but that s still actually relatively low  compared to other med tech peers out there  So  I guess the question is where do you    where is the right level of leverage for you guys on a more steady state  And even as you come up to these peak levels on post the right acquisition  can you continue to still do M A as you continue to move the leverage back down again Glenn Boehnlein    Chief Financial Officer Yeah  I think the plan  you know  first of all  is we would continue to deliver 30 to 50 basis points in the underlying business even once we combine right  And honestly  we would work through the integration plan to improve the overall leverage  which is obviously part of the acquisition modeling  I think as we think about continuing acquisitions after we close on the acquisition of right  we would still plan to do small tuck in acquisitions  which are really the bread and butter of how we drive a lot of growth for our divisions  So  I don t see any change in that piece of the strategy OperatorThere are no further questions at this time  I ll now turn the conference over to Mr  Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks Kevin Lobo    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you for joining our call  We look forward to sharing our Q1 results with you in April  And as a reminder  we will be hosting a booth tour and investor meeting at AAOS on March 26  Thank

171921,393437,SYK,Shire ready to bow to AbbVie s increased  53 billion offer,news,"By Kate Holton LONDON  Reuters    London listed drugmaker Shire Plc  L SHP  succumbed to an increased 31 billion pounds   53 billion  takeover offer from Abbvie Inc  N ABBN  on Monday  signaling the conclusion to a long running courtship largely motivated by tax 
Shire said it was ready to recommend the deal  the latest in a list of mergers proposed by U S  firms seeking to cut their tax rates  and which comes less than seven weeks after the collapse of Pfizer Inc s  N PFE   118 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc  L AZN   also motivated in part by tax factors 
Chicago based AbbVie  which wants to buy Shire to cut its tax bill and diversify its product line up  increased its offer to 53 20 pounds per share on Sunday  following a request from the Dublin based group which had rejected four previous bids 
Citing people familiar with the matter  Reuters had reported on Saturday that Shire  a maker of drugs for rare diseases  had asked AbbVie to sweeten its offer to near 53 pounds per share in order for it to recommend the deal 
Shire said the new bid comprised 24 44 pounds in cash and 0 8960 new AbbVie shares for each Shire share and would result in Shire investors owning around 25 percent of the combined entity 
 The proposed offer seems a fair price that represents good value for both companies  shareholders   said Mick Cooper  an analyst at Edison Investment Research  Shares in Shire  founded in 1986  hit a record high of 50 45 pounds in mid morning trading 
AbbVie is eager to buy Shire both to reduce its U S  tax bill by moving its tax base to Britain   a tactic known as inversion   and to diversify its drug portfolio 
The U S  group gets nearly 60 percent of its revenue from rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira  the world s top selling medicine  which loses U S  patent protection in late 2016 
Analysts at Barclays estimated the move would provide an estimated  1 3 billion tax savings by 2020  reflecting lower UK corporate tax rates

AbbVie has proposed creating a new U S  listed holding company with a tax domicile in Britain  whose corporate tax rate is set to drop as low as 20 percent from 2015  well below the U S  headline rate of 35 percent plus local taxes  The UK government has also introduced tax breaks designed to encourage research and development 
 We expect the majority of the tax savings to be realized within the first two years   Barclays analysts said 
 Strategically AbbVie acquires Shire s quality growth assets in platforms including rare diseases  neuroscience and ophthalmology  easing investor concerns about over reliance on Humira and offering future growth opportunities  
Analyst Alistair Campbell at banking group Berenberg said there were few other British pharmaceutical companies that would suit a tax inversion takeover 
 The company has to be of a certain size  because around 20 percent of the shareholders post deal must be shareholders in the target company  so you can t go for small companies   he said   Glaxo  L GSK  is too big  Astra has had an approach from Pfizer and Shire has now gone  
Smith   Nephew Plc  L SN   Europe s largest maker of artificial joints  has been seen as a possible contender  with U S  based Stryker Corp  N SYK  forced to say it would not bid for the group after reports linking it with a deal circulated in May 
Sweden s Meda AB  ST MEDAa  rejected an improved takeover offer from U S  generics firm Mylan Inc  O MYL  in April  which could have helped reduce taxes 
The approach for Shire  founded in Britain  has been far less controversial than the move for AstraZeneca  Headquartered in Dublin  it is managed from Boston  Massachusetts  and has most of its sales in the United States  resulting in a relatively small business footprint in Britain 
Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov had said he was happy for the company to be sold at the right price  but like AstraZeneca in its defense against Pfizer  he had set out a detailed case as to why it was worth a lot more than AbbVie was originally offering

171923,393439,SYK,Former OtisMed CEO sentenced for selling unapproved medical device,news,"Investing com    The former CEO and co founder of OtisMed  a Northern California based company  was sentenced to two years in federal prison for intentionally selling a medical device used in knee replacement surgery after it was rejected by the Food and Drug Administration 
In December  Charlie Chi  46 of San Francisco  pleaded guilty to three counts of distributing adulterated medical devices in violation of the federal Food  Drug and Cosmetics Act  FDCA  after having been told by the FDA  his board and legal counsel not to consummate the sale  Chi was also fined  75 000 and sentenced to an additional year of supervised release 
In August  2005  the company was founded after Chi conceived the design of an orthopedic cutting guide aimed at helping aid surgeons during knee arthroplasty procedures  The procedure requires a surgeon to remove the ends of a patient s leg bones and reshape the remaining bones to allow for the insertion of an artificial knee implant 
Complications can arise if the cuts to the bones are not made at a precise angle  During a four year period from 2006 until 2009  OtisMed sold 18 000 of its OtisKnee devices without FDA approval  generating revenue of more than  27 million  according to the Justice Department 
In September  2009  the FDA denied a submission from OtisMed for approval  ruling that it failed to demonstrate the cutting guide was  as safe and effective as other legally marketed devices   
 Companies and individuals put the public health at risk by not complying with FDA regulatory requirements for the pre market review of medical devices   Philip Walsky  acting director of the FDA s Office of Criminal Investigations  said in a statement   We will continue to investigate and bring to justice those who potentially endanger patient safety by distributing unapproved medical devices  
Last September  U S  District Judge Claire Cecchi sentenced OtisMed to a criminal fine of  34 4 million and ordered the company to pay  5 16 million in criminal forfeiture  OtisMed also paid an additional  41 2 million to settle a civil suit related to the marketing of the device  
 Today s sentencing of OtisMed s CEO ought to send a clear message to others in positions of authority within the medical device and pharmaceutical industries  the Department of Justice will vigorously prosecute not only corporations  but also the individuals at their helm who are responsible for endangering public health and safety in pursuit of profit   Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin Mizer  head of the Justice Department s Civil Division  said in a statement

   Index set for biggest monthly fall since Oct 2008
   Bargain hunting boosts miners
   S N up on reheated bid talk

 By Tricia Wright	
 LONDON  Aug 31  Reuters    Hopes for another stimulus
package from the U S  central bank drove an advance on Britain s
top share index on Wednesday  although traders questioned the
sustainability of the rally given the weakening economic
backdrop 	
 The FTSE 100 had risen 51 69 points  or 1 percent 
to 5 320 35 by 1136 GMT  albeit in thin volumes  at 30 8 percent
of the 90 day average 	
 The mood has darkened on both sides of the Atlantic   	
 A survey in the UK on Wednesday showed that confidence among
British consumers fell to its lowest level in four months in
August  a sign they will keep a tight rein on spending 
hampering a fragile economic recovery   	
 This followed U S  figures on Tuesday showing consumer
confidence slid in August to its lowest level in two years
which  along with minutes from the latest Federal Reserve
meeting  cemented a growing belief the Fed will have to
intervene with aggressive steps when it meets in late September 	
  The consumer s in debt up to its eyeballs  and you can t
spend what you haven t got   Michael Hewson  analyst at CMC
Markets  said 	
  And against a backdrop of slowing growth and rising
unemployment  I don t think consumers really have an awful lot
to be confident about at the moment  	
 Concerns over the strength of the global economy  coupled
with the European sovereign debt crisis  have in fact put
Britain s top share index on track for its biggest monthly fall
since October 2008  just after the collapse of Lehman Brothers 	
 Investors were readying themselves for a batch of U S  data 
including the ADP National Employment survey for August at 1215
GMT    a key precursor to Friday s crucial August jobs report 
which could intensify investors  belief in further U S 
stimulus 	
 U S  stock index futures    pointed to a
higher opening on Wall Street on Wednesday 	
  We might be in a position where bad news is actually
positive because it might force the Fed to be a bit more
QE focused when they meet in September   Mic Mills  head of
electronic trading at ETX Capital  said 	
 To reflect a new  more subdued second half of the year 
Citigroup has amended forecasts and price targets for UK asset
managers  with Schroders among the biggest blue chip
casualties  off 1 6 percent  as the broker cut its rating to
 hold    	
 Short term  Falling markets mean lower AUM  lower management
fees  lower performance fees   Citi said in a note   	
 Longer term  down markets and high volatility increase 
investor fear  leading to subdued and or negative fund flows  We
expect this to delay AUM  assets under management  and revenue
recovery  even if markets recover swiftly from here    	
The broker said that  for a falling market  its top picks
would be Man Group   citing its flagship AHL fund as a
catalyst  and midcap Ashmore   which Citi lifted to
 buy  on valuation grounds 	
 Shares in the pair enjoyed respective gains of 1 7 percent
and 1 6 percent  with Man Group also given a fillip  according
to traders  from a Morgan Stanley upgrade to  overweight    	
 British Land and Land Securities shed 2 2
percent and 1 percent respectively  with traders citing the
impact of double downgrades for both by Morgan Stanley in a
cautious review of the European real estate sector 	
 Mining stocks were the main force behind the UK
blue chip index s rise  building on an advance from the previous
session as bargain hunters moved in on the beleaguered sector
which has fallen nearly 12 percent in August   	
Smith   Nephew was the standout individual performer 
up 5 1 percent and extending Tuesday s gains  as long standing
bid talk was revived and after Deutsche Bank initiated coverage
with a  buy  rating on Tuesday 	
 U S  rivals Stryker Corp and Biomet were mentioned
in press reports as possible suitors for Smith   Nephew  which
reportedly attracted the interest of Johnson   Johnson 
late last year before it bought Switzerland s Synthes instead 	
 Smith   Nephew was not immediately available for comment 	
 Ex dividend factors clipped 0 25 point off the FTSE 100
index on Wednesday  with Capita   Serco and John
Wood Group losing their payout attractions

earnings and price to book value ratios  which can turn negative and cease to be relevant  the price to sales  P S  ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters Also  profits and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation  significant charges and inventory  However  management has limited opportunities to rig sale numbers  which further underscores the importance of P S ratio Therefore  P S ratio can serve as a more reliable metric for stock valuation  But focusing solely on sales growth is not a wise decision One must take in to consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number for a more dependable investment strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy P S Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Estimate revisions  better than the industry  are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or

Significant growth expectations ahead





Recently increased guidance expects 2019 revenue of over  43m  up 54  year on year   Given the importance of the current US programmes that RADA serves and the significant potential to expand sales globally  management expects strong growth to be maintained into 2020  While profitable in 2017 and 2018  RADA strategically ramped R D and opened a US manufacturing subsidiary to meet the demand  bringing it to report a net loss so far in 2019  although opex should level out at year end 2019  In addition  note that RADA had  15m cash on the balance sheet at the end of Q2  Given the revenue growth and stable gross margins it expects  this implies a return to profitability in 2020  with strong profitability in 2021

172201,393717,SYK,Why Stryker  SYK  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Stryker  SYK   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Products industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This medical device maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1 78  
For the most recent quarter  Stryker was expected to post earnings of  1 84 per share  but it reported  1 88 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 17   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 15 per share  while it actually produced  2 18 per share  a surprise of 1 40  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Stryker lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Stryker currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 24   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 25  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-stryker-syk-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200439350,200439350
172202,393718,SYK,Stryker  SYK  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Stryker  SYK  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 94 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 2  
Revenues are expected to be  3 60 billion  up 8 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 22  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Stryker 
For Stryker  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 24  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Stryker will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Stryker would post earnings of  1 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 88  delivering a surprise of  2 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Stryker 
For Stryker  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 35  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Stryker will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Stryker would post earnings of  2 15 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 18  delivering a surprise of  1 40  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Stryker appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stryker-syk-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200407219,200407219

172421,393937,SYK,Can Stryker  SYK  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Stryker  SYK   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Products industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This medical device maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1  
For the most recent quarter  Stryker was expected to post earnings of  2 15 per share  but it reported  2 18 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 40   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 68 per share  while it actually produced  1 69 per share  a surprise of 0 60  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Stryker  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Stryker has an Earnings ESP of  0 39  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on April 23  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

172451,393967,SYK,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Stryker  SYK ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Stryker  SYK  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this medical device maker is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Stryker is 12   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 11 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 2 7  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Stryker is 12 7   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11 5  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 12 7  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 10 3  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Stryker have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Stryker has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

172516,394032,SYK,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Stryker  SYK ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Stryker  SYK   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Products industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this medical device maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 1 16   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Stryker was expected to post earnings of  1 68 per share  but it reported  1 69 per share instead  representing a surprise of 0 60   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 73 per share  while it actually produced  1 76 per share  a surprise of 1 73  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Stryker  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Stryker currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 20   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 29  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-stryker-syk-200372126,200372126

172689,394205,SYK,Why Is Stryker  SYK  Up 4 1  Since Its Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Stryker Corporation   NYSE SYK    Shares have added about 4 1  in that time frame 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is SYK due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers 
Recent EarningsStryker reported first quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of  1 68  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5   The EPS figure exceeded the high end of the guidance and also increased 13 5  year over year The Michigan based medical device company reported first quarter revenues of  3 24 billion  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 20 billion by a narrow margin  Revenues also increased 9 7  on a year over year basis Organic sales growth was an impressive 7  and performance in Japan  China  Australia and emerging markets was striking as well Segment DetailsOrthopaedicsRevenues in this segment came in at  1 22 billion  up 4 7  at cc  The upside can be attributed to the Knees division  which reported sales worth  491 million  up 5  at cc  Moreover  organic net sales in the segment rose 4 7  Per management  the flagship Mako Total Knee platform saw a significant year over year uptick in new robot installations MedSurgThis segment registered revenues of  1 43 billion  up 9 1  at cc  Organic net sales in the segment increased 7 8  despite supply issues related to the company s Puerto Rico facility ramp up The growth was mainly driven by the sub segments   Instruments  Endoscopy and Medical  Instruments saw 4 1  growth at cc to  412 million  Endoscopy grew 18 7  to  444 million and Medical rose 7 2  to  511 million Per management  the Medical division witnessed U S  organic growth of 4 8   driven by strong performance of core bed and power cot products as well as physio business Neurotechnology and SpineRevenues in this segment came in at  598 million  up 13 5  at cc Organic net sales in the segment increased 10 1  Neurotechnology registered revenues worth  410 million  up 20 8  at cc  while Spine revenues came in at  188 million  up 0 3  at cc However  in the reported quarter  the Spine business saw softness as well as low double digit price declines across core product lines  The segment is also gaining from the recent integration of Entellus Medical Geographical DetailsSales in the United States came in at  2 31 billion  up 8 3  at cc International sales totaled  927 million  up 8  at cc Per management  Stryker performed strongly in Japan  South Pacific and Canada  The company also registered double digit growth on a year over year basis in the emerging markets However  the company s performance in Europe lacked luster in the first quarter MarginsIn the quarter under review  operating margin expanded 70 basis points  bps  to 25  Adjusted gross margin of 66 3  improved nominally from the prior year quarter  Per management  gross margin was favorably impacted by productivity  efficiency and foreign exchange gains  offset by business mix and price Financial ConditionStryker continues to maintain a strong position with  2 5 billion of cash and marketable securities  of which approximately 55  was held outside the United States  Cash flow in the first quarter was approximately  297 million  Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter was  7 9 billion GuidanceBuoyed by the stellar first quarter performance  Stryker now expects second quarter earnings per share within  1 70  1 75 Moreover  organic net sales growth in 2018 is expected within 6 5 7  and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in the range of  7 18  7 25 Management is also confident of a 30 50 bps improvement in operating margin

    VGM Scores
At this time  SYK has an average Growth Score of C  however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A  However  the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side  putting it in the bottom 40  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregte VGM Score of C  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than growth investors 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising  It comes with little surprise SYK has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months ",2018-05-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-stryker-syk-up-41-since-its-last-earnings-report-200319808,200319808
172712,394228,SYK,LeMaitre Vascular  LMAT  Soars To A 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of LeMaitre Vascular   NASDAQ LMAT    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12 2  over the past month  LMAT hit a new 52 week high of  41 28 in the previous session  LeMaitre Vascular has gained 25 8  since the start of the year compared to the  2 2  move for the Medical sector and the 3 8  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 21  2018  LeMaitre Vascular reported EPS of  0 21 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 19 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0 5  
For the current fiscal year  LeMaitre Vascular is expected to post earnings of  0 98 per share on  111 06 million in revenues  This represents a 13 95  change in EPS on a 10 1  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 12 per share on  122 35 million in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 14 96  and 10 17   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
LeMaitre Vascular may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for LMAT  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
LeMaitre Vascular has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 41X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 36 4X versus its peer group s average of 19 4X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 73  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective LeMaitre Vascular  Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  LeMaitre Vascular currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if LeMaitre Vascular fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though LMAT shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does LeMaitre Vascular Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of LeMaitre Vascular have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Stryker Corporation   NYSE SYK    ICU Medical   NASDAQ ICUI    and IDEXX Laboratories   NASDAQ IDXX    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
However  it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking  so it isn t all good news for LeMaitre Vascular  Still  the fundamentals for LMAT are promising  and it still has potential despite being at a 52 week high ",2018-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lemaitre-vascular-lmat-soars-to-a-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200308284,200308284

released their quarterly earnings  Most of the companies have incurred big one time charges related to the change in tax law this time around  The gap between adjusted operating earnings and reported earnings is in fact the widest in recent years  The MedTech space is also not immune to the trend Last year  the MedTech space witnessed a good deal of uncertainty on account of a series of political events  While the Affordable Care Act  ACA  or Obamacare was not rolled back as was originally expected  the year ended with the tax overhaul  As part of the latest tax reform  corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21  from 35  earlier Industry Appears Vulnerable to ChangeMany of the economists expect the new tax law to have a negative impact on the industry due to a possible cut in overall Medicare spending if certain criteria are not met by a specific date The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  apprehends that if it doesn t find any alternative to meet the fiscal deficit from the huge tax cut  automatic cuts worth  136 billion  including  25 billion in Medicare cuts  from mandatory spending in 2018 could be triggered Delayed Medical Device Tax  Boon to the IndustryAmid the concerns related to the tax reform  Congress  postponement of the medical device tax for another two years came as a huge relief to industry participants and investors  The original 2018 tax reform bill did not include any mention of this temporary repeal and investors were apprehensive that medical device tax will be reinforced in 2018 This 2 3  tax took a toll on the entire medical device industry since its enactment in 2013  Per the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group  this tax had a significant negative impact on medical innovation resulting in loss or deferred creation of

two years Regarding the latest two year suspension of the tax  Mark Leahey  President and CEO of the Medical Device Manufacturers Association  MDMA  has stated that   Congress must permanently repeal this disastrous policy in order to fully realize the long term investments in patient care and job creation that are critical to growth   It remains to be seen whether the tax is fully eliminated or

stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include McDonald s  NYSE   NYSE MCD       3M  NYSE   NYSE MMM      and Stryker  NYSE   NYSE SYK       Goldman Sachs  NYSE   NYSE GS      and Kinder Morgan  NYSE   NYSE KMI        Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  Top Stock Reports for McDonalds  3M and StrykerThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including McDonald s  NYSE       3M  NYSE      and Stryker  NYSE       These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Buy ratedMcDonald s  shares have gained  28 9  over the last six months easily outperforming many of its peers which have been struggling to survive the restaurant space s tough operating environment lately  McDonald s Q2 earnings and revenues exceeded expectations  but revenues fell year over year mainly due to the impact of refranchising Meanwhile  the company recorded the eighth consecutive quarter of global comps growth  In fact  McDonald s grew sales and guest counts in each of its top nine markets  for the first time since 2008  The Zacks analyst likes McDonald s attempts to reinforce its position worldwide via various sales and digital initiatives Also  increased focus on refranchising is expected to reduce its capital requirements  thereby facilitating EPS growth and ROE expansion in the long run  Yet  higher costs along with currency headwinds may hurt profits while a soft industry backdrop in the U S  and macroeconomic concerns in some parts of the world might limit sales growth  You can 3M s shares are up  12 4  in the year to date period  outperforming the S P 500 index  up  10 8   and the Zacks Conglomerates sector  down  1 4    Driven by broad based organic growth across all segments  3M reported strong second quarter results with healthy year over year increase in earnings and revenues  although it missed expectations on both counts The company has raised its earlier guidance for 2017 on strong quarterly results and improved business outlook  The Zacks analyst likes 3M s global footprint  diversified product portfolio and ability to penetrate different markets  However  increased pension expenses remain a significant headwind for 3M and erode its profitability Sustained strength in the U S  dollar will further continue to negatively impact earnings  as exports consume a significant part of the company s operations and growth prospects  Given its international presence  adverse foreign currency translations are also likely to affect 3M s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings  You can  Stryker s shares have gained  18 5  over the last six months  outperforming the Zacks Medical Products industry  which has gained  17 8  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Stryker s performance is likely to be affected by supply side headwinds  The company has been grappling with issues in its spine business for long and this is expected to affect performance in the second quarter China might prove to be a challenging market for the company  Additionally  challenging global economic conditions and rising competition raise concerns  Estimate movement has also been mixed ahead of its second quarter earnings release  However growing adoption of MAKO will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market  The acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio Control and the tie up with Indo UK Institute of Health s Medicity Program are also major positives  You can  Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Goldman Sachs  NYSE      and Kinder Morgan  NYSE      our interest

 NOVADAQ s unique  innovative technology complements our advanced imaging portfolio and expands our product offerings into open and plastic reconstructive surgery  Their innovative technology can reduce post procedure complication rates and the cost of care for a broad variety of surgical treatments   Scannell said 
While the  701 million valuation is 8 4 times NOVADAQ s latest 12 month revenue  analysts believe the purchase is a smart move for Stryker   We believe adding NVDQ s IP to Stryker will allow  it  to better grow the fluorescence field and we feel SYK is the most equipped company to do so   wrote Sean Lavin  an analyst from BTIG  in a research note Monday 
The transaction must first be approved by a majority of NOVADAQ s shareholders  Stockholders of at least 66  of NOVADAQ s total stock must agree to the deal either in person or be represented by a proxy  A special meeting is expected to take place around August 4  2017

172903,394419,SYK,On Stryker  Taxes  the Super Committee and Growth,opinion,Obama s Affordable Health Care Act of 2010 was paid for  in part  with an excise tax on implanted medical devices  The 2 3  excise tax goes into effect in 2013  It s already causing some of those  unintended consequences  that we keep hearing about Top NewsStryker to cut jobs to offset excise tax impactThu  Nov 10 18 18 PM ESTNov 10  Reuters    Medical device maker Stryker Corp said it will cut 5 percent  or about 1000 jobs to largely offset costs related to the scheduled implementation of the new Medical Device Excise Tax in 2013 Steve Ferguson  the chairman of Cooke Group  another device manufacturer  had this to say about the excise tax   Many companies are being forced to limit investments in R D in the U S  and go abroad  Further  many companies are looking to reduce their U S  capital investment  For Cook  we had planned on making additional investments in U S  communities  Now  because of the tax  those plans are on hold  I hope that this small example will confirm to any doubters that tax increases do have consequences  When taxes go up  jobs are lost  Investments in new plant and equipment are either deferred or are made outside of our borders  It s that simple Stryker s stock  SYK  has been in the doghouse of late  It s down 22  since the establishment of the Super Committee  mandatory cuts in medical spending   The stock market has done what it s supposed to do  adjust the multiple to reflect the changing realities SYK was trading at a 16X PE on Friday  That multiple might be justified  After all  Stryker is a pretty good company  You can t go to a hospital without using their stuff  They make the beds you lie on and the scalpels they cut you with  They are also high tech  They make gizmos that will suck out your gall bladder in just a few minutes and leave a few small holes  They re big in devices  hips  knees etc   The company is consistently profitable and has nice  15   margins  It s sitting on  3b of cash and functionally has no debt  For the suckers who think that dividends are the key to wealth SYK pays 1 5  and there s every reason to believe the payout will grow  If one wanted to get a play on the global growth story  SYK is on the list  They re everywhere  With rising incomes in Asia and aging populations in the West one would think the company is sitting pretty On the other hand  one could look at recent results  All the important lines are flatter then a pancake  What s the right multiple when top line is dead and the future is not so bright  There are only 7 days left before the Super Committee efforts are to be released  they have to publish a plan 48 hrs before the 11 23 deadline   My sense has been that there will be no deal  That was confirmed today listening to the talk shows  We re going to get big cuts in both healthcare and military spending as a result I wonder if the stock market has fully priced in the consequences for the few dozen companies whose future growth  or lack thereof  will be confirmed in a week  I also wonder what the big macro economists and players like the CBO  OMB  SSA and the IMF will say about revisions to US growth My guess is that the stock market has not fully priced this in and I m convinced that the conclusion by the deep thinkers will be that long term US growth prospects have to be revised down  not up ,2011-11-14,Bruce Krasting,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/on-stryker,-taxes,-the-super-committee-and-growth-105437",105437
172907,394423,SYK,42 Dividend Contenders for Above Average Total Return,opinion,With interest rates hovering near all time lows  investors needing income are faced with very limited choices   The traditional high yield available from bonds and other fixed income vehicles are no longer available to meet the needs of retirees needing income to live off   Moreover  it is almost a certainty that today s low yields are not adequate enough to fight inflation  Consequently  there is a growing investor interest in dividend paying common stocks  especially those that have a long record of increasing their dividend every year  This has led many lay  and even many professional investors  to assume that dividend paying common stocks are becoming overvalued  In addition to being too general to be relevant  these assumptions do not stand up to closer scrutiny Our research indicates this to be a fallacy  because in truth we have discovered numerous dividend paying enterprises that are trading at historically low valuations   But even more importantly  in addition to being historically low  we have identified numerous blue chip companies that are trading below their intrinsic values based on fundamentals  primarily earnings and cash flows   Today s growing interest has yet to compensate for the enormous aversion to equities that most investors have after being traumatized by the great recession of 2008 and the precipitous drop in stock prices that accompanied it On the other hand  not all dividend paying common stocks are the same   Therefore  we believe that potential investors need to be very discerning regarding the type and quality of the dividend paying stocks they are willing to invest in   This is especially true for those investors seeking to either augment or replace their fixed income investments with common stocks   Since the major attractions and benefits of fixed income in addition to yield  are safety and low risk  it only makes logical sense that a dividend paying strategy being considered to replace or supplant it should focus heavily on the same issues Dividend paying common stocks come in many different flavors and range from very aggressive to very conservative   When considering alternatives to fixed income because of today s low yields  we would argue that the emphasis should be on the most conservative dividend paying common stocks possible   In this vein  the reliability and predictability of a given dividend payment should rank high in importance  With that said  a logical place to begin looking is at companies that have long histories of paying dividends  and even better  a long history of increasing them each year  Although there is no guarantee that this will continue  a long track record certainly instills confidence One of the best sources available for identifying companies with long histories of dividend excellence is David Fish s CCC lists of Dividend Champions  Contenders and Challengers    The Champions  list is comprised of companies that have increased their dividend every year for at least 25 consecutive years  the Contenders  list is comprised of companies that have raised their dividends for 10 to 24 years  and finally  the Challengers  list is comprised of companies that have increased their dividends every year for between 5 to 9 consecutive years It s important to point out here that in theory at least  the Champions  list is a more conservative group than the Contenders  list which in turn is more conservative than the Challengers  list  As a general statement  we believe this is true  but like most statements that are too general  the devil is in the details   Consequently  even though the Champions  list is in theory the most conservative  we believe that there are names on the Contenders  list that are even better quality  and therefore  more conservative than some of the names on the Champions  list  and vice versa  Our last article dealt with the Dividend Champions that we believe are on sale  This is important because low prices and valuations are great attributes that mitigate risk in their own right  Here is a  to that article  This article will look at 42 Dividend Contenders that we believe are reasonably priced  too in some cases  significantly undervalued 42 Dividend Contenders On SaleThis list of Dividend Contenders  like the list of Dividend Champions before  is offered as a prescreened resource made available prior to engaging in a more comprehensive analysis  However  there is a difference between these lists and the traditional lists that are sorted by mere numbers or statistics  Currently  there are only 102 Dividend Champions and only 146 Dividend Contenders  Therefore  we were able to quickly and easily evaluate each company on the lists by running a  on each company that provides essential fundamentals at a glance  Therefore  we feel that this screen is more comprehensive than one based simply on statistical analysis Instead of bothering you with a long iteration using words and numbers to articulate what we screened for  we let a few pictures tell a few thousand words instead  The premium version of  has David Fish s lists pre loaded  with his permission of course  Therefore  it was a simple matter of scrolling through each company to determine whether or not it met our criteria of fair value  and whether or not it possessed the quality characteristics of predictability  reliability and consistency that we could be comfortable with  With our first run through  we took price out of the equation so as to only reveal the essential fundamentals of earnings and dividends on each company at a glance  Then we ran through the exercise again  only this time we added monthly closing stock prices to the graphs Remembering that we are coveting consistency and predictability with compiling our list of Dividend Contenders on sale  let s review two graphs showing earnings  orange line with white triangles  and dividends  blue shaded area paid out of but stacked on top of earnings  exclusive of stock price Two Contenders Rejected because of a Lack of ConsistencyAlterra Capital Holdings Ltd   ALTE Our first example  Alterra Capital Holdings Ltd   ALTE  is a Bermuda based holding company created by the merger between Max Capital Group and Harbour Point Limited in May of 2010  Max was a holding company formed in 1999 that went public in May of 2001 and paid a dividend that increased every year since  see DIV listed at the bottom of the graph   Although this 11 year record of increasing dividends qualifies it as a Dividend Contender  it was excluded due to the enormous cyclicality and unpredictability of its earnings  see red box at bottom   Simply stated  we didn t feel it was conservative enough to be considered as a potential fixed income replacement RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd   RNR Our second example  RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd   RNR  is a property catastrophic reinsurance company that has increased its dividend every year for 19 consecutive years  see DIV at bottom of the graph   Once again  the severe cyclicality and unpredictability of their earnings growth caused them to be excluded from our conservative list  even though their record of dividend increases has been long  This decision was made instantly by simply reviewing their earnings record  orange line  In addition to highly cyclical names like the two examples above  we also excluded MLP s and REIT s as we consider these typically high yield vehicles too risky to be considered as fixed income substitutes  However  there are many who would disagree with that position on these asset classes Two Quintessential Examples of What We Were Looking ForStryker Corp   SYK Stryker Corp   SYK  has raised their dividend for 19 consecutive years in conjunction with an impeccable record of consistently increasing their earnings at the above average rate of 18 4   With very little debt on the balance sheet  this company represents the quintessential example of the type of predictable high quality business we were seeking  International Business Machines Corp   IBM Affectionately known as Big Blue  IBM is arguably one of the bluest of all blue chip technology stocks  The record of consistently increasing earnings at the above average rate of 11  per annum since 1998 coincides with increasing their dividend for 16 consecutive years  Once again  IBM represents the classic earnings pattern and fundamental qualities that we were seeking Bringing It All TogetherSome Contenders Are Fairly ValuedWith our United Technologies Corp   UTX  example below we put it all together by adding monthly closing stock prices  black line  to the earnings and dividend graphs  In order to make our list of Dividend Contenders on sale  the company s stock price had to sit at or below its intrinsic value  the orange line  as United Technologies Corp  s price clearly does n addition to just pure dividend income  this article is further focused on total return  Since  under normal circumstances  there is more risk owning equities than owning fixed income  it is important that our candidates offered the opportunity for an attractive total return to compensate for the risk  One of the most overlooked elements of risk is valuation  overvaluation    Even though United Technologies  UTX  is currently moderately undervalued based on our calculation of intrinsic value  the orange line   it nevertheless generated a very attractive long term total return for shareholders because valuation was sound at the beginning of 1998  and therefore  valuation risk was reasonable Some Contenders Are Extremely UndervaluedTeva Pharmaceutical Industries  TEVA Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  TEVA   a leading global generic and branded pharmaceutical company headquartered in Israel represents a compelling valuation at today s levels  in our opinion  Teva has grown earnings very consistently at a compounded rate exceeding 23  per annum  which we believe warrants a much higher PE ratio than the meager PE of 9 that the market is valuing its shares at today With the consensus 5 year earnings estimates ranging from the low of 9 6  from 20 analysts reporting to Capital IQ to as high as 17 5  by 17 analysts reporting to Zacks  we believe the minimum PE of 15 to as much as a PE of 20 is warranted for this high quality pharmaceutical with only 16  debt on its balance sheet  Consequently  we see a high probability for outsized future returns based on low valuation and long term growth potential Harris Corp   HRS Harris Corp   HRS  is a leading international communications and information technology company   Note that although earnings were a little inconsistent from 1998 into 2003  since that time they have consistently advanced   Harris Corp  can currently be bought at what we believe to be a ludicrous price earnings ratio of only 7 4  We believe a more appropriate price earnings ratio for this dividend contender that has raised its dividend every year for 10 consecutive years  and now offers a starting yield of 3   should be awarded at least a 15 PE   This implies an intrinsic value that is more than double from where the company s price currently rests   This is why Harris Corp   HRS  sits at number two on the list for the highest five year estimated total return Close Calls   Quality Rejected Because of Modest OvervaluationThere were several names that were rejected due to modest overvaluation   A few examples include T J  Maxx  TJX   Ross Stores  ROST   Federal Express  FDX   Nike  NKE   T  Rowe Price  TROW   Casey s Gen  Stores  CASY  and others  The following earnings and price correlated graph on Church   Dwight Inc   CHD  represents overvaluation because stock price is higher than the orange earnings justified valuation line  We believe that each of these names listed in this paragraph are strong potential candidates if their stock prices came back into sound valuation levels  For example  we would consider Church   Dwight  CHD  a buy in the mid  30 price range Obvious Overvaluation RejectedThe following two examples  Royal Gold Inc   RGLD  and Fastenal  FAST  represent extreme and obvious overvaluation  orange line represents fair value   Although both of these names appear to be excellent businesses  the valuation risk of investing in these dividend contenders is heightened by an earnings yield that makes no economic sense  therefore  they were easily and summarily deleted from the master list because of extreme overvaluation 42 Contenders That Made The CutAfter rejecting Dividend Contenders that revealed themselves as either being too risky  too inconsistent or too expensive  we ended up with the following 42 companies that have increased their dividend every year for a minimum of 10 to 24 consecutive years  Consequently  we offer them as a fertile source of potential candidates for both investors seeking an above average and growing dividend yield  as well as investors looking for above average total return at reasonable levels of risk In other words  we believe this list offers opportunities for further exploration for all dividend income oriented investors  Dividend yields range from as low as  8  to as high as 5 2   with almost everything in between  Also  keep in mind that each of these selections has been screened for fair value or preferably undervaluation  and each has increased their dividend every year for at least 10 consecutive years A few words on the column headings are offered for clarification purposes  First  we compare each company s current PE ratio to its historical normal 15 year PE ratio  However  note that the five year estimated total return is not based on each respective company returning to its normal PE ratio   Instead  the five year estimated annual total return is a calculation based on the consensus estimated EPS growth  five year  and then applying an appropriate PE ratio to that growth  Historical EPS growth plus expected EPS growth are also side by side in order to provide a perspective of whether EPS growth will be higher or lower in the future than it was in the past  Market cap  the company s level of debt and the sector it operates in round off the table  with our candidates listed in order of highest estimated total return to lowest ConclusionsThere are several reasons why we are offering these articles on dividend paying growth and income stocks  First and foremost  is to illustrate that there are numerous extremely high quality dividend paying stocks that are available for purchase today at very attractive levels  The opportunity to invest in extremely high quality stocks at historically low valuations that offer both a growing dividend and capital appreciation is rare  Unfortunately  many investors remain traumatized and are currently eschewing quality dividend paying common stocks in favor of fixed income  at precisely the time when they should be looking at quality equities with a strong dividend record  Don t forget  each of the companies on this list raised their dividend right through the great recession Even though we have always embraced fixed income as a viable asset class that can  during normal economic times  appropriately be capable of meeting certain goals and objectives of many investors inclined towards safety and the highest yield possible  we are currently  and we believe temporarily  altering our stance  We believe that today s artificially induced and extremely low interest rate levels represent uncommon dangers with owning fixed income instruments  Therefore  we believe that carefully chosen extremely high quality dividend paying common stocks represent a viable alternative for safety conscious investors under today s economic conditions  Yes  there may be more risk  but a potentially higher total rate of return and increasing dividend income stream compensate for this greater risk  in our opinion Finally  this article in particular is offered to illustrate that there are vast differences in the types and quality of various classes of dividend paying common stocks  We feel that there s been way too much generalization with too little focus on the specifics that encompass the many differences and attributes that various kinds of dividend paying stocks possess  There are quality dividend paying stocks  there are risky dividend paying stocks and there are very expensive dividend paying stocks and in some cases there are very inexpensive dividend paying stocks  etc  To us   investing is about making these distinctions one at a time  while avoiding the natural but erroneous temptation to over generalize  In this vein  this
