Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day everyone and welcome to the Eastman Chemical Fourth Quarter Full Year 2019 Conference Call  This conference is being recorded  This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman s website  will now turn the call over to Mr  Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company  Investor Relations  Please go ahead  sir Gregory A  Riddle    Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  Deanna  and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us  On the call with me today are Mark Costa  Board Chair and CEO  Curt Espeland  Executive Vice President and CFO  Willie McLain  Vice President  Finance  and Jake LaRoe Manager  Investor Relations Before we begin  I ll cover two items  First  during this presentation  you will hear certain forward looking statements concerning our plans and expectations  Actual results or events concerning our plans and expectations could change  Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in the company s fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results news release  during this call and in the accompanying slides  and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission  including the Form 10 Q filed for third quarter 2019 and the Form 10 K to be filed for full year 2019 Second  earnings referenced in this presentation excludes certain non core and unusual items  Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures  including a description of the excluded and adjusted items are available in the fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results news release  which could be found on our website  in the Investors section  Projections of future earnings exclude any non core unusual or non recurring items With that I will turn the call over to Mark Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Greg and good morning everyone  I ll begin with the full year 2019 highlights on page 3  2019 was a significant year of macroeconomic challenges  that continue to get tougher through the year  I am incredibly proud of how Eastman employees around the world responded to these challenges and stepped up to the plate to deliver  almost  400 million in new business revenue closes from innovation led by Advanced Materials  which has achieved a decade of EBIT growth in 2019 We delivered on our cost management targets  while we continue to make progress on our innovation programs  I m also proud of how our cash engine generated free cash flow at a record level of almost  1 1 billion for the third consecutive year  Although  we aren t satisfied with our earnings performance  in what was a difficult environment  we are well positioned for earnings growth in 2020 and going forward Here are few highlights from 2019  first  we re celebrating Eastman centennial this year  Our 100 year history is filled with many successes and meaningful innovations that have enhanced the quality of life in a material way  The segment that best demonstrates its innovative spirit is Advanced Materials  which delivered impressive results  considering the challenging macro environment  Advanced Materials greatly outperformed its underlying markets  despite this exposure to transportation on several other consumer discretionary markets  And as our free cash flow results demonstrate  we can consistently deliver in any environment We continue to push our cash to work in a disciplined way  including significant delevering  which will remain a priority for us in 2020  Bolt on M A  like you saw with Marlotherm and INACSA this year  two great businesses opening up new markets for our technologies  And capital returns through a combination of share repurchases and dividends  which have increased for 10 consecutive years Finally on a personal note  I want to highlight the Curt Espeland  our CFO of 11 years  has elected to retire in 2020  after nearly a quarter century of service  Curt s a hugely talented financial professional and has had an extraordinary career  I m personally very grateful for his pragmatic leadership and the vital role he has played in the portfolio transformation  which has been a foundational element of our strategy to become a leading specialty materials company I d also like to share that I have every confidence in Curt s successor  Willie McLain  Willie has been a key player to Eastman for 20 years  and has worked closely Curt as part of our long term succession planning process  He has a proven experienced leader with deep knowledge of Eastman s financial organization  businesses  and capital markets  which will be integral as we continue the company s transformation With that  I ll hand the call over to Curt  to review some financial results  his final quarterly review  as he closes this chapter and opens another Curt E  Espeland    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks Mark and good morning everyone  First of all  I appreciate the kind words  Mark and want to thank you  the Board and all the men and women at Eastman for allowing me to serve as the CFO since 2008  It has been a real honor  I d also like to reiterate that Willie is absolutely the right CFO to take Eastman forward and is supported by very talented talented and motivated team in Eastman  We are in good hands With that said  let me start on slide 4  For the full year  revenue EBIT and EPS all declined as global growth decelerated and trade disputes created uncertainty for Eastman and our customers  At a corporate level  lower volumes due to destocking and reduced primary demand  alongside a strong dollar  contributed the most to the year over year decline in earnings  The lower volume resulted in lower utilization rates  variable margin spreads were flat at a corporate level for the year  Despite the difficult economic environment  we delivered strong growth across many of our innovative products  particularly in Advanced Materials Similar with the trends for the full year  fourth quarter results were impacted by a slowdown in the global economy  on top of normal seasonality  Revenue decreased mostly due to lower selling prices  as a result of lower raw material prices  EBIT increased slightly due to lower raw material costs and improved product mix  In an environment like we are in now  we remain focused on what we can control  closing new business revenue  reducing costs and generating strong free cash flow Moving now to segment results and starting with Advanced Materials  considering the business environment in 2019  full year performance was solid  with EBIT growing over 3   While Advanced Materials had challenges in the early part of 2019  once destocking had largely played out in the supply chain between the U S  and China  volumes return to a more normal level and the segment s innovation programs drove growth  The results in Advanced Materials are a great example of the importance of innovation  The core business was not immune due to the challenges with global trade uncertainty and transportation  but premium products provided resilience  We are also able to realize spread expansion in the second half  as lower cost raws flowed through and we remain disciplined on pricing Looking at the fourth quarter  revenue EBIT increased due to strong volume and more favorable product mix  Ahead in 2020  we expect to deliver another year of EBIT growth in this segment  as we benefit from both continued progress  growing new business revenue from innovation and a dollar headwind on foreign currency exchange rates  As a result  we expect Advanced Materials EBIT to be up mid single digits in 2020 Now moving to Additives   Functional Products on slide 6  unlike Advanced Materials  AFP was impacted more gradually with destocking picking up through 2019  While primary demand in many of the geographies we serve was decelerating  particularly in China and Europe  I m encouraged that two thirds of AFP delivered solid results in this environment  including strong growth in care chemicals  water treatment  and specialty fluids  as well as spread expansion across the portfolio We also had some challenges in this part of the segment  including slow demand in China for autos and disruptions in the ag market in China  All in  the bulk of AFPs businesses are performing how a specialty business should perform in this environment  The remaining one third of the business  adhesives tires and formic acids  that we previously called at our third quarter call  contributed the significant majority of the earnings decline for the year  We are continuing to actively work on solutions for this part of the segment  Looking ahead to 2020  we expect solid growth in the two thirds  offset by continued challenges in the one third  impacting both spreads and volumes  Putting it all together  we expect AFPs EBIT to be flat to slightly down  compared to 2019 Turning now to slide 7 in Chemical Intermediates  for the full year and the fourth quarter  sales revenue decreased for the reasons summarized on the slide  In the fourth quarter  EBIT decreased  mostly due to increased planned shutdown costs  As 2019 progressed and industry activity slowed  spreads in many of our derivative product lines declined  but we now think we re seeing signs of stabilization at this point  We expect to carry the lower level of spreads in the back half of 2019 into 2020  which will be a headwind in the first half of the year  but we also expect to see higher volumes at ag  as North America gets back to a more normal planting season  and we re expecting to see the benefits of our cost management programs and other stabilizing actions  All in  we think Chemical Intermediates EBIT in 2020 will be lower than 2019 Finishing up the segment views  with Fibers on slide 8  revenue and EBIT declined in full year 2019 due to general market decline for acetate tow  and some chunkiness related to customer buying patterns  Fourth quarter EBIT was up due to increased tow volumes in China  In the textiles market  we continue to make progress with our key initiatives  including growth in women s wear  which was up approximately 20  this year  This progress was offset by softness in the global market for more traditional textile applications In 2020  we expect acetate tow to be down slightly  consistent with the market  For Textiles  We expect continued strong growth in key end markets such as women s wear to be offset by a softer overall textile market  impacting our more traditional textile applications  Putting it together  we expect Fibers segment EBIT in 2020 to be slightly lower than 2019  consistent with the market I ll finish with some financial highlights on slide 9  free cash flow was strong at almost  1 1 billion  sustaining the record level we achieved in 2018  Another great result delivered by a variety of BA teams across Eastman  We also continued our track record of returning cash to owners and reducing debt  which both created value for our stockholders  Reducing debt will remain a top priority in 2020  and we expect to de lever greater than  400 million this upcoming year  further improving the strength of our balance sheet Our tax rate was approximately 15 5  for the full year and I expect the 2020 tax rate to be similar to 2019 in that 15  to 16  range  Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be  450 million to  475 million in 2020  The main driver behind the planned increase in capital spending  is associated with site tenant projects  which will be reimbursed across other lines of the cash flow statement over a number of periods Finally  don t miss the modeling slide in the appendix as well as our manufacturing shutdown scheduled for this year  One final comment on the appendix  in 2020  we project that depreciation and amortization will decline approximately  50 million  as part of the Taminco acquisition  Eastman mark to market and advantage methanol contract and certain other assets with a five year life  With the expiration of this advantage contract at the end of 2019  market based methanol purchases in 2020 will substantially offset the  30 million reduced amortization of the Taminco methanol contract With that  I ll turn it back to Mark Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Kurt  Now turning to our 2020 outlook on slide 10  As we all know  we are currently in a dynamic and certain macro environment  Despite this uncertainty  we needed to make a series of assumptions for our outlook  First  we expect modest volume growth and mix improvement from three factors  We are assuming global industrial production growth to be similar to  19  Second  we are expecting that destocking is predominantly behind us  although there may be some pockets where there is more to go  such as North American ag  Third  we expect to create our own growth through market development and innovation In 2020  we have a number of additional item and certain tailwinds  We expect our operating costs will be lower by  20 million to  40 million for the year  reflecting continued progress on productivity  and this is above offsetting normal inflation which is between  75 million and  100 million annually  We expect pension costs will be lower by about  25 million  and we also expect lower depreciation expense to be about a  20 million net benefit to EBIT  as Curt mentioned in his remarks  All in  these tailwinds total approximately  75 million  And we have a few headwinds for the year  such as higher variable comp and increased benefit comps  as we return to target levels  and a somewhat stronger U S  dollar compared to the euro  with an assumption of exchange rate averages at  1 10 for the year  Together with a few other small items  we expect a headwind of  85 million In addition  we are expecting spreads to be lower  primarily in Chemical Intermediates and the one third of AFP  This reflects the fact that these spreads in 2019 declined through the year  especially as a trade war escalated  and therefore we enter this year at a lower level relative to the first half of  19  Lastly  you should expect that we continue to be disciplined  as we allocate capital  including delevering  share repurchases  and bolt on acquisitions  where they make sense Putting this altogether  we expect our 2020 EPS will be slightly    will be between  7 20 and  7 60  with the first quarter EPS coming in flat to slightly down from the year ago quarter  We also expect our full year free cash flow to be between  1 0 billion to  1 1 billion  Of course  there are macroeconomic factors that could move us above or below this range  As we get through this short term uncertainty  we expect we will have a more informed view in April  and we ll adjust as necessary at that time Next  I m going to discuss actions we are taking to increase performance in 2020 and for the next three years  First on slide 11  new business revenue from innovation  For those that follow Eastman  this won t be a new concept  as we made great progress  Key to our success has been our innovation driven growth model  and in particular  the investment we ve made in application development capability  In 2017  our new business revenue was approximately  300 million  By  19  we had increased it to  400 million and in  20  we expect new business revenue approach  500 million  The segment leading the way  is Advanced Materials  which has numerous examples of innovative products driving new business revenues  They include Tritan copolyester  Saflex acoustic interlayers  heads up display interlayers and paint protection films  And with our two new commercial Chemical recycling technologies  we have enhanced our offering  especially plastics  for several applications such as cosmetics  ophthalmics  toys and more And while Advanced Materials has made the most progress  Additives and Functional Products is poised to make significant contribution in the coming years  We re getting commercial orders in a large number of innovation platforms  including Tetrashield for PPA non intent food packaging and auto coatings  specialty ketone for sustainable coating solutions  next generation Crystex for tires and we have several new platforms  we will discuss with you throughout the year Lastly  I d add that we have made great progress at Naia cellulosic yarn in the textiles markets  where we re particularly excited about our growth in women s wear  The offering of a biobase yarn  that uses cellulosics from certified sustainably managed forests is compelling in a market  where sustainability is a driving consumer behavior Now with our Circular Economy technology  we will commercialize Naia with recycled content  which makes the consumer even more excited and more compelled to buy our product  Overall  we ve made outstanding progress in driving new business revenue  This has made our results more resilient in the current difficult environment  and it positions us for strong growth  as the economy rebounds The next year I ll cover is on slide 12  and it s about our investments in building an even more capable and efficient organization to execute our strategy  We are making great progress in our commercial capability  We implemented an improved business operating model  that is dramatically enhancing our decision making to deliver growth and manage costs  We re also seeing significant improvement with our CRM investments  and are making several other digital investments  And application development investments are helping accelerate our commercialization rate of our innovation programs At the same time  we re also driving efficiency in how we offset inflation and these investment costs  As you can see with the bar graph  we are a disciplined operator in how we manage our costs relative to our peers  especially with this level of innovation efforts in our portfolio  And in these uncertain times  we are going to step up productivity significantly  as I mentioned on the third quarter call  We have developed a program to reduce our cost structure  net of inflation  by greater than  100 million  and as I said  we will get  20 million to  40 million of it  in 2020 We will achieve these results in three areas  first  site optimization will allow us to adjust our footprint to these new market conditions  One example is our Singapore plant that makes olefins  We have made the difficult decision to not renew our raw material supply contract by the end of 2020  giving us options to realize  25 million of benefits  We also have a few other sites under consideration in the one third of AFP Second  we have digital and other productivity investments  We have a wide range of productivity initiatives across maintenance  energy efficiency  improving yield and business process improvements  Third  we are driving supply chain optimization  as we look at opportunities across the globe  to adjust to changes in customer and geographic mix  In today s world  we must build our capability  continue to improve our safety performance  and at the same time  improve our cost structure to win On slide 13  in addition to building an even more capable and efficient organization  there are additional actions we are taking to improve our performance  First  better leveraging our sites could yield  30 million to  60 million in recurring EBIT by the end of three years  For example  we recently welcomed two new strategic tenants to our site in Texas City  Gulf Coast Ammonia and Air Products  At our site in St  Gabriel  Louisiana  we are building a new asset leveraging integration in alkylamines  to support  Indecipherable  innovative growth of their  Indecipherable  system  and we have several additional opportunities in development Second  we also see an opportunity to develop    to step up our level of licensing  that could contribute another  25 million to  50 million in EBIT to our results in the next three years  Eastman has a rich portfolio of innovative technologies  that have significant value  such as olefins and acetyls  and a strong history of licensing We expect to step up this value creation with the partnership we have had with JM Davy technologies  which is expected to create a meaningful benefit in 2020  We developed a new mono ethylene glycol technology that could use a variety of raw materials  including coal  natural gas or biomass  unlike the majority of the world MEG  which is currently made from ethylene  This is the first of a number of agreements in the works Lastly  as we discussed in October  on our third quarter call  we remain fully committed to taking actions in the one third of AFP  that has demonstrated more volatility than we expected in this challenging environment  These actions could be restructuring  partnerships or potential divestment  We are actively looking at all these options recognizing that they d be sensitive to current market conditions  These actions  better leveraging our sites  stepping up licensing and portfolio optimization will continue to create value for Eastman  and are important contributors to our success in 2020 and for the next few years Finally on slide 14  let me bring everything together  I just shared with you our multi year plan of actions we will take to improve performance in the coming years and win  Yet  none of this happens without the dedication and persistence of the people of Eastman  who continue to rise to the occasion and prove every day that they are the get it done team and bring to life  our commitment of enhancing the quality of life in a material way When the macroeconomic challenges reverse and we know they will  it s our innovative driven growth model that will allow us to be poised to create even more of our own growth  through innovation and leadership in specialty markets  In the meantime  big picture  we will continue to focus on what we can control and remain committed to long term attractive earnings growth  and sustainable value creation forerunners  and for all of our stakeholders With that  I ll turn it back to Greg Gregory A  Riddle    Vice President  Investor RelationsAll right  thanks Mark  As usual  we ve got a lot of people on the line this morning and we d like to get to as many questions as possible  So I ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up  With that  Deanna  we are ready for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions   We will now take our first question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead  your line is open Vincent Andrews    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThank you  Good morning everyone  Mark  maybe you could just talk about the volume growth in Advanced Materials  which continues to be impressive on an absolute and relative basis  versus what we re hearing elsewhere  Can you maybe just talk about how insulated or how much of a moat you have around that volume  We re hearing sort of generically  a pickup in competitive behavior and decreases in pricing and pricing is still holding up well  So how are you staying so differentiated there in an obviously difficult environment Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Vincent  Good morning  Yeah  great question and it s really the heart of the whole company strategy around having a innovation driven growth model  as a way you create your own growth in tough environments  as well as defend your margins  Across the entire segment  we ve been investing in innovation and this is    2019 is sort of our decade of continuous earnings growth through it The differentiation really comes from innovating differentiated and sustainable products that are important to the marketplace  So our Triton success  which is a patented proprietary product being the only solution that is BPA free for polycarbonate placement  continues to have tremendous success in housewares and durables  and now growing in medical and that s just the story that continues to deliver performance  It s the same thing with heads up display interlayers and acoustic interlayers  where you can significantly enhance the driver experience and enable lightweighting in a car  and where we have not just this generation  but are now launching the next generation of even better HUD in acoustic as we speak  and this year to continue to drive differentiation and growth in that space  Same thing with paint protection films  where we ve launched the best product to the marketplace last year  rolled out new software where we have the best cutting software support for the dealers  So it s always about enhancing and developing new features and growing these businesses at much higher rates than the underlying market This segment has a lot of consumer discretionary exposure  whether its autos or appliances or electronics that the underlying markets are down and we felt that some    in our core interlayers or some of our core copolyesters  But it s that innovation allows you to continue to grow  and why our model works so wellVincent Andrews    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  And as a follow up  could I just ask you that    I believe you said you planned on paying down more debt this year versus last year with a similar amount of free cash flow  So I m just curious what s driving that decision versus share repurchases  and congrats to Curt Curt E  Espeland    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks Vince For the question and the comment as well  So as you know  we are always disciplined with our capital allocation across those buckets of share repurchases  bolt on acquisitions and pay down of debt  And we you consider all three of them as very viable ways to create value for our stockholders  So as we finish 2019  we ended up shifting our cap allocation of that excess cash toward more further de levering as a priority  and as Mark mentioned  that s going to continue in 2020  So the result was that  we used  370 million of our free cash flow for pay down versus the original  300 million that we promised So what we re looking at now for    if you look at 2020  that kind of discipline is going to be maintained  So we re kind of looking at    if you think about that   1 billion to  1 1 billion and let s just take the midpoint of  1 050 billion  So  350 million of it will go kind of toward that increasing dividend that we re very proud of  Greater than  400 million will be used to reduce debt at a minimum  And then I m sorry    and at a minimum  we will repurchase shares to offset dilution  which is roughly  50 million  So that remaining  200 million to  300 million of free cash flow is going to be applied for acquisitions  additional share repurchases or further debt pay down  and really that s going to depend how the macro environment plays out  and that we will probably kind of hold that extra choices till the second half of this year  just so we have more time to see how it plays out OperatorAnd we will now take our next questionGregory A  Riddle    Vice President  Investor RelationsOperator  can we have the   OperatorOur next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank  Please go ahead  your line is open David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThank you  Good morning  Mark  on the one third of AFP that you ve identified for potential action here  Have you    how much more clarity do you have on a potential option today than you did three months ago  and are outright sales possible or even likely for some of these businesses  Thank you Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks David  Good morning  So we are looking at all the options  This environment requires us to be thoughtful about what options makes sense  Certainly  we re looking at everything we can do on the restructuring front  and driving both innovation as well as how it optimizes the cost structure in this environment  and then we re looking at partnering and divestment options  as things we consider  Divestment is certainly in the consideration set  but we ve got to make sure we don t overreact to short term challenges in the marketplace  make sure we understand the impact of the restructuring activities for understanding both  the qualities  businesses  as well as how we position them to a potential new owner  So we re going to keep driving it forward and we ll update you  when we have more clarity David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystAnd Mark just on    in the businesses that saw destocking over the last three to five quarters  etc  is all that do you think done  and where do we stand with supply chains and inventory levels heading into 2020 across your businesses  Any customers  Thank you Curt E  Espeland    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I d say  across the entire company in most places  I think we ve seen channels destock in Advanced Materials  I think the destocking has run its course  and even maybe a little bit of stabilization and inventory management  in a few of those businesses  In AFP  I d say it s mostly destocked in the channels and we re more looking at where primary demand goes at this point  As I mentioned ag   Functional means and CI is one place where you could see some additional destocking here in the first quarter  We do believe in net volume growth for that business  assuming a normal weather pattern here in North America  but it may not be as dramatic as we still have a bit of inventory to work off  But I would say in North America  where the economy has been stronger  there is probably people sitting on a bit more inventory than where Asian and European customers are  So there is always a risk  if the U S  economy slows down  you could see a better destocking there  So we ll just have to see how it plays out  But I do think net net  the vast majority the destocking is behind us  and that lack of it will provide some volume growth this year versus last year  assuming similar economic growth between the two years David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThank you OperatorWe will now take our next question from PJ Juvekar from Citi  Please go ahead  your line is open Prashant Juvekar    Citigroup    AnalystYes  thank you  First of all  Curt  congratulations on your retirement Curt E  Espeland    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  PJ Prashant Juvekar    Citigroup    AnalystAnd congrats to Eastman as well for your centennial year  I know it s not easy to survive for 100 years  through all the depressions and wars and all that  So congratulations Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  We re proud of it Prashant Juvekar    Citigroup    AnalystSo  a question on some of Taminco assets  care chemicals  I think they have a lot of pass through pricing  feed additives  and in the last quarter you had mentioned about Asian swine flu  So can you just update on some of those intermediate products  Thank you Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOverall  the Taminco businesses are doing great across the portfolio  with the exception of the formic acid business that we called out in the third quarter  which was a small acquisition Taminco had done  just ahead of us buying Taminco  But when we look at the core alklyamine platform  which is what we are centering acquiring care chemicals  has delivered really strong growth and very stable margins as you just highlighted  with cost pass through contracts Water treatment is having really great growth in this environment  with the environmental trends out there and again  doing quite well  stable margins  And then as you look at the functional means going into ag  those    again very stable margins  given the market structures and the contracts we have in place  Obviously  there is demand that goes up and down with the seasons But overall  the whole portfolio has really been been great  The management team has been great  We ve had phenomenal retention of the talent and the cost structure has been well managed Prashant Juvekar    Citigroup    AnalystThank you  And then for my follow up  I have sort of a big picture question  I know you ve done some bolt on acquisitions over the years  but stayed away from any major M A since Solutia deal  So in this slow environment  why not use low rates to get some growth  One company in Wilmington has some businesses for sale  especially in transportation  I know this is a large deal  but would you have risk appetite in looking at a deal of that size Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo PJ  I think we ve been really proud of the portfolio transformation  way ahead of what people are doing in the industry now  where we divested  3 5 billion of revenue of underperforming businesses  and did great acquisitions with Solutia and Taminco and some bolt ons to add  4 2 billion of great attractive businesses  So I think we have a very impressive track record of not just doing good acquisitions at good prices  where we paid nine times EBITDA for the things that we bought  and have delivered very attractive returns with the synergies that we delivered  So we re very much open to portfolio management  both in and out of the portfolio  But when we look at the market conditions right now  they seem to be very expensive  and so we don t see that there is opportunities out there  especially large ones that are financially attractive More importantly  we like the portfolio that we have  and we ve been focused on making sure we deliver return to our shareholders for the money that we spent on these acquisitions up through  14  and deliver growth and I think we ve done that quite well  If you look at the two specialty businesses  we ve had before the trade war started  over  600 million EBITDA growth from  14 to  18  one third of that was acquisition  but two thirds of it was organic growth that came from these acquisitions  as well as the core Eastman businesses  So we feel good about how we can integrate acquisitions  So I m not saying we ll never do anything  but large ones right now don t seem necessary or financially prudent Curt E  Espeland    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd PJ If I could add  I m still a traditionalist and since Willie and I both went to the same MBA school  I think it will continue  And that is  when we look at investments  whether it s acquisitions or organic growth  we look at things on an unlevered basis  So that way  we make sure we re driving good value without considering the leverage  And then once we find good opportunities and or growth programs  we find great ways to finance it  So we ll continue to look at things in a disciplined  unlevered basis Prashant Juvekar    Citigroup    AnalystThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America  Please go ahead  your line is open Matthew DeYoe    Bank of America    AnalystGood morning  So  by my numbers  raw materials and Advanced Materials were maybe something like a  50 million tailwind to the second half of  19  and you mentioned giving some of that back with lower prices  but I think things get fairly sticky with Triton  and you did absorb a lot of inflation in 2018  So when it comes to 2020  where should we think about annualization of the second half tailwinds  Should there be more give back  Is there more opportunity  yeah  if you can expand on that Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  If you look at Advanced Materials  the main driver of their growth continues to be innovation and volume growth  and then there is an opportunity to really keep pricing off of what we d call the product performance  There is some input costs that do vary  and they did have some tailwind in 2019  I think some of that will moderate  but it will still be there  And I think they ve shown good discipline on pricing of their products  relative to the performance it provides  And so that s why we think this business will grow at mid single digits EBIT in 2020 Curt E  Espeland    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe do    I mean we do expect prices to come down a little bit  as you share some of the raw material value  We ve had thorough conversations with investors on previous calls on this topic  but we expect to hold onto a good portion of it  More importantly  we re going to have volume and mix growth  that is the heart of our strategy across the company  as well as the fixed cost leverage and other cost management activities that sort of flow into the segment Matthew DeYoe    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  And then I know you plan on the bolt on  Phonetic   a little bit more of this to come  but opportunities at Crystex  you doubled capacity in Malaysia and the market has been under pressure since  So I got to think that some are older cats and dogs out there  like these facilities  can you imagine opportunities for footprint rationalization there Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo that s one of the areas  where we ve added advantaged technology with the capacity that we added  that produces a far better product  which we call Cure Pro  relative to the current product we make  as well as our competitors  So we can help customers improve their tire mixing efficiency by 10  to 20  on their tire plants  So the new capacity is also differentiated and advantaged  and we are now looking at the overall footprint in this business  Just look at where demand is  where we expect demand to grow  what sort of assets really makes sense in that  and then we ll make some decisions on what s appropriate as we go forward Matthew DeYoe    Bank of America    AnalystThank you OperatorNext question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners  Please go ahead  your line is open Kevin McCarthy    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystYes  good morning  Mark  I m intrigued by your program to leverage your sites  I think you indicated  30 million to  60 million of benefit on the EBIT line over the next three years  Can you talk a little bit about  which sites are in play  Are there any beyond for the GCA and Air Products project at Texas City  How will that flow through over the next three years  and which segments might be affected Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo we did an acquisition at Sterling  the Texas City site  which is just a phenomenal site  when you look at the scale  infrastructure  ports  rail everything  It s just a great opportunity to leverage  and this is a great example    one of I think several that will have at Texas City  and how we can sort of provide that site opportunity and the Gulf Coast Ammonia and the Air Products project set a great example of what several other opportunities could look like So I d see multiple things there  I d say what we re doing at St  Gabriel is more unique to supporting  Indecipherable  off our alkylamine platform  But there are other sites around the world we re looking at  But I do think it can be substantial and very reliably and predictable earnings William T  McLain  Jr     Vice President of FinanceYes  Kevin  this is Willie  if I may add  I would also highlight the fact that on a segment basis that we would see that primarily benefiting CI and the Additives   Functional products businesses today  But as we think about further integration beyond those two projects  it could benefit other assets as well Kevin McCarthy    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystOkay  Then a financial question for Curt or Willie perhaps  you ve raised your dividend for 10 years in a row  would you expect that streak to continue  notwithstanding the current choppy industrial production environment  What is the level of commitment to long term growth there  recognizing that it s ultimately a Board decision Curt E  Espeland    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerKevin  to your point  it is definitely    we collaborate with the Board on that decision  I think you will also see that we moderated our dividend as our dividend payout ratio is    I ll call it  gotten back in line with where we would expect it to be  post the Solutia and Taminco acquisition  and as we think about future growth  we will continue to grow it  but it will be based on the long term expectation  consistent with how we have in the past Kevin McCarthy    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystThank you  And Curt  it has been a pleasure  Willie  we look forward to working with you Curt E  Espeland    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks Kevin OperatorOur next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey  Please go ahead  your line is open James Sheehan    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystYes  thank you  Curious about your comments on an advantaged methanol contract that s expiring  are you going to be exposed to a lot more methanol price volatility  and in which segments would that occur and how would you expect to deal with it William T  McLain  Jr     Vice President of FinanceYes  this is Willie  What I would tell you is  we re diversified across our methanol exposure as we think about    we produce methanol here at our Kingsport site as well as we purchase methanol market based as well as other benchmark  So I think we ve diversified our exposure  as we think about going forward  and that exposure is primarily in our Chemical Intermediates and Additives   Functional Product segments James Sheehan    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystThanks  And can you give us your thoughts on the Corona virus impacts in China  what s embedded in your guidance for post Chinese New Year demand Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo as I said in our outlook statement  our outlook statement does not include the impact of the Corona virus  I think it s    we can all agree it s a little too early to call what those impacts were going to be  But most importantly  we re focused on safety and health of the people in China as well as around the world  including our employees  and making sure we re taking the right set of actions which we ve implemented around controlling travel within China  travel in and out of China and making sure people are as safe as possible  We do have nine plants in China and two offices  So we re focused on those and there is obviously going to be a delay  based on the Chinese extending the New Year out by one to two weeks  depending on where you look at the location  So we ll have to sort of factor that into our thinking I don t think it s a simple conclusion though  where you just look at the impact of what s going to happen to demand in China  which obviously will occur  So our customers will be shut down  but it s important to keep in mind that our competitors are going to be shut down as well  both in China  as well as how they compete around the world  So there is probably some opportunities for us to see some volume improvement outside of China  as a lot of customers have become dependent on some Chinese sources  and we want to make sure we re there to help them  when those sources may not be available  and and help them be a reliable supplier that we re proud of  our more global and diverse and reliable footprint James Sheehan    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays  Please go ahead  your line is open Duffy Fischer    Barclays    AnalystYeah  good morning  I think most of us know we had ag issues here in North America  Curt mentioned some ag issues  it sounds like  in China  So can you just kind of size the headwind that you saw in your ag business last year  and do you think you get all of that back this year to a normalization level Curt E  Espeland    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  the ag is actually animal nutrition  So it s mostly about in China  So it s mostly about the pig population that was hit by the African swine flu  It s hard to give exact numbers  but somewhere around 30  to 50  reduction in that population  which is a huge consumer of these organic acids  that we and some others sell  So we saw a volume hit associated with that  that s also contributed to some of the pricing challenges in Formic Acid  and a couple other products  So it s really that dynamic  Obviously  they ve got that flu under control  the swine flu  and with the rebuilding of that population  So we ll start to see it recover this year and next  but it doesn t snap back like the North American ag market could this year Duffy Fischer    Barclays    AnalystOkay  And then on the licensing effort  is that kind of a proactive effort on your side  that will be a lot of little projects  or is that kind of reverse inquiries  where one or two big guys are coming to you for some of your technology and we ll see one or two big lumpy contracts signed Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  our historical program is more of the former  where we get some inbound inquiries around acetyls and olefins which we always do  But what we re identifying here and calling out is this value is a more substantial proactive approach  So a number of years ago  we had developed a breakthrough technology to make MEG through an alternate process than ethylene  to leverage coal gasification and we sort of turned down that effort internally  as we focused more on specialty growth So we partner with JM Davy to work with us and finish off that technology and take it to market and leveraging their strength as a licensing organization  So we ve been in the background working that with them  and they re close to success in the first license  These licenses are are quite large and significant in the scale of what plants will be built  MEG is a critical product and this technology is a lot better than the obsolete technology they ve been trying to use  which has some quality problems  So I think it s a great opportunity for sort of multiple licenses as we go forward  Important to remember  these licenses show up in chunky ways  So it s real hard to predict exactly when they re going to hit  and you register the value Duffy Fischer    Barclays    AnalystAll right  thank you guys OperatorWe will now take our next question from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research  Please go ahead  your line is open Frank Mitsch    Fermium Research    AnalystThank you so much and best wishes  Mr  Espeland  I hope our paths continue to cross Curt E  Espeland    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you Frank Mitsch    Fermium Research    AnalystMark  I apologize I didn t quite catch what you were talking about with respect to Singapore and the raw material contract in the order of magnitude there  Can you give a little more detail there Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  I ll start and I ll let Willie finish off  The contract there was a long term supply contract that we had in place for a number of years  and it s finally coming up for expiration at the end of this year  and it allows us to terminate it and then consider other options  I will let Willie cover what those options are William T  McLain  Jr     Vice President of FinanceAs we consider as other options  obviously we look at our existing footprint and our integrated facilities in Texas to support the Chemical Intermediates business  Obviously  this gives us the ability to use that footprint  the sort of the market and the regions where we are best leveraged to compete  based on the cost curve of that business  But you can think about  probably in 2021  that we would have an improvement of  25 million versus our current run rate Frank Mitsch    Fermium Research    AnalystAll right  terrific  That s what I thought I heard  but I wanted to clarify that And you also discussed some of the    in the AFP business  the part that was doing well  You mentioned Specialty Fluids  And I know that that business can be chunky from time to time  Is there    can you expand upon what might have been the benefit that we saw in 4Q  And is that going to recur in 1Q  in your opinion Gregory A  Riddle    Vice President  Investor RelationsYeah  the  the Fluids business has been great and developed a much more robust portfolio of end market applications  So historically  it was very dependent on PET applications  for example on the heat transfer fluids  we ve now diversified into LNG facilities and some other things  So we ve diversified our market exposure  which is helpful  And we continue to have a very strong competitive position in this business relative to a couple of other small players As we see that business continuing on  there is always capital construction cycles  Frank  as you pointed out  where this business will moderate up and down  the solar field sometimes that can be fairly chunky and how they show up  It s also important to mention  that a good portion of this business is the Aviation Fluids business that is actually very steady  This is our hydraulic fluids and turbine oil fluids that go into aircraft  and have a much more stable continuous revenue stream  where we ve had great growth in revenue  as well as margin improvement  and that s just been a great acquisition that we ve done as well Frank Mitsch    Fermium Research    AnalystVery helpful and best wishes for your next 100 years Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorAnd our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead  your line is open Bob Koort    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThank you very much  Couple of questions  first  Mark on slide 12  you showed some interesting metrics around R D and admin to profitability to revenue base  I guess  I m sort of struck it would seem like that would be more favorable for commodity companies than specialties  I mean  what are the metrics do you look at from a benchmarking standpoint  that can help us sort of dimensionalize your business relative to those peers Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So Bob  I think the point we re trying to make there  is we re a very lean organization that are good stewards of our shareholders  money and trying to make sure every dollar we spend delivers a return  And I m incredibly proud of how our Chief Technology Officer has  within within the budget  transformed our technology organization in a dramatic way  So we had a lot of projects going on around process development  new technologies that we re going to have a payback for very long time  and you put those to a stop  reorient the organization much more toward application development and product development  But this AD capability we built is really the key to our success  and we ve doubled the amount of resources and capability we ve had in that business since 2014 to where we are now within that mix of spend  That AD as we explained in our Innovation Day in  18 is how we can do what our customers do  we can make a tire  we can make a windshield  we can make thermoplastic final products  we can make a coating  and so we can accelerate our innovation  accelerate the value we understand in those formulations and accelerate how we can go to market  not just with our direct customers  but downstream to drive specification through the market  by showing what we can do  So that is really the real test of it and we re  of course  adding the commercial resources  as we gear that side up and find efficiency in the support functions The metrics  I think the one that we shared with you  the new business revenue from innovation is the real test  It s the revenue we re getting every year  that s the    the metric is  year one  So it s really about the next year  when you see that  400 million last year  that s about helping this year  The  500 million we re aiming for this year  will help next year  But we keep very careful track of that and that s the most important metric to sort of say you are getting results from this portfolio  We have a bunch of internal stage gate project metrics and milestones and everything else to have good discipline  to manage our portfolio on a very disciplined way  and we re constantly optimizing and focusing and shifting resources where we see the best value Bob Koort    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  That s helpful  Thank you  And then at your third quarter call  it seems you re putting the brakes on a little bit of your working capital and production levels trying to lean out into the end of the year  Do you have any sense or can you help us quantify what that fixed cost absorption pain might have been  and when that might release  as you go through  20  Is the recovery of that an advantage to that  as you go through the year Curt E  Espeland    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  the way I d characterize it  where you are seeing that right now is kind of in the margin  So while we were able to implement the cost reduction actions  those cost reduction actions are harder to see COGS and our margins  is because we had to slow down our plans  We don t give our specific utilization rates etc  but when you get our 10 K  you ll see that our finished goods in intermediate products in inventory declined 5   Some of that is value  but also some of its     some of the slowdown we did in our production rates   Multiple Speakers   And Bob  I d just add that we re going to be careful about how we run our plants as we go into the first half of this year  So that volume growth is a way to sort of move inventory down and continue    making progress on that  It s a great opportunity for us to release a lot of cash as we go forward Bob Koort    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks guys OperatorAnd our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies  Pleas go ahead  your line is open Laurence Alexander    Jefferies    AnalystGood morning  Can you give a sense for the recycling technologies  what commodity environments would not be competitive  And secondly  I may have missed this  in terms of the spreads stabilizing in the middle to back half of the year  are you seeing competitor shutdowns helping improve the prospect for the spreads or is it purely tied to your perspective on end market demand Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Good questions  So the first one on the Circular Economy  at this point with the trends in the marketplace  it s not as much about competing against the price of oil or fossil fuel feedstocks  The train has left the station  right  you ve got legislation in Europe and coming in multiple other jurisdictions of banning single use plastics or putting what they call EPRs  Enhanced Producer Responsibility  which is basically taxes on single use plastic  So the drive for recycling and the value that it s putting on it  is creating a real cost choice  not just a consumer preference choice for brands around the world  Even China now is banning plastic bags in all major cities by the end of this year for groceries and things like that So the recycled content part  we re really excited about what we re doing  is a critical differentiator for us  Fortunately  we got out of the single use plastic business  so we re not trying to defend it  when we got rid of the PET business in 2011  We re more focused on how we provide solutions to customers around the actual recycled content  as well as put our recycled content in finished products and durables  so whole another differentiation back to Vince s questions earlier  is not only do we have a lot of product differentiation in the performance of the product  we now have a whole new vector of growth in specialty plastics  as well as over in textiles and fibers  by putting recycled content in these products  which is a very significant demand And we do think that we will get a premium relative to fossil fuel based products  for providing these solutions to the marketplace  You can look at rPET through last year in Europe  they traded at roughly a 60  premium to PET in the marketplace  I think that s a bit high  But we do think on a long term basis and we do think our technologies provide real solutions  because we can access feedstock that s going to landfill not compete against some mechanical recycled streams  So the cost structure for us will be more advantaged for our feedstock  because it has no alternative value  and that s an important differentiator for what we re doing  So we feel really good about that and we feel like  we re in a good differentiated position to sort of move those programs forward in both AM and fibers The second question was on spreads in the back half of last year  As we said  you know  spreads declined through the back half relative to the first half of  19  as people realize that the economy was not going to improve with the settlement of the trade war  and so that elongated economic stress led to a more competitive behavior  in particular  CI and that one third of AFP In CI  we do see prices very much stabilizing out relative to competitors  who are hitting their cash cost in Asia  So we have seen that  and we are seeing people will start moderating run rates or potentially shut down plants temporarily  I m not sure I think any of these plants are going to shut down permanently  So when the market recovers  some of these people will come back in the marketplace  which is why we ve been cautious on how we think about spreads this year and we re assuming spreads do not improve this year  And so I think we re in a good place there Laurence Alexander    Jefferies    AnalystThank you OperatorAnd our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS  Please go ahead  your line is open John Roberts    UBS    AnalystYes  best wishes Curt  and welcome Willie  I assume most of the lower raw materials for the overall company are purchased  paraxylene and glycols  but could you talk a little bit about acetyls and propylene  Did the Advanced Materials in fiber segment benefit from the lower acetyls prices  And how does lower propylene play out between C I and AFP Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo you re correct polyester benefited from lower PX prices  The olefins benefited from lower ethane and propane prices  as well as a propylene supply contract that s formulated to propane  So we saw a raw material benefits in the olefin chain  On the asset yield chain  we are coal based on how we make our our asset yields with our gasifier  coal prices have been relatively stable  so there wasn t any tailwind there John Roberts    UBS    AnalystThank you OperatorAnd our next question comes from Matthew Blair from Tudor Pickering Holt  Please go ahead  your line is open Matthew Blair    Tudor Pickering Holt    AnalystGood morning  Willie  could you quantify the currency impact on EPS in 2019 William T  McLain  Jr     Vice President of FinanceYes  it s basically consistent with what we were saying in Q3  which is about  0 30 a share  So it was slightly up  I d also remind you that about 85  of that s in our Advanced Materials  and it is in Functional Products businesses Matthew Blair    Tudor Pickering Holt    AnalystGreat  And then could you provide any color on the overall trajectory of the business during Q4  You do come in a little bit above the midpoint guidance provided in October  Does that imply that things are picking up a little bit in December Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThey did  So we had a good October  we had a weak November that gave us some concern about what might happen in December  And then both volume came in better than expected and cost came in quite a bit better than expected on the raw material side Matthew Blair    Tudor Pickering Holt    AnalystGreat  thank you Gregory A  Riddle    Vice President  Investor RelationsLet s make the next question our last one  please OperatorSo the last question comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo  Please go ahead  your line is open Michael Sison    Wells Fargo    AnalystHey  guys  Curt congrats and it was great working with you  In terms of your outlook for AFP  I just want to make sure I understood flat to down for EBIT  The specialty side  the two thirds grow pretty    there is a grow next year  maybe mid single digits and the one third that s more challenged  down double digits or something  Can you just give us a little bit of color on each of the pieces Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  so first of all through  19  the two thirds did quite well as Curt laid out  prices were relatively flat outside of the cost pass through contracts  and we expect that continue this year  where prices will be stable and we saw a raw material benefits as a result  we saw volume growth and we have this headwind  especially in these high value additives for automotive in China net out to being modestly down for last year  So as we look at this year  we see volume  we see raws stable as well as pricing  so that s going to deliver some growth as well as some cost reduction  So you do see some earnings growth in the two third side of the portfolio  And you re correct  the potential for down net earnings for the AFP segment is in the one third segment  as we take in those lower spreads from the back half of last year We do regain some volume  so as we had good discipline on pricing through the first half of 2019  we lost some volume in adhesives and tires regaining that with some pricing in the fourth quarter  So will have a volume improvement  but some pricing down net in the one third  as well as you re going to have some earnings challenges there  just given where spreads are at this point  So I think you re directionally correct Michael Sison    Wells Fargo    AnalystGreat and then one quick one on China  it s been a good growth business for several years  How are you on capacity  Do you need to add capacity or do you have enough to sort of support the growth that you re seeing Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe re well positioned capacity  We had doubled the capacity in 2018  because we had run our capacity  because the volume growth had been so strong  This was one of several plants that we brought online in 2018  where volume was really great  across AFP and AM  with the growth we ve been having  until the trade war hit  So we re well positioned to support growth there Curt E  Espeland    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd if I could add  Mike  that s an example for this business  not only you get volume growth  you get mix upgrade  and now you get fixed cost leverage as well Michael Sison    Wells Fargo    AnalystGreat  thank you Mark J  Costa    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  everyone Gregory A  Riddle    Vice President  Investor RelationsThanks again everyone for

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 77   A quarter ago  it was expected that this specialty chemicals maker would post earnings of  1 99 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 94  delivering a surprise of  2 51  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Eastman Chemical  which belongs to the Zacks Chemical   Diversified industry  posted revenues of  2 21 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 56   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 38 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Eastman Chemical shares have lost about 10 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 3  
What s Next for Eastman Chemical 
While Eastman Chemical has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Eastman Chemical was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 83 on  2 42 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  7 65 on  9 41 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Chemical   Diversified is currently in the bottom 11  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eastman-chemical-emn-q4-earnings-and-revenues-beat-estimates-200503389,200503389
134753,356268,EMN,Earnings Preview  Eastman Chemical  EMN  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Eastman Chemical  EMN  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This specialty chemicals maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 99 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15  
Revenues are expected to be  2 37 billion  down 7 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 44  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Eastman Chemical 
For Eastman Chemical  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 10  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Eastman Chemical will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Eastman Chemical would post earnings of  2 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 99  delivering a surprise of  4 78  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Eastman Chemical doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-eastman-chemical-emn-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200474650,200474650

134815,356330,EMN,Analysts Estimate Eastman Chemical  EMN  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Eastman Chemical  EMN  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This specialty chemicals maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 09 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 9  
Revenues are expected to be  2 54 billion  down 3 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 22  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Eastman Chemical 
For Eastman Chemical  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 39  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Eastman Chemical will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Eastman Chemical would post earnings of  1 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 77  delivering a surprise of  7 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once

Eastman Chemical shares have added about 11 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for Eastman Chemical 
While Eastman Chemical has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Eastman Chemical was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

134832,356347,EMN,Earnings Preview  Eastman Chemical  EMN  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Eastman Chemical  EMN  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This specialty chemicals maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 91 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 60 billion  down 0 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 14  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Eastman Chemical 
For Eastman Chemical  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  6 09  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Eastman Chemical will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Eastman Chemical would post earnings of  1 60 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 39  delivering a surprise of  13 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise

Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Eastman Chemical 
For Eastman Chemical  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 33  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Eastman Chemical will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Eastman Chemical would post earnings of  2 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 34  delivering a surprise of  2 18

134865,356380,EMN,Eastman Chemical  EMN  Misses Q4 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Eastman Chemical  EMN  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 39 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 60 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 62 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  13 13   A quarter ago  it was expected that this specialty chemicals maker would post earnings of  2 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 34  delivering a surprise of 2 18  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Eastman Chemical  which belongs to the Zacks Chemical   Diversified industry  posted revenues of  2 38 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 94   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 36 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Eastman Chemical shares have added about 12 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 7  
What s Next for Eastman Chemical 
While Eastman Chemical has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Eastman Chemical was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

My Market Sentiment
The rising trend line off of December lows was broken  I don t think this is cause to sound the alarm  I think more importantly it may just be that the trajectory of the current rally has changed in terms of steepness  Potential for further weakness to result in a re test of the 200 day moving average

134936,356451,EMN,6 Shorts To Avoid,opinion,"I hesitate to write this  but it could be weeks before we see another hearty selloff  Perhaps many weeks 
Listen  there s not a soul on this planet that enjoys a market plunge more than I do  However  the rapid descent of the market has a flip side to it  which is that the  healing  process required to put prices at appealing shorting levels again can be slow and grinding  After all  the bulls are scared witless during such a plunge  so they are going to be hesitant  cautious and very measured when they resume buying 
Never Again
This varies from sector to sector  of course  but what I ve done below is take a sample of six stocks that I was short  prior to covering them late last week  to show just how far away they are from resistance  that is  a good shorting price   As happy as I was to be short these before  I wouldn t dare short them at present price levels  because they are miles away from what I would consider a logical stop loss point 
Of course  one other possibility is that these companies are in such trouble that they simple resume their plunge and don t even bother trying to  re capture  those higher prices  But I wanted to show you some extreme examples to illustrate that even a multi week rise in equity prices does not necessarily indicate that the first two weeks in October were meaningless

134945,356460,EMN,Near Term Prospects Cloudy For Diversified Chemical Stocks  ,opinion,The Zacks  industry consists of manufacturers of basic chemicals  plastics  specialty chemicals and agricultural chemicals  Companies in this space serve a host of end use markets such as automotive  building   construction  transportation  electronics  aerospace and agriculture Basic chemicals are produced in large quantities and include petrochemicals and intermediates  such as ethylene  propylene and benzene   polymers  including plastic resins such as polyethylene  polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride  and inorganic chemicals  such as chlorine  caustic soda and titanium dioxide   Specialty chemicals that include catalysts  surfactants  speciality polymers  coating additives and oilfield chemicals are used in specific fields based on their performance  Agricultural chemicals include herbicides  fungicides and insecticides that are used to protect crops from disease  pests and weeds Here are the three major themes in the industry The diversified chemical industry is facing the challenges emanating from the ongoing trade war between the United States and China  Notably  China is one of the biggest export markets for U S  chemicals and  thus  leaves the American chemical industry heavily exposed to Beijing s retaliatory trade actions  The trade tariffs have created an uncertain demand environment for U S  chemical products in China  Companies in this space are exposed to headwinds from a spike in costs of raw materials as a result of short supply  partly due to production outages and plant shutdowns  China s environmental crackdown has led to the tightening in the supply of certain key raw materials as a result of plant closures  The disruption in the supply chain has pushed up prices of these inputs  Nevertheless  the companies should be able to offset the concerns with the ongoing strategic measures  including cost cutting and productivity improvement  earnings accretive acquisitions and aggressive price increase actions  These actions should help them alleviate any pressure on margin  Moreover  continued shift of focus toward high growth markets should help revive demand  U S  chemical makers are spending heavily on chemical production projects to beef up capacity  The shale gas revolution in the United States has been a huge driving force behind chemical investments in plants and equipment in the country  And currently  the U S  petrochemical industry is in the middle of a shale induced investment boom  leveraging access to abundant and cheaper feedstock  The shale bounty has provided U S  producers a compelling cost advantage over their global counterparts and incentivized a number of companies to plough billions of dollars for setting up facilities  crackers  in the United States to produce key feedstocks like ethylene and propylene in a cost effective way  Such investments are expected to boost capacity and export Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry is part of the broader Zacks  Sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  203  which places it at the bottom 21  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates gloomy near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Before we present a few diversified chemical stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a

the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector over the past year The industry has declined 26 8  over this period compared with the S P 500 s rise of 5 2  and broader sector s fall of 14 2  One Year Price Performance  Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing chemical stocks  the industry is currently trading at 8 65X  below the S P 500 s 10 87X  However  it is ahead of the sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 7 42X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 19 79X  as low as 6 59X  with a median of 9 79X  as the chart below shows Enterprise Value EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio  Enterprise Value EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio Bottom LineEscalating trade tussle between the United States and China pose challenges to the diversified chemical industry  Moreover  margins of the companies in this space will remain under pressure amid an inflationary environment given the spike in input costs Nevertheless  strategic actions including expansion of scale through acquisitions  operational efficiency improvement  capacity expansion and continued focus on cost and productivity should keep them afloat over the short haul Here  we present two stocks sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  that are well positioned to gain amid the prevailing challenges  There are

134959,356474,EMN,5 Dividend Paying Chemical Stocks To Enrich Your Portfolio,opinion,The chemical industry demonstrated a stellar performance in fourth quarter 2017  A host of companies in the space delivered better than expected earnings driven by strategic measures like pricing actions  improving productivity  restructuring of portfolio and earnings accretive acquisitions along with continued strong demand across automotive and construction markets  Moreover  President Donald Trump s business friendly tax reform contributed to the impressive performance The chemical industry is grouped

sector participants posted earnings beat and around 73 7  surpassed revenue expectations How are Things Shaping Up in the Chemical Industry The chemical industry is benefiting from a resurgent global economy and strength across major end use markets including automotive and construction  Moreover  the fundamentals across the energy space  another key market for chemicals  have been improving lately  A rebound in crude oil prices has helped recover demand for chemicals in the energy market Healthy Demand and Exports to Drive U S  Chemical  The U S  chemical industry is likely to benefit from capital investments  higher demand across housing markets and light vehicles and improving export markets Latin America and Asia   two of the key export markets for the industry   are expected to play a significant role in the growth of basic chemical production this year and the next  Moreover  strengthening export markets along with increasing capital spending have been driving the demand for chemicals across key end use markets such as light vehicles and housing   Per the industry trade group  American Chemistry Council   ACC    the U S  chemical production  excluding pharmaceuticals  is expected to rise 3 7  in 2018 and further accelerate to 3 9  in 2019 Continued Investments to Boost Growth  The United States remains an attractive destination for investment and the domestic chemical makers continue enjoying the availability of cheaper and abundant feedstocks and energy  which is driving investments in chemical projects The chemical industry invested  185 billion in restarting plants  expansions and building new factories across the United States with more than 50  of these projects under the planning stage  per the ACC  This is likely to boost capacity and exports in the long run Revival of the EU Chemical Industry  The European chemical industry is finally experiencing an upturn after a long time  thanks to an improving global economic sentiment and positive developments across the Eurozone  which is driven by factors like monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank  declining unemployment  strengthening consumer and business confidence Per the European Chemical Industry Council   CEFIC    chemical output in the EU rose above the pre economic crisis level for the first time in fourth quarter 2017  CEFIC projects the chemical output in EU to rise 2  year over year in 2018 How Dividend Paying Stocks Can Boost Your PortfolioIn addition to the positive developments mentioned earlier  we believe that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be another major tailwind for dividend paying stocks in the chemical space The newly introduced tax reform significantly reduces the corporate tax rate from 35  to 21   which is a positive for chemical stocks  This is expected to boost their bottom line  improve cash flows and incentivize capital investment  Moreover  many of the companies are likely to pay more dividends and buyback shares reaping

135005,356520,EMN,Should You Buy Eastman Chemical  EMN  Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Eastman Chemical Company   NYSE EMN   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because Eastman Chemical is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings with the most up to date information possible is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for EMN in this report Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for EMN  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of  17 85  heading into earnings season Eastman Chemical Company Price and EPS Surprise   Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that EMN has a Zacks Rank  3 and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Eastman Chemical  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-buy-eastman-chemical-emn-ahead-of-earnings-200285376,200285376
135022,356537,EMN,Can Eastman Chemical  EMN  Prove To Be Suitable Value Pick ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Eastman Chemical Company   NYSE EMN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Eastman Chemical has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 4  This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 7 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Eastman Chemical s current PE above its median over the observed period  which stands at 11 6x   Hence  we could infer that the stock is overvalued in this respect  especially in light of its historical trend Nevertheless  the stock s PE compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Eastman Chemical has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 12 1   lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Eastman Chemical stock in the near term PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Eastman Chemical has a P S ratio of about 1 4  This is lower than the industry average  which comes in at 1 7x right now EMN is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Eastman Chemical currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Eastman Chemical a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Eastman Chemical is just 1 4  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 3  which is far better than the industry average of 11 6  Clearly  EMN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Eastman Chemical might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of D  This gives EMN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward revisions and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased 0 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus   The somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineEastman Chemical is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front It boasts a favorable industry rank   among the top 24  out of more than 250 industries  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below Meanwhile  Eastman Chemical remains focused on cost cutting and productivity actions amid a challenging operating environment  Further  the company should gain from its strategic acquisitions and capacity expansion actions  It also remains committed to reduce debt and boost shareholder returns leveraging healthy free cash flows However  Eastman Chemical continues to face pricing pressure  The company is also exposed to weakness in its Fibers unit and raw material price volatility  A Zacks Rank  3 also dims the sparkle on the company as of now So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2017-10-10,Zacks Investment

135059,356574,EMN,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include Merck  Haemonetics  LKQ  Eastman Chemical And Honeywell International,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 27  2017   Stocks in this week s article include Merck   Co   NYSE    NYSE MRK        Haemonetics  NYSE    NYSE HAE        LKQ Corp   Nasdaq    NASDAQ LKQ        Eastman Chemical Co   NYSE    NYSE EMN       and Honeywell International  NYSE    NYSE HON       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research by Kevin Matras Top Stocks with Big Potential Catch up MovesGiven the recent run up in the market  here s a screen I ve been using recently for my own stock picking First  it focuses on the top Zacks Ranked Sectors and Industries  Then it focuses on the Zacks Rank  1s   2s and  3s  which are Strong Buys  Buys and Holds  respectively  But then it selects the outperforming stocks with the smallest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks Why would I do something like that Here s why You ve probably heard the old adage that roughly half of a stock s price movement can be attributed to the group that it s in  And that s true  In fact  oftentimes  even a mediocre stock in a top group will outperform a top stock in a poor group for this very reason Now  take a look at any top group  You ll see plenty of fantastic stocks with some impressive price gains in there  But not every stock in every group moves in lockstep at the exact same time  Some will move more than others at any given time So by focusing on the stocks with the smallest percentage price change with fundamentals that are just as good as those making the biggest price change  you might find yourself getting into the stocks ready to make the biggest potential catch up move Here s how to set up that screen   Best Zacks Ranked Sectors    Best 8We re screening for only those stocks with the best  lowest  average Zacks Rank  With 16 sectors  the best 8 sectors give us the best 50  of sectors   Best Zacks Ranked Industries    Best 132Next step is to get only the best Zacks Ranked Industries coming thru  Since there are 264  X  or expanded industries we look at  the best 132 will give us the best 50  of industries  But note that only the industries that also happen to be in the top sectors will get thru  If an industry is ranked as one of the best but it s outside of the top sector rank  it will not get thru   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 3Now the screen gets narrowed down even more by looking at only the Zacks Rank  1s   2s and  3s  No Sells or Strong Sells  Zacks Rank  4s and  5s  allowed   Price and Avg  Volume greater than or equal to  5 and 100 000 sharesOnly stocks over  5 with at least an average of 100 0000 shares traded daily will be considered   Relative   Price Change    4 Weeks greater than 0This means we re screening for only those stocks that have outperformed the market  S P 500  over the last 4 weeks     Change in Price    4 Weeks  Bottom 50Then finally we re scanning for the bottom 50 stocks with the lowest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks  So while all of these stocks have outperformed the market  they increased in price less than their peers So each one of these stocks is in a top Sector and top Industry within that Sector  This alone will tip the odds of success in your favor by a great deal when you consider that the best Zacks Ranked groups outperform the worst ones by a factor of 2 to 1 Then by selecting those stocks with the best Zacks Rank along with the best price performance over the last 4 weeks  you now have only a list of winners from which to choose from And from that list of winners  we re selecting the ones that have gained less than their peers on that list  Remember  these stocks aren t  dogs  or unresponsive stocks  Quite the contrary  they have all outperformed the market  It just so happens that they increased less than the others on the list  But because they are a top rated stock in a top rated industry  we ve singled these out as the ones that could make the biggest move to  catch up  to the others It s an interesting screen that has generated a lot of great names Here are 5 from that list  NYSE       Merck   Co  NYSE       Haemonetics Nasdaq       LKQ Corp  NYSE       Eastman Chemical Co  NYSE       Honeywell InternationalAll great looking stocks that seem to have lots more upside in store for them Get the rest of the

135106,356621,EMN,Is Eastman Chemical Company  EMN  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Eastman Chemical Company   NYSE EMN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Eastman Chemical has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 14  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 34  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Eastman Chemical s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Chemicals  Diversified industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 78  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Eastman Chemical has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 17  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Eastman Chemical stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Eastman Chemical has a P S ratio of about 1 36  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 16 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Eastman Chemical currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Eastman Chemical a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Eastman Chemical is just 1 41  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 70  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  EMN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Eastman Chemical might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  B  This gives EMN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been favorable enough  The current year has seen seven estimates going higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the next year estimate has seen five upward and no downward movements in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 2 35  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 1 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus   This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near termBottom LineEastman Chemical is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  its strong Zacks Rank  Top 9  out of more than 250 industries   In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Chemical Diversified industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pickToday s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017

135196,356711,EMN,What Are The Roadblocks For The Chemical Industry ,opinion,"Chemical makers should benefit from continued strength in the automotive industry and strategic measures including expansion into high growth markets  aggressive cost management  acquisitions and investment on capacity expansion  However  a number of challenges continue to hamstring the industry  There are a few reasons to be watchful about the chemical industry in the near term  which we have outlined below 
China Worries Continue
Economic cooling in China    a major market for chemicals    remains a deterrent over the near term  China s economy hit a wall in 2015  growing at its slowest pace in 25 years as a raft of government stimulus measures  including interest rate cuts  failed to stabilize its financial markets  The world s second biggest economy remains hamstrung by its tepid property market and weak private investment  which is contributing to its sluggish economic growth 
China s GDP grew 6 7  in the second quarter of 2016  the same as what was witnessed in the first  but still its weakest pace since the financial crisis 
The country s GDP expanded 6 9  in 2015  a marked deceleration from the 7 3  a year ago  The International Monetary Fund  IMF  projects growth in China to moderate to 6 6  in 2016 and 6 2  in 2017  This partly reflects weaker investment growth as the economy continues to rebalance  As such  a sluggish Chinese economy may weigh on demand for chemicals in this significant market 
Eurozone Economy Sputtering Along
The European economy is still not out of the woods  as evident from the lackluster Eurozone GDP growth of 0 3  in the second quarter of 2016  slowing from a 0 6  growth in the first  per preliminary estimates published by Eurostat  France    the Eurozone s second biggest economy    witnessed complete stagnation in the quarter after racking up 0 7  growth in the previous quarter  hurt by disruptions from labor strikes  Political and economic uncertainties brought forth by Brexit are expected to hinder Eurozone s economic growth in the short term 
Sluggishness in some of Europe s major economies continues to deter recovery of the chemical industry in that region  Western Europe continues to pose challenges on chemical stocks due to weak demand  thus remaining a source of near term uncertainty  Moreover  weak investments and lower pricing remain as overhangs on the European chemical industry 
Depressed Demand in the Energy Space
A low oil price environment is hindering investment in the energy sector  This is affecting demand for chemicals in this important end use market  Oil prices hit a 12 year low in Feb 2016  hurt by a surge in the U S  stockpile and prospects of weak demand  Subsequently  supply disruptions around the globe pushed up the prices of the commodity to close above the  50 per barrel mark in June 
However  oil prices tumbled more than 20  recently from the high they reached in early June on renewed concerns over a global supply glut  taking the commodity into bear market territory  Prices are expected to remain under pressure in the near term on oversupply concerns  Depressed crude oil prices will also keep chemical prices under check as they essentially move in tandem with oil prices 
Pricing  Currency Headwinds
Commodity pricing remain a concern for many  U S  chemical producers  Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy  given the competitive pressures in play  As a result  margins for a number of producers may be under pressure 
In addition  chemical companies generate a major chunk of their revenues outside the U S  and therefore are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations  A strong U S  dollar created a significant headwind for these companies during the first half of 2016 and is expected to continue to be a drag on profits in the near term 
Challenges Linger in Fertilizer Agrichemical Space
Fertilizer and agricultural chemical companies remain exposed to a difficult pricing environment  Potash prices  which are already at their lowest levels since 2007  remain under pressure due to elevated supply  The potash market is expected to remain oversupplied in the near future  thereby hurting prices  Moreover  depressed global energy prices and higher supply have also contributed to a softer nitrogen pricing environment 
Global capacity expansion continues to exert pressure on urea and other nitrogen fertilizer prices  Elevated supply in the global nitrogen market is hurting prices  causing farmers to delay buying activities  As such  margins of fertilizer producers remain thwarted by a weak nutrient pricing environment 
Moreover  agriculture market fundamentals remain weak and there is a continuous negative sentiment among agriculture investors that can create uncertainty in the near term  According to the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA   U S  farm income is expected to slip 3  to  54 8 billion in 2016 to the lowest level since 2002  This would also mark the third straight year of decline 
The outlook reflects depressed prices resulting from excess supply of crops and livestock  While prices of major crops  such as corn and soybeans  have recovered of late  they remain at their multi year lows 
The prevailing softness in agricultural commodity pricing is a concern for fertilizer companies as it is hindering fertilizer use by farmers given the adverse effect of lower crop pricing on growers  income  Lower farm income has a negative influence on growers  nutrient purchasing decisions 
Moreover  the crop protection market remains under pressure  in part  due to a slowdown in Brazil  Agricultural market conditions remain weak in Brazil impacted by cautious buying by farmers and the uncertain political and economic situation in that country  A challenging currency environment coupled with economic weakness has also contributed to sluggish demand for nutrients across certain emerging markets 
Bottom Line
As you can see  there are a number of reasons to be cautious in the chemical industry space  We hold a bearish view on Eastman Chemical Company  NYSE EMN   EMN   LyondellBasell Industries NV  NYSE LYB   LYB  and Methanex Corp   MEOH   It would also be a prudent choice to get rid of certain companies in the fertilizer agricultural chemicals space that show weak fundamentals  Companies that fit the bill are CF Industries Holdings  NYSE CF   Inc   CF   Agrium Inc   AGU   CVR Partners  LP  UAN   Potash Corp   POT  and The Mosaic Company  NYSE MOS   MOS

135201,356716,EMN,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Eastman Chemical  LyondellBasell Industries  Methanex  CF Industries Holdings And Mosaic,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   August 11  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Chemicals  Part 3  including  Eastman Chemical Company  NYSE EMN      LyondellBasell Industries NV  NYSE LYB      Methanex Corp      CF Industries Holdings  NYSE CF   Inc       and Mosaic Company  NYSE MOS     

	Industry  Chemicals  Part 3

	Link  

	Chemical makers should benefit from continued strength in the automotive industry and strategic measures including expansion into high growth markets  aggressive cost management  acquisitions and investment on capacity expansion  However  a number of challenges continue to hamstring the industry  There are a few reasons to be watchful about the chemical industry in the near term  which we have outlined below 

China Worries Continue

	Economic cooling in China    a major market for chemicals    remains a deterrent over the near term  China s economy hit a wall in 2015  growing at its slowest pace in 25 years as a raft of government stimulus measures  including interest rate cuts  failed to stabilize its financial markets  The world s second biggest economy remains hamstrung by its tepid property market and weak private investment  which is contributing to its sluggish economic growth 

	China s GDP grew 6 7  in the second quarter of 2016  the same as what was witnessed in the first  but still its weakest pace since the financial crisis 

	The country s GDP expanded 6 9  in 2015  a marked deceleration from the 7 3  a year ago  The International Monetary Fund  IMF  projects growth in China to moderate to 6 6  in 2016 and 6 2  in 2017  This partly reflects weaker investment growth as the economy continues to rebalance  As such  a sluggish Chinese economy may weigh on demand for chemicals in this significant market 

Eurozone Economy Sputtering Along

	The European economy is still not out of the woods  as evident from the lackluster Eurozone GDP growth of 0 3  in the second quarter of 2016  slowing from a 0 6  growth in the first  per preliminary estimates published by Eurostat  France    the Eurozone s second biggest economy    witnessed complete stagnation in the quarter after racking up 0 7  growth in the previous quarter  hurt by disruptions from labor strikes  Political and economic uncertainties brought forth by Brexit are expected to hinder Eurozone s economic growth in the short term 

	Sluggishness in some of Europe s major economies continues to deter recovery of the chemical industry in that region  Western Europe continues to pose challenges on chemical stocks due to weak demand  thus remaining a source of near term uncertainty  Moreover  weak investments and lower pricing remain as overhangs on the European chemical industry 

Depressed Demand in the Energy Space

	A low oil price environment is hindering investment in the energy sector  This is affecting demand for chemicals in this important end use market  Oil prices hit a 12 year low in Feb 2016  hurt by a surge in the U S  stockpile and prospects of weak demand  Subsequently  supply disruptions around the globe pushed up the prices of the commodity to close above the  50 per barrel mark in June

135204,356719,EMN,The Week Ahead  Have Stock And Oil Prices Decoupled ,opinion,"This week s calendar features another relatively light week for data  a lot of politics  slow summer trading  and options expiration  Something has to fill all of that air time  Expect more Olympic coverage  political commentary  and light features  There will be the usual Fed chatter  To the extent that there is real market discussion  I am looking for a new topic  Have Oil Prices Lost Their Impact on Stocks 
Last Week
The important economic news was mixed as was the market reaction 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  two weeks ago   I predicted discussion about whether the earnings recession might end in Q3  I suggested we would need to fasten our seatbelts for a showdown on the economy and earnings  probably in quarter three  That might prove out  but we certainly did not need seatbelts last week  We had quiet summer trading with light news and plenty of people on vacation  CNBC interspersed Olympic coverage and even found time to have multiple segments featuring a sandwich on Friday 
Politics  global events  and competition intersected 
There was some support for my earnings thesis from our two key sources 
FactSet  the distribution of earnings results by sector and the continuing overall beat rate 
Brian Gilmartin analyzed the forward curve for earnings  including some important implications 
The Story in One Chart Short
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this  of the S P 500 from Doug Short  The overall range is very narrow  with little overall change  Doug has a special knack for pulling together all of the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis and several other charts providing long term perspective 

The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
The Good 
Gasoline prices are expected to move lower  perhaps as low as  1 92 by year s end   EIA forecast   
Initial jobless claims remain low and even declined by 1000    for charts and analysis  
Mortgage rates are back at the lows  3 375 for  flawless scenarios      
The JOLTs report showed improved labor market conditions  Most sources are not covering this accurately  It is not an alternative method for estimating net job growth  It does show the trend in job openings  the structure of the labor market  and the voluntary quit rate  Nearly 3 million people each month are   double the number in 2009 
Producer prices fell more than expected  0 4   Some are citing this as bad news  The bad news will come when stimulus overshoots 
Michigan sentiment remained strong  slightly beating expectations  Doug Short does the best analysis and has the most informative chart 

The Bad 
Railroad growth remains slow  that this has translated into lower earnings  partly because of the energy sector 
Productivity fell 0 5   Gains in productivity are essential for economic growth 
Retail sales disappointed  with no growth month over month  It was also a significant miss of the 0 4  expected gain   this disappointing report  As always  he provides helpful historical perspective  including the chart below  It seems to show a return to the pre recession pace of growth  but without every closing the gap to the prior trend line 

The Ugly 
Public retirement commitments  Robert Pozen    highlights these costs  and the main reasons 

The unfunded liabilities for retiree healthcare for the 30 largest US cities exceeds  100bn  according to the Pew Charitable Trusts  a Philadelphia based non profit organisation  The unfunded liabilities for the 50 US states exceeds  500bn  according to Standard   Poor s  the rating agency 


Retiree healthcare plans are uniquely American  They exist because the US has never offered universal healthcare before Medicare  the national social insurance programme  at age 65 


Many employees of cities and states retire between 50 and 55  so local governments usually provide them with highly subsidised healthcare between retirement and Medicare  and sometimes beyond 

For a more general analysis of the threat from retirement costs  see  on the  titanic risks  
Noteworthy 
There is a lot of current discussion about the  typical  American community   some interesting data on both cities and states  You will find the results interesting  Much to my surprise  I am living in the state with demographics closest to the country overall 

The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  This week s award goes to Justin Fox    He takes on a popular myth that just won t die   the manipulation of government statistics  Like Fox  I have some personal experience in working with the career civil servants who analyze data  The notion that they do whatever a  temporary  political leader instructs is very costly to investors who believe it  The article takes up various accusations and stories  with plenty of good discussion  Here is one key argument 

First  because I know a little bit about the people who put together our nation s economic statistics  The Bureau of Labor Statistics  Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau are run on a day to day basis by career employees  not political appointees  Even the appointees are often   and many have   When top statistics agency officials do leave government  it s often for  in   Credibility with peers is generally of far more value  economic and otherwise  to these people than anything a politician could do for them 

I would add that any shenanigans would be the basis for articles and books by those leaving the agencies 
The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar 
We have another moderate week for economic data and the end of earnings season is near  While personally I watch everything  I highlight only the most important items in WTWA  It is important to focus 
The  A  List 
Building permits and housing starts  T   Permits are a good leading indicator 
FOMC minutes  W   No one really expects any fresh news  but the punditry will find something 
Leading indicators  Th   Still highly regarded by many  despite the various redefinitions  Continuing strength expected 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
The  B  List 
Industrial production  T   Improvement expected in this lagging series  important to GDP 
CPI  T   Inflation data remains a secondary indicator  It will take a few hot months to bring it to the fore 
Philly Fed  Th   A rebound expected  This result has earned growing respect 
Crude inventories  W   Often has a significant impact on oil markets  a focal point for traders of everything 
There is plenty of FedSpeak for those who have been missing that  Options expiration on Friday may delay the exodus to the beach for some 
Next Week s Theme 
Quiet calendars and slow trading offer time for collective introspection  There will be plenty of political discussion  tempting investors to draw unwarranted conclusions about their money  I have noted a new theme in the discussions of the Pundit in Chief and the Senior Stock Trader  Some head shaking over the daily divergences between oil and stock prices  I might be a little early with this expectation  but it is worth thinking about  Expect the pundits to be wondering 
Has the Correlation between Oil and Stock Prices Broken Down 
 the breakdown  I am always encouraged when he reports observations consistent with my own  Here is his chart 

This week s problem has two parts 
What will happen to oil prices 
Will stocks follow 
For now  let s stick to the first question  where there are plenty of opinions 
Oil supply and demand is now in rough balance   and some other experts  
Oil is going lower     There is still a glut and higher prices reflect a short squeeze 
Oil is going   The oil glut is smaller than expected leading to a target of  80  Current trading reflects only momentum  not fundamentals 
  and many similar opinions on all sides 
As always  I ll have a few ideas to add in the conclusion 
Quant Corner 
We follow some regular great sources and also the best insights from each week 
Risk Analysis 
Whether you are a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  Risk first  rewards second  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update 
The Indicator Snapshot 

The Featured Sources  
Brian Gilmartin  Analysis of expected earnings for the overall market as well as coverage of many individual companies  This week he expresses more confidence about growth in earnings 
Bob Dieli  The  C Score  which is a weekly estimate of his Enhanced Aggregate Spread  the most accurate real time recession forecasting method over the last few decades   His subscribers get  including both an economic overview of the economy and employment 
The recession odds  in nine months  have nudged closer to 10  
Holmes  Our cautious and clever watchdog  who sniffs out opportunity like a great detective  but emphasizes guarding assets 
Doug Short  The Big Four Update  the World Markets Weekend Update  and much more  
The ECRI has been dropped from our weekly update  It was not so much because of the bad call in 2011  but the stubborn adherence to this position despite plenty of evidence to the contrary  Those interested can still  via Doug Short and Jill Mislinski  The ECRI commentary remains relentlessly bearish despite the upturn in their own index 
It is time for another update of   The start of another recession would be marked by a peak and significant decline in these indicators  Most investors should take a frequent look at this chart instead of the headlines in the financial press 

Georg Vrba  The   and much more   for an array of interesting methods  Georg  Bob Dieli s enhanced aggregate spread  considering when it might first give a recession signal  Georg thinks it is still a year away  It is interesting to watch this approach along with our weekly monitoring of the C Score 
RecessionAlert  Many  for both economic and market analysis  While we feature his recession analysis  Dwaine also has a number of interesting approaches to asset allocation  This week Dwaine has his own interpretation of the  Big Four  indicators   a   Despite this  he concludes 

To conclude  looking at the individual co incident monthly data used by the NBER shows a far more pessimistic view currently than when looking at a syndrome of conditions  But the co incident data in this particular indicator and the recession probabilities we are registering are not as bullish as the employment data would have you think  In fact  taking our proprietary implementation of the Big 4 index  and comparing it to the last 8 expansions  shows just how meek this recovery has been

Top Trading Advice 
Traders are worried about the next two months  notes Steven M  Sears     Trading desk chatter about Chair Yellen s upcoming Jackson Hole speech  a possible rate hike  and mean reverting behavior in volatility  This has them buying call options on the VIX  popularly known as the fear index  Should you join this trade  I am not making a recommendation  but merely raising an idea for consideration  I do not share the concern about the impact of a rate hike  I also note that several of those quoted are selling derivatives 
Dr  Brett asks   He answers  yes  and explains how 
In another great post he explains how to

Insight for Investors 
Investors have a longer time horizon  The best moves frequently involve taking advantage of trading volatility 
Best of the Week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be some ideas that  keep on giving   This contradicts the page view theory of posting  Look for  actionable investment advice  
 is worth reading and re reading  Robert J  Martorana is an insightful author and organizer  He was the editor  I called it  ringmaster   when I wrote for TheStreet com s Real Money site  He has organized regular conference calls among advisors  bloggers  and investment managers who all have great ideas and strong credentials  Recently he took some of the calls and turned them into a first rate educational piece about reading financial news  I am delighted to be included  I hope others find the ideas as useful as I do  If it is popular  perhaps Rob will do more of these 
Another good post on this theme is from Morgan Housel  who describes   It is a great list  My favorites are the following 

Recessions and bear markets are very easy to predict  except for the timing  cause  magnitude  duration  location  and policy response 


Look at today s  in the world  Fifteen years ago  one of them didn t exist  one was a tiny start up  one was a belittled relic of the dot com bust  another was fighting to stay relevant after flirting with bankruptcy a few years before  I suspect the next 15 years will be even more extreme 


If you tell people what they want to hear  you can be wrong indefinitely without penalty  This explains the careers of many pundits

Election Effects 
Expect many more articles on the impact of the election and what stocks you should own  I am sticking with my year long viewpoint  This is all overdone  The new president  whoever is elected  will face a struggle in passing an innovative agenda  No such analysis can be complete without considering the likely makeup of Congress   and that is just for starters   has a cover story featuring a likely Clinton election and analyzing the policies  The  the difference in tax policies

Final Thoughts 
The correlation between oil prices and stocks never made any sense  Some traders prefer commodity prices as an economic indicator  They are skeptical of the official data  The fact that oil prices represented a supply story rather than weak demand did not stop many from hitting the recession panic button  HFT algo s picked up something that was working  and a lot of hot money started following this trade  If you were a trader  you had to take notice  On some days CNBC would view oil traders who said they were watching stocks  as well as stock traders who were watching oil  When a trade is working  you should not go too deeply into the reasons 
Investors got the chance to buy some great stocks at lower prices 
Fundamentally  lower gas prices are good  Past price surges were frequently described as a consumer tax with no corresponding benefit  Whether people spent or saved the extra cash  it had a positive effect  Since all transportation costs were lower  everyone was helped  not just drivers  although the effects are difficult to calculate 
When the market responded negatively to lower prices many started reaching for explanations  Attention turned to those living and working in oil production areas  as well as banks making loans to them  This was true enough and easier to see than the larger  but diverse effect on consumers 
A New Chapter  
With the rebound in oil prices  will the punditry cite this as a reason for higher stock prices  I am not counting on that  but two months ago I highlighted the idea that oil prices might have hit a  sweet spot   Energy company earnings will be better  The potential for higher production places a brake on price spikes  It provides a healthy environment for the economy and the stock market 
The oil stock relationship may be fading  but count on the trading world to find something new 
Explaining small daily moves in the market averages is like analyzing why a snowflake fell on you rather than the person walking next to you  The many words and hours spent doing this are worse than worthless  The process creates a false sense of logic and order which may well cause mistakes in future decisions ",2016-08-14,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-have-stock-and-oil-prices-decoupled-200147793,200147793

With the U S  economy springing back to life  the first three quarters of 2014 showed healthy demand trends for chemicals and continued healing across key end use markets such as housing  commercial construction and electronics  The momentum is expected to continue into 2015 despite some headwinds U S  Looks Bright  Europe   China Cloudy According to the latest monthly report from the American Chemistry Council  ACC     an industry trade group    U S  chemical production rose on a monthly basis for the tenth straight month in Oct 2014  providing further evidence that the industry remained on the road to recovery in the second half  Growth has been witnessed across all key producing regions this year  The outlook for the U S  chemical industry paints an encouraging picture as the ACC recently said that national chemical production moved up 2  in 2014  up from a 1 6  increase in 2013  and is expected to further rise to a 3 7  gain next year and 3 9  in 2016  Growth is expected to be backed by healthy demand from light vehicles market and a recovery in the housing market  The ACC expects strong capital spending in the coming years  stemming from new investments in petrochemicals and derivatives  U S  capital spending has jumped 12  this year to reach  33 billion  boosted by a raft of chemical projects  The shale gas boom is driving investment on plants and equipment in the U S  Chemical makers including majors like  BASF SE PK  OTC BASFY   Dow Chemical Company  NYSE DOW   EI du Pont de Nemours and Company  NYSE DD  LyondellBasell Industries NV  NYSE LYB   Eastman Chemical Company  NYSE EMN  and Celanese Corporation  NYSE CE  are currently ratcheting up investment on shale gas linked projects to take advantage of ample natural gas supplies which is expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years  The U S  has emerged as an attractive investment hotspot and chemical makers are aggressively expanding capacity in the country  The ACC expects U S  chemical industry to rake in trade surplus of  77 billion by 2019  supported by a significant share of gas driven chemical investments  Accelerated growth in U S  chemical exports are expected to lead to continued generation of trade surplus  With the revival across most export markets  strong growth is expected in inorganic chemicals  organic chemistry  plastic resins and synthetic rubber  The ACC sees domestic chemical sales to cross the  1 trillion milestone by 2019  Agriculture and health and nutrition have emerged as attractive markets and major chemical makers are increasingly switching their focus on these markets to cut their exposure on businesses that are grappling with weak demand and input costs pressure  Moreover  strategic actions including cost containment and acquisitions divestments remain the prime focus of chemical companies to stay afloat in a still difficult macro environment 
Outlook for Europe  however  is not so bright at the moment given fresh signs of slowdown in the region  According to the European Chemical Industry Council  CEFIC     which represents the European chemicals industry    chemical output rose just 0 9  year over year in Europe in the first three quarters of 2014  stymied by lower pricing and a reduction in petrochemical output   CEFIC now expects European chemical output to rise 1  next year  slower than 1 5  expected earlier  Fresh reports of weakness in the Eurozone economy  hurt by sluggishness in the region s major economies  such as Germany  France and Italy  have renewed concerns about the recovery prospects of the chemical industry in that region  The European chemical industry also remains hobbled by high energy costs   Moreover  the recent signs of slowdown in China may weigh on demand for chemicals in this key market  The country remains battered by its tepid property market and weak infrastructure investment growth  which is contributing to its decelerating economic growth  Crashing oil prices have also ignited investors  concerns about U S  petrochemical makers given the potential that it may dwindle the feedstock cost advantage that is so far enjoyed by these companies  Outlook for the fertilizer agricultural chemical space also remains smoggy due to weak market fundamentals and continued pricing pressure Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification  the chemical industry falls under the broader Basic Materials sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  which is expected to have a 2 8  share of total earnings for the S P 500 in 2014  We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry  The way to look at the complete list of 260  industries is that the outlook for the top one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower  is positive  the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one third  Zacks Industry Rank  177 and higher  is negative   To learn more visit     We have three chemicals related industries  Chemical Specialty  Chemical Diversified and Chemical Plastics  Both Chemical Specialty and Chemical Diversified industries lie in the middle one third with a Zacks Industry Rank  149 and  176  respectively  Chemical Plastics industry currently retains a Zacks Industry Rank  234  placing it in the bottom 1 3rd of the 260  industry groups  Looking at the exact location of these industries  one could say that the general outlook for the chemical industry as a whole is leaning toward  Neutral  Sector Level Earnings Trends
Basic Materials was among the sectors that racked up a double digit earnings growth in the third quarter of 2014  Looking at the overall results of the Basic Materials sector  earnings for the sector participants in the S P 500 index jumped 17 6  in the third quarter  a marked improvement from an 8 6  rise in the second  Total revenues for these companies were up 2 6  in the third quarter versus a 3 4  rise a quarter ago  The sector delivered a healthy earnings beat ratio  the percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises  of 61 9  and revenue beat ratio of 47 6  in the third quarter  The earnings picture for the fourth quarter  however  looks tepid with a projected decline of 5 1   Revenues are forecast to edge down 0 9  in the quarter  For 2014  earnings are expected to show an 8 2  increase  further accelerating to a 15 8  rise next year  Revenues are forecast to move up 1 5  this year and 4 4  in 2015  For more details about the earnings of this sector and others  please read our    report The Way Forward While some industry specific challenges  concerns over China s future growth and sluggishness in Europe remain roadblocks  the chemical industry is expected to continue to recuperate through the balance of 2014 and into 2015  invigorated by strength in the automotive market and significant shale linked capital investment  The recovery will also be supported by a rebound across housing and commercial construction markets ",2014-12-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chemical-industry-looking-up-amid-a-few-worries-236077,236077
135223,356738,EMN,Eastman Chemical  Impressive Diamond Reversal Pattern,opinion,"Having looked at millions of charts over the years  my eyes have become pretty good at spotting patterns  including those that would be invisible to saner people  One example is Eastman Chemical  NYSE EMN   which is sporting what I consider a pretty impressive diamond reversal pattern  
Here s a larger view to give it some context ",2015-01-08,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eastman-chemical:-impressive-diamond-reversal-pattern-237756,237756
135224,356739,EMN,Shale Revolution Accelerates Chemicals Industry,opinion,"It certainly is a good time for the  800 billion U S  chemicals industry 
According to the American Chemistry Council  ACC   U S  chemical production will continue to expand this year and next  The ACC forecast year over year output growth of 3 2  for 2015 and 3  for 2016  and foresees even better times ahead  It expects the domestic chemical industry s growth to exceed that of the nation as a whole in the years to come 
The ACC sees the industry becoming a growth engine for the economy  forecasting a rise in the 5  range in the 2017 to 2019 period  It also expects record trade surpluses for the industry by 2020 
The chemicals industry owes most of its recent success to one crucial factor 
Shale Revolution   Chemical Renaissance
The game changing innovation of fracking has unlocked reserves trapped in shale formations across the United States  Fracking has released abundant and cheap natural gas and natural gas liquids  NGL   such as ethane  which have revived the U S  chemicals industry 
You see  U S  companies now enjoy a huge advantage over foreign competitors that use naphtha as a feedstock  Naphtha is derived from crude oil  and is still expensive relative to NGLs 
The shale gas revolution has literally turned the global chemicals industry on its head 
Less than a decade ago  the outlook for producers of domestic bulk chemicals  such as ethylene  was grim  with production capabilities being shipped overseas 
But now  more and more investment in U S  production capacity is either underway or in various stages of planning 
An Investment Catalyst
According to the ACC  238 U S  chemicals companies have announced investment projects worth a total of  145 billion 
That s up from  90 billion in announced projects as of mid 2014 
Capital spending in the industry soared 64  from 2010 to 2014  to  33 4 billion  The ACC expects spending to jump another 37  to  45 8 billion by 2018 
Note that about 61  of the announced investment in U S  chemicals production is coming from foreign companies 
That s not to say  however  that U S  companies are standing on the sidelines 
U S  companies spending big to ramp up production include Du Pont  NYSE DD   Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW   Eastman Chemical  NYSE EMN   Westlake Chemical  NYSE WLK   Celanese  NYSE CE   and LyondellBasell Industries  NYSE LYB   Major oil companies such as ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  are also boosting their chemicals capacity 
Dow Chemical  for example  is spending  6 billion on expanding its Gulf Coast facilities  including a new  cracker  plant to produce ethylene  This hydrocarbon is a basic building block for other industrial chemicals 
LyondellBasell CEO Bob Patel  who succeeded longtime leader Jim Gallogly in January 2015  recently told the Financial Times that he expects the oil to gas price ratio to remain favorable for U S  companies  And he continues to see the United States as the most favorable location for ethylene production 
Positive Reaction
The recent performance of LyondellBasell s stock indicates that investors can make a lot of money from a well run chemical company 
LyondellBasell listed on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2010  Since then  the share price has nearly quadrupled 
And the company is enjoying strong operating momentum  with management reporting record earnings per share for the first quarter of 2015 
With the shale boom showing few signs of petering out  U S  chemicals producers are set to benefit from low natural gas and NGLs prices for the foreseeable future 
Are these   dare we say it   the best of times for the industry ",2015-07-05,Wall Street Daily,https://www.investing.com/analysis/shale-revolution-accelerates-chemicals-industry-257165,257165
135225,356740,EMN,Trading Chances This Week  EMN  HIG  LYB  PWR,opinion,"Eastman Chemical  NYSE EMN 
In the medium trend size we see a valid downtrend at the upper edge of the red correction zone  The point three at  73 72 was touched twice  but without a close above  Well  the correction zone is persisting  and as long as the price remains in this zone  the trend can continue each time  With a stop sell order we can speculate on this being the case  Our stop is placed slightly above the last point three and the target lies at the last point two 

Hartford Financial  NYSE HIG 
In this value we find a similar situation  The downtrend in the medium trend size is very young  The last correction move led the price more than 50  into the red correction zone and the last candles indicated that the trend was able to continue  We can try to catch the next downwards movement with the short order visible in the chart 
LyondellBasell Industries NV  NYSE LYB 
LyondellBasell is one of the biggest chemical companies worldwide  The chart shows us a young downtrend with a very large correction zone  With the last downward move  the price undercut the last point two at  72 76 by just a little bit and created a new point two at  69 10  The subsequent upwards move led the price deep into the red zone  Now it seems as if the trend will continue  We are speculating on this happening 

Quanta Services  NYSE PWR 
Quanta Services is the leading supplier of specialty services for oil and gas companies  But the chart is also in a downtrend  The current price is near the upper edge of the correction zone  and a few recent reversal signals indicated that a trend continuation was highly likely  Therefore our DowHow signal occurred  and we were able to place our short order
