141532,363047,JWN,Will Nordstrom  JWN  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this department store operator has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 21 52   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Nordstrom came out with earnings of  0 81 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 65 per share  representing a surprise of 24 62   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 76 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 90 per share  delivering a surprise of 18 42  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Nordstrom lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Nordstrom currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 43   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on March 3  2020 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-nordstrom-jwn-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200504129,200504129

141552,363067,JWN,Nordstrom s Strategic Partnerships Help Boost Growth,news,"Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  has been a strong performer in the challenging department store space  It continues to innovate by focusing on what s important to customers  While competitors such as Macy s and J C  Penney struggle with ongoing same store sales declines  Nordstrom s fiscal third quarter earnings easily beat consensus estimates  helped by solid results from its anniversary sales event and an improvement in promotions  Shares are up 28  in the last six months 
Customer experience and service has always been at the core of Nordstrom s strengths  but the consumer discretionary company also offers newness and brand discovery thanks to its partnerships with strategic brands  many of which are digitally native and direct to consumer  This helps differentiate it from its department store peers  Working with small brands that have little brick and mortar presence creates an incentive for consumers to visit their nearest Nordstrom in order to experience those products in person  The strategy has also helped transform Nordstrom s image from an average upscale department store to one that offers sought after brands that aren t widely available 

Recent partnerships
Examples of strategic partners include Topshop  Allbirds  Greats  and Reformation  More recently  Nordstrom has hosted  pop up  shops featuring jewelry brand Stella and Dot and cult beauty company Glossier  All of these brands sell through few or no other retailers 
Nordstrom has bolstered these efforts by giving partners creative flexibility and sharing data with them  Many brands that gained popularity through carefully cultivated connections with customers do not want their image or presentation altered by an outside company 
There are seven Nordstrom locations that began hosting Glossier s temporary pop up shops that sell its popular Glossier You fragrance  It s also the beauty brand s largest retail collaboration thus far  Emily Weiss  founder of Glossier  spoke of not wanting to give up control over how Glossier would be sold as a reason for not partnering with large retailers until now  Emma Grede  co founder of Good American  another Nordstrom partner  said she only works with retail partners that share customer information with the brand 
Glossier was a wise choice for a partnership as the brand is known for driving impressive foot traffic  When Glossier opened a showroom in 2016  lines formed down the street  and more than half a million customers visited 
And in November  Nordstrom launched a partnership with direct to consumer brand Stella and Dot  This is Stella and Dot s entry into traditional retail  Founder Jessica Herrin said of the launch   We saw the importance of finding new ways for the customer to experience the brand in real life  to touch and feel our product and experience the quality  
Looking ahead
Overall  Nordstrom has managed to grow its appeal with customers and drive sales growth by working with these direct to consumer brands  In addition to helping boost store traffic  these partnerships have also been a driver of sales  in that they grow 30  faster than non strategic brands and deliver better margins  By 2022  Nordstrom plans to have strategic brands comprise about 50  of full price sales    having these exclusive offerings also helps cut down on promotional pricing 
 Nordstrom has given the customer what it wants  and what the customer wants is what they don t see in other department stores  They re going after brands with a story to balance out brands with heritage   said Ed Gribbin  CEO of apparel consultancy Gribbin Strategic  In a challenging and competitive retail landscape  capturing distribution agreements with these sought after names helps Nordstrom stay a step ahead of competitors ",2020-01-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pewfh,2054020

Shares of Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   a fashion retailer operating roughly 373 stores in 40 states  jumped as much as 5 8  Tuesday morning  adding to Monday s gains  after the markets continued to absorb a couple of bullish notes 
So what
On Monday  JPMorgan analyst Matthew Boss said that the 2019 holiday season looked to be strong for department stores  among other areas   Our work points to a robust Holiday  19 overall led by continued consumer strength   Boss told investors  pointing out that unemployment is at a 50 year low and wage growth is about 4  

Boss also upgraded Nordstrom to neutral from underweight  helping its share price on Monday and Tuesday  and gave it a  41 price target  a large increase from the prior  26 target  He received a vote of confidence later when CNBC s Jim Cramer  host of Mad Money  said of Boss  track record   I think you d be crazy  crazy  to bet against him  
Now what
Analysts make upgrades and downgrades all the time  and the moves should be taken with a grain of salt  That being said  Boss made great points  and Nordstrom has managed to grow revenue over the past five years faster than most competitors

Part of Nordstrom s success has been its strategic partnerships with traditionally direct to consumer or online brands such as jewelry company Stella   Dot and cosmetics maker Glossier  Those brands don t often sell through other retailers  so it gives consumers a reason to visit Nordstrom for products not easily found elsewhere  and helps the retailer avoid pricing promotions or discounts  The department store industry will remain challenging  but it appears that Nordstrom is making many great moves    and  based on recent analyst notes  investors are catching on ",2020-01-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pe-7p,2054266

There are two other factors critical to the retailer s success  however  that must be considered in the discussion  One of them is a simple stroke of luck that happened to start falling into place years ago  That is  Nordstrom does very well with more affluent young adults who are more likely to respond to the chain s current strategies  The other is a more deliberate development    the company has fully embraced the idea of retailing as entertainment

Less inventory headed into the end of October ultimately meant fewer markdowns for the three month stretch in question  Subsequently  the third quarter s per share earnings jumped to  0 81  up 108  year over year  despite a slight revenue decline  And all of it was helped by the outperformance of its e commerce business  notes Boss  A little more than one third of sales now originate online  a figure that likely has most other apparel retailers envious  particularly given that 75  of its shoppers who pick up an online order in store end up buying something else during that trip 

Nordstrom deserves plenty of credit for holding up in the face of the so called retail apocalypse  while it orchestrated the turnaround 
It certainly wasn t always easy or pretty  Though revenue peaked early last year  profits started to wane as early as 2015  The  Nordstrom family even attempted to take the company private in 2018    as a means of escaping the headache of short term investor scrutiny that often just proves distracting     but wasn t able to make an offer the Board of Directors found acceptable  A revitalization then became the only real option  but the organization has managed to make it work at a time it arguably shouldn t have 

Serving the right people in the right place
The Seattle based department store chain had some serendipitous help along the way  though  Namely  the company does extremely well with younger shoppers  Data from Viant indicates 51  of its shoppers are between the ages of 18 and 34  For perspective  only 37  of Macy s shoppers are in that age bracket  Kohl s is even less compelling to young adults  with a mere 31  of its foot traffic from that demographic  Don t let their age fool you  though  A little more than 40  of Nordstrom s regulars earn a six figure income  versus 35  for Macy s and 29  for Kohl s 
In other words  more of Nordstrom s shoppers are likely to be more responsive to the company s online offerings  by virtue of their  collectively  younger age and affinity for technology  Its customers also boast greater discretionary spending capacity than its rivals  regulars 
The demographic data may be a function of store placement as much as it is a reflection of how the company promotes itself  Almost all of its stores are found at class A malls  as Boss acknowledges  which have been largely immune to the retail apocalypse  These malls tend to be found in the most affluent ZIP codes  where brick and mortar shopping hasn t lost its luster 
Whatever the reason  it works to the company s advantage 
Not just selling  but dazzling
Nordstrom has also taken the idea of amenities and service to the next proverbial level  and as a result  the company has reaped clear rewards 
It s admittedly more of a prototype than the typical store experience  but the food  beverages  beauty salons  dry cleaning  Botox treatments  fashion collaborations  and other value added offerings available at Nordstrom s New York flagship reflect the sort of shift now taking place at the company s other locations  Dubbed Nordstrom Local  the new brick and mortar strategy involves a network of smaller locations all working together in a way that gets    and keeps   customers in stores longer 
The strategy is working  too  As fellow Fool Pearl Wang explained in November  shoppers at  Local  stores spend 2 5 times more than the average shopper does  JP Morgan s Boss called it a  game changer  in an industry that needs several  Other department store chains are trying similar tactics  though none seem to be executing the idea as well as Nordstrom has 
The department store chain intends to put these overhauls in place primarily in its top ten markets  although those markets make up about 60  of the organization s total sales 
The future is     a little brighter
The Nordstrom upgrade is a glimmer of hope in a sea of retailing trouble  Store closures reached a record pace of 9 300 in 2019  and retail bankruptcies were once again daunting  Even Nordstrom s upgrade was ultimately tainted by the fact that JP Morgan still only rates it at neutral 
It s a standout all the same though  as it makes it clear that it s possible to do well in a seemingly lousy retailing environment  Continued store closures and retail bankruptcies  in fact  will only help Nordstrom as displaced shoppers look for new places to spend  The department store chain has clearly figured out how to draw a crowd and serve them effectively 
Investors could certainly do a lot worse ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfx4z,2055946
141555,363070,JWN,2 Things Nordstrom Is Doing Right to Survive the Retail Shakedown,news,"The retail apocalypse is devastating department stores and other retailers across the country  In 2019  there were more than 9 300 store closures in the U S  To survive  a company must make strategic changes to adjust to the environment  or else risk declining revenue  store closures  and maybe even bankruptcy 
Fortunately for its investors  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  is in a relatively stable position  given the difficult circumstances  Here s a look at two things it s doing well to counter the headwinds plaguing the industry 

1  Emphasizing its off price stores
Part of the demand in off price shopping comes from the treasure hunt experience  Customers are looking for that new piece that just arrived at the store and won t be there for long  Nordstrom is putting itself in a position to deliver that experience by developing the capability to be opportunistic buyers when off price merchandise becomes available  That way  its product mix is frequently changing with fresh looks to attract shoppers 
Management has been focusing new store openings on its off price Nordstrom Rack locations  The third quarter earnings report in November showed that the company had closed six full line stores and opened five off price locations  While full line stores saw sales decrease 4 1  in the third quarter  its off price stores experienced a 1 2  gain  Its ratio of off price stores to full line stores has also increased with 243 to 110 locations  respectively 
2  Competitive fulfillment options
Nordstrom offers free shipping on every order  no minimum required  while Macy s requires a  25 minimum for free shipping and J C  Penney  99  Free shipping on any order also puts Nordstrom ahead of Amazon com  which only offers free shipping across the board to its Prime members  who must pay a membership fee  while also enjoying a host of other benefits   With consumers shopping more and more online  this gives Nordstrom a competitive edge 
As with many retailers  buy online  pick up in store  or BOPIS  is Nordstrom s most profitable transaction  That s why it was encouraging to see that half of digital sales growth came from order pickup in the third quarter  And it was even higher in the Los Angeles market  which is its biggest  Shoppers are increasingly demanding more convenience  and the standard for customer convenience in order pickup has been set by Target  which is the level Nordstrom should aim for 
Its Market Strategy initiative is working well  Since scaling the strategy in Los Angeles  third quarter sales have outpaced its other markets by one percentage point  It now wants to expand the plan to the rest of its top 10 markets by the end of 2020  The initiative aims to give customers a greater selection available for next day pickup or delivery without increasing inventory levels  and to offer express services such as order pickup  returns  and alterations at additional locations 
What does this mean for investors 
Nordstrom has been investing heavily in its business for several years now to deal with the changing retail environment  Now that the generational investment cycle is behind it  management expects capital expenditures to drop to 3  to 4  of sales beginning this year  down from 6  of sales in 2019  With lower capital expenditures  investors can expect higher free cash flow in 2020 
Its competitive fulfillment options  off price offerings  and increasing customer conveniences will position it favorably to survive the retail apocalypse  The future for large department stores is not bright  but Nordstrom is one consumer discretionary stock that should outperform others in its field ",2020-01-16,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pitxa,2061007

141586,363101,JWN,Why Nordstrom Was a Holiday Shopping Season Winner,news,"When we talk about winners in the retail world these days  department stores usually aren t part of the conversation  As a group  they had more than their share of troubles last year as online competition strengthened  mall foot traffic waned  and discount retailers and a highly promotional environment weighed on their ability to price their wares higher 
Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  suffered from those headwinds too  The company has reported declining sales  and its stock price fell by 17  in 2019  But the department store chain s efforts  including its  buy online  pickup in store   BOPIS  option  its broader e commerce strategy  and its inventory management  may have combined to make it the holiday shopping season winner among its peers 

BOPIS was one of the keys to attracting customers over the holidays    and the rest of the year too  According to Invesp  50  of respondents in a shopping survey said they ve decided where to shop online based on whether the retailer offers them the option to pick up their packages in a physical store  Studies also showed that 75  of shoppers who go to stores to pick up their orders are likely to buy more items while they are there 
Nordstrom was also efficient with its in store pickup  fulfilling orders in less than four hours even during the busiest moments of the 2019 holiday season  according to Accenture Strategy s Kurt Salmon  The firm said that put it among the top four retailers for speedy order preparation  Nordstrom also shined in the customer experience category  During its third quarter earnings call  the retailer said order pickup is its most profitable transaction 
Digital sales gain
Shoppers are spending more time shopping online and less in physical stores  but Nordstrom is showing that it is evolving with the times  In its Q3 earnings report  the company said total digital sales gained 7  and e commerce represented 34  of its business  Digital sales represented 31  of its sales during the same period a year earlier 
Its strategy of integrating its online channel with its physical stores includes order pickups and returns  as well as making a wide selection of products available both online and in stores  Nordstrom debuted this strategy in Los Angeles  then rolled it out across New York City  San Francisco  Chicago  and Dallas 
The company aims to extend it to 10 more markets by the end of 2020  but it s already is proving effective    third quarter sales growth in Los Angeles surpassed that of other markets  E commerce is particularly important considering consumer spending trends  According to Mastercard SpendingPulse  department stores saw a 1 8  drop in sales over the holidays  but their online sales climbed nearly 7  
Holiday inventory
While some retailers have found themselves saddled with rising levels of unwanted inventory  Nordstrom ended the third quarter without a surplus    inventory was down 2 7   The close connections between its physical stores and its e commerce operation have helped with inventory control  allowing Nordstrom to offer the same merchandise across platforms rather than investing in additional inventory  Management said it plans to continue this shared inventory strategy as it expands its digital and physical store integration 
To keep inventory in check over the holidays  Nordstrom looks at customer feedback  determines what sorts of items people plan on buying and at what price points  then sets inventory levels considering those factors  Ahead of the holiday shopping season  Nordstrom said it was pleased with the early trends in gift buying 
Though Nordstrom hasn t commented yet about its holiday performance  the company s digital strategy and its inventory management are reasons to believe it was one of the season s retail winners  This doesn t mean its troubles are over  Its latest earnings report showed a decline in net sales  including a drop in its  full price  segment  Competition with off price retailers and online retailers isn t going away  and post holiday promotions may be another hurdle  with retailers feeling pressure to slash prices or lose out on sales  But with the efforts Nordstrom has been making in key revenue driving areas  there are reasons to be optimistic ahead of the next earnings report ",2020-01-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pdvgh,2052575

141682,363197,JWN,JCPenney  JCP  Q3 Earnings On Deck  Is Another Selloff In The Cards  ,opinion,"JCPenney   NYSE JCP   is set to release its third quarter earnings report before the opening bell on Friday  November 15  The department store s shares are currently down 6 7  year to date after a tumultuous August and September 
In the advent of digital commerce  department stores have been battered as consumers flock to digital storefronts to avoid the time consuming hassle of shopping in malls  In response to the decline in foot traffic  mall operators have opted to fill some spaces with venues that are better suited to attract the modern consumer  But  will these efforts help revive the dying breed or is it already too late 
Department Stores Prioritize Experience  
After over a decade of declining sales  JCPenney is trying to turn things around by adapting its stores to the wants of the modern consumer  Modern consumers now prioritize experience when going out to a company s store  Macy s   NYSE M   announced in October that it would be opening four more Potbelly Sandwich Shops   NASDAQ PBPB   within its stores  adding to the one found in its Mall of America store 
Nordstrom s   NYSE JWN   flagship store in New York City offers the typical apparel section of a department store  with a variety of food and drink options that are bound to provide an enjoyable experience to customers in the store  The recently opened location boasts four different restaurants  two bars  and will even bring food to you while you re shopping 
JCPenney offered customers at its North East Mall in Hurst  Texas  a newly refreshed store to shop in  The department store in Hurst  Texas has been reconfigured with spacious lounging areas  a fitness studio  a cafe  a barbershop  and more  CEO Jill Soltau says the new shtick is  the fullest articulation of our brand strategy and we re going to use it as a lab  
Will It Yield Results  
A potential issue with JC Penney s newest initiative is the demographic that the department store typically attracts  Unlike Macy s or Nordstrom  whose shoppers are more inclined to engage with non shopping experiences at shopping venues  the average JCPenney shopper is typically looking for value above all else 
According to data from Viant  the average JCPenney customer is 51 years old  looking for a bargain  and more likely to use a coupon  These shoppers also earn just under  63 000 per year  whereas 35  and 40  of Macy s and Nordstrom shoppers earn more than six figures  respectively  The higher end crowd that Macy s and Nordstrom serves may be more inclined and receptive to in store coffee shops and fitness studios 
The contrast in the demographic that JCPenney attracts compared to other department stores who have implemented similar features may dampen the results of JCPenney s newest initiative  However  it is still not a guarantee that JCPenney shoppers won t respond positively to the remodeled stores as time will tell if the store can pull itself out of its current slump 
Bottom Line 
Despite the valiant efforts JCPenney has been making to rejuvenate its business  the mounting debt weighing down its balance sheet is a major headwind for the struggling retailer  JCPenney has  105 million of unsecured debt maturing in June 2020 and a disappointing holiday season could put them in a serious predicament 
Our consensus Q3 estimates call for a 5 77  earnings drop off to a loss of  0 55 per share and a net sales decline of 7 48  to  2 53 billion  Comp sales are estimated to fall 7 25  in the third quarter as well  Fiscal 2020 estimates project earnings to plummet 29 79  to a loss of  1 22 per share and for sales to tumble 7 12  to  11 16 billion

quarter  9  in the second quarter  and 7  in both third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019  Continued growth in NIKE Digital and significant share gains across its wholesale partners are boosting the segment s performance  Further  innovation in footwear and strong demand in apparel remain other growth drivers The company s wholesale and NIKE Digital businesses witnessed double digit growth in North America in the last reported quarter  Further  NIKE app revenues in North America are witnessing triple digit growth  It expects the momentum in North America to continue in fiscal 2020 and beyond  driven by strong pipeline of innovative products  brand recognition and creation of digitally led consumer experiences The company s differentiated consumer experiences in North America through the rollout of the NIKE app in owned retail stores  and the testing of new services and concepts with retail partners  such as Foot Locker   NYSE FL    Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   and DICK S Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS    should drive growth For North America  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the fiscal first quarter is pegged at  4 349 million  which suggests growth of nearly 5

141708,363223,JWN,Nordstrom  JWN  Up 4 6  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   Shares have added about 4 6  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Nordstrom due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Nordstrom s Earnings Beat Estimate in Q2  Sales MissNordstrom reported better than expected earnings for second quarter fiscal 2019  While the company s bottom line reverted to a positive surprise trend after a miss in the previous quarter  the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third straight quarter  Both the top and bottom line also decreased on a year over year basis  Consequently  management trimmed the upper end of its earnings per share view Nordstrom s earnings of 90 cents per share outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents  Although the bottom line dipped 5 3  year over year  the metric benefited from robust inventory discipline and significant cost containment efforts Year to date  the company has realized more than  100 million in cost savings  remaining ahead of its plans to generate nearly  150  200 million in the current fiscal year Furthermore  the company is consistently focusing on the expansion of its local market strategy to New York City in order to drive the top line  It is slated to open a flagship store on Oct 24 along with two Nordstrom Local neighborhood hubs next month Q2 HighlightsTotal quarterly revenues fell 4 8  to  3 872 million and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 933 million  While net Retail sales dropped 5 1  to  3 778 million  Credit Card net revenues advanced 8  to  94 million  Decline in the company s top line reflected soft performance at its off price business and the Anniversary Sale Furthermore  Nordstrom s full price net sales  including the U S  full line stores  Nordstrom com  the Canadian operation  Trunk Club  Jeffrey and Nordstrom Local  decreased 6 5  to  2 530 million in the fiscal second quarter The company s off price net sales  including Nordstrom U S  Rack stores   and Last Chance clearance stores  also dipped 1 9  to  1 248 million However  the company is capitalizing on its strong inventory position to improve depth in major items and enhance in stock levels  Moreover  it saw improvements in customer metrics on a year over year basis  during the Anniversary Sale As a result  management expects improved sell through of Anniversary product to boost merchandise margin in the fiscal third quarter Meanwhile  the company s digital sales grew 4   representing nearly 30  of the overall net sales Nordstrom also continued to strengthen its loyalty program in the reported quarter  The Nordy Club has 12 million active customers  representing a 12  increase year over year and 64  of sales Operational UpdateNordstrom s gross profit margin contracted 50 basis points  bps  to 34 5  mainly on account of higher occupancy expenses  However  merchandise margin rate improved sequentially in spite of an elevated promotional backdrop Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses  as a percentage of sales  rose 26 bps to 31 2  primarily owing to higher fixed costs on lower sales This was partly offset by cost savings on account of Nordstrom s continuous efforts to enhance efficiency and adjust performance related expenses Earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT   as a percentage of net sales  declined 50 bps to 5 7  mainly due to lower sales Store UpdateAs of Aug 3  2019  Nordstrom operated 381 stores across 40 states

quarterly cash dividend of 37 cents per share  This will be payable on Sep 16  2019  to its shareholders of record as on Aug 30 FY19 GuidanceManagement updated guidance for fiscal 2019 to reflect second quarter performance and anticipations for the back half The outlook does not include the impact of tariffs on goods imported from China as it is likely to be immaterial in the fiscal year The company now estimates net sales to decrease nearly 2  compared with the prior projection of flat to down 2   Credit card revenues  net  are still expected to grow in the range of low to mid single digit Further  the company expects EBIT of  805  855 million  with EBIT margin of 5 3 5 6   Earlier  management expected EBIT in the range of  805  890  with EBIT margin of 5 3 5 8  Consequently  the

141744,363259,JWN,Luxury Homebuilder s Woes Show Mounting U S  Slowdown Fears,news," Bloomberg     Wealthy buyers are pulling back from some of the most expensive housing markets in the U S   the latest sign that sky high prices and fears of a recession are weighing on a key sector of the economy 
Toll Brothers Inc   the nation s largest publicly traded luxury home builder  said late Tuesday that purchase agreements fell 3  from a year earlier  worse than a decline of less than 1  that was expected by a Bloomberg survey of six analysts  The company s orders in California  home to some of the priciest markets in the country  tumbled 36  from a year earlier 
The results underscore a shift taking place in the U S  housing market  The return of low mortgage rates is heating up competition for starter homes and fueling steep price gains in cities that have long been more affordable  Meanwhile  expensive markets  like San Jose and Seattle  as well as the luxury homes that Toll builds  have seen a drop off in demand 
 Their buyers are a little more sensitive to what s going on in the broader economy   said Drew Reading  an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence   They re paying more attention to the stock market  
Slowdown Signs
Wall Street and Washington have been buzzing this month about the potential for an economic slowdown after U S  equities suffered one of the deepest sell offs of the year on Aug  14 and a key portion of the U S  Treasury yield curve inverted for the first time in 12 years  New home sales also were weaker than expected in June 
Homebuilders that cater to entry level buyers are better positioned to weather shifting demand  Reading said  Shares of D R  Horton Inc   which focuses on starter homes  have climbed 41  this year  while Toll Brothers is up 12   The stock slipped  1 9  in premarket trading Wednesday 
The luxury builder s biggest challenge may be its concentration in California  where its homes under contract had an average price of  1 74 million in the quarter  Chinese buyers have pulled back there and the federal tax overhaul limited deductions for property levies and mortgage interest 
As at other homebuilders  Toll s profits have gotten squeezed by the need to drive sales with buyer incentives  Fewer California deals  with their relatively fat margins  also didn t help  Toll s full year guidance for adjusted gross margin of 23  was slightly lower than the consensus of 23 2   based on a Bloomberg survey of analysts 
 Tailwinds  Intact
Toll is off to a good start in the current quarter that started Aug  1  Chief Executive Officer Doug Yearley said in the earnings statement 
 Low mortgage rates  a limited supply of new and existing homes  and a strong employment picture are providing tailwinds   he said 
The company has been looking to scale up its business in other parts of the country and build less expensive homes 
 They are diversifying the type of product they re building  but it s not a transformation that happens overnight   said Alex Barron  an analyst with the Housing Research Center in El Paso  Texas   Toll Brothers is luxury  They re not going to go from being a Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  to being Walmart  NYSE WMT

141749,363264,JWN,Nordstrom  JWN  Debuts Local  Mini  Stores In New York ,opinion,"Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   opened its first Nordstrom Local store in New York today  expanding its store portfolio  The company previously had three Nordstrom Local shops open in Los Angeles  California  The new Local store debuted in Manhattan on the Upper East Side  and the company is planning on opening an additional Local store in the West Village neighborhood on September 27th 
Nordstrom Local 
The Nordstrom Local stores are unique because they are small in size  offer personal styling services and alterations  and are a hub for picking up online orders  Consumers can order items to be shipped to the local store for them to try on in person and purchase that day if they want to  These stores are the latest initiative to expand Nordstrom s online presence and adapt to the conventional consumer needs  Co President Erik Nordstrom expressed his optimism about engaging and serving consumers on their own terms and that Local stores are an attempt to see what resonates with today s consumer 
Erik Nordstrom went on to state that people who visit a Nordstrom Local store spend 2 5X more than people who visit a regular Nordstrom location  He also stated that the consumers who use their alteration services spend 3X as much as the regular Nordstrom store consumer  The company is also hoping that their new Nordstrom Local stores will be able to lure in new customers through their services like shoe and handbag repair and gift wrapping 
Trouble in the Industry 
Nordstrom has not been immune to the decline in sales that department retail stores have suffered  In the company s previous earnings report  the company s full price stores fell 6 5  while its off price store sales slipped by 1 9   As a result  the department store giant slashed its financial guidance for the current fiscal year  Department stores as a whole have been facing immense pressure from brands who are opting to open their own stores rather than relying heavily on their wholesale partners  Macy s   NYSE M   and Kohl s   NYSE KSS   have also fallen victim to this trend and are both looking for ways to revitalize sales 
Nordstrom is also a company within an industry that imports heavily from China  making it highly susceptible to the ongoing trade war  Investors became more optimistic today as the US and China agreed to resume their talks in hopes of agreeing on a trade deal  Nordstrom is struggling to stimulate growth  and tariffs would only further complicate matters for the company  Furthermore  mixed macroeconomic signals do not bode well for the company  Nordstrom s full priced stores are already struggling to spark growth and a potential recession would be the last thing it needs right now

141777,363292,JWN,As Barneys struggles  fashion vendors try on alternative channels,news,"By Sarah White and Melissa Fares
PARIS NEW YORK  Reuters    When fashion label Prada  HK 1913  started demanding greater control over shop floor arrangements in U S  department stores  Barneys New York  now mired in bankruptcy proceedings  was one of the few with enough swagger to resist 
The luxury retailer  respected by its well heeled clients for its selection  said in interviews at the time it wanted to maintain its influence over buying the merchandise rather than ceding to a leased shop in shop controlled by the brand 
Prada eventually reintroduced its women s styles to the department store after a three year hiatus  and still counts Barneys as a wholesale partner  a person close to the label said 
But if that stand off ended well for Barneys  its bankruptcy last week may give fashion and luxury brands new motivation to move beyond wholesale arrangements with department stores  to focus on their own stores and websites 
 Most luxury vendors prefer to sell at their own stores  rather than in wholesale   said Jerry Storch  chief executive officer of consultancy Storch Advisors 
While fashion brands still like Barneys  trend setting vibe  direct sales are far more profitable than wholesale arrangements  and vendors ultimately want to be in control of their own operations and brand experience  Storch said 
Barneys New York owes some  1 6 million to Prada alone  as well as millions more to labels from  Kering   PA PRTP  s Gucci to LVMH  PA LVMH  s Givenchy  according to its bankruptcy filings  and friction with vendors had been building up 
According to Barneys  court filings  merchandise shipments began to slow over the summer  with many vendors refusing to send their inventory unless they got cash on delivery 
 There was a lot of talk among brands about finding other distribution channels   one source familiar with Barneys  supplier network said   They d been paying late  in the market  everyone knew that  
Barneys has until Oct  24 to avoid liquidation by finding a buyer and clinching a sale  according to terms of its bankruptcy financing outlined during a court hearing last week 
 Barneys is committed to working closely with our vendors to ensure we continue providing our customers with excellent services  products and experiences   a company spokeswoman told Reuters 
     We have secured approximately  218 million in new financing from partners who have directly expressed confidence in our ability to achieve a value enhancing transaction   she said   This capital will be used  in part  to ensure our long standing relationships with our vendor partners who are so essential to our future success  
For major luxury brands  hiccups in the wholesale chain only compound the allure of controlling their own wares with their own stores  as they seek to master their image by avoiding mark downs  gain flexibility to roll out products at varying paces  increase brand exposure  and boost margins   and the trend in that direction is picking up 
PRADA S PUSH INTO MINI STORES
Prada  with just under 20  of revenues derived from wholesale accounts  wants to whittle that down to 5  over the next three to five years  Chief Executive Officer Patrizio Bertelli told analysts in early August 
The bulk of that reduction will fall on Italy and the rest of Europe  Prada had already transformed some 40 sale locations in U S  department stores into concessions  essentially mini stores brands operate within host department stores 
The concessions model is already more prevalent in Europe  Parisian department stores like Galeries Lafayette are a maze of branded shop in shops  But it is a cultural shift for many U S  luxury retailers including Neiman Marcus  NMRCUS UL  and Macy s Inc s  N M  Bloomingdale s  where concessions are somewhat less common 
Barneys does not do concessions across any category in general  Barneys recently hosted limited time pop ups with brands such as Chanel  Bulgari and Moynat 
 Department stores that move to concessions don t need an internal buying team to select merchandise anymore   said Mario Ortelli  managing partner at luxury consultancy Ortelli   Co   What they have to do is create the right retail environment to generate store traffic and attract the brands  
Another industry source said that concession fees  where retailers typically get around 30  of sales  are starting to fall as brands are in a stronger position to negotiate 
If brands have more say about where and how their merchandise is sold  some may choose to exit less profitable department store locations 
 That s a real risk for the major department stores because they depend on having the big name brands in their stores to give them credibility  so the pressure is really on   said Ron Frasch  the former president at retailer Saks Fifth Avenue as well as its rival Bergdorf Goodman 
The Barneys department store chain  struggling with declining sales and soaring rent  plans to close 15 locations and wants to keep seven stores   including its flagship on Madison Avenue in New York   open for business 
Vendors are also increasingly exploring other means of distributing merchandise via partnerships with players like Rent the Runway  Richemont s  S CFR  Yoox Net a Porter and  Stitch Fix  Inc  O SFIX  
To fend off some of this competition  some high end department store chains have formed partnerships of their own 
In June  for example   Nordstrom Inc   N JWN  and Rent the Runway announced a tie up that aims to draw more foot traffic into the department store while making the clothing rental service more convenient 




In April  struggling upscale U S  retailer Neiman Marcus took a minority stake in online luxury reseller Fashionphile  In 2016  the luxury department store also teamed up with Rent the Runway and opened its first in store Rent the Runway shop in a bid to attract younger shoppers ",2019-08-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/as-barneys-struggles-fashion-vendors-try-on-alternative-channels-1953510,1953510

141781,363296,JWN,Nordstrom s Earnings Loom  Will It Stave Off The Retail Apocalypse ,opinion,"Clothing behemoth Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  is looking to stay aggressive despite an earnings call this week that could bring some bad news for shareholder value  The Seattle based company wants to stay ahead of declining social trends and sliding stock prices by maintaining a high discount rate to stay afloat in a tumultuous industry where online shopping has reigned supreme 
In response to some notable store closings at malls and elsewhere around the country  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  focused on quality over quantity  there were at one point 400 stores in 40 states in the U S  but those numbers are dwindling   With competition from a new Neiman Marcus at Hudson Yards  Macy s at Herald Square and other competitors  Nordstrom is set to open more local stores for online pick up  as well as a new hub in New York City  
The following data shows the increased floor Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  is willing to maintain to keep potential buyers engaged  They haven t dipped beneath 35  on average discounts across their inventory since earlier this year  a move that signals to us that they want people to not only visit their stores but to buy something once they re in there 





If Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  is willing to take the hit on selling clothes at nearly 40  off so often  that means they want to shrug off the notion they re too much of a high priced luxury brand for the average consumer 





After years of ownership  it seems that Trunk Club and Hautelook aren t paying off when it comes to social media attention  Engagement on Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Twitter  NYSE TWTR   especially when it relates to foot traffic  Were Here counts  aren t trending upwards  If people aren t mentioning these brands often  they might not necessarily buy products  And that is what Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  needs more people to do  buy more of their inventory  even if that means directing them away from the mall or outlet stores and opting for online service 





The only concern apart from these social trends is the retail wide stock hit many stores face  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  is not invulnerable to the same woes that affect Macy s  NYSE M   JC Penney  NYSE JCP  and Sears  OTC SHLDQ   The company will announce earnings August 21 and analysts tracked by Zacks Investment Research have downgraded expectations  looking for  0 76 per share

141782,363297,JWN,Nordstrom  JWN  Tops Q2 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 90 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 76 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 95 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 18 42   A quarter ago  it was expected that this department store operator would post earnings of  0 43 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 23  delivering a surprise of  46 51  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Nordstrom  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry  posted revenues of  3 87 billion for the quarter ended July 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 55   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 07 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Nordstrom shares have lost about 46  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15 7  
What s Next for Nordstrom 
While Nordstrom has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Nordstrom was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 71 on  3 73 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 28 on  15 60 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Retail   Apparel and Shoes is currently in the top 43  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-08-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nordstrom-jwn-tops-q2-earnings-estimates-200457339,200457339

s bottom line reverted to a positive surprise trend after a miss in the previous quarter  the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third straight quarter  Both the top and bottom line also decreased on a year over year basis  Consequently  management trimmed the upper end of its earnings per share view Nevertheless  shares of this Seattle  WA based company jumped 12 2  in the after market trading session on Aug 21  This uptick is primarily attributed to the company s bottom line beat in the quarter under review  Nordstrom s earnings of 90 cents per share outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents  Although the bottom line dipped 5 3  year over year  the metric benefited from robust inventory discipline and significant cost containment efforts Year to date  the company has realized more than  100 million in cost savings  remaining ahead of its plans to generate nearly  150  200 million in the current fiscal year  Furthermore  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company is consistently focusing on the expansion of its local market strategy to New York City in order to drive the top line  It is slated to open a flagship store on Oct 24 along with two Nordstrom

to  3 778 million  Credit Card net revenues advanced 8  to  94 million  Decline in the company s top line reflected soft performance at its off price business and the Anniversary Sale Furthermore  Nordstrom s full price net sales  including the U S  full line stores  Nordstrom com  the Canadian operation  Trunk Club  Jeffrey and Nordstrom Local  decreased 6 5  to  2 530 million in the fiscal second quarter  The company s off price net sales  including Nordstrom U S  Rack stores   and Last Chance clearance stores  also dipped 1 9  to  1 248 million However  the company is capitalizing on its strong inventory position to improve depth in major items and enhance in stock levels  Moreover  it saw improvements in customer metrics on a year over year basis  during the Anniversary Sale  As a result  management expects improved sell through of Anniversary product to boost merchandise margin in the fiscal third quarter Meanwhile  the company s digital sales grew 4   representing nearly 30  of the overall net sales  Nordstrom also continued to strengthen its loyalty program in the reported quarter  The Nordy Club has 12 million active customers  representing a 12  increase year over year and 64  of sales Operational UpdateNordstrom s gross profit margin contracted 50 basis points  bps  to 34 5  mainly on account of higher occupancy expenses  However  merchandise margin rate improved sequentially in spite of an elevated promotional backdrop Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses  as a percentage of sales  rose 26 bps to 31 2  primarily owing to higher fixed costs on lower sales  This was partly offset by cost savings on account of Nordstrom s continuous efforts to enhance efficiency and adjust performance related expenses Earnings before interest and

141784,363299,JWN,Have Department Stores Fallen Into Value Territory ,opinion,"Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   stock soars following a mixed earnings report last night  August 21st  with shares up more than 16  in today s trading  Were earnings so impressive that investors and traders rushed to buy scores of JWN or is their more to the story 
Department retail stocks have gotten hammered over the past 52 weeks  with Kohl s   NYSE KSS   down over 40  while Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    Macy s   NYSE M   and JC Penney   NYSE JCP   are all down over 50  

What is causing this mass exodus of department store stocks and why were mixed earnings results enough to send JWN surging over 15  
There is a significant consumer shift occurring in society today that is centered on value and convenience  These massive  seemingly unorganized department stores aren t meeting the next generation s consumer needs  In my article    I touch on retailers that have been able to ride this evolving consumer wave and those that haven t  In this article  I will focus on department stores and their future in the retail world 
Q2 Earnings 
Macy s Q2 results provoked a devastating blow to its share price as well as its competitors  It missed big on both top and bottom lines illustrating its worst Q2 EPS in a decade and worst Q2 sales in 9 years  M s share price has plummeted almost 20  since its earnings release last week  Macy s poor results was a cautionary tale to investors about the department store earnings to come 
Expectations for these department stores have dropped significantly over the past year with analysts displaying considerable conservatism in their estimates  A big miss on a conservative forecast is going to kill any stock  which we saw with Macy s  An EPS beat on a stock that has been battered down for the last year is going to release some of the pessimistic sentiment  This is what is happening with Nordstrom 
Nordstrom released earnings last night and had a big EPS upside surprise which sent shares surging  despite a marginal topline miss and lowered guidance  Some of this bounce can be credited to short covering  Short interest on JWN has been growing throughout 2019 and traders decided it was time to cash out 
This week has seasonally low volume due to end of summer vacations  which may also have attributed to the massive upside that JWN experienced 
Valuation Argument
Nordstrom s current forward P E is lowest it s been since the great recession in 2008  This stock may have been traded down further than its intrinsic value  and all investors needed was a small catalyst  EPS beat  to jump back in  This is likely the same reason that shorts were covering  All stocks  no matter how poor they are performing  have a price in which they become attractive  JWN was  and may still be  in an attractive price range for any value investor  and the 5 6  dividend gives you a little more comfort in purchasing this stock 
Macy s appears to be trading at its lowest forward P E ever with its most recent earnings sinking the stock to its lowest price in over a decade  This stock may be trading below its fair value with pessimistic traders and investors keeping it down  I am not rushing to buy shares Macy s  but there is an argument to be made that this is a value buy  especially when the stock is yielding an almost 10  dividend  Macy s is not at risk of default yet  though their credit rating is toeing junk bond levels  and with expectations so low it wouldn t take much for this stock to get a boost 

Take Away
Millennials have taken over as the largest consuming group  and they are shaking up the retail space  This generation of consumers are increasingly online  and so are their shopping patterns  Millennials are attracted to convenience and value when making a purchase  Big department retailers are unable to provide these attributes 
These department store stocks may have been beaten down enough to once again provide value to your portfolio with significant dividend yields hedging some of the risks of buying into a potentially dying sector 
Department stores have the potential to change consumer sentiment in their favor if they can effectively shift their businesses models  This is easier said than done  but I am confident that some of these department retailers will be successful in this evolving market

is a synopsis of all five stocks  MobileIronis a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and it is the Bull of the Day   Normally we have a stock with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  holding the title of Bull of the Day  but today I want to show you a stock that looks to be breaking out   With all the Trade Talk and Geopolitical drama dominating the headlines  this stock has moved steadily higher over the last few months and just broke up over  7 yesterday   Higher highs are coming for this stock so that 52 week mark of  7 42 is in sight DescriptionMobileIron  Inc  provides mobile IT platform that enables

advanced security controls  MobileIron  Inc  was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in Mountain View  California Earnings HistoryThe earnings history is ok for MOBL  not great  but not bad either  I see two meets  a miss and one beat in the last four reports  The beat was 4 quarters ago and it was a monster  The company reported a gain of 2 cents when a loss of two cents was expected and that translates into a 200  positive earnings surprise  Over the course of the last 4 quarters  the positive average earnings surprise is 45   Estimate RevisionsOver the last 60 days we have seen then estimate for this quarter slip by a penny  That move also caused the full year estimate to slide by the exact same amount  Next quarter is standing firm at a gain of 6 cents  For next year  the Zacks Consensus Estimate also holding still at  0 08 ValuationFor the next 12 months  there is not going to be positive earnings  But as you read in the last paragraph there will be positive earnings in 2020  That said  I see 10  topline growth and price to sales multiple of 3 7x  Margins are still negative for now  but I see some improvement over the last few quarters in operating margin  LG Display is Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and it is the Bear of the Day today   The stock dropped heading into earnings and then missed    but all is not lost   I held this stock in the Stocks Under  10 portfolio here at Zacks  and have to admit that not that it is at these lower levels  I am enticed DescriptionLG Display Co   Ltd   formerly known as LG Philips LCD Co   Ltd   primarily manufactures and sells thin film transistor liquid crystal display  TFT LCD  panels  The Company supplies its products to original equipment manufacturers and multinational corporations  LG Display offers TFT LCD

medium and large size panels for industrial and other applications  including entertainment systems  portable navigation devices  e paper  digital photo displays  and medical diagnostic equipment  LG Display Co   Ltd  is based in Seoul  the Republic of Korea Recent EarningsAs I look at the earnings history I seet he recent report has the company coming up only 1 penny short   That is the smallest of misses and on its own should not be a reason to take a pass on this stock Estimates Have Moved DownThe losses are getting bigger at LPL  with the current quarter moving from a loss of 2 cents to a loss of 26 cents in just 60 days   THe full year saw estimates adjusted lower to a loss of  1 10 from a loss of  0 34 2020 numbers are showing the company earnings money  and we know that investors love to get in on the switch   Moving from a loss to a gain is an important distinction that some investors care a lot about The 2020 Zacks Consensus Estimate has LPL earnings 17 cents per share ValuationWith no earnings  the forward PE is an NA for us   I see the price to book is only 0 3x so deep value investors are really ready to kick the tires   This stock could see a huge lift in a China deal comes    but most indicators are telling us that could be a long ways off Have Department Stores Fallen into Value Territory Nordstrom stock soars following a mixed earnings report last night  August 21st  with shares up more than 16  in today s trading  Were earnings so impressive that investors and traders rushed to buy scores of JWN or is their more to the story Department retail stocks have gotten hammered over the past 52 weeks  with Kohl s down over 40  and Macy s down over 50  What is causing this mass exodus of department store stocks and why were mixed earnings results enough to send JWN surging over 15  There is a significant consumer shift occurring in society today that is centered on value and convenience  These massive  seemingly unorganized department stores aren t meeting the next generation s consumer needs  In my article    I touch on retailers that have been able to ride this evolving consumer wave and those that haven t  In this article  I will focus on department stores and their future in the retail world Q2 Earnings Macy s Q2 results provoked a devastating blow to its share price as well as its competitors  It missed big on both top and bottom lines illustrating its worst Q2 EPS in a decade and worst Q2 sales in 9 years  M s share price has plummeted almost 20  since its earnings release last week  Macy s poor results was a cautionary tale to investors about the department store earnings to come Expectations for these department stores have dropped significantly over the past year with analysts displaying considerable conservatism in their estimates  A big miss on a conservative forecast is going to kill any stock  which we saw with Macy s  An EPS beat on a stock that has been battered down for the last year is going to release some of the pessimistic sentiment  This is what is happening with Nordstrom Nordstrom released earnings last night and had a big EPS upside surprise which sent shares surging  despite a marginal topline miss and lowered guidance  Some of this bounce can be credited to short covering  Short interest on JWN has been growing throughout 2019 and traders decided it was time to cash out This week has seasonally low volume due to end of summer vacations  which may also have attributed to the massive upside that JWN experienced Valuation ArgumentNordstrom s current forward P E is lowest it s been since the great recession in 2008  This stock may have been traded down further than its intrinsic value  and all investors needed was a small catalyst  EPS beat  to jump back in  This is likely the same reason that shorts were covering  All stocks  no matter how poor they are performing  have a price in which they become attractive  JWN was  and may still be  in an attractive price range for any value investor  and the 5 6  dividend gives you a little more comfort in purchasing this stock Macy s appears to be trading at its lowest forward P E ever with its most recent earnings sinking the stock to its lowest price in over a decade  This stock may be trading below its fair value with pessimistic traders and investors keeping it down  I am not rushing to buy shares Macy s  but there is an argument to be made that this is a value buy  especially when the stock is yielding an almost 10  dividend  Macy s is not at risk of default yet  though their credit rating is toeing junk bond levels  and with expectations so low it wouldn t take much for this stock to get a boost Take AwayMillennials have taken over as the largest consuming group  and they are shaking up the retail space  This generation of consumers are increasingly online  and so are their shopping patterns  Millennials are attracted to convenience and value when making a purchase  Big department retailers are unable to provide these attributes These department store stocks may have been beaten down enough to once again provide value to your portfolio with significant dividend yields hedging some of the risks of buying into a potentially dying sector Department stores have the potential to change consumer sentiment in their favor if they can effectively shift their businesses models  This is easier said than done  but I am confident that some of these department retailers will be successful in this evolving market Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market

141825,363340,JWN,Investor Litt says Hudson s Bay worth double chairman s C 1 74 billion bid,news, Reuters    Activist shareholder Jonathan Litt lambasted a C 1 74 billion bid to take Canadian retailer Hudson s Bay Co private as  woefully inadequate  on Tuesday  saying the chairman led shareholder group looking to push through a deal could double the offer  The shareholder group  which collectively owns 57  stake in the struggling retailer  made an offer last week to buy the company for C 9 45 per share  with plans to fund the deal using some of the proceeds from asset sales  Litt  however  said if the buyout group used all the proceeds from asset sales  rather than a part of it  it could raise the offer to C 18 per share  He also asked the special committee of independent directors  tasked with evaluating the latest offer  to hire an independent investment bank to evaluate the value of Hudson s Bay s real estate and retail banners  Litt s Land and Buildings and other shareholders have long criticized Hudson s Bay for not doing enough to capitalize on the value of its properties  Hudson s Bay real estate was worth as much as  6 4 billion or  35 24 per share  the company said in 2017   However  that figure included the Lord   Taylor flagship store  which the company sold to WeWork and partner Rh ne Capital for  850 million in October 2017  and a Vancouver property owned by the company s RioCan joint venture  since sold for  675 million   Shares of the company  which owns the Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord   Taylor retail chains  have risen nearly 61  to C 10 25 since Baker s proposal   The department store operator has been shuttering underperforming shops to cut costs and stay competitive among discount brands and e commerce behemoths such as Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  and is the latest retailer to consider going private   Last year  members of Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  Inc s founding family offered  8 4 billion for the company  but abandoned the bid once Nordstrom s special board committee rejected it  Litt also said he believes it was highly unlikely that a majority of the shareholders outside the buyout group will approve the transaction   Hudson s Bay and the buyout group were not immediately available for comment ,2019-06-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/investor-land--buildings-calls-hudsons-bay-chairmans-offer-inadequate-1900421,1900421
141826,363341,JWN,Hudson s Bay s chairman s buyout bid pits retail versus real estate,news,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Harry Brumpton  Reuters    The success of Hudson s Bay Co Executive Chairman Richard Baker s  1 3 billion bid to take the department store operator private hinges on whether an independent valuator will view the company more as a retailer and less as a real estate owner  corporate governance experts and analysts said  Much of Hudson s Bay s value is locked up in its real estate  Were the company to sell off some of its properties to raise cash  it could fetch more than what Baker offered  but would then be forced to pay rent to run some of its stores  Baker s buyout consortium  which already owns 57  of Hudson s Bay  has made a C 9 45 per share offer for the remainder of the Canadian company  a 48  premium to where the stock was trading before the announcement   However  some of the minority shareholders  including hedge fund Land   Buildings Investment Management LLC  say they value the company s assets at between C 28 and C 33 per share  Hudson s Bay shares ended trading on Friday at C 9 73  above the C 9 45 offer price  as investors bet on a sweetened bid  The big valuation gap is due to disagreements over how much of Hudson s Bay s prime real estate can be divested while keeping it operational  Selling off property raises cash but also makes it more financially burdensome for the company to rent the space for the stores it operates  As a result  it would likely close stores  and its retail footprint would begin to shrink   There is judgment to be exercised on the valuation  which can always be challenging   said Catherine McCall  the executive director of the Canadian Coalition for Good Governance  an organization representing institutional shareholders in Canadian public companies  Hudson s Bay operates 39 stores under its Saks Fifth Avenue brand  133 stores under its Saks OFF 5th brand  more than 40 stores under the Lord   Taylor banner  90 Hudson s Bay department stores  as well as 37 stores in Canada which the company plans to close this year under the Home Outfitters brand   Hudson s Bay s trophy asset is the Saks Fifth Avenue building in Manhattan  which this year completed a  250 million renovation  Hudson s Bay s most recent public estimate for the value of its real estate was in September 2018  when CEO Helena Foulkes pegged it at  28 per share  Baker has offered about a third of that because he argues that the company would have to all but liquidate to achieve all the real estate value  Toronto Dominion Bank  which has been hired by a Hudson s Bay board committee to independently evaluate the take private deal  will recommend whether the company should accept the offer as fair  or reject it and try to negotiate further   The board committee excludes representatives of Baker s buyout consortium and is granted power to prevent any deal  even if the prospective acquirers otherwise control the company  In an illustration of this  a special board committee sank the hopes of Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  Inc s founding family group last year to take the U S  department store operator private  after it rejected their  8 4 billion offer  The methodology Toronto Dominion Bank uses to value the bid for Hudson s Bay will be key to the outcome and will be scrutinized heavily by shareholders  The bank will likely be assessing how comparable companies  shares trade  research similar deals and consider how much a financial buyer like a private equity firm would pay  said Andrey Golubov  a professor of finance at the University of Toronto   It s not done just to justify the offer  That said  valuation is not a science   Golubov said   Hudson s Bay declined to comment  as did a spokesman for Baker s buyout consortium  Spokespeople for TD Bank did not respond to requests for comment  CASHING OUT ON REAL ESTATE Sale lease back arrangements in which retailers sell their properties and become tenants in their stores have become increasingly popular in the last few years as the downturn in brick and mortar retail brought about by the rise of internet shopping has put pressure on retailers to raise cash  However  some retailers resist them because they view the rent obligation as burdensome  a stance that often attracts investor criticism  Macy s Inc for example  another department store operator  was pressured by hedge fund Starboard Value LP three years ago to do more to cash out on its real estate   Even if Toronto Dominion Bank blesses an offer from Baker s consortium and the board committee negotiating a deal approves it  the acquisition still faces some hurdles  A majority of the shareholders who are not affiliated with the buyout consortium have to vote for it  accounting for about 21 5 percent of the company s shareholder base  Opponents could still challenge the deal in court when the company seeks approval for it before a judge under the Canada Business Corporations Act   But successful legal challenges of deals that have followed the process for management buyouts outlined by the Ontario Securities Commission  as Hudson s Bay is seeking to do  are rare  
 Most of these deals get done once they get board approval and a transaction agreement gets signed   said Jeremy Fraiberg  chair of the mergers and acquisitions group at Osler  Hoskin   Harcourt LLP ",2019-06-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/hudsons-bays-chairmans-buyout-bid-pits-retail-versus-real-estate-1904976,1904976
141827,363342,JWN,Exclusive  In push to replace Huawei  rural U S  carriers are talking with Nokia and Ericsson,news,"By Tarmo Virki and Angela Moon HELSINKI NEW YORK  Reuters    About a dozen rural U S  telecom carriers that depend on Huawei for network gear are in discussions with its biggest rivals  Ericsson  BS ERICAs  and Nokia  HE NOKIA   to replace their Chinese equipment  sources familiar with the matter said  The carriers  which include Pine Belt in Alabama  and Union Wireless in Wyoming  are seeking discounted pricing and looking forward to government assistance but have yet to reach agreements  these sources said  Nokia and Ericsson declined to comment   The talks are critical for small carriers that have relied on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd or ZTE Corp  HK 0763  for inexpensive  high quality mobile network gear in recent years even as the big U S  telecom companies shunned the Chinese firm  The U S  government has labeled Huawei a security threat and effectively banned U S  companies from doing business with Huawei  But switching vendors will not be easy  Nokia and Ericsson  both of which have struggled financially in recent years  will not match Huawei s pricing  analysts and company executives say  Huawei s prices  were not market based   said an equipment industry executive who has worked for years in North America   They made no sense    Roger Entner  an analyst at Recon Analytics  estimated Huawei and its compatriot  ZTE  charged 30  to 50  less than rivals  Talks are not expected to continue until legislation in the U S  Congress to provide  700 million in subsidies to help rural carriers with the switch is approved  sources familiar with the discussions said  No action has been taken on the bill since it was introduced in May  according to Congress gov  The Rural Wireless Association  RWA   a trade group  estimates it would cost between  800 million to  1 billion to install new gear  John Nettles  president of Pine Belt  said he reached out to Ericsson and Nokia last year when the federal ban on using money from the  8 5 billion Universal Service Fund for Chinese equipment was first suggested   The conversation has been going on for about a year and they are looking for ways to bring down the price  within the reach of the smaller carriers   he said  Without a discount  he added  rural carriers would not be able to afford it  Union Wireless said it was in discussions with Nokia  but declined to provide details   Industry executives briefed on the discussions confirmed that Nokia and Ericsson were in talks with rural carriers but detailed discussions will not happen until later this year as the regulators are still trying to determine which parts need to be replaced  Ericsson and Nokia  however  may have little incentive to offer discounts as economies of scale are not in rural carriers  favor  The  700 million opportunity is scattered between small operators which in total  according to one industry executive  need at most 2 000 base stations to be swapped  By comparison  the top U S  operators each run networks of more than 50 000 base stations   The availability of local workforces that manage swapping of the equipment could also be a problem   The scarcest resource in the U S  today is tower climbers  There is tremendous job growth in this sector right now   said one industry executive   RISK OF SHUT DOWNS  Rural wireless carriers typically serve between 50 000 to 100 000 subscribers in remote areas that are out of reach by big telecom companies like  Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ  or AT T Inc  NYSE T  and are often the sole regional provider  Among these carriers  the RWA estimated that 25  of its members have Huawei or ZTE equipment  SI Wireless  which has 20 000 mobile customers across western portions of Kentucky and Tennessee  said the majority of its network uses Huawei equipment  Viaero  which serves 110 000 mobile customers across Eastern Colorado  Western Kansas  Nebraska and parts of Wyoming and South Dakota  said roughly 80  of its network equipment  including core  wireless  microwave and fiber  was manufactured by Huawei  according to FCC filings   Rural telcos are not very profitable and a lot of the owners are in their 50s  60s and 70s  If they have to rip out their network  they are probably going to shut down if they can t easily find a buyer   Recon Analytics  Entner said  That means basic communications could disappear from poorly served communities  The advent of 5G networks poses a dilemma  companies that are forced to rip out Chinese equipment could try and move to 5G immediately  but that would be more expensive in the short term  Still  5G could give the rural carriers some leverage with Nokia and Ericsson  Handelsbanken analyst Daniel Djurberg noted small deals would boost the number of 5G wins Nokia and Ericsson are counting to show their advances in the new technology  Ericsson and Nokia are likely interested in the deals also for strategic reasons  
 It s important to be in the U S  and these operators may be bought by bigger operators later on and then they have positioned themselves   said Bengt Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   head of Stockholm headquartered consultancy firm Northstream which advises telecom operators and vendors ",2019-06-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/exclusive-in-push-to-replace-huawei-rural-us-carriers-are-talking-with-nokia-and-ericsson-1906988,1906988

The market promptly punished Macy s for its results and saw the company s performance as a sign of things to come from other operators in the space who are on deck to report results in the next few days  As a result  the market meted out equal opportunity punishment to Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   JWN   Kohl s  KSS  and other retailers  This added to these stocks  existing woes  as you can see in the year to date performance chart of Macy s vs  Nordstrom vs  the S P 500 index 

The Wal Mart report Thursday morning didn t contain even a whiff of the issues that Macy s management was whining about on Wednesday  The retail giant not only handily beat estimates  but actually guided higher  The internals of the Wal Mart report reconfirmed my long held confidence in the company as offering the most credible challenge to Amazon  AMZN  in the space

So  what s going on with Macy s  
I am no expert of the retail space and have no idea how the company needs revive its fortunes  But there is no doubt in my mind that Macy s problems are of its making  In other words  this is a company specific problem  What this means is that it may not be fair to treat Nordstrom  Kohl s  and others with the same brush

Department stores stocks have been getting hammered in 2019 with the entire space being down over 37   while the overall retail sector is up more than 16   July retail sales figures rose  7  from the prior month and 3 4  year over year  the biggest gains since March 
Department stores illustrated a top line decline of 4 3  in the first 7 months of 2019 compared to 2018  while ecommerce saw an 11 9  sales increase 
Macy s   NYSE M   was the first of the big department stores to release its July quarter financials  Macy s results were devastating to shareholders  reporting its worst July quarter sales in 9 years and lowest Q2 profitability in 10 years  Share prices plummeted over 16  on the news 
JC Penney also released its earnings last week and the results further confirming analysts concerns with another quarter in the red 
Dying Department Stores
Why are these big department retailers struggling while the broader retail market seems to be performing on par with the S P 500 
A generational shift is occurring in society today with millennials now being the largest consumer group  Millennials pride themselves on their ability to achieve their goals with as little hassle as possible and going to a massive  challenging to navigate department store don t fit that standard 
This next generation of consumption is quickly moving to the World Wide Web  Ecommerce shopping continues to expand at an accelerating rate  Not only do consumers not have to navigate cumbersome department stores  but they can sit on their couch and typically find what they were looking for at a lower price 
Below you can see how top department stores have performed since the beginning of the year 

TJ Maxx  TJX 
TJ Maxx appears to be the one diamond in the department store rough  TJX offers something that the other department stores don t  value shopping at the lowest prices  Millennials are savvy shoppers with a renewed focus on finding value  TJX has seen consistent year over year topline growth for over 2 decades  in a trend that analysts are estimating won t slowdown anytime soon 
TJX analysts are estimating a Q2 EPS of  0 62 on revenues of  9 88 billion  which would represent 6  and 5  year over year growth  respectively 
Kohl s  KSS 
Kohl s is coming off very disappointing Q1 earnings  which plummeted its stock price over 15  in just one day  This instigated analysts to drop EPS estimates across the board 
For tomorrow mornings July quarter results analysts are estimating an EPS of  1 52 on sales of  4 46 billion  which would represent a year over year decline of 13 6  and 2 5  respectively 
Nordstrom  JWN 
Nordstrom has lost over 57  of its value in the last 52 weeks as the company struggles to compete with online retailers  They have made significant investments into their ecommerce platform  but they are still unable to remain competitive as their earnings begin to toe the line of profitability 
JWN is a big mover on recent earnings with an average price movement of 9 1  over the past 6 quarters  2 up  4 down   Analysts are estimating an EPS of  0 76 on  3 93 billion in revenue  which would be a marginal year over year decline on both metrics 
Take Away
The department store model is a dying breed  but there are still stars in the space that have found their niche like TJ Maxx  Color on how management plans on navigating the rocky waters ahead is going to be crucial for how these stocks perform in the impending July quarter reports  These firms need to successfully pivot their business model to adjust to the shifting consumer

141865,363380,JWN,Retail Store Cannibalization  Walmart Latest To Fall Prey,opinion,The retail space is currently passing through turbulent times despite a relatively healthy U S  economy with record busting equity market performance by benchmark indices  Dwindling sales by several underperforming stores have led to a surge in brick and mortar store closures  following the principle of  survival of the fittest  In 2018  the retail sector reportedly witnessed 5 864 store closures as low customer footfall generated soft turnover  rendering most brick and mortar stores financially unviable  With online shopping fast becoming the preferred mode of transaction  about 5 994 store closures are in the cards this year as retail sector bankruptcies are piling up  Notably  online shopping is likely to swell from 16  of retail sales at present to 25  by 2026  bringing on the chopping block an estimated 75 000 stores   Read More   Dog Eat Dog MarketIn addition to the evolving customer preferences and preeminence of the online shopping platform  much of the lackluster performance is attributable to retail store cannibalization  whereby one store undercuts another store of the same company  In order to survive in a cut throat market  various companies often resort to increasing their physical footprint in every nook and corner of the locality  This often ended up putting stores into direct competition with one another  and became an unsustainable model with rising rents and other operating costs adding to the woes of declining store traffic Retail firms have learnt the hard way that quality supersedes quantity and overexposure though higher number of stores often fail to yield the desired effect  Efforts are on to focus more on increased customer reach and deeper market penetration through location analytics to choose better locations and identify the right ways to expand without compromising on profitability  The latest firm to realize this ideology after falling prey to retail store cannibalization is Walmart Inc    NYSE WMT   Feeling the Pinch With more than 5 300 combined retail locations across the United States  Walmart has aggressively expanded its store footprint from a humble beginning in 1962  The company followed an extensive expansion strategy to garner a top of the mind customer recall for almost anything on offer for day to day use  However

141866,363381,JWN,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Walmart  Foot Locker  Shoe Carnival  Nordstrom And Macy s,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  July 8  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Walmart Inc    NYSE WMT    Foot Locker  Inc    NYSE FL    Shoe Carnival  NYSE CCL   Inc    NASDAQ SCVL    Nordstrom  Inc    NYSE JWN   and Macy s  Inc    NYSE M   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog Retail Cannibalization  Walmart  WMT  Latest to Fall PreyThe retail space is currently passing through turbulent times despite a relatively healthy U S  economy with record busting equity market performance by benchmark indices  Dwindling sales by several underperforming stores have led to a surge in brick and mortar store closures  following the principle of  survival of the fittest  In 2018  the retail sector reportedly witnessed 5 864 store closures as low customer footfall generated soft turnover  rendering most brick and mortar stores financially unviable  With online shopping fast becoming the preferred mode of transaction  about 5 994 store closures are in the cards this year as retail sector bankruptcies are piling up  Notably  online shopping is likely to swell from 16  of retail sales at present to 25  by 2026  bringing on the chopping block an estimated 75 000 stores   Read More   Dog Eat Dog MarketIn addition to the evolving customer preferences and preeminence of the online shopping platform  much of the lackluster performance is attributable to retail store cannibalization  whereby one store undercuts another store of the same company  In order to survive in a cut throat market  various companies often resort to increasing their physical footprint in every nook and corner of the locality  This often ended up putting stores into direct competition with one another  and became an unsustainable model with rising rents and other operating costs adding to the woes of declining store traffic Retail firms have learnt the hard way that quality supersedes quantity and overexposure though higher number of stores often fail to yield the desired effect  Efforts are on to focus more on increased customer reach and deeper market penetration through location analytics to choose better locations and identify the right ways to expand without compromising on profitability  The latest firm to realize this ideology after falling prey to retail store cannibalization is Walmart Inc Feeling the Pinch With more than 5 300 combined retail locations across the United States  Walmart has aggressively expanded its store footprint from a humble beginning in 1962  The company followed an extensive expansion strategy to garner a top of the mind customer recall for almost anything on offer for day to day use  However  this

141868,363383,JWN,Can Nordstorm  JWN  Be A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Nordstorm Inc    NYSE JWN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Nordstorm has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 07  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 01  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Nordstorm s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 16 28 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 26 92  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Nordstorm has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 27  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Nordstorm stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Nordstorm has a P S ratio of about 0 30  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Nordstorm currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Nordstorm a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 30  which is far better than the industry average of 5 76  Clearly  JWN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Nordstorm might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of F  This gives JWN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been sluggish at best  The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the next year estimate has seen none up and two down in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has inched lower by 0 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dropped by 1 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Nordstrom  Inc  Price and Consensus   Apart from this somewhat dismal trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNordstorm is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 29  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2019-08-05,Zacks Investment

141895,363410,JWN,Members only  U S  retailers revamp loyalty schemes for Amazon era,news,"By Aishwarya Venugopal  Reuters    With private fitting rooms  members only stores and clever apps  U S  department stores are reinventing their old and tested loyalty programs to fend off the challenge from e commerce giant Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  and other online rivals  Over the past two years  major U S  retailers  including Macy s  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   Kohls Corp and others  have spent billions of dollars to overhaul existing programs or launch new loyalty schemes   According to estimates compiled by market intelligence firm Beroe  the U S  loyalty program market was worth between  47 billion and  55 billion in 2018 in terms of spending by companies and sector analysts expect it to keep growing by 2 percent to 4 percent a year between 2018 2020  Data from research firm LoyaltyOne showed retailers now invest at least 2 percent of their total revenue on loyalty programs and double that or more on related customer targeting and analytics  Department stores and apparel retailers typically invest more than the others   Its report  Loyalty Big Picture  based on an international survey of 1 200 loyalty plan providers and some 4 500 members said 69 percent of executives reported a rise in spending on royalty schemes over the past two years  and 55 percent expected a further increase in investment in the next two years  Around in some form for over a century  loyalty programs have long relied on a simple concept   reward shoppers with coupons  discounts  prizes or air miles and they will come back  E commerce has changed that  It has made shopping around for bargains easier than ever while Amazon s Prime program set a new benchmark with perks  such as free two day shipping  video streaming or cloud storage  Just last month  Amazon raised the stakes again announcing it would spend  800 million to ensure one day delivery for its Prime members    In the age of Amazon  it s very much  what have you done for me lately type of retail environment    Matt Lindner  senior ecommerce analyst at market intelligence firm Mintel   The challenge these retailers are facing is how do you offer attractive rewards without totally compromising your bottom line    Realizing that expensive advertising is unlike to win back shoppers lost to online rivals  traditional retailers have shifted their focus to retaining existing customers and making them spend more  industry analysts say   BIGGEST AND BADDEST  Those most successful have employed sophisticated data gathering and analytics to better tailor offers to customers  tastes while providing perks that Amazon cannot match  such as private dressing rooms  members only stores or beauty workshops   Retailers are finally realizing that they need to respond to the  biggest and baddest  loyalty program in the market right now and that is Amazon Prime   research firm Gartner director Tom Gehani said   They have done so over the past five years by combining revamped loyalty schemes with increased online presence  in store pickup for online purchases  upgraded stores and new or improved mobile apps that tie in with loyalty programs  Macy s  for example  relaunched its scheme in mid 2017 after 10 straight quarters of comparable sales declines as a tiered plan with special privileges to its most loyal and big spending customers  The perks include ticketed seats to Macy s Thanksgiving Day Parade sales  concerts  fashion shows and cooking classes  When a year later  Macy s reported third quarter 2018 earnings that nearly doubled Wall Street s predictions  the department store chain attributed some of the growth to its  Star Rewards  program    The program is outperforming our expectation   Macy s Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Gennette said in February   Rival Nordstrom redesigned its customer loyalty program   The Nordy Club   in October 2018  It offers more reward points  fast redemptions  curbside pickup of purchases  and perks such as beauty and style workshops or brands not available to other shoppers  Today  the program s 11 million members account for a third of Nordstrom s customers and over half of its sales  Members can also save items in an app that will send push notifications to remind them of their wish list once they get close enough to a Nordstrom store  Only three or four years ago the retailer would spend most of its advertising dollars on seasonal campaigns  said Sean Claessen  executive vice president of Bond Brand Loyalty   You are now seeing them turn their attention to the  Nordy Club  and those kind of components   he said  Brand retailers have also joined the fray  J Crew launched its first rewards program in July 2018 with free shipping and exclusive sales and offers  while  Nike   NYSE NKE  has a members only floor at its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City   Members of its no fee NikePlus program get free courier delivery for purchases at the store  exclusive access to in demand shoes and one on one assessments by its experts   My favorite perks would be the fact that they can reserve a pair of sneakers for you  also exclusive wear where you can only get it if you re a member and birthday discounts   said Carlos Pena  23  a college student from New York City  Pena said he bought a pair of sneakers for his 22th birthday using the program s discount  In December  Lululemon said it was testing its first ever annual membership program for  128 with perks such as access to workout classes  free shipping and a pair of yoga pants  
 The standards of what it takes to win and keep customers are just going to keep getting higher   Gartner s Gehani said   Amazon is a company that has risen to meet that challenge and every other retailer is learning that they need to continually rise to meet that challenge too  ",2019-05-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/members-only-us-retailers-revamp-loyalty-schemes-for-amazon-era-1867046,1867046

141898,363413,JWN,Nordstrom Shares Slump on Earnings Miss ,news,"Investing com   Shares of department store chain Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  fell nearly 9  postmarket after the company missed on earnings and revenue for the fiscal first quarter  Nordstrom cut its guidance as well 
Nordstrom had expected to earn  3 65 to  3 90 a share for the year  The new guidance is  3 25 to  3 65  Revenue growth is projected at down 2  to flat  The prior guidance had been up 1  to 2  
For the quarter  Nordstrom earned 23 cents a share  missing the estimate of analysts polled by Investing com of 43 cents  Revenue was  3 44 billion  off 3 3  from a year ago  The Investing com estimate was  3 57 billion 
The company said its biggest problem was a 5 1  decline in sales of full price merchandise  Digital sales jumped 7  year over year  The company also said it struggled with a number of execution issues  including a big one with its enhanced loyalty program

141900,363415,JWN,Nike  NKE  Q4 2019 Earnings Preview  China  North America   More,opinion,"Shares of Nike   NYSE NKE   have fallen nearly 4  over the last three months after the sportswear powerhouse warned Wall Street of slowing growth last quarter  With Nike set to report its fourth quarter fiscal 2019 financial results on Thursday  June 27  let s see what investors should expect from the company s top and bottom lines  as well as its key region  China and North America 
Overview 
Nike is coming off a better than projected Q3  However  executives said they expect a low single digit revenue gain in Q4  due to currency headwinds  which are projected to reduce growth by 6   NKE stock is down over 10  since the firm reported its Q3 fiscal 2019 financial results on March 21  Meanwhile  the apparel market is down 7 6  as investors fear the U S  China trade war will negatively impact growth going forward   
In fact  in late May  Nike  Foot Locker   NYSE FL    Adidas  DE ADSGN  AG   OTC ADDYY    and a total of 173 companies in the general footwear industry wrote an open letter to President Donald Trump  urging him to reconsider his tariffs on shoes made in China   The proposed additional tariff of 25 percent on footwear would be catastrophic for our consumers  our companies  and the American economy as a whole   the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America wrote 
With that said  Nike has returned to growth in its key North American market over the last year  after a downturn  This comes even as it faces more competition from the likes of Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU    Adidas  Puma  Gap   NYSE GPS   owned athleisure brands  and other smaller players  Nike  like other retailers  has focused its future on direct to consumer and digital first growth through its own apps  website  as well as expansion across social platforms such as Instagram   NASDAQ FB   which has beefed up its shopping capabilities 
CFO Andy Campion has said he expects Nike s digital division will make up 30  of the company s total business by 2023  compared to roughly 15  in the second quarter of 2019  It is far too easy to say that Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   caused this change  but shopping habits have made the likes of Macy s   NYSE M    Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    and Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS   less relevant 
 
 
 
Outlook 
Before we dive into what to expect from the firm s Q4 fiscal 2019 metrics  investors will notice that NKE stock has easily outpaced the Apparel Market s average over the past five years  This gap has shrunk in the last year and Nike is up 12  in 2019  compared its industry s 19  climb  Nike shares hovered down 1 10  at  83 37 through late afternoon trading Wednesday  which represented a roughly 7  downturn compared to its 52 week intraday high of  90 0 a share 
Looking ahead  our Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for the company s quarterly revenue to pop 3 8  to  10 16 billion  Last quarter  Nike s quarterly revenue climbed roughly 7  to  9 611 billion to surpass our Zacks Consensus Estimate  This  however  marked a slowdown from Q2 s 10  revenue growth 
At the bottom end of the income statement  Nike s adjusted Q4 earnings are expected to slip 2 9  to  0 67 per share  NKE s third quarter earnings came in flat from the prior year period  This also topped our estimate  which Nike pretty much always does  The firm boasts a 9 8  average earnings surprise over the trailing four quarters 
North America 
Moving on  Nike s North American revenues are projected to jump nearly 7  from  3 875 billion in the year ago period to  4 139 billion  based on our NFM estimates  This would match last quarter s 7  expansion in the region that accounted for around 40  of total Q3 sales 
 
 
Greater ChinaChina  with its growing middle class and massive fashion hubs  has long been an area of intense focus for Nike  In fact  last quarter marked the firm s 19th consecutive quarter of double digit revenue growth in the world s second largest economy  Sales in China surged 19  to hit  1 588 billion  which came in well above our  1 54 billion estimate  However  Nike s performance in Greater China fell short of Q2 s 26  expansion 
With this in mind  Nike s Q4 sales in the region are projected to climb just 6  from  1 468 billion in Q4 2018 to  1 558 billion Nike s sales in China soared 35  in the fourth quarter of 2018 
Bottom Line
Clearly  Nike is projected to see a slowdown  which management warned was due in part to currency headwinds  This means that Wall Street might pay even closer attention to the firm s Nike Direct progress and any trade war updates 
Nike is scheduled to release its Q4 fiscal 2019 financial results after the closing bell on Thursday  June 27  Make sure to head back to Zacks for a complete breakdown of the sportswear giant s actual quarterly metrics

Nike s adjusted Q4 2019 earnings slipped and fell short of expectations  which rarely happens at the Beaverton  Oregon based company  The firm said its profits were hurt by increased spending on new technology and a higher tax rate than a year ago  This spending included adding RFID tags into products as part of an ongoing effort to streamline and speed up its business in an IoT focused age 
At the top of the income statement  Nike s revenue jumped 4  and topped estimates  Nike s sales growth was negatively impacted by currency headwinds  brought about by a strong U S  dollar  The company also saw its North American business  which accounts for roughly 40  of total sales  continue to grow 
Meanwhile  Nike s revenue in Greater China climbed by double digits for the 20th consecutive quarter  China is expected to continue to play a vital growth role at Nike for years to come  Investors should also note that Nike executives said the current U S China trade war hasn t hurt business much  and they don t expect it to going forward

141905,363420,JWN,Nordstrom Stock  Potential Value At This Price,opinion,"Nordstrom Inc  NYSE JWN   ticker    is a luxury retail chain that also offers off price Nordstrom Rack locations 
The company is in a bit of a rough patch at the moment  and Nordstrom stock has dropped like a rock in recent months 

Chart Source  F A S T Graphs
The Bad News 
On the surface  Nordstrom sounds like a lot of other brick and mortar retailers these days 
The company is in the midst of closing   its stock price is currently the same as it was in 2005  ouch    and its dividend payout has been flat since 2016 
The principle issue is that although sales are strong  the company has had declining profit margins  Over the past five years alone  the company s gross margin decreased from over 38  to under 36   and their operating margin literally halved from 10 8  to just 4 8   This doesn t bode well at all 
The Nordstrom family offered to buy the company and take it private in early 2018 at a price of  50 share  The board rejected this offer for being way too low  since the public stock price was already in the high  40 s at the time and there wasn t much of a premium offered 
By late 2018  the stock price was happily up to  66 share  In the mere 8 month since then  the stock price is down to under  32 share 
Nordstrom reported very poor results in May for the first quarter of 2019  which has been responsible for much of this recent sell off  Almost all reported items were bad  sales slumped and margins on those sales declined  If there was one silver lining  it was that online sales for the company increased by 7  for the quarter 
The Good News
Unlike many retailers that have been struggling  shrinking  and liquidating  Nordstrom has been able to grow its revenue over the past decade  which shows the resilience of the brand in a very competitive environment  Over the past five years  they have increased revenue from  12 5 billion to  15 7 billion 
Nordstrom has been around for well over a century  and has historically been somewhat of a blue chip stock  The company has often had big draw downs of 50  per more  and those were historically strong buying opportunities 

Nordstrom is already 61  off of its high point  which is the biggest drop since the global financial crisis and its fourth largest stock price drop in history 
At this price  the P E is below 10 and the dividend yield is over 4 6   which may present somewhat of a floor to the stock as long as company fundamentals don t deteriorate further  While the company could turn into a value trap  history suggests that Nordstrom is usually a buy at these levels 
The company s balance sheet is solid with BBB  credit ratings and a debt income ratio of about 4x  They are making use of leverage but not to excess 
Going forward  Nordstrom earns almost a third of its sales from online channels  and this will likely keep growing  The fact that the company is closing stores can help its margins  and it makes sense for the company to focus on profitable locations and online penetration 
For investors that want decent yields  high dividend stocks like Nordstrom along with some safe closed end funds can offer much higher yields than the S P 500  or treasury bonds  without taking on too much risk  The key is to stay diversified and watch payout ratios closely  Right now  Nordstrom only pays out about half of its earnings as dividends  so unless earnings take a dive  the dividend appears safe for now 
I ve been ignoring the retail space for a while  but at this new low price  I m interested  People are happy to buy clothes and shoes when they go on sale  but rarely want to buy stocks on sale 
Final Thoughts
The equity risk premium in the United States continues to be substantial  meaning that average S P 500 earnings yields are considerably above real bond yields 
In other words  although we are likely late in the market cycle  there is a solid case to buy stocks rather than to only own bonds when looking at the two asset classes from long term point of view 

Chart Source  Yardeni Research
By many metrics  stocks are expensive  Stock market capitalization as a percentage of GDP  CAPE ratio  dividend yield  all point to stock market overvaluation  Many areas of the market are likely overvalued  including many software companies and hot IPOs 
A large portion of high quality dividend stocks  however  still represent a good alternative to government bonds that yield next to nothing  and are relatively cheap when that comparison is made  For this reason  I continue to be 70  in equities despite the fact that I m cautious about many of their prices 
Companies with solid fundamentals  strong dividend yields  and resilient balance sheets still make sense as investments these days  If Nordstrom can turn its recent slump around for a better quarter or two  its stock could pop in price 
While I wouldn t make Nordstrom a large core position in a portfolio  I consider it a buy as a small position at these prices  Retail has always been volatile  but Nordstrom is one of the stronger players in the space  and now that the stock is in the low  30 s  the valuation is compelling

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  
Retail Bankruptcies Soar  E Sports  Gym Chains to the Rescue
Despite a relatively healthy U S  economy with record busting equity market performance by benchmark indices  an alarming trend of rising brick and mortar store closures has hogged the limelight in the retail space  Dwindling sales by several underperforming stores have led to a surge in retail sector bankruptcies  threatening the sustainability of real estate properties that primarily cater to malls and shopping complexes 
As the mall landlords seek alternative options to replace lost tenants  esports and gym chains have emerged as saviors  gobbling up the vacant spaces and helping the beleaguered properties to remain relevant to customers  Before we tread on these uncharted territories  let us dig a little deep into the seemingly closed chapters of the retail sector 
Brick and Mortar Retail Stores on the Wane
In 2018  the retail sector reportedly witnessed 5 864 store closures as low customer footfall generated soft turnover  rendering most brick and mortar stores financially unviable  With online shopping fast becoming the preferred mode of transaction  about 5 994 store closures are in the cards this year as retail sector bankruptcies are piling up  Notably  online shopping is likely to swell from 16  of retail sales at present to 25  by 2026  bringing on the chopping block an estimated 75 000 stores 
Various specialty retailers and discount stores such as Payless  Gymboree  Charlotte Russe and Shopko have filed for bankruptcies this year with a combined store closure of 3 720  Department stores like Nordstrom  Inc   Kohl s Corp  and Macy s  Inc  have reduced their store footprint as the battle for survival become murkier with intense price wars 
Reinventing Malls for Higher Customer Connect
With increasing vacancy  mall owners were forced to reinvent malls to cover the operational and real estate costs by engaging tenants who encouraged more customer connect and social interaction  Leading by example  Simon Property Group Inc    the largest publicly traded retail real estate firm with a diverse portfolio of shopping malls   has taken recourse to esports to transform its shopping centers into in game locations 
Esports  a billion dollar business  has fast emerged as the latest craze among sporting buffs with engaging content and challenges  Simon intends to capitalize on this trend and has collaborated with entertainment firm Allied Esports to create 10 000  to 15 000 square foot esports lounges for competitive video game events  The events are likely to generate additional sales opportunities for niche entertainment categories  food  drink  apparels and accessories  bringing a fresh lease of life to the struggling retail destinations 
Gym Chains Drive Additional Customer Traffic 
In addition to esports  gym chains and fitness centers have lent support to increase mall occupancy  and cashed in on the increased health awareness of U S  customers  A case in point is Planet Fitness  Inc  that aims to open about 225 gyms this year  With a tally of 1 800 gym centers across the country  Planet Fitness has been on growth streak in recent years with majority of its new gyms cropping up in locations that were vacated by retailers like Toys  R  Us  In the past three years  this fitness chain recorded a stellar return of 280 9   making it is one of the hottest stocks in retail space 
Mall owners are increasingly preferring gyms and grocery stores as they increase customer footfall even on weekdays when it is often tough to draw physical traffic  Moreover  customers often tend to combine their gym visits with shopping to save time and shop either before or after their workouts  Per data from real estate firm CoStar Group  the number of gym tenants in shopping centers has more than doubled over the past decade to more than 14 000 last year

141946,363461,JWN,Bear Of The Day  Bed Bath   Beyond Inc   BBBY ,opinion,"Shares of Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  NASDAQ BBBY    BBBY  have fallen steadily since 2015  Now  amid an activist investor push  which led to its CEO Steven Temares stepping down in mid May  the company s earnings and revenues appear to be headed in the wrong direction 
Recent News   Overview  
Bed Bath   Beyond on May 13 announced that it appointed Mary Winston interim CEO as its former chief executive walked away amid pressure from three activists Legion Partners  Macellum Advisors  and Ancora Advisors  Then  at the end of May  the company named four new independent directors to its board in a settlement with activist investors who had pressured BBBY to make changes amid a shifting retail landscape  Investors should note that 12 of the company s 13 directors have joined the board within the last two years 
The need for a change might have been cemented after Bed Bath   Beyond in early April reported its first annual loss and sales decline in  as a public firm  BBBY saw its full year fiscal 2018 revenue fall 2 6  to  12 03 billion  Meanwhile  the home goods retailer posted a GAAP net loss of  1 02 per share  which included a non cash goodwill and tradename impairments charge 
With all that said  Bed Bath   Beyond has clearly faced a hard time adjusting to an Amazon  AMZN  obsessed retail age  or at least found it difficult to convince Wall Street and investors it can based on its price chart  Shares of BBBY have tumbled 80  over the last five years  compared to its industry s 96  climb  After some initial 2019 success  Bed Bath   Beyond has seen its stock price fall 19  in the past month  BBBY stock closed regular trading hours Thursday at  12 29 per share  Plus  BBBY stock is pretty heavily shorted at the moment 
 
 
Outlook   Earnings Trends 
Before we jump into what to expect from Bed Bath   Beyond in the near term  let s quickly look at the retail landscape as a whole  As of Wednesday  we had first quarter results from 38 of the 39 retailers in the S P 500  Total earnings for these companies were are up  12 2  from the same period last year on  7 9   Despite that overall strength  department store firms from Macy s  M  to Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   JWN  have failed to impress  also read    
Meanwhile  Bed Bath   Beyond s first quarter fiscal 2019 revenue which is due out on July 10 is projected to fall 6 3  to  2 58 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  Looking further ahead  the company s full year revenue is expected to sink 4 4   Plus  the company s 2020 revenue is expected to fall over 1  below our current year projection in a sign of continued negativity 
Moving to the bottom end of the income statement  the company s adjusted Q1 2019 earnings are projected to plummet 75  to  0 08 per share  Meanwhile  Bed Bath   Beyond s full year fiscal 2019 EPS figure is projected to slip 3 9  overall  Investors will also notice just how dramatically the company s Q1 and fiscal 2019 and 2020 earnings estimates have fallen over the last 90 days 
 
Bottom Line
Bed Bath   Beyond is currently a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   based  in large part  on its negative earnings estimate revision picture  The company could clearly make a turnaround at some point and it is worth paying attention to any signs of life the change in leadership might bring down the road 
But for now  investors still interested in the general retail space might instead consider stocks such as  1  Strong Buy  ranked Hibbett Sports  HIBB  or  2  Buy  ranked Lululemon  LULU

Even though investors entered the holidays expecting a surge of spending  figures released Thursday by the Commerce Department show that wasn t the case  U S  retail sales fell 1 2 percent in December from the previous month  not the slight increase economists had been expecting  That marks the biggest drop since 2009 
The economic data backs up what some big consumer companies have already indicated  Sales weakened in December after a strong start to the holiday period during an earlier than normal Black Friday weekend  Even low gas prices and a more confident consumer couldn t make up for an extended holiday season with promotions and free shipping deals that started months before Christmas 
The disappointing holiday period spending doesn t bode well for the next round of apparel and department store results  scheduled for release in coming weeks  Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc   the world s biggest retailer  reports its fourth quarter results next week  Macy s Inc    Best Buy  Co  NYSE BBY   and  Nordstrom Inc   NYSE JWN   will also report before the end of the month  Macy s Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette already warned in January that sales  weakened in the mid December period and did not return to expected patterns until the week of Christmas  
Not only was the report on December spending disappointing  but it also came much later than normal  Wall Street usually gets numbers on year end spending by mid January  but the partial federal government shutdown meant those results were postponed by nearly a month ",2019-02-14,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/delayed-data-confirms-it-us-christmas-spending-disappointed-1779811,1779811

telecom network equipment business  aiming to capitalize on the security fears hobbling China s Huawei  according to company officials and other industry executives  Those efforts include moving high performing managers and numerous employees to the network division from its handset unit  two Samsung sources said  Potential customers are taking notice of Samsung s efforts to reinvent itself as a top tier supplier for 5G wireless networks and bridge a big gap with market leader Huawei and industry heavyweights Ericsson  BS ERICAs  and Nokia  HE NOKIA   French carrier Orange s chief technology officer  Mari No lle J go Laveissi re  visited Japan last year and was impressed with the pace of 5G preparations using alternative equipment makers including Samsung  a company representative told Reuters  Orange  which operates in 27 markets and counts Huawei as its top equipment supplier  will run its first French 5G tests with Samsung this year   Samsung is doing a big push in Europe at the moment   one industry source said  declining to be identified  Underscoring the growing importance of the business  South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak yeon visited Samsung s network division in January  In a closed door meeting during that visit  Samsung heir Jay Y  Lee asked for government help with recruiting high level engineers  Huawei is battling allegations by the United States and

supplier for the upstart carrier   We don t think 5G is far away in India   a Samsung official with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters  He declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter  Samsung s clients include U S  firms AT T Inc  NYSE T    Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ  and Sprint Corp and it has 5G network contracts with all three  though it was not clear how

Germany and other countries   could push back deployment of 5G by as much as three years  Others warn Samsung may struggle to develop a global sales and support organization    The way telcos purchase

141977,363492,JWN,J C  Penney pulls plug on clothing subscription service,news,"By Melissa Fares
NEW YORK  Reuters    J C  Penney Co Inc on Friday will end a clothing subscription service venture  the retailer said this week  a move toward sharpening its focus on more profitable apparel sales and exiting lines like major appliances 
In December 2017  the department store chain announced a new service through a partnership with Bombfell com that offered Penney private label and national men s clothing brands to people who signed up for regular apparel shipments 
Bombfell sends customers five clothing items handpicked by a stylist for them to try on in the comfort of their own home  Penney shoppers then have seven days to decide which items they wanted to buy and which they will send back 
Customers who signed up for the men s subscription service paid a  20  styling fee  with each order that included a  dedicated personal stylist  free shipping and returns  and which was applied toward the cost of any clothing they kept  Penney  with  2 65 billion in total net sales last quarter  relied on Bombfell to handle logistics of the arrangement 
Some of Bombfell s current partners include Lucky Brand  Tommy Bahama  Barbour and Johnnie O 
The end of the partnership was mentioned on the style blog chubstr com  Representatives for Penney and Bombfell confirmed that the arrangement would end but declined to elaborate 
Bombfell  based in New York and founded in 2011  is similar to Stitch Fix Inc  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  s Trunk Club  and Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  Inc s Prime Wardrobe service  which launched in the U S  in June and more recently in the UK and Japan 
Through the partnership  Plano  Texas based Penney became one of many consumer companies to pitch online subscription services  The strategy has not always worked 
When successful  subscriptions and timed shipments can provide retailers with guaranteed revenue and valuable customer data  But analysts said the downside includes high marketing costs and high cancellation rates as consumers get frustrated with the return process 
Penney  struggling to maintain sales as more shoppers move online  recently cut jobs  shut some stores around the country and renovated others as part of a multi year turnaround plan that sped up under newly installed Chief Executive Officer Jill Soltau 
This month  Penney announced it would stop selling major appliances including fridges and washing machines  and revamp the layout of its stores in a bid to focus on apparel to boost profits  Penney has generated a quarterly profit just three times since 2012 and analysts expect it to report another net loss in the fourth quarter 
The 116 year old company is struggling with the same problems that sent longtime rival Sears into bankruptcy  Penney s interest coverage ratio  measuring ability to pay interest on its nearly  4 5 billion debt load out of operating income  has been negative in all but one of the past seven years and remained so through the first three quarters of last year 
Both its stock and its bond prices have swooned  JCPenney s share price has collapsed 70 percent in 12 months and briefly sank below  1 a share late last year  It closed at  1 25 on Tuesday 
Its bonds were downgraded twice in the past 12 months by each of the three main credit rating agencies and now stand six notches into junk bond territory  Its longest dated obligation  a  500 million  century bond  issued in 1997 and maturing in 2097  is quoted at 35 cents on the dollar and has lost half its face value in the past year 
The service  Penney s only subscription offering  marketed big and tall clothing  according to a notice  Team Bombfell  sent to customers of the big and tall clothing service earlier this month   It was great to see firsthand how much the Big   Tall Box provided easy style solutions to so many of our loyal customers   said the notice  which Reuters reviewed  Current subscribers can work with their stylists to place orders through Feb  28 
Trent Kruse  J C  Penney s head of investor relations  highlighted the success of Penney s overall sales to big and tall men on an earnings call last November   Men s apparel outpaced the company comp with particular strength in big and tall  active and seasonal categories   Kruse said 
Burt Flickinger  managing director of Strategic Resource Group  dubbed the big and tall clothing business one of the  fastest growing  in retail and valued the category at roughly  25 billion  But  he added   neither Penney nor Bombfell really has the size or the scale now to take the partnership forward   Both companies declined to comment on Flickinger s analysis 
He said both retailers are better off continuing independently  as Bombfell works to develop its technology and Penney focuses on turning around its apparel business among its consumers  who tend to favor in store shopping as opposed to making online purchases ",2019-02-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/jc-penney-pulls-plug-on-clothing-subscription-service-1792591,1792591

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Medtronic  NYSE MDT   TJX Companies  NYSE TJX  and Deere  DE  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Medtronic s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Products industry in the past year  gaining  6 2  vs   1 2   Medtronic exited fiscal 2019 on a promising note with better than expected fourth quarter numbers  Barring the Diabetes group  all major business groups contributed to solid top line growth at CER 
The Zacks analyst thinks that within RTG  the launch of the Mazor X Stealth navigated robotic system is off to a strong start  Diabetes group  although registered a dull quarter this time  the company expects this business to reaccelerate in the first quarter and be accretive to total company growth in fiscal 2020  Within CVG  despite ongoing challenges  multiple product lines showed exceptional strength in the quarter  
The 2020 guidance also looks promising  On the flip side  the declining CRHF revenue raises concern for Medtronic  Escalating costs persistently put pressure on gross margins 
 You can   
Shares of Buy ranked TJX Companies  have underperformed the Zacks Discount Stores industry over the past three months  gaining  5 6  vs  a  7 1  increase  However  the Zacks analyst thinks the company is likely to put up an above average performance in the near term  
The company is set to benefit from robust comps  which have been gaining from continued rise in consumer traffic and strong merchandising policies  These factors along with TJX Companies  off price model  strategic store locations and impressive brands have been driving its store and online performance  This was visible in the company s first quarter fiscal 2020 results  wherein customer traffic rose for the 19th straight time  
Management is encouraged about witnessing continued growth  evident from its raised earnings view  Also  the company s shareholder friendly moves reflect its solid financial status  However  the company has been witnessing high wage costs  which along with elevated freight costs are likely to hit EPS growth in fiscal 2020  Also  volatile currency movements pose threats 
 You can   
Deere s shares have lost  8 5  year to date  underperforming the Zacks Farm Equipment industry  which has declined  6 5  over the same period  Deere reported year over year improvement in both adjusted earnings per share and revenues in second quarter 2019  While the top line beat expectations  the bottom line missed  
For fiscal 2019  Deere anticipates net sales to increase about 5  year over year and net income at  3 3 billion  The Zacks analyst thinks concerns over the U S China trade war  lower commodity prices and delayed planting season in North America led farmers to become cautious about their equipment purchases  
However  the recently announced  16 billion aid program for American farmers impacted by the trade war is likely to boost agricultural equipment sales  Improving construction markets  the Wirtgen acquisition and introduction of advanced technologies in its products will also aid growth  However  raw material cost inflation  elevated expenses and unfavorable foreign currency impact will hurt results

The comparisons charts above provide a mixed picture  with EPS beats tracking above or about in line with historical periods while revenue beats are tracking below what we had seen from the same group of retailers in the past  Given how low expectations had been ahead of the start of this earnings season  this is a fairly weak showing from the traditional operators

The chart below of quarterly year over year earnings and revenue growth for the S P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following three quarters and actual results for the preceding 5 quarters 
 
 
Driving the negative growth in the first half of the year is tough comparisons due to huge boost to profitability in the year earlier period  The chart below puts earnings growth expectations for full year 2019 in the context of where growth has been in recent years and what is expected in the next two years 
 

 
The market appears to have priced the deceleration in growth this year in the hope that growth resumes from next year onwards  It is in the context of these lowered expectations that market participants find the actual Q1 results reassuring  The key issue will be if expectations for the second half of the year and beyond will hold or come down as we move through the remainder of the year

142052,363567,JWN,Nordstrom Put Options Popular On Earnings Eve,opinion,"A slew of retailers are slated to report earnings this week  with department store Nordstrom  Inc   NYSE JWN  on deck to report after the close tomorrow  Ahead of the event  Barron s called JWN stock a  bargain   but it looks like recent options buyers are expecting more downside for the beat up shares 
Nordstrom stock was last seen 0 5  higher at  37 27  The security touched a nearly three year low of  36 37 last Friday  May 17  and has already lost more than 9  so far in May    pacing for its worst month since December s 11 8  slide  and a steeper loss than the equity typically averages in May  Further  JWN shares barreled right through the  38  40 region  which contained pullbacks in 2017  The  36 region could emerge as a potential foothold  though  as this is home to JWN s 2016 lows  Meanwhile  the  34 area is roughly half of Nordstrom stock s November 2018 high 

It s no surprise  then  to find that JWN s 14 day Relative Strength Index  RSI  stood at an oversold 27 coming into today  Nevertheless  options buyers have been betting on more downside for the shares  On the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX   traders have bought to open more than four Nordstrom puts for every call in the past two weeks  The 10 day put call volume ratio of 4 04 is in the 90th percentile of its annual range  pointing to a much healthier than usual appetite for bearish options bets ahead of earnings 
Echoing that  JWN has already seen roughly 14 000 puts change hands today    six times its average intraday volume  and about four times the number of calls traded so far  It looks like some traders are buying to open the June 40 put  expecting the retail stock to extend its journey south of  40 through the next few weeks 
On the flip side  it looks like one investor may have sold to open a block of July 30 puts    the most active option so far today  By doing so  the speculator expects JWN shares to remain north of  30 through the close on Friday  July 19  when the options expire  In this best case scenario  the options will expire worthless  allowing the seller to retain the entire net credit received at the initiation 
Outside of the options pits  short sellers have been upping the bearish ante  Short interest grew nearly 7  in the past two reporting periods and now accounts for nearly 21  of Nordstrom s total available float  At the stock s average pace of trading  it would take nearly eight sessions to repurchase these pessimistic positions 
In the same bearish vein  only two of 15 analysts consider JWN stock a  buy  or better  However  the average 12 month price target of  46 94 represents a premium of more than 25  to the security s current perch  Should the retailer disappoint in the earnings spotlight tomorrow night  a round of price target cuts could exacerbate selling pressure on the shares ",2019-05-21,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nordstrom-put-options-popular-on-earnings-eve-200423303,200423303

The challenge for Macy s and other department stores is to hold onto their revenues and margins as they bring their operations in line with the changed ground realities  But transitions are never smooth  easy or cheap  It is the inherent difficulties of this transition that explains the performance challenge facing Macy s and other department store companies 
Q1 estimates for Macy s  which reports quarterly results before the market s open on Wednesday May 15th  have steadily come down  The company is expected to earn 36 cents on  5 5 billion in revenues  down  25  and  0 21  from the year earlier period  respectively  The current 36 cents estimate is down from 37 cents a month back and 49 cents three months back 
Given Macy s recent underperformance and these lowered estimates  the bar is likely fairly low for the company to surprise to the upside  The stock was up in response to the last quarterly release on February 26th  which followed two back to back releases that pushed the stock lower 
The other major retailer releasing results this week is Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   WMT   which reports Thursday May 16th before the market s open  Wal Mart s travails are not as severe as Macy s  but it is going through its own transition that requires active investments and that is weighing on its margins  The stock has lagged the market this year  up  9  vs   14  for the S P 500 index 
Chinese online retailer Alibaba  NYSE BABA   BABA  is the major earnings release this year  as are Cisco  CSCO   Nvidia  NVDA  and Deere   Company  NYSE DE   DE   In total  we have almost 250 companies releasing results this week  including 9 S P 500 members 
Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of Friday  May 10th 
We now have Q1 results from 450 S P 500 members or 90  of the index s total membership  Total earnings for these 450 companies are up  0 6  from the same period last year on  5  higher revenues  with 77 1  beating EPS estimates and 59 3  beating revenue estimates 
The proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 51 3  
Here are the three trends that are clearly visible this earnings season
First  the growth challenge is very real  This is no surprise and has been well known for a while now  giving rise to the so called  earnings recession  narrative  Regular readers know our views about the so called  earnings recession  narrative this year  For reference  check out 
The comparison chart below puts the earnings and revenue growth pace for these 450 index members in historical context 
 
 
This tough comparison on the growth front is due to the tax cut boost to corporate profitability in 2018  The growth picture is expected to start improving in the second half of the year and accelerating into next year  with full year 2020 earnings growth for the index reaching double digits after a  2  growth in 2019 
The moderation in this year s growth also reflects the deceleration in global economic growth  The global GDP growth picture appears to have stabilized and even started improving in China and some other parts  but the pace is nevertheless expected to be below what we experienced in the last two years 
The bearish narrative is that we have reached the end of the economic cycle when growth inevitably turns south  Macroeconomic data doesn t support this narrative currently  but these things are hard to decipher in real time anyway 
My reading of the economic tea leaves is a lot more favorable  While I acknowledge the weakness in Europe  the outlook for the U S  economy continues to be positive  with growth modestly below the preceding year s level  but still very stable  The stronger than expected Q1 GDP growth rate reconfirms this view  even though the elevated GDP growth reading benefited from a couple of  lower quality  drivers  And other key regions of the world  particularly China  are showing signs of  green shoots  
We will know either way as we move through the rest of this year  but my money is on continued growth 
Second  driving the earnings growth challenge is widespread margin pressures across all major sectors  While the pace of revenue growth has come down as well  but the top line deceleration is a lot less pronounced than is the case with earnings 
Net margins for the 450 index members that have reported results are 12 1   which compares to 12 6  for the same group of index members in the year earlier period  as you can see in the comparison chart below 
 
 
A big reason for this margin issue is the tough comparisons to last year when margins got a big boost from the tax cut legislation  But some cyclical factors are at play as well  with many companies on the earnings calls complaining about rising material  transportation and payroll costs 
Third  and most importantly  estimates for the current period  2019 Q2  have been coming down as companies have been reporting Q1 results and sharing their outlook for business trends 
Total Q2 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be down  1 4  from the same period last year on  4 5  higher revenues  with the growth pace steadily coming down in recent days 
That said  the pace and magnitude of negative revisions to Q2 estimates is lower than what we had been seeing at the comparable period in the preceding quarters 
The chart below shows the evolution of Q2 earnings growth expectations in recent weeks 
 
 
Expectations for 2019 Q1 as a Whole 
Looking at Q1 as a whole  combining the actual results that have come out from the 450 S P 500 members with estimates for the still to come companies  total earnings are expected to be down  0 1  from the same period last year on  5 1  higher revenues 
Driving the expected Q1 earnings decline is broad based margin pressures across all major sectors  with net margins for the index down 11 4  from 12  in the year earlier quarter  Net margins are expected to be below the year earlier period for 9 of the 16 sectors  including the Technology sector  more on Tech margins below  
The table below shows the summary picture for 2019 Q1  contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding period 
 
 
As you can see above  net margins for the index are expected to be 60 basis points below the year earlier level  with margins notably weak in the all important Technology sector  with 2019 Q1 net margins for 19  below the year earlier period s 21 2  level 
The chart below shows the sector s Q1 net margins picture in the context of where margins have come from and where they are expected to go 
 
 
The chart below shows earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2019 Q1  the blended growth picture  contrasted with what we had in the preceding four quarter and what is expected in the following three quarters 
 
 
Expectations for 2019 Q2 and the following quarters will evolve further as the remaining companies report Q1 results and provide commentary about ground level business conditions  We will be keeping a close eye on this revisions trend

142084,363599,JWN,Sell Macy s  M  Stock With Q1 2019 Earnings Expected To Tumble ,opinion,"Shares of Macy s   NYSE M   have tumbled nearly 30  in 2019  while the broader market and retail industry rebounded  Times have been tough for the historic department store giant in recent years as the overall retail world dives deeper into e commerce  Now investors need to decide what to do with Macy s stock heading into the release of its first quarter fiscal 2019 financial results on Wednesday 
Quick Overview
Macy s was once part of a gold standard of retail  Today  the company s name recognition might still be high  but consumers have seemed to move on in an Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   focused retail age where speed and ease have become paramount  Macy s has  of course  expanded its digital offerings in order to better compete going forward  These initiatives include expanded  Buy Online Pickup in Store  and  Buy Online Ship to Store  offerings  along with a beefed up vendor direct program  which helped it nearly double its online SKUs in 2018 
Looking ahead to 2019 and beyond  Macy s executives have said they hope to improve supply chain efficiencies  bolster its mobile app as the company tries to focus on a  mobile first  strategy  and roll out more in store upgrades around the country  Macy s  which also owns Bloomingdale s and Bluemercury  is not alone its plans to improve its digital business  Kohl s   NYSE KSS    JC Penney   NYSE JCP    and Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   have all tried to introduce more modern retail offerings to help attract a wider consumer base  But these strategies cost a lot of money  and giants such as Nike   NYSE NKE   and others have committed to a more direct to consumer heavy future 
Last quarter  Macy s adjusted earnings fell 4 2  on the back of a 2 5  drop in sales  during the key holiday shopping period  M stock has fallen by over 13  since then  to help shares of the Cincinnati  Ohio based company come down nearly 30  over the past 12 months  Investors will also notice just how hard the last five years have been for Macy s 
 
 
Q1 2019 Outlook   Earnings Trends
Macy s first quarter fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to slip 0 21  from the prior year quarter to hit  5 53 billion  Looking further ahead  the company s full year revenue is expected to come in roughly flat  with 2020 s sales projected to dip slightly below our 2019 estimate 
At the bottom end of the income statement  Macy s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to plummet 25  to  0 36 share  Meanwhile  the department store s full year fiscal 2019 EPS figure is expected to fall nearly 26   Peeking even further ahead  M s adjusted fiscal 2020 earning are projected to fall 5  below our current year estimate 
Along with its overall negative earnings estimates  Macy s has seen its estimate revision activity trend more heavily in the wrong direction recently  With that said  the company s management has helped Macy s successfully top quarterly estimates in the trailing four periods  to extend a strong history of quarterly earnings beats 
 
 
Bottom Line
Macy s is currently a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  based  in large part  on its recent earnings estimate revision activity  M stock hovered down around 3 83  at  21 60 per share through mid afternoon trading Monday as the market dipped on U S  China trade war related fears  This represented a roughly 48  downturn compared its 52 week intraday high of  41 99 per share  which could help Macy s stock following earnings if the firm gives Wall Street any positive signs 
Macy s is also a dividend payer  with an impressive 6 72  yield  But the price movement chart above helps show investors that M stock has been on a roller coaster ride  Plus  the retail industry is full of companies that seem more ready to compete in the modern retail age  including Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU   and others 
With all that said  Macy s is scheduled to report its Q1 2019 earnings results before the market opens on Wednesday  May 15  Make sure to head back to Zacks for a complete breakdown of the firm s actual quarterly metrics  Fellow retail bellwether Walmart   NYSE WMT   also reports its quarterly results this week  also read

142085,363600,JWN,Analysts Estimate Nordstrom  JWN  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 21  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This department store operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 44 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 7  
Revenues are expected to be  3 54 billion  down 0 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 13  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nordstrom 
For Nordstrom  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 07  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nordstrom will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Nordstrom would post earnings of  1 42 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 48  delivering a surprise of  4 23  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Nordstrom doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-05-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-nordstrom-jwn-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200421209,200421209
142086,363601,JWN,Why Nordstrom  JWN  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   This company  which is in the Zacks Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This department store operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4 46  
For the last reported quarter  Nordstrom came out with earnings of  1 48 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 42 per share  representing a surprise of 4 23   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 64 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 67 per share  delivering a surprise of 4 69  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Nordstrom  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Nordstrom currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 14   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on May 21  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-05-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-nordstrom-jwn-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200421717,200421717
142087,363602,JWN,Dollar Mixed As Trade Worries Ease  Oil And Bitcoin Volatility Continue,opinion,"Tuesday s risk on rally saw US stocks recover roughly half of yesterday s losses after President Trump attempted to calm markets and signaled it would be clear in  three or four weeks  if talks were successful  The US dollar s best gains were to the British pound and safe haven currencies  the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc  Cable keeps losing ground as PM may seem to be running out of ideas to get her deal pushed through Parliament 
Treasury yields also advance with the 10 year rising 1 1 basis points to 2 412   Today s price action shows markets are still pricing in a trade deal to get done by next month s G 20 summit in Japan 
Stocks   Trump calms markets
EUR   German GDP on tap  temporary factors eyed for a strong print
Oil   Geopolitical risks control the narrative
Gold   Trade optimism sinks safe havens
Bitcoin   Interest reinvigorated on Wall Street
Stocks
Asian markets are likely to see a positive open after global equities benefited from a positive tone on trade talks from President Trump  We are far away from a final deal being  markets are not even sure when both sides will meet again  but no escalation in tensions was good enough of a reason for investors to return to buying stocks  The Nasdaq outperformed rising 1 1  to 7 734  while the S P 500 rose 0 8  to 2 834 

EUR
German GDP is expected to rebound Wednesday morning  Last month  the German Economy Ministry cut German GDP growth in half to 0 5   If the first quarter reading comes in at the expected 0 4   that would be close to the high end of year forecast  While we could see a strong rebound  the US China trade war will likely overshadow any robust reading  Some analysts are saying the results will be skewed due to front loading purchases ahead of Brexit  tax cuts  good weather  and a pickup in car manufacturing 
The euro may see limited upside on a strong beat  as trade war concerns linger and the German ZEW survey showed a deterioration of 7 points in the May survey 

Oil
Oil prices initially rose over 1  as Middle East tensions remained on high alert after Saudi Aramco s pumping stations were attacked by two Iranian backed drones  Markets appear not ready to focus on this week s news that IEA sees US crude oil production increasing by 1 49 million barrels per day  bpd  which would be an average of 12 45 million bpd in 2019  If accurate production would outpace global oil demand growth forecast of 1 4 million barrels 
The security of global oil supplies remains the dominant theme for crude and if we see continued threats from Iran and disruptions with production in Venezuela or Libya  oil prices could quickly march back towards the 2019 highs 
Venezuelan oil production  which is still near a 16 year low  is expected to stabilize around 750 000 barrels a day  Electricity issues appear to be over  but that does not mean it is business as usual for Venezuela  Most of the Venezuelan crude that is on tankers is synthetic and Asian buyers have limited ability to process it and with US sanctions in place  that crude will have trouble finding a home  The Venezuela situation is likely to lead to an increased reduction of spare capacity from other OPEC members 
The banter between Iran and the US is intensifying along with attacks on vessels in the Persian Gulf  Tehran s economy was weak to begin with and the US sanctions are having a crippling effect  Iran is now renouncing parts of the 2015 nuclear deal in hopes to pressure Europe into giving some sanction relief  While both the American and Iranians say we are not on a path to war  the risks are rising 
The weekly API report at the end of the US session took away half of the gains after reporting a strong build of 8 63 million barrels last week  Current expectations for the EIA US crude inventories to only rise by 29 000 barrels  with a low estimate of  4 3 million barrels and a high estimate of 4 7 million barrels 

Gold
Gold prices naturally pulled back after a positive risk on trading session saw the appetite for safe haven assets flee  While stocks saw a robust rebound  the overall optimism that we will likely see continued progressive steps in trade talks is unlikely  The unpredictability of Trump s escalating comments and China s response is likely to keep safe haven appeal until a conclusive deal is outlined 

Bitcoin
Bitcoin mania appears to be back  Bitcoin is up over 100  from the February low on further progress entering mainstream commerce and interest in offerings from Fidelity  Etrade and Robinhood 
This is not the first attempt to gain retail acceptance  but this time it appears to be attracting big name stores  such as Amazon owned Whole Foods  Crate and Barrel and Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   While using Flexa  consumers can buy goods using their phones with digital scanners that are already in most retailers  The adoption of using Bitcoin for retail consumers will continue to grow if the processing times are fast and costs are cheaper than traditional credit cards  In order to complete mainstream success  crypto volatility will need to ease

142115,363630,JWN,Is Nordstrom  JWN  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks  Nevertheless  we know that our readers all have their own perspectives  so we are always looking at the latest trends in value  growth  and momentum to find strong picks 
Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
In addition to the Zacks Rank  investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system  Of course  value investors will be most interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with  A  grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment 
One company value investors might notice is Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   JWN is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A  The stock is trading with a P E ratio of 11 52  which compares to its industry s average of 14 30  Over the past year  JWN s Forward P E has been as high as 18 30 and as low as 11 32  with a median of 14 27 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  JWN has a P S ratio of 0 43  This compares to its industry s average P S of 0 56 
Finally  we should also recognize that JWN has a P CF ratio of 6 33  This data point considers a firm s operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook  This company s current P CF looks solid when compared to its industry s average P CF of 7 87  JWN s P CF has been as high as 10 75 and as low as 6 19  with a median of 8 03  all within the past year 
These are only a few of the key metrics included in Nordstrom s strong Value grade  but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now  When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook  JWN looks like an impressive value stock at the moment ",2019-04-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-nordstrom-jwn-stock-undervalued-right-now-200406754,200406754
142116,363631,JWN,JWN Or SFIX  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Retail   Apparel and Shoes sector might want to consider either Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  or Stitch Fix  SFIX   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Nordstrom and Stitch Fix are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
JWN currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 68  while SFIX has a forward P E of 126 69  We also note that JWN has a PEG ratio of 1 78  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  SFIX currently has a PEG ratio of 5 63 
Another notable valuation metric for JWN is its P B ratio of 7 72  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  SFIX has a P B of 7 83 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to JWN s Value grade of A and SFIX s Value grade of D

Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price 
So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on the back of strong fundamentals 
Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal   
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through  You can see  
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 28 
Here are five out of the 28 stocks 
Nordstrom Inc     NYSE JWN     This is a leading fashion specialty retailer offering compelling clothing  shoes and accessories for men  women and children  The stock has a Zacks Rank  2  It comes from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 39

142154,363669,JWN,Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  To Post Q4 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,Bed Bath   Beyond Inc    NASDAQ BBBY   is slated to release fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 10 The company has delivered a positive earnings surprise in four of the last five quarters  However  it reported average earnings miss of 3 1  in the trailing four quarters  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings is pegged at  1 11  which remained stable over the past 30 days  This reflects a decline of about 25  from the prior year quarter  For quarterly sales  the consensus mark stands at  3 333 million  mirroring nearly 10  decline year over year Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayWe note that Bed Bath   Beyond is battling margin pressures for 10 straight quarters now  Higher coupon expenses and lower merchandise margin have been denting the gross margin  This coupled with higher SG A expenses have been hurting the operating margin  Going ahead  margins will continue to remain weak  For fiscal 2018  management had earlier projected gross margin deleverage mainly on the investments in the customer value proposition and digital channels  Moreover  SG A expenses are estimated to increase due to higher investments towards transformational efforts  However  the company expects to witness lower operating margin contraction than that in fiscal 2017 Apart from margin woes  the company has been witnessing soft comparable store sales  comps  for a while due to decline in sales from stores  For fiscal 2018  management projects comps decline of about 1   Strained margins and soft comps trend remain a threat to the company s top and bottom lines in the fiscal fourth quarter In a recent move  the activist investors including Legion Partners Asset Management LLC  Macellum Advisors GP LLC and Ancora Advisors LLC are working to oust all 12 members of Bed Bath   Beyond s board  per sources  Media reports also revealed that the group is likely to submit 16 nominees to take over the company s board at the Annual Meeting  The investor group wants to replace the company s chief executive officer as well  The activist investor group owns a combined stake of 5  in the company  The reason behind this was the failure of the current management team to keep up with the evolving retail scenario Nevertheless  Bed Bath   Beyond responded to the activist investors by issuing a statement  The company notified that it is working in the best interest of its shareholders  Moreover  the company stated that the board consistently assesses its composition  reflecting the right talent and expertise  These apart  the company is going through a comprehensive transformation to develop its foundational structure and boost shareholder value In fact  on its third quarter fiscal 2018 s conference call  Bed Bath   Beyond had stated that it is ahead of plan in relation to achieving its long term financial targets  The company s long term financial goals include moderating declines in operating profit and net earnings per share in fiscal 2018 and 2019  Earnings are envisioned to be about  2 00 per share for fiscal 2018 Additionally  Bed Bath   Beyond s store rationalization efforts bode well  In fiscal 2018  it targets opening 20 stores  mainly comprising Buybuy BABY and Cost Plus World Markets stores  Simultaneously  it expects to close nearly 40 underperforming stores  including mostly flagship ones  to boost profitability  Meanwhile  robust sales at its customer facing digital networks are driving the company s top line  which is likely to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter Zacks ModelOur proven model conclusively shows that Bed Bath   Beyond is likely to beat earnings estimates in the fiscal fourth quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Bed Bath   Beyond has an Earnings ESP of  2 17  and a Zacks Rank  3  which make us confident of an

142181,363696,JWN,Economic Calendar   Top 5 Things To Watch This Week,news,"Investing com   Investors will stay focused on Turkey s deepening currency crisis and the fallout across global markets in week ahead to see if any more news materializes after Washington s latest sanctions on Ankara battered the lira and triggered a move out of riskier assets 
In addition  market focus will stay attuned to the next potential steps in the tit for tat trade dispute between the U S  and China 
U S  Sino trade war fears have been simmering for months  keeping market gains in check with investors jittery over the prospects of further escalation in tensions between the world s two largest economies having an impact on economic growth 
On the data front  U S  retail sales figures for July come out on Wednesday  which should give clearer signs on the strength of the American consumer at the start of the second half of the year 
There are also about 10 S P 500 companies reporting earnings in the week ahead on Wall Street  as the earnings season starts to wind down  with big name retailers such as  Home Depot    Macy s and Walmart among the highlights 
Elsewhere  China also has key data  including industrial production on Tuesday  which will be watched for any signs of damage from the ongoing trade spat with the U S 
Meantime  in Europe  traders will be able to get their teeth into the latest snapshots of U K  inflation  employment  and retail sales for further indications on the continued effect that the Brexit decision is having on the economy 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets 
1  Turkey Turmoil Spillover 
The lira briefly plunged more than 20  to a record low on Friday  while global markets reeled  as investors were spooked that the collapse in the Turkish currency would spread across emerging markets and hit the European banking system 
The lira ended down around 15  against the dollar  its worst day since Turkey s financial crisis of 2001  on the back of a deepening rift with the United States 
U S  President Donald Trump said he would double tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum  after imposing U S  sanctions earlier in the week because of Turkey s detention of Andrew Brunson  an American pastor detained in 2016  Turkish authorities accuse Brunson of supporting a failed coup attempt earlier that year 
Turkey s President Recip Tayyip Erdogan failed to offer any economic solace when he spoke Friday  declaring that  they have their dollar  we have our god  
Erdogan also asked citizens to  change the euros  the dollars and the gold that you are keeping beneath your pillows into lira   noting this is  a domestic and national struggle  
Adding to emerging market currency woes was the Russian rouble  which sank to its lowest since April 2016 against the dollar  on threats of new U S  sanctions over the Kremlin s alleged involvement in the poising of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal with the chemical agent Novichok earlier this year in the rural English town of Salisbury 
The geopolitical worries come as the U S  is embroiled in a trade war with China  Both governments announced the possibility of imposing tit for tat tariffs on an additional  16 billion worth of goods last week 
2  U S  Retail Sales
The Commerce Department will publish data on retail sales for July at 8 30AM ET Wednesday 
The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0 2  last month  moderating from a gain of 0 5  in June 
Excluding the automobile sector  sales are expected to increase 0 4   the same as its increase a month earlier 
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth  while weaker sales signal a declining economy  Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70  of U S  economic growth 
Besides the retail sales report  this week s calendar also features U S  data on building permits  housing starts  industrial production  as well as surveys on manufacturing conditions in the Philadelphia and New York regions 
Economists reckon the data will do little to alter expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates two more times this year  with the next move higher coming at its September meeting 
3  Retailers Headline Last Big Week Of Earnings
While just 10 S P 500 companies are due to report financial results this week  retailers are just getting started in what will be the last big wave of the second quarter earnings season 
Home Depot  NYSE HD  unofficially kicks things off when it reports on Tuesday  results from Macy s  NYSE M  are on the agenda for Wednesday  while Walmart  NYSE WMT   the world s largest retailer  is due to report results on Thursday 
Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   JC Penney  NYSE JCP  and Children s Place  NASDAQ PLCE  are among the other major retailers reporting this week 
Other high profile names set to report this week also include NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   Deere  NYSE DE  and Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  



This earnings season has been stronger than analysts had expected  Nearly 90  of S P 500 companies have reported quarterly results thus far  Of those companies  76  have reported better than expected earnings 
4  China Industrial Output 
China is to release July industrial production figures on Wednesday morning 
The consensus among analysts is that the data will show China s factory output grew 6 3   accelerating from a 6 0  gain a month earlier 
At the same time  the Asian nation will publish reports on fixed asset investment and retail sales 
Recent data has started to show that the world s second largest economy may be losing steam  raising concerns about the potential fallout from a full blown U S  China trade war 
5  UK Inflation Figures
The UK Office for National Statistics will release data on consumer price inflation for July at 0830GMT  4 30AM ET  on Wednesday 
Analysts expect annual CPI to inch up to 2 5   a tad faster than the 2 4  increase seen in June  while core inflation is forecast to hold steady at 1 9  
In addition to the inflation report  traders will focus on monthly employment and retail sales data  due on Tuesday and Thursday  respectively  for further hints on the health of the economy 
Britain s economy picked up some speed in the second quarter after a sharp winter slowdown earlier in the year  official data at the end of last week showed 
However  traders slammed the pound to its lowest in over a year against the dollar as the probability of a no deal  or hard Brexit rises 
With less than eight months until Britain leaves the European Union  the government has yet to agree a divorce deal with Brussels and has begun talking more publicly about the prospect of leaving the bloc without any formal agreement on what happens next

142185,363700,JWN,Bull Of The Day  Foot Locker  Inc   FL ,opinion,"Shares of Foot Locker  NYSE FL   FL  have climbed 14  this year to outpace the S P 500 and its industry s 9  average climb  The sneaker focused sporting goods retailer is also coming off a better than expected quarter and looks poised to expand its bottom line as it invests in the future of its industry 
Overview 
Foot Locker saw its comparable store sales  which includes existing stores and its website  surge 9 7   This blew away Wall Street s 4 5  estimate  More specifically  physical same store sales popped 5 7   while online sales skyrocketed roughly 30   This strength was important for Foot Locker during the vital holiday shopping period and helped shake off concerns that sportswear giants such as Nike  NYSE NKE   NKE  and Adidas   ADDYY  direct to consumer push in the Amazon  AMZN  age would hurt FL 
Investors should note that some of the strength came on the back of consumers  willingness to spend more money on sneakers  In fact  average selling prices jumped by a double digit percent to help offset a low single digit decline in traffic  Yet  executives noted that Foot Locker s traffic outpaced overall mall traffic 
 
 
Growth Initiatives 
The New York based company announced in early February a  100 million minority investment in secondary sneaker market firm GOAT Group  Foot Locker s investment comes as the sneaker market continues to explode  For instance  luxury fashion e commerce company Farfetch  FTCH  purchased Stadium Goods for  250 million late last year in an effort to capture a portion of this quickly growing market 
Foot Locker s core customers are digital natives that range from 12  to 25 year olds  This means FL must adapt with the times and cater to its tech savvy  sneakerhead  consumers  The company currently boasts 9 7 million followers on quickly expanding Instagram  FB  where brands are built and people shop to top the likes of Under Armour s  UAA  7 million and blow away Dicks Sporting Goods  DKS  
Foot Locker has also invested millions in children s lifestyle brand Super Heroic  women s luxury activewear brand Carbon38  and footwear design academy Pensole  Plus  late last month  FL invested in subscription based clothing service Rockets of Awesome  which is akin to Stitch Fix   SFIX  for kids 
 
 
Outlook 
Clearly  Foot Locker is looking to the future in order to grow in a quickly changing retail landscape  As we mentioned at the top  shares of FL have climbed 14  so far this year and are now up 39  over the last 12 months  This crushes the Retail Apparel Shoe Market s 14  average decline and easily tops the S P 500 s 5  growth  Investors will also notice that FL stock has been able to return to growth  while its industry and the likes of Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   JWN  and Dick s have failed to regain traction 
Looking ahead  FL s first quarter fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to pop 3 42  to reach  2 09 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  This would top last quarter s 2 8  top line expansion  which topped analyst expectations  For the full year  the retailer s revenue is expected to jump over 4  to reach  8 26 billion  Once again this would easily beat 2018 s 2  revenue growth   
Earnings Trends 
At the bottom end of the income statement  Foot Locker s adjusted Q1 earnings are projected to jump 12 4  to reach  1 63 a share  The company is expected to see its bottom line expand by 9 3  in the second quarter  with 9 6  EPS expansion expected for the full year year  Peeking even further ahead  FL s adjusted fiscal 2020 earnings are projected to jump 8 5  above our current year estimate 
Investors should also note that the company s earnings estimate revision activity has trended almost completely in the right direction recently  highlighted by the positive movement for 2019 and 2020  This means that at least some analysts are more bullish on FL s longer term earnings outlook 
 
 
Bottom Line
Foot Locker is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  based somewhat on its recent earnings estimate revision activity  The company also sports an  A  grade for Value and a  B  for Momentum in our Style Scores system 
FL is currently trading at 11 4X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  This represents a discount compared to its industry s 15 1X average and the S P s 16 8X  Maybe more importantly  Foot Locker stock has traded as high as 17 3X over the last five years  with a five year median of 13 2X  Foot Locker is also a dividend payer that recently declared a quarterly cash dividend of  0 38 per share

142218,363733,JWN,Here s What To Expect From Macy s  M  Q4 Earnings As Stock Tumbles ,opinion,"Macy s   NYSE M   shares slipped 2 3  Thursday to help extend its 2019 downturn that runs counter to the broader market s resurgence  The question now is does Macy s fall signal that investors are worried about the company s fourth quarter earnings results 
Overview 
Retail investors might be nervous after the U S  Commerce Department said last week that overall U S  holiday sales experienced their largest drop since 2009  But Macy s already warned Wall Street of this after it released its holiday shopping results last month  In fact  M shares tanked nearly 18  on January 10  which marked their worst day ever  after the department store chain lowered its 2018 earnings outlook on the back of lower than expected holiday sales 
Macy s comparable sales in the November and December period climbed just combined 1 1    The holiday season began strong   particularly during Black Friday and the following Cyber Week   but weakened in the mid December period and did not return to expected patterns until the week of Christmas   chief executive Jeff Gennette said in a statement 
With that said  retail behemoth Walmart s recently reported Q4 results helped prove that its e commerce push has paid off in the Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   age  Still Macy s and other department stores  inducing Kohl s   NYSE KSS    JC Penney   NYSE JCP    and Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   have struggled as more brands  such as Nike   NYSE NKE    push for more direct to consumer sales  also read    
 
Q4 Outlook   Earnings Trends 
Looking ahead  Macy s Q4 revenues are projected to sink 2 4  from the year ago period to  8 46 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  This would represent a downturn from the third quarter s roughly 2 3  top line growth 
At the bottom end of the income statement  Macy s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to fall 6  from the prior year period to reach  2 65 a share  Investors should also note that the company s earnings estimate revision picture has turned negative recently  More specifically  the company s fourth quarter earnings estimate has fallen by  0 11 a share in the last 60 days 
 
 
Bottom Line 
Macy s is a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  at the moment based on its recent earnings estimate revision activity  The company also sports a  D  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system  M stock closed regular trading Thursday at  24 45 a share  This marked a 42  downturn from its 52 week high and does leave room for Macy s stock to run 
Macy s is scheduled to report its Q4 financial results before the market opens on Tuesday  February 26  So  make sure to head back to Zacks for a complete break down of the firm s actual quarterly metrics

142221,363736,JWN,3 Sportswear Retail Stocks To Buy Right Now ,opinion,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research where Associate Stock Strategist Ben Rains breaks down three of the best sportswear focused stocks to consider buying right now 
Today we began by taking a look at Foot Locker   NYSE FL    which is due to report its fourth quarter and full year financial results on Friday  March 1  The sneaker retailer is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that has seen its stock price soar over 90  since November 2017  Foot Locker  like Dick s Sporting Good   NYSE DKS    has faced challenges as brands like Adidas   OTC ADDYY   push more heavily toward their own direct to consumer businesses in the Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   age 
To help expand  Foot Locker announced in early February a  100 million minority investment in the GOAT Group  which owns GOAT and Flight Club brands  The deal will see the companies   combine efforts across digital and physical retail platforms to create exclusive customer experiences   according to a statement  
The move helps show just how quickly the broader secondary shoe market has grown in the larger athleisure age  GOAT functions somewhat like an eBay   NASDAQ EBAY   for expensive sneakers  Foot Locker s investment also follows Farfetch s   NYSE FTCH    250 million acquisition of sneaker seller Stadium Goods 
Another company to keep an eye on is Nike   NYSE NKE    The sportswear giant is coming off a strong fiscal Q2 that saw its revenues jump 10   Plus  the company s North American growth continued and its digital revenues surged 41   with mobile accounting for over 50  of its digital sales  This was driven by Nike s new apps and helps show how important its presence is across Instagram   NASDAQ FB   and Twitter   NYSE TWTR   have become 
Nike has been able to expand its position in the sports world  fashion  and athleisure along with Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU   and some of Gap s   NYSE GPS   brands  Nike  which seems to stand in contrast to Under Armour s   NYSE UAA   inability to return to growth in its home market  rests right near its 52 week and all time high of  86 04 a share 
The episode closed with Canada Goose   NYSE GOOS   after its stock price plummeted  despite posting better than projected quarterly financial results  The Toronto based company s direct to consumer revenue soared nearly 80  in the vital holiday quarter  yet its stock price now sits well below its 52 week high 
Looking ahead  Canada Goose  which sells parkas that cost as much as  1 500 and  395 sweaters  expects to expand its retail footprint beyond its 11 flagship stores and at department stores like Nordstrom   NYSE JWN

142222,363737,JWN,OLED Stock Can Halve If Rejected At Fibonacci Level,opinion,"Universal Display  NASDAQ OLED  stock is hot again  The share price is up by over 90  in less than two months  climbing from under  79 to above  151 since January 3rd  But is the bulls  optimism warranted 
Six months ago  on August 15th 2018  we examined OLED stock through the prism of the Elliott Wave principle  The chart below  which was included in that analysis  shows what we found 

The 4 hour chart of Universal Display Corp  revealed that the selloff from  209 to  78 75 has the structure of a textbook five wave impulse  According to the Elliott Wave theory  this meant two things  first  that a three wave recovery can be expected  and second  that another notable plunge should then follow 
There has been plenty of news about Universal Display in the past six months  The company missed estimates in its Q3 report  got downgraded by several investment analysts  beat the estimates in its Q4 report and was consequently upgraded by several investment analysts  The updated chart below visualizes OLED stock s progress during that time 

Six months later now  a complete A B C correction is already visible on the 4 hour chart of OLED stock  Despite all the positive and negative news around Universal Display  the stock has been following the Elliott Wave path quite closely 
OLED Stock   Roadblock Ahead
If this count is correct  the 5 3 wave cycle from  209 is almost complete  The sharp surge in the last two months fits in the position of wave C of  B   approaching the 61 8  Fibonacci resistance level near  160 a share  A bearish reversal for the start of wave  C  down can be anticipated in that area 
Given that wave  C  s natural targets lie beneath the bottom of wave  A   we think OLED stock can lose over 50  from current levels during the rest of 2019  The same kind of pattern inflicted a lot of pain on Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  shareholders recently ",2019-02-28,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oled-stock-can-halve-if-rejected-at-fibonacci-level-200393365,200393365

142242,363757,JWN,Economic Calendar   Top 5 Things To Watch This Week,news,"Investing com   Global financial markets will focus on this week s U S  retail sales data  which should give clearer signs on the strength of the American consumer 
Market players will also pay close attention to comments from a parade of Federal Reserve officials this week for insights into the outlook for monetary policy in the months ahead and the frequency of rate hikes through the end of the year 
Wall Street is divided over whether the Fed will raise interest rates two more times this year  as it has forecast  or three more times 
There are also about 10 S P 500 companies reporting earnings in the week ahead on Wall Street  as the earnings season starts to wind down  with big name retailers such as  Home Depot    Macy s and Walmart among the highlights 
Across the Atlantic  traders will focus on British employment data for further hints on the likelihood of the Bank of England raising interest rates this year  especially in the wake of last week s dovish meeting 
Meanwhile  in Asia  Japan is to publish preliminary data on first quarter economic growth as traders look for further signs on the strength of the economy and hints on when the Bank of Japan will start withdrawing stimulus 
The market will also have to navigate other things that worry it in the coming week  such as developments on NAFTA trade talks in Washington  which could wrap up ahead of Thursday s deadline 
Trade negotiations between the U S  and China will also keep investors on their toes 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets 
1  U S  Retail Sales
The Commerce Department will publish data on retail sales for April at 8 30AM ET  12 30GMT  Tuesday 
The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0 4  last month  moderating from a gain of 0 6  in March 
But excluding the automobile sector  sales are expected to increase 0 5   after a 0 2  rise a month earlier 
Economists reckon the data will help further shape the debate over how many times the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates through the end of this year after somewhat disappointing inflation figures out of the U S  last week 
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth  while weaker sales signal a declining economy  Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70  of U S  economic growth 
Besides the retail sales report  this week s calendar also features U S  data on building permits  housing starts  industrial production  as well as surveys on manufacturing conditions in the Philadelphia and New York regions 
2  Fed Speakers
Several Fed speakers will get market attention in the week ahead  as traders watch for clues on the pace of future rate hikes this year 
Topping the agenda will be remarks from incoming New York Fed President John Williams  who speaks on Tuesday at the Economic Club of Minnesota s May Luncheon  in Minneapolis 
Speeches from Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester  St  Louis Fed President James Bullard  Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic  Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  Dallas Fed Rob Kaplan  and Fed Governor Lael Brainard will also be on the agenda this week 
In addition  the nominee for Fed vice chairman  Richard Clarida  as well as Michelle Bowman  who was nominated to be a Fed governor  will both face Congress on Tuesday for their confirmation hearings 
The Fed kept interest rates unchanged earlier this month  while noting that inflation was starting to inch higher  leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June 
The U S  central bank currently forecasts two more rate hikes in 2018  although market expectations of a third move higher before the end of the year has been gaining momentum in recent weeks amid strengthening inflation prospects 
3  Retailers Headline Last Big Week Of Earnings
While just 10 S P 500 companies are due to report financial results this week  retailers are just getting started in what will be the last big wave of the first quarter earnings season 
Home Depot  NYSE HD  unofficially kicks things off when it reports on Tuesday  results from Macy s  NYSE M  are on the agenda for Wednesday  while Walmart  NYSE WMT   the world s largest retailer  is due to report results on Thursday 
Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   JCPenney  NYSE JCP  and Children s Place  NASDAQ PLCE  are among the other major retailers reporting this week 
In addition  blue chips such as Deere  NYSE DE  and Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  will also report 
U S  stocks rose on Friday  booking a week of solid gains  as a rally in energy and technology stocks provided a lift higher 
The Dow rose 2 3  last week  its biggest weekly gain since March  while the S P 500 and Nasdaq climbed 2 4  and 2 7  respectively 
4  UK Employment Report
The UK Office for National Statistics will publish the monthly jobs report at 0830GMT  4 30AM ET  on Tuesday  and it will be watched more for what it says about wages than hiring 
The claimant count change is expected to rise by 13 300 in March  with the jobless rate holding steady at 4 2  
More importantly  wage growth including bonuses is forecast to rise 2 7   a tad slower than the 2 8  gain seen in February 
Should the data miss estimates  the pound could face renewed selling pressure after sliding against its major peers last week in the wake of a dovish Bank of England policy meeting 
The BoE held interest rates steady last week and said weak growth during a snowy start to 2018 was likely to be only temporary  but it wanted to see a pick up in the economy in the next few months before raising borrowing costs 
Britain s economy grew more slowly than most of its peers in the first quarter of 2018 due to a mix of unusually snowy weather and headwinds from Britain s impending exit from the European Union 
5  Japan Preliminary Q1 GDP
Japan will publish preliminary first quarter economic growth data at 8 50AM Tokyo time on Wednesday  2350GMT Tuesday  
The report is expected to reveal that the world s third largest economy shrank for the first time in two years due to weak private consumption and softer export demand 
Gross domestic product probably contracted at an annualized rate of 0 2  in the first quarter after a 1 6  expansion in the final quarter of 2017 
If confirmed  that would mark the first contraction in Japan s economy since late 2015  following eight straight quarters of growth  which was the country s longest period of economic expansion since its 1980s bubble economy 
The annualized contraction would translate into a flat reading from the previous quarter 
Private consumption  which accounts for roughly 60  of gross domestic product  was seen recording no growth in the January to March period  after a 0 5  gain in the previous three month period 
In addition to the GDP report  Japan is also slated to produce data on core machinery orders  which is looked at as a good indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months 
The Bank of Japan kept policy steady last month  but ditched a timeframe it had set for hitting an inflation target  in a surprise move analysts say is aimed at keeping market expectations for more stimulus in check

142251,363766,JWN,Time To Buy Canada Goose  GOOS  Stock After Post Earnings Selloff ,opinion,"Shares of Canada Goose   NYSE GOOS   plummeted over 13  through mid afternoon trading Thursday  despite posting better than projected quarterly financial results  Therefore  the downturn might have been caused by broader retail worries 
Quarterly Overview 
Canada Goose saw its adjusted Q3 fiscal 2019 earnings surge nearly 60  from  0 46 per share in the year ago quarter to  0 73 a share  which crushed our  0 58 per share Zacks Consensus Estimate  At the top of the income statement  the high end parka company s revenues surged over 45  to reach  302 17 million  This also blew by our  260 million estimate 
More specifically  the Toronto based company s direct to consumer revenue soared nearly 80  in the vital holiday and winter weather quarter  Canada Goose opened five new retail stores and launched one new e commerce site during the quarter to help drive growth  Meanwhile  GOOS  wholesale revenues jumped roughly 22  
Investors should also note that the company operates a relatively high margin business  DTC s gross margin came in at 76 1   down slightly from the year ago period s 76 5   Company executives noted that higher labor costs accounted for much of the decline  which impacted the wholesale business more  
Price Movement
Despite the strong showing  Canada Goose saw its stock price plummet 13 5  through mid afternoon trading Thursday to rest at  51 23 per share  It is very possible that the big downturn can be attributed to the fact that the Commerce Department said Thursday that retail sales fell a seasonally adjusted 1 2  in December from a month earlier to  505 8 billion  This marked the largest   which could be a worrying sign for retail investors 
Investors will see that shares of GOOS are still up huge since the firm went public in March 2017  Plus  Canada Goose stock has crushed the S P 500 over this stretch  along with the likes of Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU   and Nike   NYSE NKE    With that said  shares of GOOS sit roughly 29  below between their 52 week high of  72 27 a share  This might set up a solid buying opportunity for those high on the company 
 
Outlook 
Looking ahead  Canada Goose executives expect annual revenue to grow in the mid to high 30s on a percentage basis in fiscal 2019  This is up from an  at least 30   projection  Meanwhile  the firm upped its earnings outlook from at least 40  to the mid to high 40s 
Canada Goose is more optimistic based on expected growth in China and its other regions as the company rolls out more physical retail locations  The company  which sells parkas that cost as much as  1 500 and  395 sweaters  currently boasts 11 flagship stores  with locations in New York  Beijing  Hong Kong  London  Tokyo  and many other major metropolitan hubs 
The company s jackets can also be found at higher end department stores such as Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   and on Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    among other sites and stores   We have successfully entered new markets  introduced new product  and increased capacity to meet growing demand in both channels   CEO Dani Reiss said in a statement   We remain deeply confident in the long runway we have ahead  
In the end  Canada Goose stock might be attractive at its current price point  with the company s top and bottom lines expected to surge in 2019

142252,363767,JWN,Retail Sales Sank During Busy Shopping Season ,opinion,"The monthly Retail Report  which was delayed due to the shutdown  is finally out  and the news isn t good  The U S  Census Bureau s report dropped early morning on Valentine s Day and evoked no warm  heart shaped feelings  Quite the opposite  the report revealed a 1 2  decline for the month of December  This is a downturn the likes of which has not been seen since September 2009  while we were still recovering from the financial crisis 
To make matters worse  analysts were predicting a neutral report  rather than a negative one  previously anticipating growth of 0  
There was no good reason for retail sales to sink during one of the busiest shopping seasons of the year  and the bears see it as an indication of a potential shift in market momentum  with good reason  Save for a minor increase in sales for auto dealerships and home centers  there was a drop in sales across the board  Gas Stations was hit the hardest  with sales plummeting 5 1  in reaction to the slump in gas prices The biggest shock  however  came from internet sales  which experienced a 3 9  drop  That s a figure the likes of which hasn t been seen since November 2008 when we were in the midst of the recent recession 
eBay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY  and Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  dodged the brunt of it and witnessed the gains you d expect to see during Christmas  but all other internet based entities suffered 
The sad  but unsurprising news came in the form of reduced sales at the larger brick and mortar retailers like Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   Macy s Inc  NYSE M  and Kohls Corp  NYSE KSS   Their December was incredibly disappointing  They weren t alone either  Bars  grocers  restaurants  home furnishers  pharmacies  and hobby outlets also felt the pain in this retail report 
Now I m not normally one to fuss over retail sales data  but I fear it may be a sign of things to come in 2019  Market analysts and economists predict the U S  GDP declined 2 7  at the close of 2018  but if the Retail Report is any indication  those numbers will likely be far worse  with a growth contraction far larger than originally anticipated 
Investors quickly realized that possibility and markets like the Dow plummeted  sinking 200 points mere minutes after the opening bell 
A Chief Economist from Pantheon MacroEconomics  Ian Shepherdson  came forward with an alternative theory when consulted by MarketWatch 

These data are so wild that we have to expect hefty upward revisions  but if they stand  they are very unlikely to be representative of the trend over the next few months  The consumer is no longer enjoying tax cuts or falling gas prices  but that s no reason to expect a rollover 

In light of this news  any hope of a Bullish post Christmas rally has been obliterated ",2019-02-14,Bill Poulos,https://www.investing.com/analysis/retail-report-reveals-what-the-shutdown-has-wrought-200388521,200388521
142253,363768,JWN,Nordstrom  JWN  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 28  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This department store operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 42 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 3  
Revenues are expected to be  4 63 billion  up 0 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nordstrom 
For Nordstrom  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 55  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nordstrom will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Nordstrom would post earnings of  0 64 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 67  delivering a surprise of  4 69  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Nordstrom doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200390916,200390916

142272,363787,JWN,Economic Calendar   Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,news,"Investing com   Global financial markets will focus on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in the week ahead  as he makes his first major appearance as central bank chief when he testifies on the economy before congressional committees 
Staying in the U S   a report on personal income and spending  which includes the personal consumption expenditures inflation data  the Fed s preferred metric for inflation  will be the highlight of the week 
In Europe  investors will await monthly inflation data to assess how fast the European Central Bank will start unwinding its asset purchase program 
Meanwhile  traders will focus on a pair of reports on activity in the UK manufacturing and construction sectors for further hints on the health of the economy and the likelihood of the Bank of England raising interest rates this year 
Elsewhere  market participants will be looking ahead to monthly data on China s manufacturing sector amid recent signs that momentum in the world s second largest economy remains strong 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets 
1  Fed Chair Powell Testifies
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver his first semi annual monetary policy testimony on the economy before Senate and House committees in Washington DC 
Powell is scheduled to testify on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 00AM ET  1500GMT  Tuesday  On Thursday  he will appear in front the House Financial Services Committee also at 10AM ET 
Text of the testimony will be released 90 minutes before he starts speaking 
Powell s comments will be monitored closely for any new insight on his views on the recent uptick in inflation and how that can affect the current rate hiking path  Investors will also be watching for comments on the markets themselves  in light of the latest bout of increased volatility 
The latest minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee s policy discussions published last week drove speculation the U S  central bank will raise interest rates at a faster pace than currently expected 
Indeed  many economists have started to forecast four rate hikes this year  more than the three the Fed currently predicts  due to a recent batch of stronger than expected U S  inflation data 
The Fed is scheduled to hold its next policy meeting on March  20 21  with interest rate futures pricing in an 80  chance of a rate hike at that meeting  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool 
2  U S  PCE Inflation Data
The Commerce Department will publish data personal income and consumer spending for January  which include the personal consumption expenditures  PCE  inflation data  the Fed s preferred metric for inflation  at 8 30AM ET  1330GMT  Thursday 
The consensus forecast is that the report will show that the core PCE price index inched up 0 3  last month  after rising 0 2  a month earlier  On an annualized basis  core PCE prices are expected to rise 1 5   unchanged from the preceding month 
The Federal Reserve uses core PCE as a tool to help determine whether to raise or lower interest rates  with the aim of keeping inflation at a rate of 2  or below 
This week s calendar also features the second estimate of GDP growth for the fourth quarter on Wednesday  expected to show a small downward revision from 2 6  to 2 5  
Reports on ISM manufacturing sector growth  CB consumer confidence  durable goods orders  new home sales  pending home sales and monthly auto sales will also be on the agenda 
Meanwhile  on Wall Street  earnings in the week ahead include results from chain store retailers such as Macy s  NYSE M   Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   Kohl s  NYSE KSS  and JC Penney  NYSE JCP   in what will be the last big wave of the fourth quarter earnings season 
Elsewhere  news out of Washington D C  is expected to keep investors on their toes  as the investigation into President Donald Trump campaign s ties to Russia continues to rumble on 
3  Euro Zone Flash Inflation
The euro zone will publish flash inflation figures for February at 1000GMT  5 00AM ET  Wednesday  which if they remain strong could push the European Central Bank another step closer to ending its mass stimulus program 
The consensus forecast is that the report will show consumer prices rose 1 2   slowing slightly from 1 3  in January  remaining short of the European Central Bank s target of just below 2  
Perhaps more significantly  the core figure  without volatile energy and food prices  is seen holding steady at 1 0   unchanged from a month earlier 
Germany  France  Italy and Spain will produce their own CPI reports throughout the week 
Besides the inflation data  ECB President Mario Draghi will testify on monetary policy and the inflation outlook before the European Parliament Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee  in Brussels at 1400GMT  9 00AM ET  Monday 
How he views signs of rising inflation and any clues on how fast the central bank will begin exiting its massive quantitative easing program will be important 
Minutes of the ECB s last meeting released last week revealed that ECB officials rejected even a token change in the bank s policy message  arguing that it was premature to signal policy normalization given weak inflation 
Despite those remarks  market players remain convinced that easy monetary policy in the region is coming to an end sooner rather than later 
The central bank cut its monthly bond purchases from  60 billion to  30 billion back in October  but extended the program until the end of September 2018  citing muted price pressures 
The ECB next meets on March 8 
4  UK PMI s
The U K  will release readings on February manufacturing sector activity at 0930GMT  4 30AM ET  on Thursday  followed by a report on the construction sector on Friday 
The manufacturing PMI is forecast to ease slightly to 55 0 from 55 3 a month earlier  while construction activity is expected to inch up to 50 7 from 50 2 
Additionally  a speech on Friday by British Prime Minister Theresa May about Britain s post Brexit relationship with the European Union will also be on the agenda  as Brexit developments remain in focus 
While Britain s economy is lagging behind the global recovery  it has held up better than the gloomy forecasts made at the time of the 2016 vote to leave the European Union 
The Bank of England kept interest rates steady earlier this month  but signaled it was likely to raise rates sooner and by more than it thought a few months ago as it seeks to keep a grip on inflation 
5  Chinese Manufacturing PMI
The China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing is to release data on February manufacturing sector activity at 0100GMT on Wednesday  amid expectations for a modest uptick to 51 4 from a reading of 51 3 in January 
The Caixin manufacturing index  which focuses more on small and mid sized firms  is due at 0145GMT Thursday  The survey is expected to dip by 0 2 points to 51 3 from 51 5 
The purchasing managers  index  PMI  is seen as a good indicator of economic conditions and it is even preferred by some analysts to gross domestic product  which might be affected by poor seasonal adjustment and is prone to revisions 
Anything above 50 0 signals expansion  while readings below 50 0 indicate industry contraction 
China s economy grew 6 8  in the fourth quarter from a year earlier  helped by a rebound in the industrial sector  a resilient property market and strong export growth

He is due to testify in front of the Senate Banking Committee at 10 00AM ET  1500GMT  
In his first congressional hearing as head of the Fed on Tuesday  Powell vowed to prevent the economy from overheating while sticking with a plan to gradually raise interest rates 
Those comments rekindled speculation in equity markets over U S  monetary tightening this year happening faster than expected  Indeed  many economists have started to forecast four rate hikes this year  compared to the three the Fed currently predicts 
2  Fed s Preferred Inflation Metric in Focus
Besides Powell  Thursday s calendar features a closely watched report on personal income and spending for February  which includes the personal consumption expenditures inflation data   the Fed s preferred metric for inflation   at 8 30AM ET  1330GMT  
The consensus forecast is that the report will show that the core PCE price index inched up 0 3  last month  after rising 0 2  a month earlier  On an annualized basis  core PCE prices are expected to rise 1 5   unchanged from the preceding month 
The Fed uses core PCE as a tool to help determine whether to raise or lower interest rates  with the aim of keeping inflation at a rate of 2  or below 
In addition to the inflation data  reports on weekly jobless claims  ISM manufacturing activity  construction spending and monthly auto sales will also on the agenda for today 
3  Dollar Climbs To Six Week High

The dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  was last at 90 70  after hitting an overnight high of 90 74  the best level since Jan  18 
Meanwhile  the U S  10 year Treasury yield stood at 2 841   continuing to move away from a four year high of 2 957  reached last week 
Against the yen  the dollar inched up 0 1  to  106 80

142285,363800,JWN,Breaking Down Nike s  NKE  Impressive Earnings Results ,opinion,"Nike   NYSE NKE   stock soared over 8  Friday after the sportswear giant posted better than expected quarterly financial results Thursday  So  let s take a look at where Nike performed the best and dive into some of what we learned from the company s earnings call 
Quick Q2 Overview 
Right off the bat  Nike s fiscal second quarter 2019 revenues jumped 10  from the year ago period to reach  9 37 billion  This matched the company s growth last quarter and topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate that called for a 7 1  expansion to reach  9 16 billion  Meanwhile  on the bottom end of the income statement  the sportswear giant s adjusted quarterly earnings popped 13  to touch  0 52 per share  which blew past our estimate that called for a 2  dip to hit  0 45 a share 
Shares of Nike were up 7  to  72 31 a share through mid afternoon trading Friday  Clearly  many investors were pleased with Nike s top and bottom line expansion  But we need to dig a little deeper to see why Nike was able to beat quarterly expectations 
Details
Nike s North American revenues surged 9  to hit  3 78 billion  This also came in above our  3 68 billion NFM estimate and marked the much needed continuation of sales growth in its largest market  We should note that Nike was able to build on a disappointing Q2 of fiscal 2018 when its North American sales fell 5  
Nike has been able to return to the growth investors have come to expect through a massive direct to consumer push  driven by Nike Digital  The company has introduced multiple e commerce focused apps and blows away some of its biggest competitors  Adidas   OTC ADDYY   and Under Armour   NYSE UAA    in terms of reach across social media from Instagram   NASDAQ FB   to Twitter   NYSE TWTR   
Plus  the company has expanded its athleisure business in order to fight off challengers like Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU   and Gap s   NYSE GPS   Athleta  And the firm has remained a dominant force in sportswear and streetwear  while it maintains its position as a global leader in basketball and soccer  also read    
Overall  Nike s digital revenues surged 41   with mobile now accounting for  well over  50  of its digital commerce revenue  Nike CFO Andy Campion said that Nike expects its digital division will comprise 30  of the firm s total business by 2023  compared to roughly 15  at the moment 
The company was also able to return to growth in its Jordan division  Plus  Nike s biggest category  Sportswear  saw its apparel segment surge over 20   Nike also noted that it expects big things from its Converse brand going forward  including a Basketball push and a new digital platform 
Moving on  Nike s sales in Greater China soared 26  to reach  1 54 billion  which topped our  1 42 billion estimate  This also marked larger growth than last quarter s 20  expansion in what is a key market for Nike  The firm s Singles  Day popularized by Alibaba   NYSE BABA   sales skyrocketed 40   Maybe more impressively  Q2 marked the 18th consecutive quarter of double digit revenue growth in China 
Sales also climbed 8  in Europe  Middle East  and Africa to  2 31 billion  Nike s Asia Pacific   Latin America division climbed 2  to  1 3 billion 
Bottom Line
Nike s digital push has proved successful  But the company hasn t given up on traditional retail  In fact  Nike has rolled out new store concepts around the world  And CEO Mark Parker said on the company s earnings call that Nike is  making great strides with strategic partners like JD Sports  Foot Locker   NYSE FL    Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    and Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS    elevated experiences are driving outsized growth in the wholesale channel  
Through its dominance of sportswear and big time professional sports  which includes the NBA  NFL  and European soccer along with Adidas Nike seems poised to remain a retail giant for years to come  Looking ahead  our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Nike s full year revenues to climb 7 4  to reach  39 07 billion

142321,363836,JWN,Nordstrom Crashed  Was EPS Miss The Real Reason ,opinion,"Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  shareholders were enjoying a smooth ride so far in 2018  The stock was up by as much as 38 8  by the end of October  crushing the return of the S P 500 by a large margin  November  on the other hand  is not that generous  JWN fell from  67 75 to less than  50 a share in the last two weeks  erasing most of the year to date gains 
According to Barron s  the reason for the sudden collapse was the company s latest quarterly report  which delivered an earnings miss and a weak revenue guidance for the full year  It all makes sense in hindsight  but one problem remains   investors cannot turn back time and protect their profits  Fortunately  Elliott Wave analysts do not have to worry about time travel 
The chart below  published in an article titled  Nordstrom s Woes Not Over Yet   shows JWN stock investors had plenty of time to take defensive measures On June 28th 2017  we shared our opinion that  the current rally could be expected to continue towards the area between  65 and  70 a share   On the other hand  this chart also suggested that  the bulls should be careful approaching this zone  because once wave  B  ends  wave  C  to the south should begin   Seventeen months later  here is an updated chart of Nordstrom stock  JWN reversed to the downside shortly after entering the  65    70 area  As visible  by the time the Q3 earnings disappointment arrived  the bearish reversal was already in place  This means that anticipating major market moves is a lot more important than predicting an earnings miss or beat  mostly because the latter is impossible 
Nordstrom  s EPS Miss was just a Catalyst
Besides  we have seen stocks crashing after a positive EPS surprise and stocks rising following an EPS miss  In this respect  staying ahead of the news actually means anticipating other people s reaction to it  And that is where the Elliott Wave Principle is most valuable 
In Nordstrom s case  there was a five wave impulse pattern from over  83 to  35 a share  According to the theory  every impulse is followed by a three wave correction in the opposite direction  Once this 5 3 wave cycle is over  the larger trend resumes in the direction of the impulsive sequence  Since wave C of  B  was still missing  it made sense to expect more strength towards  65    70  followed by more weakness in wave  C  
The good news is the same reasoning can be successfully applied to other trading instruments  as well  It wasn t something uniquely related to Nordstrom and insider information was not part of the equation  either  It was just an Elliott Wave pattern on Nordstrom s price chart 
With the bears already in charge  Nordstrom remains vulnerable going into 2019  Wave  C  s initial targets lie below the bottom of wave  A  at  35  If this count is correct  JWN stock can lose another 30  from current levels  Perhaps even more

142326,363841,JWN,Nordstrom family suspends attempt to take U S  retailer private,news,"By Carl O Donnell and Greg Roumeliotis  Reuters     Nordstrom Inc   NYSE JWN  said on Monday that a founding family group had suspended attempts to take the U S  department store operator private because of difficulties in arranging debt financing for its bid ahead of the key holiday shopping season   Nordstrom shares dropped as much as 7 percent as investors were again reminded of the challenges of the U S  brick and mortar retail sector  which has seen a record number of bankruptcies this year amid competition from e commerce firms such as Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  and off price stores like TJX Cos Inc  Nordstrom s rival Hudson s Bay Co  owner of the Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord   Taylor retail chains  has also been exploring going private  Reuters has reported  Its shares dropped 5 percent on Monday as analysts said the chances of other retailers clinching such deals had become slimmer    It s difficult to make a case for private equity investing in these legacy retail companies when the play is really not about growing the company so much as right sizing it   said Neil Saunders  retail analyst at Global Data  Nordstrom shares dropped to  39 64  their lowest level in five months  giving the company a market capitalization of around  6 6 billion  Nordstrom said in June that the family group  which owns 31 2 percent of the storied retailer  was looking to take the company private  Sources said the family believed it could better manage the company s operational restructuring and transition to e commerce away from the public markets   Nordstrom  which has sought to become more competitive by investing in its off price discount chain Nordstrom Rack  in August reported better than expected quarterly same store sales  as more people shopped at its online stores  The family was seeking to partner with buyout firm Leonard Green   Partners LP on the bid  sources had said  But investment banks balked at providing the debt financing required for the bid  estimated at between  7 billion and  8 billion  Last Friday  representatives of the Nordstrom family group informed Nordstrom s special board committee handling the potential deal that it had given up on efforts to take the company private until the end of the year because of the difficult of obtaining debt financing  according to a Nordstrom regulatory filing  It added that the group would explore a take private bid after the holiday season  A source close to the family group said Nordstrom s upcoming holiday sales did not have to be particularly strong for a deal to materialize  and that it was the uncertainty of what the shopping season will look like that weighed on the banks  appetite to finance the bid   However  the market for leveraged buyouts in the retail sector has been very choppy of late  with debt investors licking their wounds after participating in recent deals   The  2 billion of bonds issued by specialty pet retailer PetSmart in May to finance its  3 billion acquisition of online rival Chewy have suffered steep losses  When private equity firm Sycamore Partners acquired office supplies retailer  Staples Inc   NASDAQ SPLS  for  6 9 billion last month  it separated its retail from its business to business delivery operations to make financing more palatable to investors   However  Sycamore was forced to cut the size of the planned bond deal by  300 million to  1 billion to pay a higher yield than originally targeted to sell the debt  The bonds have lost some of their value since then  Neiman Marcus  another Nordstrom s rival  canceled plans earlier this year for an initial public offering after struggling with its soaring debt pile  Some activist investors are pushing ailing retailers to explore other strategies

142332,363847,JWN,U S  department stores tap brakes on stocking for holiday season,news,"By Nandita Bose CHICAGO  Reuters    This holiday season  retailers are making a list  checking it twice  and then ordering less for U S  shoppers   With foot traffic at their stores in decline  department stores that would have stocked up for the biggest shopping season of the year months ago are still in the process of placing new orders  according to nearly a dozen sources including company officials  vendors who work with the retailers and consultants who advise such chains  The strategy is aimed to keep their inventory costs down and avoid the experience of previous holiday seasons  when large piles of unsold stock led to deep markdowns that eroded profits  But these retailers risk losing sales if supplies run out at a time when many are struggling to keep up with Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  and a steady shift towards online shopping  Macy s Inc  J C Penney Co Inc Kohl s Corp  Nordstrom Inc   NYSE JWN   Dillard s Inc and Hudson Bay Co s Lord   Taylor are among the retailers buying in smaller batches with shorter lead times this year and relying on a more dynamic demand forecasting process than in the past  according to sources familiar with these companies  practices  Macy s  Kohl s  Nordstrom  J C  Penney declined to comment  Lord   Taylor said it is working on preparing a carefully selected merchandise assortment for the holiday season but did not share anything specific  Dillard s did not respond to a request for comment  Keeping inventory levels low helps manage costs  and may also instill urgency in consumers to spend now rather than hold off on purchases in search of a better deal  according to the sources  But it also risks alienating customers who may end up having less choice  and is also putting strain on vendors to deliver on shorter lead times  the sources added  The high stakes strategy takes a page from the playbook of  Inditex   MC ITX  SA owned Zara  Hennes   Mauritz AB  ST HMb   H M  and other so called  fast fashion  retailers that consistently keep low inventories of trendy clothes and try to win customers with cheap prices   For a graphic  click   I think in some sections the choice is limited this year like cashmere sweaters and sweaters in general   said Dakota Whitlow  a 46 year old marketing executive as she shopped for winter clothing at Macy s State Street store in Chicago   But limiting choice is in many ways better than overcrowding the store with clothes  which makes it harder to shop   she added  Traditionally  retailers lock in most of their purchases nine months to a year in advance  This year  retailers started placing a large portion of their holiday orders three to four months before the holiday season  and are refreshing fast selling items within as little as six to eight weeks  vendors and consultants said   There is a big push from department stores across the board this year to cut down lead times and manage inventory tightly   said Robert D Loren  chairman and CEO of U S  based Xcel Brands  which supplies branded apparel to chains like Lord   Taylor and Dillard s and private label clothing to other department stores   We are delivering orders on weekly cycles with plans that are six weeks out   The risk for department stores is whether suppliers can keep up with the new approach   Department stores rely on vendors whose traditional supply chains are not built for a fast turnaround  because they handle orders for several brands  Fast fashion chains  on the other hand  have designed their supply chain to shift on a week to week basis versus the traditional four for department stores and work with vendors who can deliver quickly on private label items they stock   As a result  some smaller vendors of traditional department stores struggle to adapt to request for shorter lead times    We are refusing to take  last minute  orders  We just don t have that kind of idle capacity in our factories  our production lines  Cargo delivery contracts are not built to react that way   said a Bangladeshi supplier to J C  Penney and Kohl s  who would only be quoted on condition of anonymity   WILLING TO LOSE A SALE So far this year  retailers have been willing to sacrifice some orders for tighter inventory management   Between the risk of a lost sale and the risk of a loss of margin  department stores are willing to lose the sale this year   said Greg Portell  a consultant with AT Kearney who advises retail chains on strategy  Retailers are optimistic about their new strategy  Macy s expects a  marked difference this holiday versus last  in the way it buys stock  Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said on an earnings conference call in August   We definitely are buying closer in    to make sure we have the right goods in time for holiday  but not too far in advance   To be sure  ordering closer to demand can help a retailer cope with weak consumer spending  but it cannot offset its negative impact altogether  While consumer confidence has improved overall  the National Retail Federation cautioned in October that U S  consumers will remain hesitant to spend until there is more certainty about policy changes on issues such as taxes and trade  The trade group estimated holiday sales for the U S  retail industry will grow between 3 7 4 2 percent in 2017  from 3 75 percent in 2016   
  Retailers  simply don t want to be stuck with excess stock  It takes up working capital and that was okay when times were good but not when things are this tough   said Neil Stern  partner at McMillan Doolittle  a consultancy who works with retailers including department stores ",2017-11-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-department-stores-tap-brakes-on-stocking-for-holiday-season-820628,820628

142336,363851,JWN,Here s What To Expect From Macy s  M  Q3 Earnings,opinion,"Shares of Macy s   NYSE M   sunk 3 40  during regular trading Tuesday in a sign that investors might be nervous about the department store giant ahead of the release of its Q3 financial results Wednesday 
Overview 
Coming into Tuesday  shares of Macy s had skyrocketed over 80  during the last 12 months as investors jumped on the bandwagon with the firm showing signs of a turnaround  Macy s posted its third straight quarter of comparable store sales growth last quarter and has grown its e commerce business in the age of Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   
Yet  we can see that Macy s stock has greatly underperformed the S P 500 over the past five years  And it seems very likely that many investors simply bought the massive Macy s dip last November 
 
Q3 Outlook
Macy s third quarter revenues are projected to pop by 1 91  to reach  5 38 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  Plus  Macy s Q3 comparable store sales are projected to climb 2 2   based on our current NFM estimates  This  however  comes after comps fell 3 6  in the year ago quarter 
Meanwhile  the firm s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to tumble 43 5  to hit  0 13 per share  With that said  we still need to know how likely it is that Macy s is able to top our quarterly earnings estimate 
Luckily  we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure to do so  The Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Macy s is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  based on its recent upward earnings estimate revisions  The company also sports an Earnings ESP of  20 0   Therefore  investors can reasonably expect that Macy s might top our quarterly earnings estimate Wednesday  Plus  the retailer has beaten our quarterly earnings estimates in eight out of the last 10 periods 
Macy s is scheduled to report its Q3 financial results before the market opens Wednesday  Fellow department stores J  C  Penney   NYSE JCP   and Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   report their quarterly financial results on Thursday

142337,363852,JWN,What To Expect From Victoria s Secret Parent L Brands  LB  Q3 Earnings,opinion,"The CEO of L Brands    NYSE LB   Victoria s Secret division  Jan Singer is reportedly stepping down from the company as sales continue to slow  Amid this news  L Brands is set to report its third quarter financial results after the closing bell Monday  So  let s see if LB stock might be able to build on its recent 13  jump over the last month 
Recent News   Overview 
Victoria s Secret s CEO is set to step down after roughly two years at the company  according to a   Singer  who spent time at Spanx and Nike   NYSE NKE    moves on from the retailer at a time of immense uncertainty within the brand as sales falter 
With that said  L Brands  which also owns Bath   Body Works  La Senza  and Henri Bende  reported its sales figures for the four week period that ended on November 3  The company posted net sales of  860 5 million  which marked an 8  jump from the comparable period last year 
L Brands also released its sales figures for the 13 week period  which helps us gauge what to expect from the company s Q3 revenues  The firm s net sales jumped roughly 6  from  2 618 billion in the year ago period to hit  2 775 billion  Plus  L Brands  comparable sales popped 4  
 
 
Complete Q3 Outlook
Moving on  our current Zacks Consensus revenue estimate falls in line with the firm s  2 775 billion net sales figure  Meanwhile  L Brands  full year revenues are projected to jump 4 3  to touch  13 17 billion  It is also worth noting that Victoria s Secret sales are projected to slip nearly 2  from  1 539 billion in the prior year quarter to  1 509 billion  based on our NFM estimates 
Meanwhile  at the other end of the income statement  the retailer s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to plummet 46 7  from  0 30 per share to reach  0 16 per share  Therefore  with this massive  expected year over year decline most likely priced in at the moment  we need to know how L Brands  earnings estimate revisions have been trending since a beat could be helpful 
L Brands has received four upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter within the last seven days alone  This helps us see that some analysts are more positive about the retailer s earnings picture than they have been recently  Plus  the chart helps us see that earnings might be better down the road  with more revisions coming in for its current year and the following fiscal year 
Bottom Line
L Brands is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  based on its recent positive earnings estimate revision activity  The company  which also sports an  A  grade for Value in our Style Scores system  has seen its stock price surge 13  over the last month amid the larger market downturn  But investors should note that shares of LB sunk over 4  through early afternoon trading Thursday  likely on the back of Singer s departure 
L Brands is set to release its Q3 financial results after the closing bell on Monday  November 19  The company follows reports from fellow retailers Macy s   NYSE M    J  C  Penney   NYSE JCP    Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    and giants like Walmart   NYSE WMT

142338,363853,JWN,Nordstrom  JWN  Beats Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 67 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 64 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 67 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4 69   A quarter ago  it was expected that this department store operator would post earnings of  0 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 95  delivering a surprise of 14 46  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Nordstrom  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry  posted revenues of  3 75 billion for the quarter ended October 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 83   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 63 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Nordstrom shares have added about 29  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 1  
What s Next for Nordstrom 
While Nordstrom has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Nordstrom was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 50 on  4 61 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 59 on  15 92 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

142365,363880,JWN,Nordstrom  JWN  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 15  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This department store operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 63 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6  
Revenues are expected to be  3 68 billion  up 1 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 33  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nordstrom 
For Nordstrom  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  16 90  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Nordstrom will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Nordstrom would post earnings of  0 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 95  delivering a surprise of  14 46  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Nordstrom appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nordstrom-jwn-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200357010,200357010
142366,363881,JWN,Buy Macy s  M  Stock Ahead Of Q3    1 Trillion Holiday Shopping Season ,opinion,"Shares of Macy s   NYSE M   have climbed nearly 15  over the last month as the broader market slipped in a sign that investors might expect big things from the department store giant s Q3 financial results  Let s take a look at some of Macy s key estimates to help understand if M stock might be a buy ahead of earnings and what looks to be a booming holiday shopping period 
Quick Overview 
Macy s has revamped its business and boosted online sales  The company also posted its third straight quarter of comparable store sales growth in Q2 
The retailer seems to have regained some strength at a time when many thought the likes of Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and other online giants would greatly harm traditional brick and mortar businesses  Investors should also remember that although we are waiting on Macy s third quarter earnings results  we are in the midst of the vital fourth quarter shopping season 
Looking ahead  the holiday shopping period is expected to surpass the  1 trillion mark for the first time  according to   This would mark a 5 8  jump from 2017 and represent the strongest holiday spending growth since 2011 
Price Movement  
We can see that Macy s stock has dramatically underperformed its industry over the last five years  M stock s 20  decline also looks miserable compared to the S P 500 s 62  surge 
Investors then decided to buy the dip on the back of some signs of a possible revival over the last year  In fact  shares of M have skyrocketed nearly 90  in the past 52 weeks  Plus  shares of Macy s closed regular trading Friday at  37 80 despite its recent positive  This marked a nearly 10  downturn from its 52 week high of  41 99 per share 
 
Valuation
Moving on  M stock is currently trading at 10 5X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  which marks a discount compared to its industry s 13 4X and the S P 500 s 16 8X 
Macy s stock has traded as high as 11 6X over the last year and as low as 7 1X  Jumping back even further we can see that M s valuation picture is hardly stretched that the moment 
 
Q3 Outlook
Looking ahead  our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Macy s third quarter revenues to pop by 2 99  to reach  5 44 billion  Plus  Macy s Q3 comparable store sales are projected to climb 2 2   based on our current NFM estimates  This  however  comes after comps fell 3 6  in the year ago quarter  The department store s full year revenues are projected to climb 1 9  to  25 31 billion 
Meanwhile  the firm s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to plummet 43  to hit  0 13 per share  The company s full year earnings are expected to climb 6 37  
Bottom Line
Macy s is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  that has topped our quarterly earnings estimates in eight out of the last 10 periods  With that said   Macy s has seen zero earnings estimate revision activity over the last 90 days  Therefore  it seems that Macy s stock might be one to stay away from based on its Q3 earnings outlook 
Macy s is scheduled to report its Q3 financial results before the market opens on Wednesday  November 14  Fellow department stores J  C  Penney   NYSE JCP   and Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   are set to report their quarterly financial results on Thursday

	We were really hoping this market could end the week on positive ground  but there was bound to be some profit taking after Wednesday s epic rally  More importantly though  Friday s selloff did not ruin a strong week  as two of the major indices were still able to jump more than 2  
	There were a lot of things happening this week  but fortunately no real surprises  The midterms ended as expected with a split Congress and the Fed kept interest rates unchanged  The Committee also reiterated its plan for  gradual  hikes in the future  which may be disappointing to some investors but can t be considered a surprise by anyone 
	With some clarity achieved  stocks soared on Wednesday and kept most of those gains through a sluggish Thursday  But other uncertainties remain with no signs of being resolved anytime soon  including fears of an economic slowdown  rising rates and trade issues 
	All of the indices came off their lows by the closing bell  but the NASDAQ still dipped by 1 65  to 7406 90 on Friday  The S P was off by 0 92  to 2781 01 and the Dow slumped 0 77  to 25 989 30 
	But for the week  the Dow jumped 2 8   which actually beat last week s solid performance of 2 4   The S P climbed by 2 1   The NASDAQ has been getting beaten up a lot these days as tech continues to come under pressure  but it too managed to stay on the positive side with a weekly advance of 0 7  
	Even with a couple of good weeks  the editors are still wondering if the market can climb higher from here or if it needs to test the correction lows again  Who isn t a bit cautious after the damage done in October  With the midterms now out of the way and earnings season winding down  next week could be very important in deciding how the market will finish the year  Today s Portfolio Highlights Technology Innovators  The market was pretty soft to finish the week  so Brian Bolan thought it was a good idea to take a big gain now ahead of the weekend  Therefore  he sold Twilio  TWLO  on Friday to secure a nice profit of nearly 23  in less than a month Surprise Trader  We re reaching the end of earnings season  which means its time for the retailers to report  Dave thinks Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  is set for a surprise after the bell on Thursday  November 15  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  has a positive Earnings ESP of 6 92  for the quarter  The editor believes that lowered expectations for retail could also bode well for a nice beat  JWN was added on Friday with a 12 5  allocation  Read the complete commentary for more Counterstrike  Crude is now stuck in its longest losing streak ever  Jeremy wants to buy into it since there s a potential for a good sized bounce next week  He added a 4  allocation in Velocityshares 3X Long Crude Oil  UWT  today  The editor thinks crude could dip all the way to  57 before the rebound  so there s room to add even more moving forward  Jeremy also decided to bank some profits during this weak session  so he sold ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  SVXY  and Corning  GLW  for returns of 6 1  and 8 2   respectively  See the full write up for more on today s moves TAZR Trader  So does the market need to test its correction lows  or just fill the post election gap to embark on a Q4 rally  Either way  Kevin wants to prepare for the eventual rebound  so he added more to the portfolio s position in ProShares UltraPro QQQ 3X Bull ETF  TQQQ   This is his favorite tech leverage play  Read the write up for more on this name and the editor s outlook Home Run Investor  It was exactly three months ago today that Brian Bolan added SendGrid  SEND   and the stock has certainly performed in the portfolio during a very difficult stretch  This stock has appeared on the Top Movers List regularly since news that it was being acquired by Twilio  TWLO   Given the soft market today  the editor thought it would be a good idea to sell the name and take a 42 6  return to the bank

142368,363883,JWN,Macy s  Nordstrom  Wal Mart And Amazon Are Part Of Zacks Earnings Preview,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 12  2018   Zacks com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises  This week s list includes Macy s   NYSE M    Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    Wal Mart   NYSE WMT   and Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   Can Retail Stocks Build on Their Recent Gains The earnings focus shifts to the Retail sector this week as traditional brick and mortar retailers come out with quarterly results  Stocks of most of these traditional operators have outperformed the broader market this year  with the very favorable domestic consumer spending backdrop helping offset the market s longstanding worries about the space s competitive positioning in the emerging retail landscape of declining mall foot traffic and growing digital sales Given continued favorable trends in the broader economy  it is reasonable to be optimistic about earnings results from these traditional operators and their stock prices  But what will be critical to these stocks  performance in the coming days will be management s outlook for the coming holiday s period  On deck to report results this week are Macy s  Nordstrom  Wal Mart and a number of others  In total  we have more than 300 companies reporting results this week  including 12 S P 500 members Macy s  Nordstrom and other department store stocks have been strong performers this year  with Macy s up  50 1  and Nordstrom up  38 1  in the year to date period  doing better than the S P 500 s  4 9  gain  These stocks had lost ground in the two month period from mid August to mid October  but they shook off the October blues ahead of the broader market The Zacks Department Store industry is up  8 3  thus far in Q4 and  42 3  since the start of the year  Amazon  which reported Q3 results that the market found disappointing  is down  14 5  in Q4  but is otherwise up  46  this year  We count Amazon as part of the Zacks Retail sector that includes the traditional retailers  restaurants and online vendors like Amazon Given the way we define the Retail sector  this week s results from Macy s  Wal Mart and others wouldn t be the first results from this space as many of the restaurants and online vendors have already posted Q3 results  In fact  we already have Q3 results from 19 of the 38 Retail sector companies in the S P 500 index or exactly 50  of the sector companies in the index Total earnings for these 19 Retail sector companies that have reported results already are up  37 5  from the same period last year on  10 7  higher revenues  with 89 5  beating EPS estimates and 63 2  beating revenue estimates The Retail sector results thus far are from the online vendors and restaurant players  with  traditional  operators starting to report only this week  The comparison charts above show that while growth  both earnings as well as revenues  is below the preceding quarter s level  it compares favorably with historical periods  Positive revenue surprises have been hard to come by this earnings season across all sectors and that appears to be the case with Retail as well With respect to the sector s growth  Amazon s blockbuster numbers  particularly on the revenues front  has a big role in the very strong growth picture at this stage  even though the online retail giant s results disappointed the market Q3 earnings growth is still very strong  but the revenue growth rate is a lot lower on an ex Amazon basis  Join us on Facebook  NASDAQ FB    Zacks Investment Research

Season Shares of Macy s have climbed nearly 15  over the last month as the broader market slipped in a sign that investors might expect big things from the department store giant s Q3 financial results  Let s take a look at some of Macy s key estimates to help understand if M stock might be a buy ahead of earnings and what looks to be a booming holiday shopping period Quick Overview Macy s has revamped its business and boosted online sales  The company also posted its third straight quarter of comparable store sales growth in Q2 The retailer seems to have regained some strength at a time when many thought the likes of Amazon and other online giants would greatly harm traditional brick and mortar businesses  Investors should also remember that although we are waiting on Macy s third quarter earnings results  we are in the midst of the vital fourth quarter shopping season Looking ahead  the holiday shopping period is expected to surpass the  1 trillion mark for the first time  according to   This would mark a 5 8  jump from 2017 and represent the strongest holiday spending growth since 2011 Price Movement  We can see that Macy s stock has dramatically underperformed its industry over the last five years  M stock s 20  decline also looks miserable compared to the S P 500 s 62  surge Investors then decided to buy the dip on the back of some signs of a possible revival over the last year  In fact  shares of M have skyrocketed nearly 90  in the past 52 weeks  Plus  shares of Macy s closed regular trading Friday at  37 80 despite its recent positive  This marked a nearly 10  downturn from its 52 week high of  41 99 per share ValuationMoving on  M stock is currently trading at 10 5X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  which marks a discount compared to its industry s 13 4X and the S P 500 s 16 8X Macy s stock has traded as high as 11 6X over the last year and as low as 7 1X  Jumping back even further we can see that M s valuation picture is hardly stretched that the moment Q3 OutlookLooking ahead  our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Macy s third quarter revenues to pop by 2 99  to reach  5 44 billion  Plus  Macy s Q3 comparable store sales are projected to climb 2 2   based on our current NFM estimates  This  however  comes after comps fell 3 6  in the year ago quarter  The department store s full year revenues are projected to climb 1 9  to  25 31 billion Meanwhile  the firm s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to plummet 43  to hit  0 13 per share  The company s full year earnings are expected to

estimate revision activity over the last 90 days  Therefore  it seems that Macy s stock might be one to stay away from based on its Q3 earnings outlook Macy s is scheduled to report its Q3 financial results before the market opens on Wednesday  November 14  Fellow department stores J  C  Penney and Nordstrom are set to report their quarterly financial results on Thursday The Hottest Tech Mega

142399,363914,JWN,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Nordstrom  JWN ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry 
This department store operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 17 94  
For the last reported quarter  Nordstrom came out with earnings of  0 95 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 83 per share  representing a surprise of 14 46   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 42 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 51 per share  delivering a surprise of 21 43  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Nordstrom  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Nordstrom currently has an Earnings ESP of  16 90   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on November 15  2018 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-11-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-nordstrom-jwn-200354071,200354071

initiatives to bring itself back on the growth trajectory  In April 2018  the company introduced a transformation plan to reduce costs and increase focus on its core products such as hair color and hair care  As part of this plan  the company also initiated solid strategies in the third quarter  including reviewing freight expenses to achieve significant cost savings in the future and launching two new color lines   Arctic Fox and Wella ColorCharm Paints   to strengthen its hair product offerings In the quarter to be reported  the company expects to undertake marketing and merchandising initiatives in its core products  and enhance digital capabilities and cost cutting actions  For fiscal 2019  Sally Beauty is set to launch box color across SBS network  In the BSG division  the

fiscal 2018  Management also plans to revamp Sally Beauty s e commerce site These apart  the company announced plans to decrease headcount in its corporate headquarters in Denton  TX  for reducing costs  Sally Beauty will gain  14  15 million from these cost reduction initiatives  with benefits in fiscal 2018 estimated between  6 million and  7 million However  the company is grappling with

decline 50 bps in fiscal 2018 due to price investments made in Sally during the first quarter  enhanced promotional activity and a business segment mix shift  Management expects adjusted operating income to decline 8 10  in the same year on decrease in same store sales and contraction in gross margin along with marginally higher adjusted SG A expenses What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven

142434,363949,JWN,4 Stocks To Watch Today  AMD  CRON  SFIX  TLRY,opinion,"Advanced Micro Devices  Inc   NASDAQ AMD   after a pause of three or four days  consolidated  ran up and had a very quiet inside day on Friday  and on Tuesday it exploded another 2 89  or 11 1 2   to 28 06  on 188 million shares  That s huge volume  I don t like it when a stock makes a higher high on lower volume  This stock has a long ban of resistance going back to 2006 when this stock hit 27 90  where Tuesday s high is  If it extends  it might run up to 31 32  maybe 34  I m not going to predict that  but I will say that on a short term basis it may get to the 30 range 
Cronos Group Inc  NASDAQ CRON  had a big reversal because of the Citron on Thursday  and on Tuesday came back up 1 27  or 13   to 11 15  on 44 million shares  My immediate target is 12 3 4  When it gets through that  you re looking at 14 15 
Stitch Fix  NASDAQ SFIX  was up 2 69  or 6 63   to 43 27  on 3 7 million shares on Tuesday  This stock looks awesome since the breakout and swing trade recommendation at around 30  and has gone up 14 points to 44  That was my secondary target  The next target is 49 50  and then 55 
Tilray Inc  NASDAQ TLRY  can t get much better than this  In three and a half weeks this stock has gone up 200   On Tuesday it was up another 11 81  or 18   to 77 01  on 16 million shares  Is it ahead of itself  It sure is  Is this marijuana stock done  It doesn t look like it  The next target 85 88 going forward

142435,363950,JWN,Retail Rally Comes To A Screeching Halt ,opinion,"Toys R Us refuses to die  The hedge funds that own the debt of the bankrupt toy retailer decided to cancel an auction of assets and instead plan to revive the brand and even open new retail outlets 
The prospects of another Toys R Us revival could become symbolic  the timing coincided with what looks like a top in retail stocks as represented by the SPDR S P Retail ETF  NYSE XRT  

The SPDR S P Retail ETF  XRT  lost 3 3  and confirmed a 50DMA breakdown  XRT finished reversing all the gains from its last breakout and now sits at a 2 month low 
XRT fell 3 3  on high trading volume to close at a 2 month low  The move confirmed the previous day s 50DMA breakdown  The resulting reversal of XRT s last breakout gives the index a very toppy technical pattern  While XRT is back to the consolidation pattern that preceded the breakout  a test of 200DMA support seems highly likely given the intensity of selling  XRT last closed below its 200DMA last November  A 200DMA breakdown would confirm XRT s top 
If I were still playing my 2018 retail recovery thesis  I would have just sold everything here to lock in profits  I would next resolve to wait until holiday season headlines picked up steam for deciding next sector wide moves  For now  I went scrambling for headlines trying to assess whether fundamental events agreed with the bearish technicals  Two other events stand out 
First  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  raised its minimum wage to  15 hour and lobbied Congress to raise the national minimum wage from a paltry  7 25 hour  Wall Street hates sharing profits and wage hikes shift a small amount of the loot from shareholders to workers  Moreover  wage increases translate into cost pressures and margin compression   anathema for stock prices 
Second  Stitch Fix  NASDAQ SFIX   an online retailer which sells customized clothing  was absolutely clobbered after its earnings report completely failed to satisfy investors hopped up on high expectations  The stock closed with a 35 2  loss that is still just a 2 month low  SFIX is a surprisingly sizable component of XRT with a 1  share  The largest holding has a 2 1  share  more on that later  
I have been fascinated by the SFIX story ever since I heard the CEO tell her story  Now I am even more fascinated given the current volatility and a float which is sold 24  short 
Stitch Fix  SFIX  lost a whopping 35 2  post earning but is still up 12 0  for the year  A test of 200DMA support is in play 

Carvana  NYSE CVNA  is the largest holding in XRT with a 2 1  share  This company sells used cars online and delivers them from multi story vending machines  CVNA dropped 5 2  on the day and broke down below its 50DMA  This 2017 IPO is on a tear and is up 185  year to date 
CVNA traded almost down to  8 in 2017  The stock now looks like a short  but short interest is extremely high  I took particular interest in the news events surrounding what looks like a topping pattern in the making around all time highs  a large owner dumped a significant number of shares  an important competitor made a noteworthy financial deal  I first learned about Shift 2 1 2 years ago in an intriguing talk by the CEO Minnie Ingersoll at Stanford University s eCorner   A Drive to Disrupt    and an analyst upgraded CVNA to outperform right into the teeth of the selling with no effect  A complete reversal of post earnings gains would confirm the top 
Carvana  CVNA  lost 5 2  and closed below 50DMA support for the first time since early March  2018 

Surprisingly  Best Buy  NYSE BBY  does not show up in the top 10 holdings for XRT  cut off at 1 4  share of assets   Still  the stock s 4 8  drop and 50DMA breakdown confirmed the weakness in the retail sector  BBY is extremely important to watch here because a test of 200DMA support is in play  BBY last tested its 200DMA in September  2017  BBY last closed below this support in July  2016 

Best Buy  BBY  broke down sharply below 50DMa support and closed at a 2 month low 
Finally  I checked out one of my favorite retail plays  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   JWN sold off with the sector to close right at 50DMA support  The price is still too high for me  but I am a buyer if it manages to return to the extended consolidation period that preceded the impressive August post earnings breakout 

Nordstrom  JWN  lost 3 5  and closed right on top of 50DMA support Now retail has joined forces with other indices like small caps and financials to add weight to the anchor loading down the stock market  AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above 40DMAs  dropped to a 6 month low at 37 2  even as the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   closed flat  still near all time highs  and the volatility index  the VIX  also closed flat  Losing retailers to a fresh sell off like the one in 2017 would make me doubt the underlying health of the consumer and the stock market as a whole given home builders have struggled for most of 2018  Stay tuned 
Be careful out there

142457,363972,JWN,Market Stays Flat As Retail  Oil  Surprise,opinion,"Remember that time is money  He that can earn ten shillings a day by his labour  and goes abroad  or sits idle one half of that day  though he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness  it ought not to be reckoned the only expence  he hath really spent or thrown away five shillings besides  Benjamin Franklin

In one of the first jobs I ever had as a coach  I assisted an excellent head coach  However  the biggest issue with this person was the lack of punctuality  If a practice was supposed to start at x  usually it would not begin until a half hour or hour after that announced time  I am sure you have experienced similar such inconvenience  As one has more responsibility  constraints become more frequent on each day  so associating with people who don t respect your schedule becomes trying at best  and quite irritating at worst  We can also apply this idea to the financial markets as well 
The time value of money is one of the first concepts of finance  A dollar today is worth more than one a year from now  An investment in a portfolio that performs well this year is better than one that performs well next year  Entities that have plans for three and five years from now are better left for venture capital and private equity fields as public investors have very little patience for those time horizons  The idea of opportunity cost also applies as capital allocated to something today which has poor performance could have been in a position which was ok  or even better  outperformed  Over and over  in such a simple form  the value of Franklin s advice becomes wiser by the day 
In the financial markets this week  the biggest story revolved around the Supreme Court decision which struck down the prohibition of sports betting at the Federal level  with the exemption in Nevada   Essentially  this was another version of the conflict between Federal power and States rights which Hamilton and Jefferson made famous  In this instance  Jefferson would be quite pleased  The implications will become evident over time  but for quite a few industries  it could be quite substantial  Obviously  for the casino industry  those entities with properties in many jurisdictions should be helped in terms of attracting more patrons  Anecdotally  a while back we used to own the largest independent sports betting company in Nevada 
We learned quite quickly the sports betting business is not a high margin business  In fact  the sports book really has thin margins  and the parlay piece is where margins are higher  In any event  it will be a nice feature in states where sports betting was not allowed  and if the state next door doesn t  well  that certainly is helpful  The media companies have their thinking caps on about how to incorporate it into their operations  as do the fantasy sports entities  The sports leagues  naturally  want their piece of the pie  and I suspect they might get a little reward  but given their cooperation  or lack thereof  for the last hundred years  I don t think the gaming entities are going to be in a hurry to hand over big licensing fees so quickly  It certainly is something to monitor as the idea Congress can agree to any kind of Federal legislation is far fetched  and that is what will have to happen for the NFL  NBA  and MLB to get a national gaming law  Don t bet on that  anyway 
Elsewhere  the retail sector was a focus as Wal Mart  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  s  and Macy s Inc  NYSE M  all reported this week  The biggest surprise came from Macy s as it really put a shot in the arm to the entire retail space  Quietly  the energy complex is attracting more capital as black gold busted through the 80 dollar a barrel mark  Usually  oil does not do well when interest rates rise  and with the ten year breaking through 3  and holding  many prognosticators think energy will remain unloved if this situation persists  Not so for now  and it bears our attention  as does dollar weakness 
Finally  our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims in the Ante Fe  Texas situation  While the second amendment remains a political battleground  e sports continues to boom  As part of e sports  the video game industry which makes all the popular titles for the gamers  bears some scrutiny in terms of the violence in these games  With their unit volumes soaring each year  perhaps our hard working regulators should take a good hard look at what is in this content  If it can help stop the slaughter of innocent people  especially kids  it certainly is worth the effort  Then again  it would require the pols to get off their patoots and take the time to do so  and we know how valuable time is  just like Franklin told us many years ago

142460,363975,JWN,Is Gap  GPS  Set To Miss Q1 Earnings Estimates ,opinion,"Shares of Gap   NYSE GPS   have climbed 10  over the last four weeks in a sign that investors might be anticipating strong quarterly financial results from the retailer  Let s take a look to see what they should really expect from Gap in the first quarter 
Gap follows a slew of other retail industry giants which have all reported their quarterly earnings results over the last few weeks  including Macy s   NYSE M    Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    J C  Penny   NYSE JCP    and  Kohl s   NYSE KSS    Not all of these companies have performed well following the release of their Q1 earnings  which means Gap could be under even more pressure on Thursday 
With that said  Gap stock has surged 42 5  over the last year as it successfully faces down continued pressure from online sellers such as Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    while also adapting to changing shopping patterns  However  a poor quarter could easily see Gap stock slip at least in the near term 
Gap Q1 Outlook
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Gap s quarterly revenues to climb by 4 9  to touch  3 61 billion  Moving on to the opposite end of the income statement  the company s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to soar by 25  to reach  0 45 per share 
Unfortunately for investors  Gap has experienced some downward earnings estimate revision activity recently  Meanwhile  investors also need to understand what chance Gap has to top our earnings estimate as this could help its stock price climb  especially following its earnings release 
Luckily  Zacks Premium customers can utilize the  in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise  either way 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
In contrast  a stock with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or worse  coupled with a negative Earnings ESP  is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season 
Gap is currently a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and sports an Earnings ESP of  0 37   This means that investors can consider GPS a stock that could fall short of quarterly earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Thursday   
However  it is also worth remembering that the retailer s earnings are still expected to surge by 25  from the year ago period

142486,364001,JWN,After Macy s Crushes Earnings  Should You Buy Nordstrom Stock  ,opinion,"Shares of Macy s   NYSE M   gained more than 11  on Wednesday after the company posted its latest quarterly financial report  surpassing estimates on the top and bottom line and raising its full year earnings guidance  Now  with these impressive results fresh on the minds of investors  the attention will turn to industry rival Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   
Nordstrom s latest results are due out after the closing bell on Thursday  Retail bulls will hope the company can match the remarkable results of Macy s  which saw comps growth of 4 2  and improved its digital sales by double digit percentages 

So what should we expect to see from Nordstrom when it reports on Thursday  Let s take a closer look 
Latest Outlook
According to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates  analysts are calling for Nordstrom to report adjusted earnings of  0 42 per share and total revenue of  3 47 billion  These results would represent year over year growth rates of  2 3  and  5 8   respectively 
It is worth noting that Nordstrom s consensus earnings projection has moved a penny higher over the duration of the quarter  indicating a slightly improved outlook from a few months ago 
Earnings ESP Whispers
Investors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Nordstrom surprises investors with better than anticipated earnings results  For this  we turn to our Earnings ESP figure 
Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Nordstrom is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Hold  and an Earnings ESP of  5 8   This means that the most recent estimates have been higher than the consensus  In other words  our model is suggesting that a beat is likely 
Most Recent Valuation
 
Nordstrom added about 2  on Wednesday  but before the day s gains  it was trading at about 14 4x forward 12 month earnings  This is a slight premium to its industry s average of 13 9x  but well within the range investors have come to expect over the past year and actually cheaper than where the stock has been in recent months 
Surprise History
Another important thing to consider ahead of Nordstrom s report is the company s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices  The retailer actually missed estimates in the previous quarter  but it had a solid streak of positive earnings surprises going before that 
But we like to judge the price effect of earnings announcements by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report  Nordstrom has moved higher in four out of the previous six of these windows 
Bottom Line
Nordstrom is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock that looks even more attractive after the solid report of its top industry rival  Shares are trading at a decent valuation  and recent analyst sentiment has been strong  This should add to the anticipation for the company s report tomorrow

Looking closer at the charts  JWN s price action in has been choppy in 2018  though its 200 day moving average has served as a floor since the stock gapped above this previous layer of resistance in late November  While the security bounced from here on April 19  its short lived mid May pullback was cushioned by the 120 day trendline  Year to date  the shares are currently maintaining a nearly 6  lead 

History suggests this volatility could continue in Friday s trading  Over the past eight quarters  JWN stock has averaged a single day post earnings move of 6 1   with the options market pricing in an even bigger 10 6  swing this time around  regardless of direction  A move of this magnitude to the upside would put Nordstrom stock north of  55 for the first time since December 2016  while a swing to the downside would have the shares testing support at their 200 day trendline 
There s plenty of skepticism being priced into Nordstrom shares ahead of earnings    which could help spark a rally on a positive earnings reaction  While short interest is down 17 3  since mid March  there are still 16 18 million shares dedicated to these bearish bets  This represents 14 1  of the stock s available float  or 10 2 times its average daily pace of trading 
Elsewhere  11 of 13 analysts covering the retail stock maintain a  hold  or  sell  rating  and the average 12 month price target of  51 19 is roughly in line with the equity s current perch  This leaves room for a round of upgrades and or price target hikes should JWN stock rise in the session immediately after earnings    just as its done in five of the last eight quarters ",2018-05-17,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/macys-gives-nordstrom-stock-a-lift-ahead-of-earnings-200316838,200316838

142516,364031,JWN,Should You Buy Macy s  M  Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Macy s   NYSE M   are up 11  over the last 12 weeks as the department store giant continues to impress investors after an extended downturn had many worried that its better days were long gone  With that said  things can change quickly  so investors need to know how Macy s is expected to perform in the first quarter 
Macy s reported relatively solid fourth quarter sales  up 1 8  from the year ago period  The company s earnings surged 39 6  to  2 82 per share  Macy s also once again proved its commitment to improving online sales  reporting its 34th consecutive quarter of double digit digital sales growth   We head into 2018 with an improved base business  healthy inventories  a focused and engaged organization and a clear path to return Macy s to growth   CEO Jeff Gennette said in a statement last quarter 
But that was last quarter  meanwhile  Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and other online sellers have only gotten bigger  So let s take a look at Macy s current first quarter outlook and some other key metrics ahead of the retail bellwether s Q1 earnings report on Wednesday  May 16 
Latest Outlook   Valuation
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Macy s to report Q1 revenues of  5 43 billion  which would mark a 1 7  climb from the year ago period  At the other end of the income statement  Macy s is expected to see its quarterly earnings skyrocket by 50  to hit  0 36 per share 
Of course  top and bottom line growth estimates are just two of the many things investors will be concerned with when Macy s reports  We can also turn to our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file to help prepare 
The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non financial metrics reported by companies  The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts 
According to these consensus estimates  Macy s comparable store sales are expected to dip marginally  or 0 01   This is something investors need to take into consideration as comp sales are hugely important for retail businesses and often help encapsulate the overall health of the company 
Another important factor to consider is Macy s current valuation and how it stacks up not just against its peers  but itself  Heading into Friday  Macy s was trading with a Forward P E of 8 4  which marked a discount compared to the  Retail   Regional Department Stores  industry s average of 10 1  The company also presents far better value than it did at the start of March when it traded at 10 6x forward earnings  This is also impressive considering that Macy s has seen its stock price climb over that period 
Earnings ESP Whispers
Investors will also want to understand what chance Macy s has to surprise investors with better than expected earnings results  For this  we turn to our Earnings ESP figure 
Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago

In contrast  a stock with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or worse  coupled with a negative Earnings ESP  is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season 
The company s Most Accurate Estimate the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment calls for earnings of  0 34 per share  which is 2 cents worse than our current consensus estimate  Macy s is also currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and sports an Earnings ESP of  5 01   Therefore  M is a stock that could fall short of our quarterly earnings estimate 
Surprise History
The department store s earnings surprise history and the effect that these surprises have had on its share prices are two other important factors to consider ahead of Macy s earnings report Macy s  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   We can see that Macy s has posted strong earnings results recently  topping quarterly estimates in six of the trailing eight periods  Furthermore  these beats have also led to positive momentum immediately following Macy s quarterly earnings release  We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report  Macy s stock has turned positive in five out of these last eight windows

142517,364032,JWN,Can Retail Stocks Maintain Their Momentum ,opinion,"The earnings focus shifts to the Retail sector this week as traditional brick and mortar retailers come out with quarterly results  Stocks of most of these traditional operators have done better than the broader markets this year  except for Wal Mart  NYSE WMT     which reports before the market s open on Thursday and whose stock has been a notable laggard since the company s last earnings release back in mid February  The company s recent big Indian purchase has failed to reverse the stock s underperformance  with the stock now down  14 8  in the year to date period In total  we have 125 companies on deck to come out with Q1 results  including 10 S P 500 members  Macy s     Nordstrom  NYSE JWN      Wal Mart    and Home Depot  NYSE HD     are major retailers reporting results this week  with Cisco    and Deere   Company  NYSE DE     as the other notable reports Macy s  Nordstrom and other department store stocks have been strong performers this year  with Macy s up  18 7  and Nordstrom up  3 5  in the year to date period  doing better than the S P 500 s  2 5  gain  Driving this recent momentum is the market s optimism about these companies  restructuring and competitive repositioning  with Macy s actively bringing down its physical footprint and investing in its digital platform  We will see if either Macy s or Nordstrom can sustain these gains after they come out with results in the next few days   The Zacks Retail sector is up  7  in the year to date period  doing better than the broader market  Helping the sector s recent outperformance is the aforementioned positive momentum in the stock prices of Macy s and other traditional retailers  But we should keep in mind that the Zacks Retail sector also includes online vendors like Amazon    in addition to traditional brick and mortar operators You can clearly see this dynamic at play in the year to date chart below plotting Macy s  blue line  against the Zacks Retail sector  red line  and Amazon  green line  

The recent momentum in these traditional retail stocks notwithstanding  the group remains on a long term downtrend  as you can see in the chart below 

The only difference between this chart and the earlier one is time   this chart represents a 5 year period while the earlier one represents the year to date period  As you can see  Macy s shares are down  25  over this longer time horizon There is another very interesting aspect to this chart as well  The blue  Macy s  and green  Amazon  lines moving in lock step with each other in the earlier part of the chart   through July 17  2015 to be precise  In other words  what seem such obvious existential secular headwinds facing Macy s and its peers at present are only so with the benefit of hindsight  the market had no idea what lay ahead for Macy s and its peers prior to that July day in 2015 The takeaway from this discussion is that many trends that appear crystal clear in retrospect are anything but that in real time What s the significance of that date in July 2015  Amazon held its first Prime Day on July 15th to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its founding  which it claimed turned out to be bigger than Black Friday  As you can see in the chart above  the world has never been the same since that day  particularly for Macy s and its department store peers Retail Sector Scorecard We now have Q1 results from 50  of the retailers in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these Retail sector companies that have reported results already are up  26 1  from the same period last year on  14 9  higher revenues  with 68 4  beating EPS estimates and 63 2  beating revenue estimates The comparison charts below put the sector s Q1 results in a historical context 

The Retail sector results thus far are from the online vendors and restaurant players  with  traditional  operators starting to report only this week  The comparison charts above show that while growth  both earnings as well as revenues  is tracking notably above historical periods  the proportion of positive surprises is on the weak side With respect to growth  Amazon s blockbuster numbers  particularly on the revenues front  has a big role in the very strong growth picture at this stage  Amazon s Q1 earnings increased  125  on  42 9  higher revenues  with the net dollar increase in the online retailer s revenues an impressive  15 3 billion The comparison charts below try to look at the sector s growth picture with and without the Amazon contribution 

As you can see in the right hand chart above  Q1 growth is still tracking above historical periods  but the growth rate is a lot lower on an ex Amazon basis   Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of Friday  May 11th For the S P 500 index as a whole  we now have Q1 results from 455 index members  Total earnings for the 455 index members that have reported results already are up  24 4  from the same period last year on  9 4  higher revenues  with 77 6  beating EPS estimates and 75 2  beating revenue estimates  The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62 9  To put these results in a historical context  the charts below compare the results thus far with what we had seen from the same group of 455 index members in other recent periods 

Earnings and revenue growth rate and the proportion of positive EPS surprises is tracking above what we have been seeing from the same group of 455 index members  But revenue surprises are tracking modestly below the preceding earnings season  but remain above historical periods What s Happening to 2018 Q2 Estimates The chart below plots the evolution of earnings growth expectations for the current period  As you can see  there has been no incremental improvement in the earnings outlook relative to what was expected ahead of the start of this earnings season 

A big part of the positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season reflected the direct impact of the tax law changes  which was obviously a one off development  Had all positive revisions been a result of tax law changes  we would have seen only EPS estimates go up  with no changes to revenue estimates  But that wasn t the case  as revenue estimates had gone up as well  which raised our hopes that the aggregate revisions trend had finally turned positive after many years being in the other direction Disappointingly  we are not seeing that with estimates for Q2  as the above chart shows  In other words  the growth picture coming out of this earnings season is very impressive  but there is no improvement in expectations for the current and coming quarters  The recent uptrend in the exchange value of the U S  dollar and questions about global growth will likely serve as incremental negatives for folks like us monitoring the aggregate revisions trend This flat aggregate revisions trend notwithstanding  June quarter estimates have actually modestly ticked down for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors and gone up for 4 sectors  The sectors enjoying positive revisions in the aggregate include Technology  Industrial Products  Basic Materials and Retail Note  Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department  He is an acknowledged earnings expert whose commentaries and analyses appear on Zacks com and in the print and electronic media  His weekly earnings related articles include  and Earnings Preview  He manages the  and  portfolios and writes the  article for  subscribers Here is a list of the 126 companies including 10 S P 500 and reporting this week ",2018-05-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-retail-stocks-maintain-their-momentum-200315660,200315660

retailers come out with quarterly results  Stocks of most of these traditional operators have done better than the broader markets this year  except for Wal Mart which reports before the market s open on Thursday and whose stock has been a notable laggard since the company s last earnings release back in mid February  The company s recent big Indian purchase has failed to reverse the stock s underperformance  with the stock now down  14 8  in the year to date period In total  we have 125 companies on deck to come out with Q1 results  including 10 S P 500 members  Macy s and Wal Mart are major retailers reporting results this week  with Cisco as another notable reports Macy s  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  and other department store stocks have been strong performers this year  with Macy s up  18 7  and Nordstrom up  3 5  in the year to date period  doing better than the S P 500 s  2 5  gain  Driving this recent momentum is the market s optimism about these companies  restructuring and

come out with results in the next few days   The Zacks Retail sector is up  7  in the year to date period  doing better than the broader market  Helping the sector s recent outperformance is the

addition to traditional brick and mortar operators The recent momentum in these traditional retail stocks notwithstanding  the group remains on a long term downtrend  Macy s shares are down  25  over this longer time horizon There is another very interesting aspect to this chart as well  The blue  Macy s  and green  Amazon  lines moving in lock step with each other in the earlier part of the chart   through July 17  2015 to be precise  In other words  what seem such obvious existential secular headwinds facing Macy s and its peers at present are only so with the benefit of hindsight  the market had no idea what lay ahead for Macy s and its peers prior to that July day in 2015 The takeaway from this discussion is that many trends that appear crystal clear in retrospect are anything but that in real time What s the significance of that date in July 2015  Amazon held its first Prime Day on July 15th to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its founding  which it claimed turned out to be bigger than Black Friday  As you can see in the chart above  the world has never been the same since that day  particularly for Macy s and its department store peers Retail Sector ScorecardWe now have Q1

142519,364034,JWN,Is Walmart  WMT  Set To Beat Q1 Earnings Estimates This Week ,opinion,"Shares of Walmart   NYSE WMT   opened higher on Monday as investors assess how the retail powerhouse might perform in the first quarter  With that said  let s take a look at some of Walmart s latest Q1 estimates to see what investors should really expect from Walmart s Q1 financial results during a big week for retailers Walmart stock is up 9  over the last year  but its shares have fallen 19  during the last 12 weeks  The recent downturn comes after the company reported relatively solid fourth quarter results  Much of the concern likely comes from Walmart s e commerce sales  which slowed in Q4 after a sustained stretch of massive growth 
Walmart s e commerce sales still surged over 20  from the year ago period  but as Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and other online sellers continue to expand  investors have become increasingly worried about the long term growth prospects of big box powers  This means that Walmart will likely have to report strong top and bottom line numbers on Thursday in order to impress investors 
Walmart Q1 Outlook
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Walmart s quarterly revenues to climb by 2 2  to reach  120 13 billion  On the other end of the income statement  the retailer s Q1 earnings are projected to surge 13  to reach  1 13 per share 
Moving on  investors will also want to understand what chance Walmart has to top our earnings estimate as this can often lead to positive stock price movement in the near term  Luckily  Zacks Premium customers can utilize the  in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise  either way 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
In contrast  a stock with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or worse  coupled with a negative Earnings ESP  is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season 
Walmart s Most Accurate Estimate the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment calls for earnings of  1 14 per share  which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate  The company is also currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and sports an Earnings ESP of 0 77  
Therefore  investors should consider Walmart a stock that could top quarterly earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results before the market opens on Thursday 
Other retail giants  including Macy s   NYSE M    J  C  Penney   NYSE JCP    and Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   also report their quarterly earnings result this week  So make sure to come back here for complete breakdowns

142526,364041,JWN,The Week Ahead  5 Things to Watch on the Economic Calendar,news,"Investing com   The outcome of Sunday s closely watched French presidential election is likely to set the tone for global financial markets this week 
Elsewhere  key U S  economic data could provide further evidence if the world s largest economy is strong enough to withstand a rate hike as early as next month  with Friday s retail sales and inflation reports in the spotlight 
Meanwhile  China is to release monthly trade and inflation data amid renewed concern over the health of the world s second biggest economy 
Investors will also focus on monetary policy decisions due in the U K  and New Zealand 
Ahead of the coming week  Investing com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets 
1  French Presidential Election
The second round of the French Presidential Election between pro European Union centrist Emmanuel Macron and anti EU  anti immigration far rightist Marine Le Pen win will be held on Sunday 
Some 67 000 polling stations opened at 8 00AM in Paris  6 00GMT   Pollsters will publish initial estimates at 8 00PM  18 00GMT   once all polling stations are closed 
Surveys on Friday showed Macron ahead by 62  to 38   but investors are wary of opinion polls after recent political shocks such as Donald Trump s election to the White House and Britain s decision last year to leave the EU 
The expected victory of Macron would be taken by markets as a sign that political risk in Europe is receding and could be a positive for the euro and European stocks 
A surprise win for Le Pen would raise the risk that the euro zone s number two economy could abandon the single currency and even leave the EU  which could increase volatility in financial markets  particularly in European equities  bonds  and currencies 
Besides the French election  there will also be German  French and Italian industrial production data  All are expected to show growth  adding to evidence that the euro zone s economy is gaining momentum 
2  U S  April Retail Sales

	The epic comeback included a 3 26   or approximately 228 point  surge for the NASDAQ to 7 220 5  The Dow jumped 2 84   or 669 points  to 24 202 6  while the S P advanced 2 72  to 2 658 6  Now that s a great start to the week and the market really needed it 
	Investors applauded news that the U S  and China were open to figuring out a way to resolve their trade problems without resorting to a trade war  Plus  the market was primed to get back some ground lost during last week s sharp pullback  The reason for the positive tone today was because there was no new tariff shouting and the trade war idea was talked back a bit by the White House  Trump doesn t want to screw up the stock market  so it makes sense to pull back a bit   said Jeremy Mullin in Counterstrike   The thought today is Trump is just negotiating and when China gives us a little  the Tariffs will go away  Hopefully that s the case   In the portfolios  TAZR Trader added more to an existing position that s facing a lot of public scrutiny right now  but should eventually be able to weather the storm and move higher  Black Box Trader replaced three names in its weekly adjustment and one of them brought a double digit gain to the portfolio  Read the highlights section below for more on these moves Today s Portfolio Highlights TAZR Trader  The FTC has opened a formal investigation into the privacy practices of Facebook  NASDAQ FB  but Kevin isn t overly concerned  The social media platform is already taking steps to improve its user safety features  Plus  the company should be able to weather any punitive actions  including a billion dollar fine  Therefore  the editor added 5  to the portfolio s FB position while its still at a bargain price  Learn a lot more about this move in the complete commentary

	 I point this out because the tariff talk in the media doesn t match the actual news on the ground  And too many people are getting spooked out of the market due to the knee jerk  over sensationalized  reporting  on this topic and others in a desperate attempt to explain the market s pullback  But they keep getting it wrong 
	 So yes  the market has a right to be concerned about the impact of tariffs  But the word  trade war  was being bandied about recklessly and only served to create unnecessary panic  We will have to see how the tariffs play out  But I contend the correction taking place is normal market behavior

Just last week  Macy s   NYSE M   posted solid fourth quarter 2017 results that marked the company s first quarterly sales growth in   Shares of Macy s have climbed since then as part of a larger turnaround backed by renewed investor confidence

Restoration Hardware is expected to see its quarterly earnings hit  1 56 per share  which would mark 129  growth from the year ago period  But what are the chances the company actually beats this estimate  To answer that  we ll need to take a closer look 
Luckily  Zacks Premium customers can utilize the  in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat  Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Restoration Hardware is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports an  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system  Coupled with its Earnings ESP of 1 77   which means earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead of RH s Q4 results  investors should consider the stock as one that could easily beat our consensus mark

142685,364200,JWN,Is Nautilus Group  NLS  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Nautilus Group  Inc    NYSE NLS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Nautilus Group has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 1x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Nautilus Group s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 8 6  This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  has a forward PE  ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 8  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Nautilus Group stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Nautilus Group has a P S ratio of about 1  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  NLS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Nautilus Group currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20   of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Nautilus Group a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Nautilus Group might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of A  This gives NLS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days  while the next year estimate has seen one down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 7 7  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched lower by 0 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Nautilus Group  Inc   The  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNautilus Group is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 27  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-03-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-nautilus-group-nls-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200296704,200296704

142755,364270,JWN,Key Predictions For Q3 Earnings Reports Of JWN  M  KSS,opinion,It is almost time to bid adieu to the third quarter earnings season  As we near the end  we have results on the board from a large chunk of S P 500 members with only about 15   or 94  of Index members left to their quarterly numbers  While most sectors are nearly through with the quarter s reporting cycle  the  still has a considerable chunk of reports to come  Incidentally  our focus in the article will also be upon Retail stocks that are slated to report earnings on Nov 9 Q3 Earnings ScorecardPer the  dated Nov 3  about 406 of the S P 500 members have reported results so far  representing 85 4  of the Index s total market capitalization  Of the 406 S P 500 members that reported their quarterly numbers  approximately 73 9  delivered positive earnings surprises  while 66 7  beat top line expectations  Total earnings for these companies were up 7 5   on 6 3  revenue growth Key takeaways from the results so far point to clear revenue momentum as top line growth has been accelerating compared with other recent periods  Further  the quarter has seen an above average proportion of positive surprises  reflecting the carry forward of momentum from the preceding quarter  Thirdly  we have seen a favorable trend of estimate revisions for the December quarter  which is different from the pattern witnessed in the last few periods where estimates for the following quarter generally start to decline as the current quarter progresses Coming to expectations  S P 500 companies are expected to report earnings growth of 6 5  year over year  with a 5 6  jump in revenues  Thus  the overall picture looks favorable for this reporting cycle A Look at Retail SectorThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors  While results for the Finance sector have been below average  this earnings season is turning out to be a good one for the Industrial Products  Technology  Construction and Medical sectors As stated earlier  we are yet to see a sizable chunk of earnings to be released from retailers  Per the latest report  earnings for the Retail Wholesale sector on the whole are expected to improve 0 1   with revenue growth of 6 2   The Retail Wholesale Staples sector is currently ranked among the bottom of the 16 Zacks sectors  A close look at the sector reveals that retailers continue to bear the brunt of the current challenging retail environment  This can be accountable to sluggish mall traffic  volatile consumer spending and increased competition from online players  Further  these retailers are heavily investing in e commerce and omni channel functionalities  which are likely to weigh on margins at least in the near term However  we note that the Retail Wholesale sector has grown 22 9  year to date  outperforming the S P 500 market s jump of 16 1  What Awaits JWN  M  KSS in Q3 Well our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive   the chance of a positive earnings surprise is high  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  So  let s see what awaits the following Retail stocks that are queued up for earnings releases on Nov 9 We are not confident of an earnings beat for the Seattle  WA based Nordstrom Inc    NYSE JWN   in the third quarter fiscal 2017  This is because the company currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 00  with both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at 63 cents per share  alongside a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  Nordstrom s shares have lost 18 3  in the last three months  wider than the  s decline of 2 2   The downturn was owing to the temporary call off of the Nordstrom family s plans to take the company private However  we laud Nordstrom s positive earnings surprise trend and remain optimistic on the company s cost saving initiatives  store expansion efforts and progress on 2020 strategy  Though the company s growth strategy bodes well  investments related to occupancy  technology  supply chain and marketing are likely to weigh upon its near term cost and margins performance  Evidently  its merchandise performance was hurt by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores in the previous quarter  Moreover  for fiscal 2017  management anticipates Retail gross profit to be impacted by higher new store occupancy expenses and mix impact from off price growth Further  the company s projections for SG A expenses incorporates higher technology and supply chain expenses related to its growth initiatives  offset by progress in productivity improvements  Given the margin pressures  it is unlikely to predict the outcome of the upcoming quarter results   Read more   Moving to Macy s Inc    NYSE M    we are not very optimistic about this department store chain retailer that has delivered an average trailing four quarter negative surprise of 19 9   Macy s has an Earnings ESP of  32 09  as the Most Accurate Estimate of 13 cents is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents  Moreover  it currently carries a

and has recently announced the restructuring of merchandising operations  These seem inevitable given the challenging retail landscape  aggressive pricing strategy  waning mall traffic and increased online competition that have been weighing on Macy s performance  The company s dwindling top and bottom line results is the reflection of the same  Further  the company expects comps on an owned plus licensed basis to decline approximately 2 5  in the third quarter  Given this background  we remain skeptical of Macy s performance in the third quarter   Read more   Finally  let s assess the earnings beat criteria for Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS    a U S  based department store chain that operates specialty department stores and an e commerce site    in the United States  While the company currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  our earnings beat criteria was let down by its Earnings ESP of 0 00   Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter fiscal 2017 are currently pegged at 71 cents per share We note that the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 18   However  Kohl s has been struggling with weak comps and a difficult retail sales scenario for the last few quarters  This indicates that the company s  Greatness Agenda   which was designed to increase transactions per store  has been failing to deliver adequate results  The consensus mark for the third quarter projects flat comps compared with the prior year quarter Nevertheless  Kohl s has been undertaking initiatives to boost store performance  Since October  the company has started offering more outside famous brands  while cutting down sales of in house clothing brands  Kohl s stores have begun accepting returns from Amazon com s   NASDAQ AMZN   customers on select products in 82 of its U S  store locations  Additionally  we expect Kohl s third quarter performance to benefit from surging e commerce business Notably  these endeavors have helped Kohl s shares gain 2 2  in the past six months  as against the industry s decline of 21 7   Let s see if such efforts will enable Kohl s to overcome these hurdles in the third quarter   Read more   Wall Street s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of

142756,364271,JWN,A Light At The End Of The Tunnel For Retail Companies ,opinion,"This weekend  I strolled around one of my local malls 
I know  it was a very  retro  thing to do  If I d had on skinny jeans  worn Warby Parker glasses and sported a beard  I d have felt like a true hipster 
But alas  I was bored and driven by a morbid curiosity to see how bad it had gotten 
Like a growing number of Americans  I abandoned mall shopping years ago  This is why enclosed malls and department stores have struggled 
Not surprisingly  the crowd was sparse 
The number of vacant storefronts with security gates lowered had grown since my last visit  All those dark spaces made the mall feel gloomy  even with holiday decorations popping up 
Every place touted discounts  And even the shelves in the high end retailers were stickered with markdowns of 40  or more 
The retail apocalypse has taken its toll 
This paints a depressing picture of the retail industry  But the reality might be much more upbeat  At least one important signal is showing record optimism 
A Scorched Earth Revival 
Over the last couple of years  retailers have received large lumps of coal in their stockings    and their investors have struggled 
It s been a dark time for brick and mortar retailers as the rapid rise of e commerce and mobile commerce has picked their pockets 
Shares of Macy s Inc  NYSE M  set a new 52 week low on Monday  And they re down nearly 50  so far in 2017   

Shares of JC Penney Company Inc Holding  NYSE JCP  have performed even more poorly  Meanwhile  shares of Nordstrom  NYSE  NYSE JWN   Sears Holdings Corporation  NASDAQ SHLD  and Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  have slid by double digits 
At the other end of the spectrum  shares of retail disruptors such as Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  have surged to unprecedented heights   

eBay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY  shares are up 25  in 2017    That s far better than the brick and mortar retailers  but half the gain of Amazon and well behind the performance of Overstock com  NASDAQ OSTK  and Wayfair Inc  NYSE W  
So  as brick and mortar retailers have shuttered hundreds of locations and teetered on the brink of bankruptcy  e commerce companies have soared 
But I think the scorched earth retail landscape holds some real opportunities this holiday season  And that s because there s a glimmer of hope    a light at the end of the tunnel 
Retail s Record Gamble
Retail accounts for 1 in 4 U S  jobs 
The sector accounts for  2 6 trillion of the nation s GDP  And it s one of the best barometers of the state of the economy 
The latest survey from the National Retail Federation predicts that 2017 should be a busier holiday season  with spending rising between 3 6  and 4   That puts total U S  spending between  678 8 billion and  682 billion 
That would be a record  But total U S  holiday spending has set a new record every year since 2010 

More importantly  if the projected growth goes to 3 8   it would be higher than last year s 3 6   And it would be the biggest year over year increase in spending since 2014 
Plus  retailers are apparently anticipating a surge in shopping 
During the summer  they imported goods at a record pace 
In July and August  the number of twenty foot equivalent units  TEU  a measure of shipping volume  at ports set back to back records  The record highs in this important indicator are providing much needed good news to the retail sector 

And in August  the number of import TEUs was up 5 6  year over year 
In September and October  port deliveries eased   as they seasonally do   but they were still at elevated levels  In October  the number of import TEUs was up 2 99  
So the mood has shifted in this area of the market 
There s been a tremendous buildup of inventories heading into the holiday season  Of course  cargo containers don t instantly equate to sales  But retailers   both brick and mortar stores and online disruptors   are expecting a merrier than normal Christmas 
That means investors need to start acting on their retail stock wish list now  before those record volumes of cargoes are converted into revenues   and shares start to soar ",2017-11-09,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-for-retail-companies-200263670,200263670

Bloomberg writers Matt Townsend  Jenny Surane  Emma Orr and Christopher Cannon claim America s  Retail Apocalypse  Is Really Just Beginning 
Delinquent Loans

Problem is Debt
Don t blame this on Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   The authors note the  root cause is that many of these long standing chains are overloaded with debt often from leveraged buyouts led by private equity firms  There are billions in borrowings on the balance sheets of troubled retailers  and sustaining that load is only going to become harder even for healthy chains  
Actually  the root cause is the Fed cheapening money and making all this building and junk loans possible 
Regardless of the reason  an explosive amount of debt is coming due in the next five years just as credit markets are starting to tighten 
Too Late to Party
One testament to that negativity on retail came earlier this year when Nordstrom s  NYSE JWN  founding family tried to take the department store chain private  They eventually gave up because lenders were asking for 13 percent interest  about twice the typical rate for retailers 
Concentration of Retail Jobs

The report concludes  A pall has been cast on retail   said Charlie O Shea  a retail analyst for Moody s   A day of reckoning is coming  
Here are some charts I created on Fred to consider 
All Employees Retail Trade

Department Store Employees

 Average Weekly Hours Retail Trade

Nonstore Retail Employees

Day of Reckoning
Yes indeed  a  day of reckoning  is coming and it s not just retail 
The day of reckoning includes a stock market bubble  a junk bond bubble  real estate bubbles  a public union pension bubble  and far down on the list of importance  a bitcoin bubble 
Deflationary Trends
These are extremely deflationary trends  So is the demographic setup  so is debt in general  so are all all of the bubbles mentioned above  Also note that the coming revolution in self driving vehicles will put millions of drive for a living employees out of a job 
I confidently conclude another major round of deflation is coming up  Curiously  the Fed  central banks in general  fueled this very result with their deflation fighting tactics 
BIS Deflation Study
The BIS did a historical study and found routine deflation was not any problem at all 
 Deflation may actually boost output  Lower prices increase real incomes and wealth  And they may also make export goods more competitive   stated the study 
It s asset bubble deflation that is damaging  When asset bubbles burst  debt deflation results 
Central banks  seriously misguided attempts to defeat routine consumer price deflation is what fuels the destructive asset bubbles that eventually collapse ",2017-11-10,Mike (Mish) Shedlock,https://www.investing.com/analysis/retail-apocalypse-deflationary-collapse-200263894,200263894

142776,364291,JWN,Strong U S  retail sales  consumer sentiment data buoy economic outlook,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  retail sales in April recorded their biggest increase in a year as Americans stepped up purchases of automobiles and a range of other goods  suggesting the economy was regaining momentum after growth almost stalled in the first quarter 
The jump in sales reported by the Commerce Department on Friday is a boost for the sector that has been hit by sluggish demand  It comes days after major retailers  including Macy s  NYSE M  and Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   reported sales tumbled in the first quarter and lowered their full year profit forecasts 
 Reports of the consumers  demise appear to be premature   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania 
Retail sales surged 1 3 percent in April  the largest gain since March 2015  after dropping 0 3 percent the prior month  Excluding automobiles  gasoline  building materials and food services  retail sales shot up 0 9 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0 2 percent gain in March 
These so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product 
Core retail sales were previously reported to have gained 0 1 percent in March  Economists had forecast retail sales rising 0 8 percent and core retail sales gaining 0 3 percent last month 
Though the signs of an acceleration in consumer spending will be welcomed by Federal Reserve officials  they are probably insufficient for the U S  central bank to raise interest rates next month as inflation remains tame 
A second report from the Labor Department showed its producer price index climbed 0 2 percent last month after slipping 0 1 percent in March  In the 12 months through April  the PPI was unchanged after dipping 0 1 percent in March 
Inflation continues to be restrained by the lingering effects of the dollar s surge and oil price plunge 
 Today s data materially strengthen the hand of those within the Fed for a rate increase in June but we remain doubtful as to whether this view will prevail  barring an especially robust employment report in early June   said Anthony Karydakis  chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York 
The dollar rose to a two week high against a basket of currencies  Prices for U S  government debt were trading higher  while stocks on Wall Street fell marginally 
UPBEAT CONSUMERS
Prospects for consumer spending got a boost from a third report showing sentiment among households jumped to an 11 month high in early May  driven by steadily rising incomes  better employment prospects and low inflation 
The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index surged 6 8 points to 95 8 early this month  the highest reading since June  Sentiment increased among all income and age groups  with big gains among lower income and younger households 
As a result of last month s strong core retail sales increase  the Atlanta Fed raised its fourth quarter GDP growth estimate to a 2 8 percent annualized rate from 2 2 percent 
Economic growth braked to a 0 5 percent pace in the first three months of 2016 after expanding at a 1 4 percent pace in the fourth quarter 
But data on construction spending and factory orders  as well as a fourth report on business inventories from the Commerce Department on Friday  suggested the first quarter GDP growth estimate would be raised to a 1 2 percent rate when the government publishes its revision later this month 
Retail sales have been sluggish in part because the firming labor market has not generated strong wage growth  Some of the savings from cheaper gasoline over the past year and a half have been absorbed by rising rents and medical care costs 
Macy s  the largest department chain  said this week same store sales fell 5 6 percent in the first quarter  and it expected full year sales to decline 3 4 percent 
Nordstrom reported that sales at stores open at least a year fell 1 7 percent in the first quarter  It cut its profit forecast for the year to  2 50  2 70 per share from  3 10  3 35 
 Today s report raised some eyebrows given the string of negative commentary from retailers  but that juxtaposition is a useful reminder that publicly traded corporations account for a minority of economic activity in the U S    said Michael Feroli  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York 
The Commerce Department report showed retail sales in April rose across all categories  with the exception of building materials and garden equipment  Auto sales posted their largest gain in 13 months after slumping in March  Sales at clothing stores increased by the most since May 2015 

Online retailers reported the biggest sales gain since June 2014  Consumers also spent on sporting goods and hobbies  electronics and appliances  and they visited restaurants and bars  Building materials and garden equipment sales  however  recorded their biggest drop since August ",2016-05-13,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/strong-u.s.-retail-sales,-consumer-sentiment-data-buoy-economic-outlook-401873",401873

142780,364295,JWN,Walmart Is Reportedly Partnering With Lord   Taylor To Create An Online Mall,opinion,"According to a new report from   retail giant Walmart   NYSE WMT   is nearing a deal that will see department store Lord   Taylor begin selling its goods and products on Walmart com 
Citing people familiar with the matter  the WSJ said that this partnership would create a type of  online mall that shoppers could access from Walmart s website   Competitors like Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN   and even Alibaba   NYSE BABA   offer retailers dedicated spaces like this to brands on their sites  which allow for both an increase in traffic to e commerce platforms and boost retailers  online inventory 
Lord   Taylor  part of Canada s Hudson Bay portfolio  which also owns high end department store Saks Fifth Avenue  attracts a similar customer as Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   or Macy s owned   NYSE M   Bloomingdale s  While one might not necessarily think of Walmart and Lord   Taylor fitting together  Walmart s e commerce head Marc Lore has been working tirelessly to build a more upper end reputation for Walmart com 
Just look at the company s most recent digital acquisitions  and you ll notice a major shift in Walmart s e commerce direction  From Bonobos and ModCloth to Moosejaw  Shoebuy  and Jet com  Walmart s online division is undoubtedly moving more upscale 
There will no doubt be some major hurdles to overcome if the deal goes through  For instance  Lord   Taylor s core customer skews much older and more suburban than Walmart s recent acquisitions  which targeted a more urban  millennial consumer 
But Lord   Taylor could also welcome this partnership as a way to compete against Amazon  especially as a way to stay afloat in the crowded e commerce space  If getting helped by America s largest brick and mortar retailer and Amazon s biggest rival is the catch  then so be it 
The WSJ noted that Lord   Taylor will continue to operate online  but shoppers of lordandtaylor com will now be able to pick up and return items and Walmart s 4 700 U S  retail stores

Yesterday  Citi Research downgraded Macy s   NYSE M   and JCPenney   NYSE JCP   to  Sell  from  Neutral   alluding to a less than positive holiday season for retailers in the struggling department store space 
Analyst Paul Lejuez said that Macy s in particular  no longer makes much money as a retailer   and  has  not  found the right tools  to evade a steady decline  JCPenney s rating was cut on the heels of weak updated guidance  while the company blamed heavy discounting ahead of the holiday shopping period 
As a result  a domino effect occurred  sending shares of Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    Kohl s   NYSE KSS    and Dillard s   NYSE DSS   downwards  Even retail sector ETFs like the SPDR S P Retail  MX XRT  ETF  and the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF   V RTH   were down 
But this impact is nothing new  and it s time these department stores break this vicious cycle 
How can companies like Macy s stand out from its peers  What can it do differently  And most importantly  how can it make shopping an event again 
With Nordstrom and even Sears implementing innovative strategies  stores like Macy s and JCPenney must try something to stay in the game

142793,364308,JWN,Wall Street tries to recover as inflation pressures Fed,news,"Investing com   Though U S  stocks began Friday by following the global downturn in stocks  they begin to recover territory just before midday on Wall Street  in a session where U S  inflation racked up its largest rise in four and a half years and oil continued to move to the downside 
In a session with a sparse economic calendar  investors focused on the U S  Commerce Department s consumer price index  CPI  that showed inflation registered its largest gain in four and half years 
The that consumer prices remained flat from a month earlier in January  compared to expectations for decline of 0 1  
Year over year  consumer prices were 1 4  higher from the same month a year earlier  above expectations for a 1 3  increase and after having risen 0 7  in December 
Consumer prices  excluding food and energy costs  increased by a seasonally adjusted 0 3   above forecasts for a gain of 0 2   This same measure had also risen 0 2  in December 
Core CPI increased at annualized rate of 2 2  last month  slightly above expectations for a 2 1  rise 
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve  Fed  as a better gauge of longer term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories  The central bank usually tries to aim for 2  core inflation or less 
This firming of the inflation data could add to the likelihood that the Fed will hike interest rates this year 
Indeed  Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester reiterated her outlook that the US economy would improve and the normalization of monetary policy would be gradual this year depending on the data 
 Thus  the actual path normalization takes could very well turn out to be either less gradual or more gradual than what we anticipate it to be today   she said in a speech delivered in Florida 
The Fed s next policy decision meeting will take place on March 15 and 16 and will be accompanied by updated forecasts from its members as well as a posterior press conference with Fed Chair Janet Yellen

142833,364348,JWN,Should Value Investors Consider Nordstrom  JWN  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Nordstrom  Inc    NYSE JWN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Nordstrom has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 3  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Nordstrom s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 16 6  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 27 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Nordstrom has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 1  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Nordstrom s P CF ratio of 7 2 is higher than the industry average of 5 8  which indicates that the stock is somewhat overvalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Nordstrom currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes JWN a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Nordstrom might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A  This gives JWN a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days and three lower  while the full year estimate has seen five upward and one downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 1 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Nordstrom  Inc  Price and Consensus    Even though Nordstrom has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNordstrom is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 42  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5

believes these overhangs are overblown and provide an attractive entry point in the stock The analyst sees several catalysts ahead in the technology fiber optic and 5G buildout  FirstNet  and a rebound in pipeline transmission projects  These could all contribute to better than expected earnings growth into 2018  Finally  the Deutsche Bank view is that MTZ shares carry a 2 1 positive risk

142836,364351,JWN,Nordstrom Stock Shares Soar On Going Private Speculation,opinion,"Nordstrom  Inc   NYSE  NYSE JWN 
Shortly after the market closed for trading on Tuesday September 12th   Nordstrom released a statement indicating that the family is nearing a deal to be taken private and no longer be a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange 
As soon as it was released shares soared higher closing in the after hour session up nearly 10  at  49 50 which was up  4 45 in the after hour period  During the regular trading session shares traded between  44 66 and  45 97 
What makes this interesting is that there is a pretty substantial short interest of 24  outstanding  Short interest is the percentage amount of shares that have been sold before they have been actually purchased  This process  or action of short selling  is usually done by  short seller traders    hedgers   and  speculators  
They basically are betting that the share price goes lower short term rather than higher short term  In some instances this practice is also used longer term when speculators are betting that a company made file for bankruptcy and ultimately go out of business  At Nordstrom s average trading volume  this could take 13 days for the shorts to cover their positions 
This is the kind of situation that can send the stock soaring higher and higher as the shorts need to cover or receive large margin calls  On top of this huge short interest  the company pays a fairly hefty dividend of 3 2  per year  Shares have traded in a 52 week range from a low of  39 53 to a high of  62 82  During the regular trading session shares closed at  45 03 or up  0 33 on the day 
The Players
would provide up to  1 billion in financing for the founding family  which owns 31  of Nordstrom  JWN  shares  CNBC said  citing sources  The family has been seeking bank financing while the retailer has set up a special committee to evaluate any offer 
Nordstrom is a 116 year old company  with roughly 350 stores in about 40 US States They compete with the likes of Macy s  Saks Fifth Avenue Lord   Taylor  to name just a few

recommendations    Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  3 Great Reports Amid Retail s Horrible Earnings SeasonAs another earnings season passes us by  concern about the state of the retail industry is once again rising  Changing consumer habits and competition from e commerce sites have devastated several traditional retail giants  and very few encouraging retail reports emerged this earnings season Of course   very few  does not mean  none at all   Indeed  some retailers be it those who have been deemed Amazon  NASDAQ      proof  or those who have successfully adapted to the times were able to produce quality results in the most recent quarter So who sticks out from the pack  Which retail companies actually did report solid earnings  Check out these three stocks below 1        Nordstrom Inc   NYSE     While several of its department store peers disappointed investors  Nordstrom was able to post earnings and revenue figures that topped estimates this quarter  Adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents and extended the company s surprise streak to five  Total revenue of  3 8 billion surpassed our consensus estimate of  3 73 billion Net retail sales increased 3 5   while credit card revenues rose 28 8   Total company comps rose 1 7   driven by comps growth at both full line and Rack stores  Nordstrom Rack total revenues  which include Rack stores and nordstromrack com  gained 9 8   So far this year  the company has opened a total of six new Rack stores and closed one full line store not bad in the face of shuttering department stores around the country Nordstrom now anticipates net sales growth of nearly 4  for fiscal 2017  which is at the high end of its previous guidance of nearly 3 4  growth  Also  the company now envisions fiscal 2017 earnings per share in the range of  2 85  3 00  compared with  2 75  3 00 projected earlier JWN is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but the stock does carry  A  grades in each of our Style Score categories  including the overall weighted average VGM category 2        The Home Depot  Inc   NYSE     Home Depot reported better than expected earnings and revenue results before the bell on Tuesday  adding more support to the idea that it is one of the few retailers safe from the dangers of Amazon and providing more evidence that the housing market is relatively sound right now The company posted fiscal second quarter earnings of  2 25 per share  which was up more than 14 2  from the year ago quarter and comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 21  Net sales grew 6 2  to  28 1 billion  while comparable store sales were up about 6 3  year over year Thanks to its impressive performance in the first half of the year  Home Depot now expects sales growth of 5 3  and comps growth of 5 5  for the full fiscal year  The company also raised its full year earnings outlook to  7 29 per share from  7 15 per share Interestingly  Home Depot s beat and raise was not met with immediate excitement from investors  and shares were actually down more than 3  through early afternoon trading Tuesday  However  Home Depot s report contained plenty of strength  so it will be interesting to see if the stock rebounds soon  Currently  HD is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  3        Aaron s  Inc   NYSE     Despite a tough retail environment  Aaron s was able to post its fifth straight earnings beat in the most recent quarter  Indeed  earnings of 68 cents per share surpassed our Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents by a cool 17  Revenues of  815 6 million were up about 3 3  year over year and above our consensus estimate of  790 million  perhaps adding to the theory that the company s rent to own model could be helping it stick out right now  However  comparable store sales are continuing to slump  which is a familiar story in the retail industry Nevertheless  share of Aaron s received a nice lift from the report  The company released its earnings details before the market opened on July 28  and the stock closed more than 17  higher that day  Aaron s also recently announced that it was purchasing its largest franchisee  a move that investors clearly feel is coming from a position of strength In fact  Aaron s shares are up over 41  year to date  making it one of the best performing stocks in the retail sector this year  AAN currently sports a Zacks Rank

the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and carry a  of A Stock PerformanceShares of Nordstrom have shown solid momentum in the last three months driven by its earnings surprise trend as well as progress on long term strategies  The stock witnessed 9 6  growth  outperforming the  s 14 8  decline Earnings Trend   OutlookNordstrom posted solid second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings  wherein both earnings and sales topped estimates  While the company delivered positive earnings surprise for the fifth straight quarter  sales beat estimates after three consecutive misses  Results gained from a strong Anniversary sale event  smooth execution of customer strategy along with disciplined inventory and expense management  Sales growth in Nordstrom Rack and solid eCommerce sales also aided results  Moreover  the company s revised fiscal 2017 guidance remains encouraging Nordstrom  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    The company now anticipates net sales growth of nearly 4  for fiscal 2017  which is at the high end of its previous guidance of 3 4  growth  Further  the company raised the lower end of its Retail EBIT and earnings per share guidance  while it upped forecast for Credit EBIT  It now expects Retail EBIT in the range of  790  840 million  compared with  780  840 million anticipated earlier  Credit EBIT is estimated to be about  145 million  compared with the earlier forecast of  140 million  The company now envisions fiscal 2017 earnings per share in the range of  2 85  3 00  compared with  2 75  3 00 projected earlier Long Term Growth StrategyNordstrom is making significant progress with respect to its customer based strategy and is on track to reach its long term growth target of  20 billion by 2020  In doing so  the company is executing its strategy of enhancing market share through persistent store expansion and strengthening capabilities via further investments  particularly in digital growth  With regard to cost savings  the company plans to strike a balance between sales and expense growth  Notably  Nordstrom is making amendments to its operating model in response to the constant slowdown in mall traffic resulting from customers  shift to online shopping Store ExpansionNordstrom has been persistently focusing on store expansion strategy as part of efforts to grow market share  In doing so  the company remains keen on prioritizing investments in the top North American markets  In September  the company will successfully complete its planned full line store expansion in Canada with the opening of its sixth outlet at Sherway Gardens in Toronto  Overall  the company envisions a  1 billion sales opportunity from expansion in Canada by 2020  including six planned full line stores and 15 Rack stores  Furthermore  the company is on track with domestic store expansion  It is scheduled to inaugurate two full line store relocations in California in October  at Westfield Century City in Los Angeles and at University Towne Center in La Jolla  Year to date  the company has opened a total of six new Rack stores while it closed one full line store Higher Expenses to Remain a HurdleWe note that Nordstrom s growth strategy focused on enhancement of digital experience and increased investments in supply chain bode well for the long term  However  investments related to occupancy  technology  supply chain and marketing expenses are likely to weigh upon the company s near term cost and margins performance  Consequently  the company s merchandise performance was hurt by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores in the fiscal second quarter  Further  the company s accelerated investments towards technology  supply chain and marketing  resulted in higher SG A expenses in the quarter For fiscal 2017 also  the company anticipates Retail gross profit to be impacted by higher new store occupancy expenses and mix impact from off price growth  Further  the company s projections for SG A expenses incorporates higher technology and supply chain expenses related to growth initiatives  offset by progress in productivity improvements ConclusionWe believe the company s long term growth efforts and its surprise history speaks loads of the company s potential to grow  While higher near term costs are surely a concern for the company  we believe this is temporary and will gradually subside once its strategic efforts are fully implemented Meanwhile  investors interested in the retail space can count on Canada Goose Holdings Inc    NYSE GOOS    The Children s Place Inc    NASDAQ PLCE   and

142857,364372,JWN,Macy s  M  Stock Gains On New Digital  Restructuring Initiatives,opinion,"On Tuesday  shares of department store Macy s Inc    NYSE M   are gaining  up over 4  in late morning trading after the company announced a major restructuring plan that could be exactly what the struggling retailer needs 
Macy s said it will be cutting 100 jobs as part of a consolidation plan to unite its merchandising  planning  and private brands operations into one department  The company also said the plan will save Macy s an estimated  30 million a year  including roughly  5 million  or a penny per share  for the fourth quarter of 2017  But  the change will also mean one time costs of approximately  20 million to  25 million  taking effect mostly in the third quarter  according to Macy s 
The company has also named a new president  bringing in former eBay   NASDAQ EBAY   executive Hal Lawton  Lawton has previously worked for The Home Depot   NYSE HD   and McKinsey   Co   a management consulting firm  he will begin his tenure on September 8 
Macy s CEO Jeff Gennette commended Lawton s  deep expertise at the intersection of retail and technology  a diverse set of business experiences that give him a unique perspective  and a track record of successfully driving a change agenda at scale 
 This is a key step   Gennette added   as we look to further transform the business and work through the volatility of today s retail landscape  
At eBay  Lawton was in charge of marketing  merchandising  and consumer selling  and has  in technology and digital expertise  all things that will be vital to Macy s has the department store giant makes big moves to revitalize its business 
Additionally  Macy s is getting ready to roll out its off price division  Macy s Backstage  in more of its store locations  as well as strengthen its beauty business  leveraging its recent acquisition of Bluemercury    The company launching a new loyalty program that will officially hit the market in October 
Macy s In Depth
Macy s is currently a  3  Hold  on the Zacks Rank  with a VGM score of  A   Though its industry    has lost almost 36  year to date  it sits in the top 43  of all 265 industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank 
This past quarter  Macy s surpassed analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines  though the company still expects comparable sales for the full year to decline by 2 2  to 3 3   Looking ahead  earnings are expected to grow about 7  for the current year  while sales are projected to decline nearly 4  in the same time frame 
From a value perspective  Macy s is very cheap  with a P E of only 5 85  The stock has depreciated over time too  losing about have its value over the last 12 months its P E a year ago was around 10 5 and demonstrating the brutal environment of traditional brick and mortar retail 
Macy s value story also reflects the so called  perceived value  among retailers  Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    for instance  has a P E right now of 14 9  Macy s and Nordstrom are in the same industry and arguably have suffered many of the same problems  The only difference is that investors have always been willing to pay more for JWN because of the company s perceived high status among retailers  a factor that has worked in their favor with shareholders and customers 
Right now  people don t equate  high end  with Macy s  But bringing in executives like Mr  Lawton  and working to utilize acquisitions like Bluemercury  and rethinking what it means to do retail in the twenty first century may help Macy s reach that icon status once again

142869,364384,JWN,Bentleys and Bordeaux  Chinese newcomers drive Vancouver s luxury market,news,By Elizabeth Dilts and Julie Gordon VANCOUVER  Reuters    At a luxury car dealership in Vancouver  a 19 year old college student recently traded in his 2014 Ferrari for a 2016 Bentley that cost C 350 000   268 446    MCL Motor Cars Manager Scott Warren says the teen was his typical customer  young  Chinese and eager to swap a relatively new car for an even newer  trendier model   They don t mind taking a C 75 000 hit   he said  noting that some brand sensitive teens change cars every few months   They just trade them in and dad puts the money in their account    While Vancouver is often called the gateway to Asia and has been a top destination for wealthy Chinese immigrants for some time  the boon for luxury retailers this year is particularly noteworthy given the summer plunge in the Chinese stock market and President Xi Jinping s campaign against corruption  The crackdown  which has included Chinese demands that Canada arrest and deport former Chinese officials accused of corruption  has had no apparent impact on demand for everything from C 350 000 Bentleys to C 3 000 bottles of wine   But cracks could be starting to show  Detached home sales volumes in the city of Vancouver fell 41 percent from June to September  with listings down just 3 percent  the largest drop in sales for that period since 2008  Real estate agent Tom Gradecak  who sells on Vancouver s affluent westside  says it  feels  like the market has slowed  but prices have not dropped yet   It could be the Chinese stock market   probably is   but it could just be a bit of a breather from an insane first part of the year   he said  adding that he just sold a home for C 300 000 over the asking price with seven competing offers  Yet business remains so brisk at car dealerships that sportscar maker McLaren has a third party financier on hand at its Vancouver location to provide loans to young Chinese clients who may lack a Canadian credit history   At MCL  Warren said the dealership expects to sell 70 Bentleys this year  about the same as the Toronto store despite Vancouver having roughly a third of the population  noting the brand is popular for its mix of luxury and performance   It s amazing the amount of 16  to 24 year old kids with 500 horsepower under the hood of their cars in this city   he added with a laugh  The Bentley Flying Spur W12 s engine clocks in at 616 horsepower  triple the power of a typical Toyota Camry   But the ostentatious displays of wealth by Chinese immigrants have created tension in Vancouver  a city known for its eco friendliness and yoga culture  A blog called  University of Beautiful Cars   a play on the University of British Columbia  posts photos of luxury vehicles parked on campus with snarky comments like  struggling Vancouver student needs new Porsche   And there has been backlash from faculty and students who say they cannot afford to live on the leafy campus due to high price of condos on University land  which start at more than C 400 000 for small units and are heavily marketed in China  Indeed  foreign buyers are widely blamed by locals for the stratospheric rise in housing costs in Vancouver  where the median condo sold for C 495 866 in September and detached home demanded C 2 02 million  up 60 percent from September 2010  STOCKING THE WINE CELLAR Wealthy mainland Chinese started streaming into Vancouver around 2005  many entering on the now defunct millionaire visa program  which fast tracked visas for foreigners with a net worth of at least C 1 6 million and C 800 000 to invest  From 2005 to 2010  the program attracted more than 57 000 wealthy individuals to Canada  with about 30 000 arriving in British Columbia  Research has shown that many of those who landed elsewhere quickly moved to the west coast province  attracted by Vancouver s top ranked schools  pristine environment  and long established Asian community   The influx helped to attract upscale department stores like  Nordstrom Inc   N JWN  and high end retailer Simons  and fuel the expansion of luxury department store Holt Renfrew  Nancy Bendtsen  co owner of contemporary furniture design store Inform Interiors  said the surge in business from Chinese speaking clients has helped the business expand into a second location and hire new staff  including four Mandarin speakers   I ve done million dollar deals with nothing but hand signals   said Bendtsen  laughing off the language barriers she still occasionally encounters   Bendtsen said her clients  frequently women whose husbands remain in China  hire Inform to outfit entire homes in Vancouver  China and around the world  The desire for all things luxurious is not limited to cars  clothes and home furnishings  At the state owned liquor store s 2012 Bordeaux launch earlier this month  more than 200 people   most of them speaking Mandarin   lined up to get first pick of the most exclusive bottles of the famous French wine  One woman  who did not identify herself  was frantically searching the crates for numerous expensive bottles and ended up buying nearly C 19 000 worth of wine  Another woman  who gave her name as Vivian  came armed with a list of requests from her husband  who spends most of his time working abroad but maintains a wine cellar in their Vancouver home for when he visits   I don t know anything about wine   she said  gesturing to her selection of bottles   My husband picked it up as a hobby   Peter Wang  a Vancouver based wine consultant who came with a newcomer couple from mainland China  said his friends had spent the night in line to ensure they would be able to get a rare  2 800 Chateau Petrus and a  1 200 bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild  both from the Pomerol region of France        It s a great year for Pomerols   he said  lugging three cases of the C 65 a bottle Chateau Rouget to the cash register   There are some real

142877,364392,JWN,S P 500 Futures  10 Years After The Credit Crisis And Still Going ,opinion,"When President Trump warned North Korea about continuing to threaten the U S  by saying the North will be meet with  Fire and Fury  of the likes the world has never seen  the U S  stock market sold off  and so did many of the other world markets 
Yesterday  on globex  the S P 500 futures traded down to 2459 00  On the 8 30 CT bell  the ES  ESU17 CME  opened at 2462 50  and traded up to 246650 before going back down and testing the Globex low at 2459 25  From there  the futures traded above and below the vwap  and made a new high at 2468 00  After that  it was a series of higher lows that eventually pushed the futures back up to 2468 75  and then up to its high of the day at 2470 50 
Early in the day I said 2470 2471 would be the potential resistance  The S P no longer does its own thinking  movement is keyed off the price action of the Nasdaq 100 futures  NQU17 CME   When the NQ rallies the ES goes with  When the NQ downticks the ES goes with  After making the 2470 50 high  the NQ sold off  and the ES sold off down to 2462 25 
While there were some good ups and downs  the big thing was the volume  At 2 00 CT total ES volume was 1 25 million contracts  Late in the day  the MiM started out showing  131 million for sale  and flipped to  26 million to buy  The ES made a late low at 2462 50 after an NQ stop run under the vwap  and traded up to 2468 00  then 2571 50 when the NYSE came out showing buy  650 million 
Like the title says   10 years after the credit crisis the stock market is still going   Bad news like Trumps North Korean threat  or for that matter any negative headlines  always turn into buying opportunities  When I saw that 330 000 ES traded on Globex yesterday  all I could think about was how the sell off got people short at bad prices  and that after running the sell stop the ES would push people out on the upside  and that s exactly what happened 
In the end the S P 500 futures  ESU17 CME  settled at 2473 00  up 0 25 handles  the Dow Jones futures  YMU17 CBT  settled at 22018  down  12 points  and the Nasdaq 100 futures  NQU17 CME  settled at 5922 50  up  4 50 points 
Investors Have Never Been More Short Volatility Futures
Bloomberg 
Never mind strategists  of a potential VIX rebound  or historical data showing the index tends to  the most in August  The number of short positions on VIX futures has hit a fresh peak  and an exchange traded fund that benefits when volatility falls just saw its  since June  following three weeks of withdrawals  That s even as the CBOE Volatility Index hovers within 1 point of its record low close 

So what may be pushing investors to keep shorting volatility and why is the market so stubbornly calm  Dean Curnutt  CEO of Macro Risk Advisors  said in a note last week it may be due in part to  of long vol positions established before things got this quiet  Here s what he wrote 

Realized vol is just so low and has already imposed such theta loss that those who own it higher are more trying to get out of the way for now and manage the rent with short dated variance sales at levels we really aren t used to seeing 

In conclusion 
Are the collective  re  hedging pursuits of long vol holders serving to dampen volatility  The story is an appealing one as market participants seek to explain not just a low vol period  but an environment that is so quiet that it feels as if some other factor is at work

142881,364396,JWN,3 Great Reports Amid Retail s Horrible Earnings Season,opinion,"As another earnings season passes us by  concern about the state of the retail industry is once again rising  Changing consumer habits and competition from e commerce sites have devastated several traditional retail giants  and very few encouraging retail reports emerged this earnings season 
Of course   very few  does not mean  none at all   Indeed  some retailers be it those who have been deemed Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   proof  or those who have successfully adapted to the times were able to produce quality results in the most recent quarter 
So who sticks out from the pack  Which retail companies actually did report solid earnings  Check out these three stocks below 
1        Nordstrom Inc     NYSE JWN   While several of its department store peers disappointed investors  Nordstrom was able to post earnings and revenue figures that topped estimates this quarter  Adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents and extended the company s surprise streak to five  Total revenue of  3 8 billion surpassed our consensus estimate of  3 73 billion Net retail sales increased 3 5   while credit card revenues rose 28 8   Total company comps rose 1 7   driven by comps growth at both full line and Rack stores  Nordstrom Rack total revenues  which include Rack stores and nordstromrack com  gained 9 8   So far this year  the company has opened a total of six new Rack stores and closed one full line store not bad in the face of shuttering department stores around the country Nordstrom now anticipates net sales growth of nearly 4  for fiscal 2017  which is at the high end of its previous guidance of nearly 3 4  growth  Also  the company now envisions fiscal 2017 earnings per share in the range of  2 85  3 00  compared with  2 75  3 00 projected earlier JWN is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but the stock does carry  A  grades in each of our Style Score categories  including the overall weighted average VGM category 
 
2        The Home Depot  Inc     NYSE HD   Home Depot reported better than expected earnings and revenue results before the bell on Tuesday  adding more support to the idea that it is one of the few retailers safe from the dangers of Amazon and providing more evidence that the housing market is relatively sound right now The company posted fiscal second quarter earnings of  2 25 per share  which was up more than 14 2  from the year ago quarter and comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 21  Net sales grew 6 2  to  28 1 billion  while comparable store sales were up about 6 3  year over year Thanks to its impressive performance in the first half of the year  Home Depot now expects sales growth of 5 3  and comps growth of 5 5  for the full fiscal year  The company also raised its full year earnings outlook to  7 29 per share from  7 15 per share Interestingly  Home Depot s beat and raise was not met with immediate excitement from investors  and shares were actually down more than 3  through early afternoon trading Tuesday  However  Home Depot s report contained plenty of strength  so it will be interesting to see if the stock rebounds soon  Currently  HD is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   
3        Aaron s  Inc     NYSE AAN   Despite a tough retail environment  Aaron s was able to post its fifth straight earnings beat in the most recent quarter  Indeed  earnings of 68 cents per share surpassed our Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents by a cool 17  Revenues of  815 6 million were up about 3 3  year over year and above our consensus estimate of  790 million  perhaps adding to the theory that the company s rent to own model could be helping it stick out right now  However  comparable store sales are continuing to slump  which is a familiar story in the retail industry Nevertheless  share of Aaron s received a nice lift from the report  The company released its earnings details before the market opened on July 28  and the stock closed more than 17  higher that day  Aaron s also recently announced that it was purchasing its largest franchisee  a move that investors clearly feel is coming from a position of strength In fact  Aaron s shares are up over 41  year to date  making it one of the best performing stocks in the retail sector this year  AAN currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and an overall VGM grade of  B

March s retail sales were revised higher to show a 1 1 percent increase instead of the previously reported 0 9 percent rise  that was not enough to offset the general weak tone of the report  Economists had forecast sales up 0 2 percent in April  Futures markets continued to show that traders do not expect an interest rate hike until December at the earliest   The dollar fell against a basket of currencies  while prices for U S  Treasury debt slipped  U S  stocks were little changed  Retail sales excluding automobiles  gasoline  building materials and food services were also unchanged after an upwardly revised 0 5 percent increase in March  These so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product  Economists had forecast core retail sales rising 0 5 percent in April after a previously reported 0 4 percent increase in March   Retail sales have trended weaker despite households getting a massive windfall from lower gasoline prices  Consumers appear to have saved much of the money from the cheaper gasoline  The retail sales data added to employment and manufacturing reports in suggesting that while the economy was regaining its footing at the start of the second quarter  it lacked enough vigor to convince the Fed to tighten monetary policy soon  The economy was walloped earlier in the year by a mix of bad weather  disruptions at ports  the strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy firms  SILVER LINING  While the continued weakness challenges the notion that sales had been depressed by the weather and a lack of inventory during a labor dispute at the West Coast ports  economists are optimistic of a pick up given that personal savings are at two  year highs and consumer confidence remains robust   We remain puzzled by the softness in retail sales given the gains in employment  real incomes from lower energy prices  and wealth  but we continue to look for consumer spending to pick up this year   said John Ryding  chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York  The weak retail sales trajectory was underscored by Macy s Inc  one of the largest U S  department store retailers  which reported a 13 8 percent drop in first quarter net income  blamed on the weather  the port disruptions and the dollar   The company  which operates more than 850 stores throughout the United States and U S  territories  said tourist spending at Macy s and Bloomingdale s stores were down sharply  It said second quarter earnings were expected to fall short of the same period a year ago  Several other major retailers will report results in the next few days  including Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   Kohl s and JC Penney  which will release its earnings after the close of trading Wednesday   The government reported last month that GDP expanded at a 0 2 percent annual pace in the first quarter  Trade and wholesale inventory data published last week  however  suggested the economy actually contracted  That was corroborated by a third report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday  showing business inventories barely rose in March  Economists estimate the economy shrank at a 0 8 percent pace  The government will release its GDP revision later this month  The case for the Fed to delay hiking interest rates was strengthened by a separate report from the Labor Department showing import prices fell 0 3 percent in April after slipping 0 2 percent in March  The dollar  which has gained about 11 percent against the currencies of the United States  main trading partners since June  and lower crude oil prices are keeping a lid on price pressures  That has left inflation running well below the Fed s 2 percent target   The dollar may have stabilized  but until it falls  the downward pressure emanating from lower import costs will limit domestic firm pricing power   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland  Pennsylvania   Last month  retail sales were curbed by declines in receipts at auto dealerships  service stations  furniture and electronic and appliance stores  There were some pockets of strength  with sales of clothing  sporting goods and building materials and garden equipment rising  Receipts at online stores rose as did those at restaurants and bars

Nordstrom  an upscale fashion retailer based in Seattle  posted first quarter net earnings of  128 million  down from  140 million during the same period in 2014  Nordstrom s sales reflected the opening of full line stores in Ottawa and San Juan  Puerto Rico during the quarter  along with the launch of 10 discount Nordstrom Rack stores throughout the U S  In addition  the company  which was founded by Swedish immigrant John W  Nordstrom in 1901  acquired The Trunk Club  a Chicago based Men s shopping service  for an undisclosed amount last summer 
On Thursday  Nordstrom said the impact of the acquisition and its expansion into Canada reduced earnings before interest and taxes by approximately  19 million on the quarter  While Nordstrom increased its net sales by 9 8  on the quarter to  3 1 billion  same store sales rose by only 4 4  during the period  A strong quarter among Nordstrom s Women s and Men s Apparel division helped fuel the increase  It represents a reversal from recent periods where Nordstrom s Accessory and Shoe departments posted stronger earnings 
Nordstrom Rack  meanwhile  reported an increase of  90 million or 12  on the quarter   a reflection of the opening of the new stores  In terms of same store sales  a key metric for the company  Nordstrom Rack experienced a 0 2  decrease for the quarter 
Nordstrom s forward guidance of 2015 earnings per share between  3 65 and  3 80 remained unchanged 
The earnings came in the wake of disappointing U S  retail sales for the month of April when department store revenues fell sharply by 2 2   Since last April  retail sales nationwide have edged up only 0 9   marking the lowest level of retail growth since late 2009

142896,364411,JWN,Macy s to expand same day delivery to new U S  markets  challenging Amazon,news,"By Nandita Bose and Mari Saito CHICAGO SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Macy s Inc  N M  is expanding same day delivery to several new U S  markets this summer  one of the most aggressive pushes by a brick and mortar retailer in an area dominated by e commerce giant Amazon  O AMZN   according to a Macy s official      Macy s  the nation s largest department store chain  already offers same day delivery services in eight markets  By partnering with Deliv  an Uber like startup that uses a fleet of contract drivers to pick up online orders from stores and malls  the retailer has found a cost effective way to expand  said the Macy s official  who spoke on condition of anonymity        The official said that the initial plan is to offer the service in several more markets but there nay be additions later this year  and that could take it ahead of Amazon   which currently offers same day delivery in 14 markets  Currently  Macy s is offering the service in Houston  San Francisco  San Jose  Seattle  Washington D C   Chicago  Los Angeles and New Jersey  It couldn t be immediately ascertained which ones were being added      The department store company s efforts come as the  last mile    the final portion of a package s journey that takes it from a retailer s warehouse or store to the customer s front door   becomes the next battleground for retailers trying to increase online sales  Macy s has one possible advantage over Amazon in that it has 886 stores as of May 2 in the U S  from which to source products for delivery   meaning the packages often have less distance to travel   against 50 fulfilment centers and smaller distribution facilities run by Amazon      But fast shipping is costly and most retailers who offer it currently lose money on the service  warn logistics experts  For example  analysts estimate that Amazon loses  1 billion to  2 billion a year on its U S  Prime service  which promises delivery within anything from one hour to two days  Amazon s net shipping cost rose to  4 2 billion in 2014  up from  3 5 billion a year earlier   Macy s spokesman Jim Sluzewski confirmed the retailer s plans to expand the service this year but declined to give further details  Faster delivery also becomes a differentiating factor when new online retail sites like Jet com  which launched on Tuesday  promise to offer cheaper prices than Amazon  The startup  which will charge  49 a year for membership  claims its consumers can get the lowest price on anything they buy online  with the trade off of being relatively slow delivery service                RACE TO THE BOTTOM       Even as Macy s rushes to extend fast delivery  many other traditional retailers are far more cautious  The costs of same day delivery and ambivalence from many customers remain concerns  analysts say       Nordstrom Inc   N JWN  has offered same day delivery for  15 since 2011  but the service is still only available in three markets  Seattle and Bellevue in Washington state  and La Jolla in California      A January survey of 5 118 online shoppers by UPS and Comscore found that 85 percent of people surveyed were willing to wait five days or more for their delivery           The thing that s so perplexing about this last mile and same day is that the consumers overwhelmingly prefer free shipping over speed   said Satish Jindel  a logistics consultant and president of SJ Consulting Group       That could change  said David Bell  a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania s Wharton School  and if consumers became accustomed to same day service  the result would be an expensive  race to the bottom for retailers  who would not be able to compete with Amazon on the delivery cost       Macy s does not disclose how many items it has available for same day delivery  and Deliv will not say how many items it carries for Macy s       Amazon has more than a million products available for same day delivery  Macy s charges its customers  5 for same day delivery  but it is unclear how much of its costs that covers  Deliv says its rates for retailers are in line with the average  8 ground delivery cost of carriers such as UPS and FedEx  NYSE FDX   but it was unclear whether that s what it charges Macy s or whether it takes a loss to offer the service to Macy s   It s very hard to compete with Amazon  but traditional retailers have an advantage in that they already have all of their inventory in place five miles from 90 percent of their purchasing population at their stores   said Deliv CEO Daphne Carmeli   This is one of those opportunities to out Amazon Amazon   she said      Although Macy s does not break out details of its online sales or shipping costs  analysts assume the company is losing money on the service once additional costs are taken into account  including finding the product  getting the package ready for delivery  and restocking expenses  
     Only the biggest of retailers that are capable will be able to afford these operations   said Jarrett Streebin  the CEO of EasyPost  a shipping startup  He estimated costs per package could reach  20 or more with additional logistics processes and staffing to handle the orders   Who s willing to pay the bill   he asked ",2015-07-22,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/macy's-to-expand-same-day-delivery-to-new-u.s.-markets,-challenging-amazon-352365",352365

142911,364426,JWN,Earnings Watch  Department Stores On Deck,opinion,"Nordstrom Inc   NYSE JWN  Reports  8 10 17
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 65  two cents higher than Wall Street s consensus of  0 63  Currently  the Estimize community is looking for revenues of  3 734M  roughly in line with the Street s expectation for  3 732M 
What to Watch  Retail sales and mall traffic have been plunging  there s no way around that fact  Despite the Nordstrom family wanting to take the stock private to work on a turnaround  it has still fared better than its other retail competitors  Nordstrom is set to open its sixth Canadian store  as well as a line of its daughter store  Nordstrom Rack  in the coming months  Since Canada s economy has seen a spike in 2017  its GDP on track to grow 3  in the next year  this could be a positive move for the company  More things impacting Nordstrom could be the downsizing of its competitors  For example  Neiman Marcus has closed three of its Last Call locations and is planning to take a look at the chain as a whole  Likewise  Hudson s Bay  TO HBC   owner of Lord   Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue  is also looking to downsize as retail continues to take a beating 
Macy s Inc   NYSE M  Reports  8 10 17
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 42  two cents lower than Wall Street s consensus of  0 44  Currently  the Estimize community is looking for revenues of  5 482M  slightly lower than the Street s expectation for  5 501M 
What to Watch  Last quarter  the store came out with a negative earnings surprise of  31 4  Analysts polled by Zachs have predicted revenues of  5 490  down 6 4  from last year  Over the last three months the stock has declined 19   a wider margin than the industry wide decline of 4 8   Major deterrents for Macy s have consistently been decreasing mall traffic  aggressive pricing strategies and increased competition  Retail stocks in general have been under scrutiny as the sector continues to change 
Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  Reports  8 10 17
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  1 19  one cent higher than the Wall Street consensus of  1 18  Currently  the Estimize community is looking for revenues of  4 116M  roughly even with Street s expectation of  4 109M 
What to Watch  Unlike other retailers  brick and mortar stores  Kohl s  is a positive asset to the stock s performance  Because its locations are found in suburban strip malls  its performance has not been hurt by declining traditional mall traffic  Likewise  unlike other retailers who are considering closing locations  Kohl s has decided to focus on certain brands  cut down inventory and decrease store size  Studies have shown that 80  of Americans live within 15 miles of a Kohl s location  indicating that it is convenient and accessible  especially with back to school shopping just around the corner  To top things off  Kohl s  dividend yield is a whopping 5 2   another reason to consider giving this stock a chance

What to Watch  In the last four quarters  the company has beat the Zachs consensus by an average of 50 9   The company has stated that its sales have been up in the latter half of the 2017 fiscal year  The company has also revamped its rewards program to compensate loyal customers and increase sales  For every 200 points earned  customers will earn  10 in store credit  However  in order to go along with its restructuring plan  the company will be shuttering two distribution facilities and 130 140 stores  which makes up roughly 13 14  of its portfolio and will decrease its annual sales by roughly 5  or less

There have been a handful of disappointing retail earnings recently  but Nordstrom sticks out from the pack for a variety of reasons  Nordstrom features an adequate Zacks Rank  strong earnings history  as well as an Earnings ESP of 4 84   All of these factors should allow investors to possess optimism as we approach its quarterly earnings release 
Here are 3 additional reasons to be bullish on Nordstrom as we near its report 
1        Store Expansion to Boost Sales
Nordstrom has continued to focus on its store expansion strategy  Apart from expanding its footprint within the United States  the company has been actively expanding its presence and customer base in Canada  Nordstrom s newly opened Canadian stores have led to increased online sales in those regions  Also  the company envisions a  1 billion sales opportunity from its expansion in Canada by 2020  including six planned full line stores and 15 Rack stores 
Additionally  the company will inaugurate two full line store relocations in California at Westfield Century City in Los Angeles and at University Towne Center in La Jolla  Furthermore  the company stated that it has opened six Rack stores so far in 2017  with another 11 planned for the fall  Finally  Nordstrom is on track with the opening of its flagship store in Manhattan in 2019 and its first Men s store in spring 2018 
2        Strong Style Scores
Nordstrom features impressive  A  grades for the Growth and Value Style Scores categories  while Momentum holds a  B  grade  The company s  A  grade for Value is partially driven by its strong Cash Flow per Share of  7 75  which towers over the industry average of  1 49  Further  Nordstrom currently holds a respectable 6 33 EV EBITDA ratio 
Additionally  the company s  A  grade for Growth is underscored by its 17 15  current cash flow growth and 61 36  RoE  both of which defeat the industry averages of  4 69  and 9 27   respectively  Also  Nordstrom possesses projected sales growth of 3 19   in comparison with the meager industry average of 0 04   Finally  the company holds a  B  grade for Momentum  largely due to its recent share price increase of 16 66  in the past twelve weeks 
3        Projected Growth in Key Divisions
Sales from specific divisions within the company are expected to continue growing  For example  revenues from all retail stores are projected to total close to  2 62 billion  which would represent a year over year increase of around 32   Also  sales from its  website are projected to grow 19 5  year over year to around  187 55 million 
Overall  our Zacks Consensus Estimate projects Nordstrom to report  3 73 billion in sales  which would constitute year over year growth of 2 22   Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimates expects the company to post earnings of  0 62 per share

142918,364433,JWN,UPS  FedEx seek ways to manage massive peak season package bulge,news,"By Nick Carey CHICAGO  Reuters    Determined not to repeat a holiday season that left millions of packages delivered too late and customers seething  United Parcel Service Inc  N UPS  and FedEx Corp  N FDX  are investing heavily in new infrastructure   but the continued dynamic growth of e commerce will test those efforts 
The world s two largest shipping companies are building new facilities  adding more temporary holiday workers and pushing retailers to help them avoid a recurrence of a pre Christmas shipping logjam 
Even so  the rise in shipping originating with e tailers including Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  and Zappos could test even the new capacity levels  Peak days at both companies now equal roughly double their average daily volumes 
Mark Wallace  vice president of engineering in the United States at UPS  said the company still has volume limits  despite substantial investment this year   There is only so much capacity in the network  
A late spike in demand last year caused by last minute online promotions plagued express delivery companies 
Some 2 million express packages were left stranded by delivery companies on Christmas Eve  according to shipment tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc  UPS experienced far more severe problems than FedEx 
This year  UPS has allocated  500 million to expand and improve facilities and is hiring 95 000 seasonal workers   or 10 000 more than last year   to handle 2014 holiday packages 
During its second quarter conference call  UPS Chief Executive David Abney said  these projects will weigh on earnings in 2014  but pay off long term  A spokesman declined to comment further ahead of UPS s next quarterly earnings  expected to be released on Friday 
FedEx has said up to 90 percent of its  1 2 billion investments this year are to boost capacity  The company plans to hire 50 000 seasonal workers  up from 40 000 last year  Patrick Fitzgerald  senior vice president of marketing and communications at FedEx  said this year s capital investments would not affect the company s earnings forecast 
The investment is designed to address the rapid growth of consumer goods ordered online  Through 2013  peak volume  referring to the busiest day of the year  had climbed 57 percent over five years at FedEx  to 22 million packages  It jumped 40 percent at UPS  to 31 million packages 
Deloitte LLP predicts sales growth of up to 14 percent this holiday season  and FedEx said on Wednesday it expected peak day package volumes to reach 22 6 million this year 
The peaks have become more pronounced closer to Christmas as last minute online free shipping deals have proliferated  Unchecked  those peaks will only grow worse  experts said 
 The e commerce shipping model isn t sustainable in its current form   said Yossi Sheffi  a professor of engineering systems and director of the Center for Transportation   Logistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT    You cannot build a shipping network to operate 365 days a year based on a spike in packages three days before Christmas  
 
PROTECTING THE CORE
In a bid to better manage the peak  the shipping giants have asked retailers for clearer estimates of 2014 holiday volumes and have encouraged earlier deadlines for consumer orders 
 We now have the kind of visibility we didn t before on what to expect from our largest customers   said UPS s Wallace 
FedEx s Fitzgerald said customers could be disappointed if they offer last minute sales without first consulting FedEx   If we don t have the right discussions up front  we may not be ready to handle  a sudden surge  Fitzgerald said  
In mid August  Wal Mart Stores Inc  N WMT  gave its carriers its peak forecast  both by day and by shipping facility  three weeks earlier than usual  Contingency plans include shipping from alternate Wal Mart distribution centers or upgrading packages to faster services if  deemed at risk  of missing Christmas  said spokeswoman Jaeme Lazckowski 
Nordstrom Inc  N JWN  has moved up its cutoff point for Christmas deliveries by three hours on Dec  23  and UPS has agreed to additional last minute flights for the company  
FedEx and UPS had no choice but to engage retailers in reducing peak loads and getting them to manage consumer expectations on realistic delivery deadlines  said veteran Cowan   Co analyst Helane Becker   They can t keep trying to squeeze more and more through such a narrow funnel   she said 
Both FedEx and UPS are concerned about impact on their core business to business customers  
 When packages went undelivered last year  that also affected high volume business customers   said Rick Jones  a former UPS executive and now CEO of regional delivery company Lone Star Overnight   Have no doubt this is not about getting little Johnny his Christmas present  It s about protecting that core business  
Logistics experts say the 2014 adjustments are a temporary fix  and more changes are needed for the 2015 holiday season  A price hike might help tackle ubiquitous free shipping offers  and negotiations with Amazon  in particular  likely will occur  
 What you will see is Amazon Prime with a little minus for the three days before Christmas   where free shipping doesn t apply   said MIT s Sheffi   And Amazon will be able to blame UPS for it anyway  
Amazon declined specific comment   We work very closely with all of our delivery partners and are confident in their ability to deliver for Amazon customers this holiday   the company said in a statement  

FedEx s Fitzgerald said the company does not plan a 2015 price increase  at this point   A UPS spokesman said the company has focused on fixing last year s problems instead of pricing

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK  May 13  Reuters    U S  stock index futures edged
up on Friday ahead of key inflation and consumer confidence
data that will give investors a chance to reassess recent
volatility of the commodities market 
 Declines in commodities  including crude oil and silver 
have hurt risk appetite and prompted traders to brace for
further unwinding of dollar funded bets on risk assets 
 The euro rose against the U S  dollar  giving support to
commodity prices on Friday  after strong growth data in France
and Germany bolstered speculation that a healthy euro zone
economy would keep interest rates there higher than in the
United States 
 Three month copper  gained 1 9 percent and both
Brent  and NYMEX crude  oil futures rose near 1
percent  with U S  light crude hovering around  100 per
barrel 
 Silver bounced back about 2 percent after two days of
declines  The iShares Silver Trust  gained 3 8 percent
to  34 50 in premarket trade 
  There s probably some value to be had in equities given
the selling that s been going on in the past weeks   said John
Brady  senior vice president at MF Global in Chicago 
  The bloodletting in commodities has ceased  so there may
be some stabilization trade or maybe bargain hunters out
there  
 The S P 500 fell 1 7 percent last week and has risen 0 6
percent since Friday s close 
 S P 500 futures  rose 2 points and were above fair
value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates  dividends and time to expiration of the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures  gained 16
points and Nasdaq 100 futures  were flat 
 The Labor Department releases its April Consumer Price
Index at 8 30 a m   1230 GMT   Economists in a Reuters survey
expect a 0 4 percent rise compared with a 0 5 percent increase
in March 
 The Thomson Reuters University of Michigan preliminary
consumer sentiment index for May is due at 9 55 a m   1355
GMT   Economists in a Reuters survey expect a reading of 70 0
compared with 69 8 in the final April report 
  The recent sell off in commodities may give the consumer
the sense food and energy prices may not be heading
significantly higher from here   said MF Global s Brady 
 He said the killing of Osama bin Laden and the higher
prices at the pump would affect consumer confidence 
 Nordstrom Inc  will be a focus after the retailer
forecast 2011 profit below forecasts   ID nN12113732 
 Yahoo Inc  shares fell 6 5 percent in premarket
trade after it said the Alibaba Group restructured the
ownership of Alipay  one of China s largest online payment
businesses  without the knowledge of Yahoo and Softbank  two of
its stakeholders   ID nN12125783  
 Defensive shares led a rebound in U S  stocks on Thursday
as investors weighed mixed economic signals and volatility in
commodity prices

142959,364474,JWN,FEATURE In recession  ladies recycle last year s dress,news,"By Martinne Geller
 NEW YORK  Nov 11  Reuters    Last year at this time  Kathy
Johnson and her husband traveled to London and Paris  where she
spent about  2 000 on a shiny  red Louis Vuitton shoulder bag
and a matching charm without much thought 
 This year Johnson  who runs a tech advisory firm with her
husband in the San Francisco Bay area  is recycling older
dresses to save money 
  I m thinking  Maybe I ll just sneak in last year s dress
and nobody will notice   and I ll just accessorize it a bit
differently   said Johnson  who expects to attend several
holiday parties this year 
  I try to make it a little more about what I need on an
everyday basis  rather than spending a bunch of money on
something I ll just wear once or twice   she said 
 Johnson s logic is likely to be played out across the
country this season as U S  consumers cut spending amid the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression 
 That is terrible news to department stores  boutiques and
apparel makers  who tend to get a boost when the
fashion conscious splurge on clothes for office holiday parties
and New Year s festivities 
 U S  retail chains just posted the worst October sales
results in more than three decades  prompting the International
Council of Shopping Centers to pare its already grim forecast
for holiday season sales  It now expects November December
sales to rise 1 percent  from a prior view of 1 7 percent 
 What is more  a recent survey by executive search firm
Battalia Winston Amrop found that one fifth of U S  businesses
are not having 2008 holiday parties  effectively passing out
pink slips to women s  little black dresses  
 That could hurt department stores like Nordstrom Inc
 and Macy s Inc   already struggling with sharp
monthly sales declines  as well as women s apparel stores like
AnnTaylor Stores Corp   Talbots Inc  and Chico s
FAS Inc   which owns the White House Black Market chain
in addition to its namesake stores 
  I think  consumers  are going to be very loath to buy
anything   said Wendy Liebmann  chief executive of consulting
firm WSL Strategic Retail  which researches shopping trends 
 As for herself  Liebmann guessed that she will feel the
need to be festive during this gloomy holiday season 
  But I know there s a very wonderful corner of a very
wonderful closet of mine  which has absolutely fabulous stuff
in it that I haven t worn for some time  So I know I will be
shopping in that corner  
  But if  people  do feel they need an affordable little
treat     there are a lot of places women feel very comfortable
buying used  pre owned or excess inventory products  
 According to her most recent poll  about 51 percent of
women had bought second hand clothes  and Liebmann expects that
to increase as times get tougher and more people realize that
some used clothing stores sell vintage designer dresses 
 TJX Cos Inc   an off price retailer that buys excess
merchandise at below wholesale prices  has outperformed in
recent months as shoppers look for bargains at its TJ Maxx and
Marshalls stores 
  We often talk about the resiliency of our off price
business model  and we are seeing that resiliency benefiting us
in this difficult consumer environment   said TJX CEO Carol
Meyrowitz in a statement last week 
 LIFE GOES ON
 A spokeswoman for Goodwill Industries International  which
operates more than 2 000 second hand stores across the U S  
said sales have increased nearly 7 percent over the first nine
months of the year  More specifically  she said store managers
in New York City    the epicenter of the Wall Street meltdown
   were noticing new faces in their shoppers  midst lately 
 Another discount avenue that is growing in popularity is
sample sales  where fashion companies aim to unload excess
goods at deep discounts  They have traditionally been held in
cities like New York or Los Angeles  but a number of companies
have emerged that now do the same thing online 
 Top Button is one such company  which said it is getting a
boost as fashionistas become more bargain conscious and the
credit crisis forces some fashion brands out of business 
  We haven t seen a decrease in shopping   said Top Button
co founder Michael Feldman   If anything  it s been a lot
more   The company s original site TopButton com has
information about actual sample sales while a newer site 
TopSecret com  holds virtual sample sales 
 A recent event featured Andrew Marc coats at 65 percent off
retail  Feldman said they sold 1 200 pieces in five hours 
  People still have to go to parties  They may change their
shopping habits     but life doesn t stop   Feldman said 
 That sentiment is being shared by executives at Ann Taylor 
which usually sells many special occasion items like dresses 
cashmere sweaters and party tops during November and December 
  Even in these challenging times  we still believe there
will be parties  although they may take on a slightly different
tone   said spokeswoman Maria Sceppaguercio 
 For Laurice Rahme  founder and chief executive of boutique
perfume maker Bond No  9  there may be fewer party invitations
this year  but no drop off in shopping  especially when it
comes to her favorite designer  Marc Jacobs 
  It just happened that his collection is terrific this
year  I just have to have one  item from it    Rahme said

142961,364476,JWN,RPT Wall St Week Ahead  Wal Mart may give rally some legs,news," Repeating column initially transmitted late Friday 
 By Ellis Mnyandu
 NEW YORK  May 10  Reuters    U S  stocks should rally this
week  and push the Dow into positive territory for the year 
with bank stress tests out of the way and investors hopeful
retail sales will reinforce views the economy is on the mend 
 The week may provide clarity on whether the recent signs of
stabilization are translating into profits  with Wal Mart
Stores Inc among several big retailers due to post quarterly
results 
 Although the Standard   Poor s 500 Index is up 37 percent
from the bear market closing low of early March and the risk of
a pullback is mounting  analysts said renewed confidence about
banks  health should be enough to keep the bulls in charge a
little longer 
 A speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke about the
financial system s condition on Monday will keep the spotlight
on what is ahead for banks 
  Now that the stress tests are out  we have some certainty
in terms of where banks stand in the spectrum of stronger to
weaker   said Richard Sparks  senior equities analyst and
options trader at Schaeffer s Investment Research in
Cincinnati 
  It seems the path of least resistance is upward  I
certainly see the S P 500 reaching 1 000 as a distinct
possibility in the next several weeks  
 And as the first quarter earnings season is winding down 
the spotlight will fall on anything that could spark more hopes
the recession that started in December 2007 is waning 
 CPI AND RETAILERS   REPORT CARDS 
 Besides Wednesday s data on April retail sales and March
business inventories  other key indicators will be readings on
March international trade on Tuesday  weekly jobless claims and
the April Producer Price Index on Thursday  followed by
Friday s May consumer sentiment data and April reports on
industrial production and the Consumer Price Index 
 A May survey of New York State manufacturing activity is
also due on Friday 
 A Reuters poll of economists forecasts April retail sales
will be flat compared with a 1 2 percent decline in March 
Excluding autos  sales are forecast to gain 0 2 percent versus
a drop of 0 9 percent in March 
 On the earnings front  it is the major retailers  including
Wal Mart  a Dow component  as well as Kohl s Corp  Macy s Inc
and Nordstrom Inc that will take center stage 
 Their quarterly scorecards will be scrutinized for clues
about the financial health of U S  consumers  whose spending
accounts for about two thirds of U S  economic activity 
 According to Thomson Reuters data  through Friday about 85
percent of the S P 500 companies had reported their quarterly
results  and 65 percent beat estimates  8 percent came out in
line  and 28 percent missed projections 
  The market is going to continue to focus on signs the
economy is beginning to stabilize and eventually recover   said
Tim Ghriskey  chief investment officer of Solaris Asset
management in Bedford Hills  New York   We still don t know
exactly when that recovery will be or how strong it s going to
be  
 Bernanke is scheduled to speak on banking before the
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta conference at Georgia s Jekyll
Island on Monday at 7 30 p m   2330 GMT   Several other top Fed
officials are also due to speak at the same event 
 HOW DOES WALL ST SPELL RELIEF 
 The latest sign of some economic stabilization emerged from
Friday s April nonfarm payrolls report  Although the
unemployment rate soared to 8 9 percent  the highest since
September 1983  the data also showed that U S  employers cut
539 000 jobs last month  the fewest since October 
 Optimism about jobs data  along with relief about the bank
stress tests  sent Wall Street sharply higher and helped propel
the Nasdaq to its ninth straight weekly advance  the longest
winning streak since December 1999 
 For the week  the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 4 4
percent  the S P 500 climbed 5 9 percent  while the Nasdaq
added 1 2 percent 
 A further advance this week could yield a crucial milestone
since the Dow is the only major index that has yet to turn
positive for the year  At Friday s close  it was off 2 3
percent for the year to date 
 Technically  the S P 500 is now fewer than 30 points away
from breaking above its 200 day moving average  a closely
watched gauge of the broad market s strength 
 The S P 500 has not closed above its 200 day moving average
since December 2007  It is up 37 percent since the 12 year
closing low of March 9  but it is still off 40 percent from its
record high of October 2007

142966,364481,JWN,Premium Denim Retailer True Religion Has Filed For Bankruptcy,opinion,"On Wednesday  True Religion Apparel  a premium denim designer that soared in popularity in the late 2000s  announced it has filed for bankruptcy protection  signing a restructuring agreement with many of its lenders 
True Religion filed for creditor protection under Chapter 11 in the U S  bankruptcy court in the District of Delaware  the retailer listed assets and liabilities in the range of  100 million to  500 million  In a court filing  True Religion said it hopes it stay in business  but does plan on closing some store locations 
Under the restructuring deal with lenders  TowerBrook Capital Partners which is the New York provate equity firm that owns the jeans retailer will slash True Religion s debt by  350 million  or about 75   TowerBrook  which also owns J  Jill   NYSE JILL    Kaporal Jeans  and the NHL s St  Louis Blues  will still retain a minority stake 
The plan also provides for full payment of claims of True Religion s continuing trade creditors  including landlords  suppliers  and vendors  The company expects the reorganization to take 90 to 120 days 
 After a careful review  we are taking an important step to reduce our debt  reinvigorate True Religion s iconic brand and position the company for future growth and success   John Ermatinger  the company s president and CEO  said in a statement 
True Religion was founded back in 2002  and is based outside of Los Angeles  With more than 140 stores in 33 states and foreign markets  the denim retailer also sells its product in department stores like Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    Saks Fifth Avenue  and Bloomingdales  which is owned by Macy s   NYSE M   
True Religion said its business had been hurt by discounts at other retailers  a common foe in the industry  as well as online competition and interestingly  the athleisure trend  Consumer tastes have also been shifting  moving away from the  trendy  denim that True Religion is known for and moving towards more classic  versatile denim styles

142984,364499,JWN,Is Nordstrom  JWN  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Nordstrom  Inc    NYSE JWN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Nordstrom has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 30  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 39  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Nordstrom s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 16 77  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Retail   Apparel and Shoes industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 21  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Nordstrom has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 15 67  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Nordstrom has a P S ratio of about 0 54  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Nordstrom currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes JWN a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 29  which is slightly better than the industry average of 7 47  Clearly  JWN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Nordstrom might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  C   This gives JWN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days and seven lower  while the full year estimate has seen five upward revisions and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by about 4 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen by about 2 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Nordstrom  Inc  Price and Consensus    This mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNordstrom is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 10  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Retail   Apparel and Shoes sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Stocks to Ride a 588  Revenue ExplosionAt Zacks  we re mostly focused

142986,364501,JWN,Amazon Prime Wardrobe Wants To Be Your Favorite Fashion Subscription Service ,opinion,"Just days after Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN    that it is acquiring organic grocery chain Whole Foods Market   NASDAQ WFM    the e commerce giant has unveiled a new tier to its Prime membership 
Dubbed Prime Wardrobe  this newly announced component to Amazon s growing retail division is comprised of subscription based boxes filled with clothing  shoes  and other fashion accessories of your choosing  Customers can pick from brands like Calvin Klein  Adidas   OTC ADDYY    Levi s  Timex  Lacoste  and more 
Customers must pick at least three items  and once the Prime Wardrobe box arrives at your home  you have seven days to try on and decide of the items you picked are right for you  For the items that you have decided not to keep  just drop off at a UPS location or schedule a free pick up  the boxes are resealable and come with a prepaid label for this purpose 

With Prime Wardrobe  customers are able to fill up a box with various apparel items at no upfront cost  and only pay for the items they end up liking and keeping  It s a  service that brings the fitting room to you  so you can try the latest styles and find your perfect fit before you buy   said Amazon 
And  if you really hit the shopping jackpot and keep five or more items from an order  Amazon will give you 20  off 
Subscription Fashion
Prime Wardrobe mimics popular subscription fashion companies like Stitch Fix  Le Tote  and Trunk Club  which is owned by Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    Stitch Fix  for example  costs  20 per box  and after answering a questionnaire  you re connected with a personal stylist that selects three pieces of clothing and two accessories for you  The  20 fee is applied towards any items you purchase  and if you buy all five items  you get 25  off the entire purchase 
Le Tote works similarly  but costs  49 per month  After creating a style profile  you re also connected with a personal stylist  who then fills a box with three pieces of clothing and two accessories  While you can keep and wear the items from your box for as long as you like  you ll be charged  59 on the same day every month  You can also keep any of the items  just send the rest back and the company will charge your credit card 
Trunk Club  on the other hand  elevates the stylist experience  but doesn t consider itself a subscription service  It has  Clubhouses  across the country where you can visit and try on a curated selection of clothing picked out just for you  Or  a stylist will send you  trunks  of personalized clothing to your home  you ll have five days to try everything on at home  and a  25 styling fee will be credited towards whatever you choose to keep 
It s clear that Prime Wardrobe aims to be somewhere in the middle of these three fashion services  and hopes that its Prime distinction will help it stand out  It ll be interesting to see how Amazon integrates its   which is the company s latest Alexa powered device that can take photos and videos of you in your favorite outfit  Amazon will likely want to boost its in house fashion brands like Lark   Ro too  and offering discounts on these labels if you use Prime Wardrobe could be a simple way to do that 
Prime Wardrobe is currently in beta  but you can sign up to be notified when it officially launches

142989,364504,JWN,Bed Bath   Beyond  Be Careful Of The Free Cash Flow Defense ,opinion,"Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  NASDAQ BBBY  reported 1Q earnings that were drastically below what were already low expectations heading into the quarter  The company reported EPS of  0 53  which was well below consensus of  0 66  and the stock declined 12  on Friday 
There have been some contrarians that have come out in defense of the company  arguing that Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  generates significant free cash flow and returns much of that in the form of share buybacks and dividends 
But here s why that argument is misguided  This sort of defense works for a company like Staples  where profitability is stable  and net income is flat  This is not the case for Bed Bath   Beyond  which has deteriorating fundamentals across the board  Free cash flow will eventually follow  meaning that share buybacks and repurchases are not sustainable 
To show this  I ll first walk through the deterioration in fundamentals  I ll then connect this to free cash flow and show how that hurts the free cash flow outlook going forward  Finally I ll address what I see as the bull case is for the stock 
Comps Struggling Amid Competition
The argument that I laid out several years ago is still largely the same    
1Q17  came in at  2   which was well below expectations for roughly flat comps  Outside of 2008  this was the worst comp in the data that we have going back to 1992  and the 5th negative comp in the last 6 quarters 


Source  Company filings

Sales were flat as Bed Bath and Beyond opened more stores  But comps are the thing to key in on as they show the underlying trends at their stores 
Within the comp  digital channels grew north of 20   while store comps declined by mid single digits  While digital was a bright spot  it s important to note that margins are lower in the digital channel  as I ll detail later   and they appear to be coming at the expense of their stores  where store comps deteriorated further 
Management has a number of initiatives to get trends back in order  The company continues to test a membership program and is strengthening its digital properties  Additionally  the company is expanding its online assortment 
Importantly  management noted that trends so far in June were slightly better and were tracking more in line with management s prior guidance of flat to slightly positive 
So what does this mean for the outlook  It s difficult to see what will improve comps from here  The company has clearly been losing share to competitors for some time now  and I m skeptical of their initiatives getting customers back to the brand  Consensus expectations are for comps to remain negative  and I would not be surprised if this turned more sharply negative in the coming quarters 


Source  Company filings  brokerage estimates
Margins continue to erode
The margin picture is also similar to the case I outlined back in 2015   the company is investing heavily to drive growth  and margins will continue to deteriorate  going forward Gross margins have declined by roughly 60 90 basis points fairly consistently for the last several years  and 1Q17 continued that trend with a 91 basis point decline  100 basis points on an adjusted basis  


Source  Company filings

Management noted that the declines were driven by 1  increased e commerce shipping expense as a result of their  29 minimum free shipping policy  and 2  increased coupon redemptions  those big Bed Bath and Beyond coupons you get in the mail  
It s difficult to see either of these two headwinds alleviating any time soon  and very concerning to think that comps were still below expectations despite favorable discounts to the consumer  One might consider the idea that the company would slow discounts or eliminate the shipping policy  but comps would then likely turn even more negative  Bulls can take some comfort from the fact that the company will lap its  29 shipping policy in 2Q  which should help somewhat  but this will likely only make the decline less severe 
On the SG A front  the company continues to see significant deleverage  SG A deleveraged 150 basis points  which was 70 basis points worse than where expectations were 


Source  Company filings

The primary drivers were increased advertising expense  payroll and payroll related expenses  and tech related expenses  The company has stated that they will continue to invest in the business to get customers back to the brand  so these expenses don t appear to be improving any time soon  And with comps potentially negative going forward  this makes SG A leverage even more difficult 
With a dire outlook on both gross margin and SG A expense  analysts are expecting total operating margin to continue to decline over the next two years

Deteriorating fundamentals a bad sign for free cash flow
Here s where the above argument connects with the free cash flow argument  Deterioration in comps and operating margins are the primary inputs that are going to negatively impact net income  Analysts are currently modeling a 19  decline in net income in 2017 and a further 14  decline in 2018  And net income is the primary input into free cash flow  shown below 


Source  Company filings  brokerage estimates

Some bulls might point to 2016 when net income declined by 18  and yet free cash flow actually grew by  26 million  One can see that this was primarily due to changes in working capital  which became significantly less negative in that year  That s fine and dandy  but changes in working capital cannot offset net income declines of  150 million forever 
So what we re left with is  consensus  free cash flow year over year declines of   150 million and   50 million in 2017 and 2018  respectively  Could the company continue to buy back shares and return dividends to shareholders  Yes  but the key questions are 
1  At what level will they continue when free cash flow is declining  and
2  Will those returns to you as a shareholder offset what is likely to be continued stock declines should fundamentals continue to deteriorate 
On the first question  I would argue that share buybacks have already begun to slow  In 1Q17 Bed Bath   Beyond repurchased  127M of stock in 1Q17  a decline from the  171M in 4Q16  As free cash flow generation declines  the company can afford less share repurchases and dividends 
On the second point  let s not forget that while Bed Bath   Beyond has returned capital to shareholders over the last several years  the stock has done this 


Source  Google Finance

Generally  stocks don t react well to deteriorating fundamentals due to what I ve highlighted above  Since the beginning of 2015  Bed Bath   Beyond stock is now down 61  vs FCF deterioration of 1  between 2015 and 2016  or a 23  decline off of forecasted FCF declines in 2017  
The message from all of this  be careful with free cash flow arguments  especially when fundamentals are declining across the board 
A different bull argument  resurging interest in retail
There s other bull arguments for the stock finding support  and potentially going up from here  though 
  With the company struggling and the stock valuation now strongly anticipating further fundamental declines  it is possible that private equity or another buyer  potentially another company in the home furnishings space  may become interested in Bed Bath and Beyond  We have already seen this occur with several other retailers that have similarly struggled  The obvious example is of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  s recent announced acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc  NASDAQ WFM   Additionally  there has been rumored interest from private equity in Staples and Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   and investors are likely beginning to look at Dick s Sporting Goods Inc  NYSE DKS  as well  Furthermore  we ve seen this occur with numerous other retailers in the past  including PetSmart and Aeropostale  In such a scenario  the buyer would purchase shares at a premium to today s prices and send the stock up 
  Management s numerous initiatives could prove effective and stem share losses  and at least help the company maintain share within the space  With the stock now anticipating further sales declines  signs of stability would send the stock significantly higher 
These arguments  especially the former  make me a bit more hesitant to forecast such a dire outlook for the stock  But one should be careful of the free cash returning capital to shareholders argument  as that doesn t appear sustainable ",2017-06-25,The Non-Consensus,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bed-bath---beyond:-be-careful-of-the-free-cash-flow-defense-200197298,200197298

We had a bunch of stuff happening today  The Dow Industrials hit a record high intraday  but could not hold on for a record high close  The trading session went from positive to negative and back 
The NASDAQ Composite did manage a new record high  But it looks like markets are still trying to digest everything  The S P 500 traded in a range of about one half of one percent 
The VIX  the volatility index  also known as the  fear gauge   held at historically low levels  The dollar and bonds both traded lower but nothing out of the daily norm 
Let s start with the testimony of former FBI Director Jim Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee  The public hearing lasted nearly 3 hours  I won t try to recap everything  One or two interesting points  None of the senators questioning Comey tried to claim that Comey was lying about his representation of his meetings with President Trump  however there was sharp disagreement over the significance of their conversations 
A one point  Comey said Trump lied  None of the senators tried to claim Trump did not lie  However  after the hearing  Trump s lawyer  and spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders had the unenviable task of proclaiming the president is not a liar  Comey did not answer some of the most pointed questions because of the classified nature  He later testified before a closed door committee  We do not know what he said there 
We certainly learned more today than yesterday  when Intelligence chiefs Coats and Rogers stonewalled the Committee  but what Comey said in public is not the be all  end all of this investigation  no matter how much you might want to debate about the minutiae and innuendo and nuances of the testimony 
While it was compelling television  it is just one small piece of the puzzle  nothing that exonerated nor nailed the coffin  Perhaps the most important thing we learned today is that contemporaneous memorandums of communication carry probative value 
In other words  it was a smart move to keep a diary  The bottom line is  when Comey was fired 

Comey  is going to consume most of the oxygen in Washington for the foreseeable future 

We are not seeing much progress on tax reform or an infrastructure plan  This doesn t mean nothing is happening  just that it is now on a back burner  and time is running out  The Senate is working on its version of Trumpcare but if they can t come up with something substantially different than the House  it will be dead on arrival 
Today  the House of Representatives voted largely along party lines to replace the 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street reform law  a move that is expected to die in the Senate but open the door to revamping or eliminating regulations that came out of the 2007 09 financial crisis  No real word on what might replace Dodd Frank  other than the prospect of just letting the banksters run wild 
The  left interest rates and policies unchanged while trimming expectations for inflation through 2019  While that was largely expected  the shared currency fell as ECB President Mario Draghi said in his news conference that the euro area still isn t generating enough inflation  overshadowing improved prospects for the economy that led officials to upgrade their growth assessment 
The change in the assessment of risks for the economy sets the scene for the ECB to start a discussion about the timing for the removal of the stimulus  but that is apparently a debate for another day 
According to an  released shortly after voting ended  Prime Minister Theresa May will win 314 seats in Britain s election  short of a majority in the 650 seat parliament  That is an exit poll  not official results 
Prime Minister May called the snap election in a bid to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations  to win more time to deal with the impact of the divorce and to strengthen her grip on the Conservative Party  It appears that her electoral gamble failed  If the exit polling numbers hold  it means May s Conservative Party would have to form a coalition or attempt to govern with the backing of other smaller parties 
For investors  the over riding factor is likely to be greater uncertainty about whether there will be a deal on Brexit and what it will look like  A delay in forming a government could push back the start of Brexit talks  currently scheduled for June 19  and reduce the time available for what are expected to be the most complex negotiations in post World War Two European history 
Labour  led by veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn  could attempt to form a government with those smaller parties  which strongly oppose most of May s policies on domestic issues such as public spending cuts 
If Corbyn s Labour does take power with the backing of the Scottish nationalists and the Liberal Democrats  both parties adamantly opposed to Brexit  Britain s future will be very different to the course the Conservatives were planning and could even raise the possibility of a second referendum  The unofficial exit polls sent a small shock through markets  pushing the pound sterling down 
Brazil s top electoral court excluded testimony of engineering company executives from an illegal campaign funding trial against President Michel Temer  a move that suggested it would throw out a case that had threatened to unseat him 
The Commerce Department s quarterly services survey  or QSS  showed consumer spending  including healthcare spending  increased at a faster clip than the government had assumed in its second estimate of gross domestic product published last month 
The QSS data suggested first quarter GDP could be revised up to as high as a 1 5 percent annualized rate from the 1 2 percent growth pace reported in May  Growth in the current quarter may be above 3 percent  due to payback from the first quarter s 1 2 percent reading  but the underlying trend appears to be holding steady at close to 2 percent for the year 
The Federal Reserve reports net worth of U S  households and nonprofit groups rose by  2 35 trillion  or 2 5 percent  to  94 84 trillion in the first quarter from the previous three month period  Household wealth has grown  boosted mostly by a 5 5 percent gain in the Standard   Poor s 500 Index last quarter and house price appreciation that matched the biggest year over year increase since 2014 
Now  the bad news  Household debt increased at a faster rate  or 3 2 percent  as mortgage borrowing advanced at a 3 percent pace  Other forms of consumer credit  including auto and student loans  climbed at a 5 percent rate  the slowest since 2013

Claims have now been below 300 000  a threshold associated with a healthy labor market  for 118 straight weeks  Low layoffs and record high job openings suggest a deceleration in job growth in May was likely because companies could not find suitable workers  Labor market tightness could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13 14 policy meeting

Weak Retail Earnings Reports to End Last Week

	A combination of soft economic readings and some more weak earnings reports from traditional retailers are weighing on stocks today  The April Retail Sales and CPI readings this morning came in weaker than expected  though the prior month s Retail Sales growth pace did get revised higher 

	The run of April data in recent days  the first set of numbers for the second quarter  is showing a rebound in the U S  economy s growth rate from the first quarter s sub par pace  but the extent of the growth rebound has been less than impressive  The Atlanta Fed s real time GDP estimate tracker currently pegs Q2 growth at  3 6  following this morning s data  unchanged from before 

	J C  Penney  NYSE         became the latest retailer this morning to disappoint with same store sale data  which follows similar underperformance from Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   Macy s and Kohl s on Thursday  These reports reconfirm what we all knew all along   that these operators needed literally to reinvent their businesses to effectively compete with the likes of Amazon  A number of these retailers are still very profitable and have strong balance sheets  which will keep them around for a long time  So  Macy s and Nordstrom aren t going away  at least not any time soon  But for them to become thriving and growing operations again  they will not only need to aggressively shrink their brick and mortar footprint  but also stock up with differentiated merchandize 

	We provide the Q1 earnings season scorecard below  but please note that this daily publication features the best research output of the Zacks analyst team  In today s write up  we are featuring analyst reports on 16 major stocks  including reports on Amazon  NASDAQ           Verizon  NYSE          Citigroup  NYSE         and Amgen  NASDAQ           These reports have been hand picked from amongst the 70 or so stock research reports published by our analyst team today  You can see all of today s research reports       

Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard   as of Thursday  May 12th  

	Including this morning s releases  we now have Q1 reports from 454 S P 500 members and another 18 index members on deck to report results next week  Total earnings for these index members are up  13 9  from the same period last year on  7 9  higher revenues  with 72 3  beating EPS estimates and 65 9  beating revenue estimates  The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 51 6   As we have been saying all along  this better performance than we have seen from the same group of 454 index members in other recent periods 

	For the Retail sector  we now have Q1 results from 24 of the 42 retailers in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these 24 retailers are up  2 2  from the same period last year on  4 6  higher revenues  with 58 3  beating EPS estimates and 54 2  beating revenue estimates 

	Please note that we have a stand alone Retail sector  unlike the official Standard   Poor s placement of this space in the Consumer Discretionary sector  The Zacks Retail sector includes  besides the traditional department stores and other brick and mortar retailers  the online vendors like Amazon and Priceline and restaurant operators  Most of the 24 Zacks Retail sector companies that have reported Q1 results already at this stage are online vendors and restaurant players  with the traditional retail operators starting the reporting process with Thursday s Macy s disappointment that was maintained by Nordstrom after the market s close on Thursday and JC Penney this morning 

	The aggregate results from the 24 retailers that have reported Q1 results already are tracking below what we had seen from the same companies in other recent periods  This is despite the  41 1  growth in Amazon s earnings on  22 6  higher revenues  On an ex Amazon basis  the sector s Q1 earnings growth would be modestly in the negative

Today s Featured Stock Research Reports 

Amazon  s shares have outperformed the broader market in the year to date period  the stock is up  26 4  vs  the  7 2  gain for the S P 500 as a whole   The company delivered strong first quarter results with both earnings and revenues beating expectations  The Zacks analyst likes the company s solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy  and content addition continues to add selection to Prime memberships  Also  the AWS generates much higher margins than retail  so it has a very positive impact on Amazon s profitability  Devices and IoT is also a potential growth area  However  Prime saturation in the U S  market and competition in online retail remains concern   You can     

	Shares of Verizon have been laggards over the past year   the stock is down  9 6  over the past 12 months vs  AT T  NYSE T  s  1 8  decline and the  16 9  gain for the S P 500 index  Verizon s latest deal to acquire Straight Path Communications for  3 1 billion is part of its recent efforts to maintain its wireless leadership while branching out into adjacent opportunities  The company s decision to launch FiOS Prepaid plan  FiOS Internet service and to zero rate its data on FiOS Mobile App should help it gain subscribers while unlimited data plans have heated up the wireless industry  The Verizon Yahoo deal underwent a discount revision of  350 million  but is part of the company s efforts to add content  a TV streaming service is reportedly being contemplated  In the updated research report issued today  the Zacks analyst discusses the pros   cons of investing in Verizon shares at this stage   You can     

Citigroup  shares have gained around  2 1  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Major Banks industry  which has gained  1 5  over the same period  The company s first quarter 2017 earnings outpaced expectations on higher revenues  The Zacks analyst likes the company s restructuring and streamlining efforts  strategic investments in core business and expense management and believes these actions should support profitability going forward  Uncertainty about regulatory overhaul and interest rates are concerns in the Citigroup story  as they are for all other major banks   You can     

Amgen  shares struggled last year  but came back strong following the election as fears of restrictive pricing and regulatory strictures eased  The stock has been down in a big way since March 1st  but has still done better than the peer group over the past year  The Zacks analyst points out that Amgen remains well positioned for growth with several blockbuster drugs in its portfolio  Amgen s growth products   Prolia  Xgeva  Vectibix  Nplate and Sensipar   are all performing well  Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline including biosimilar drugs  given quite a few regulatory and data updates scheduled for the coming quarters  However  the company has some challenges in store given the presence of biosimilar competition and slowdown in sales of mature products  Volume growth of new products may not be enough to offset the lost sales due to the decline in mature brands   You can

Nordstron is approaching a solid support level around the  37 75 level  which happens to be the 200 month moving average  Believe it or not  moving averages are very important on all time frames  Traders should look for this  37 75 level to be defended by the institutional crowd  This important area on JWN stock was also defended in June 2016 and should find support again when retested ",2017-05-16,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/not-all-retail-stocks-are-created-equal-200189474,200189474

The company s chief financial officer Karen Hoguet voiced her concern that the company s full year gross margins could be 60 to 80 points lower year over year  and might also be down 100 basis points for the quarter  On top of that  Macy s continues to drop its retail prices as it fights to reach its earnings forecast  which the company recently reaffirmed 
Macy s stock currently hovers fractionally above its 52 week low of  22 04  which is also only slightly above its 5 year low   I have tremendous faith in the power of the Macy s brand and brand s ability to strengthen its bond with customers      We don t have all the answers  but we are working hard to figure it out  
Macy s shares have lost 35  of their value in the past year alone as e commerce powers such as Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   continue to erode the department store giant s customers and profits 
The company noted today that it is looking for new and innovative ways to use its existing stores to help bring in more cash after Macy s posted same store sales declines for the  
The failing department store is in the midst of closing roughly 100 stores  which is about 15  of the company s brick and mortar locations  Last month  Gennette didn t rule out the possibility of closing more stores

Please note that we have a stand alone Retail sector  unlike the official Standard   Poor s placement of this space in the Consumer Discretionary sector  The Zacks Retail sector includes  besides the traditional department stores and other brick and mortar retailers  the online vendors like Amazon and Priceline and restaurant operators  Most of the 24 Zacks Retail sector companies that have reported Q1 results already at this stage are online vendors and restaurant players  with the traditional retail operators starting the reporting process with Thursday s Macy s disappointment that was maintained by Nordstrom after the market s close on Thursday and JC Penney this morning 
The aggregate results from the 24 retailers that have reported Q1 results already are tracking below what we had seen from the same companies in other recent periods  This is despite the  41 1  growth in Amazon s earnings on  22 6  higher revenues  On an ex Amazon basis  the sector s Q1 earnings growth would be modestly in the negative

143064,364579,JWN,Naked Brand Group  NAKD  Stock  How Bendon May Build A Powerhouse Brand,opinion,"Naked Brand Group Inc
Investors who are attracted to emerging companies are not exactly a rare breed  but  for all intents and purposes  they do share some inherent traits that make them somewhat of a renegade spirit in the investment world  Let s face it  these investors aren t easily phased by turbulent volatility  are willing to look past transgressions  and for the most part  are willing to undertake a significant risk in order to generate a meaningful reward 
Now  what if there was an emerging story that can offer investors the best of all worlds  a superior management team  a well capitalized balance sheet  and an actual brand that has already established a remarkable footprint worldwide  Would you read that story  If you are not intrigued yet  read on  because investors may soon be treated to witness the process behind the building of a brand  and the real time saga of how an iconic brand like Bendon is going to transform a relatively small company  Naked  NASDAQ NAKD  intimate and innerware apparel  into a national brand capable of defining a new era of the way undergarments are marketed and sold 
Bendon Can Be Naked Too
Some investors are probably already familiar with NAKD apparel  but they may have failed to realize that an investment opportunity was also at hand  Naked is not a new brand of underwear and intimate apparel  In fact  with the label being sold since 2010  they have established a strong and genuine reputation  formalizing engaging relationships with the likes of HSN  Macy s  NYSE M   Bloomingdale s  and other major department store chains throughout the United States  But  even well liked and emerging brands  like Naked  eventually need deep pocketed support on their drive toward profitability  And  this is where Bendon plays the critical role in propelling not only NAKD  but their own company as well  perpetuating their iconic name in additional worldwide markets 
Let s not kid ourselves  While NAKD can deliver additional value and market opportunity to Bendon  the real hero of this story is Bendon  and the proposed deal to merge with Naked Brand Group demonstrates how they can utilize their global company  size  strength and management expertise to bring near term shareholder value to investors that have already bought into the company s brand story 
Bendon  in its 70 year history  brings enormous opportunity to NAKD shareholders  but Naked Brand Group is contributing some well earned assets as well  For instance  Naked has seen its brand sales grow and has also attracted enormous talent to endorse its men s line of athleisure wear  with Dwayne Wade serving the endorsement role in the men s category  And  with Bendon delivering an evergreen partnership agreement with Heidi Klum  the combined marketing power in just the intimate apparel and undergarment segment may continue to prove a lucrative market for Bendon and Naked Brand Group alike  If you are a NAKD shareholder  having an interested partner like Bendon may be equivalent to hitting the jackpot on a one armed bandit 
Let s be honest  while celebrity endorsements can be bought and paid for on some levels  it doesn t happen in the case of Klum and Wade  Their endorsements are sincere and powerful  and they deliver a message that both Bendon and Naked brand of underwear and intimate apparel are products worthy of consumer attention  NAKD  for their part  is pioneering a new method of design  using innate features in their line which provides extreme comfort through the use of innovative manufacturing processes  such as  second skin  feeling fabric that is seam free and silver infused 
Some investors question why Bendon would be so eager to merge with a company like NAKD  whose revenue is less than 2  of Bendon s trailing twelve months revenue  It s because Bendon is quick to recognize and seize upon potential  Already enjoying consistent growth  NAKD has engaged in an exclusive partnership for one of its brands with HSN  a premier shopping network that offers a premium showcase for the brand  At the same time  NAKD has positioned the brand to be a specialty garment  allowing for pricing power in an industry where margins have historically been razor thin 
Led by industry veteran Carole Hochman  CEO of Naked Brands  the company has fortified its presence by capitalizing on its management expertise  Banking off of her skill set  NAKD is already positioned to penetrate through the barriers that exist in the apparel industry  barriers that can be prohibitive  especially for companies that are working to develop value through e commerce and brick and mortar placements  While NAKD  too  has seen its growth hamstrung by small and emerging brands  Bendon offers a competitive advantage by providing NAKD the opportunity to take advantage of the many Bendon distribution channels  allowing the brand a real opportunity for success 
Bendon And The NAKD Truth
The global intimate apparel market is significant  currently being pegged as an  82 billion market  Even more impressive for those keeping score  the already substantial market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 17  through the year 2020  keeping the investment opportunity fresh and compelling  Unlike other consumer products  the intimate apparel market has remained relatively strong during economic downturns  in fact  the market even remained stable during the Great Recession  Pockets of growth have been demonstrated for only a small handful of intimate apparel brands  and Bendon has been a worthy inclusion into that select group 
During the past few years  there has been an influx of new and smaller players into the space  facilitated by the relative ease of building a small scale e commerce site  However  the reality of actually building and maintaining a profitable business strategy beyond the initial launch proves well beyond the reach of most emerging brands  as the customer acquisition costs  lack of an integrated infrastructure  and the barriers in place that can stifle sustainable growth are mostly underestimated by new brands on the block 
Despite the brand and name recognition sometimes enjoyed by small and aspiring brands  in many instances these names only tend to provide a handsome salary to the brand owners  with product sales often unable to provide much of the additional capital required to take a brand beyond the  20 million revenue level 
Without a solid infrastructure and a richly experienced management team in place  the opportunities for growth are minimal  regardless of how well a brand may be received by consumers  In an industry where a single stitching error can cost a company multi millions of dollars in lost sales and wasted expense  a company that does not launch with a well organized and integrated business plan is often destined to fill the racks at national discount chains  Under Bendon s tutelage  don t expect to find NAKD there 
Perhaps Bendon recognized this quality early on in NAKD  Knowing the potential limitations of product and market development for smaller brands  Bendon appears to be taking aim at emerging opportunities to expand its consumer base  For NAKD  by being able to take advantage of Bendon s significant market position and worldwide distribution platform  the journey forward for investors may prove to be a smooth ride  No doubt  NAKD investors may have hit the jackpot  as a finalized reverse merger will take their investment into a small  2M revenue company  and facilitate ownership into a much bigger and established worldwide player in Bendon 
Bendon Gets Naked
For NAKD shareholders  the Bendon alliance may be a windfall  Bendon holds a 70 year history deeply rooted in innovation and lifestyle excellence  Its founder is considered a pioneer of modern women s lingerie  breaking away from styles that included heavy and restrictive corsetry  designing garments that allowed free flow and non restrictive fits  These innovative features quickly put Bendon on the lingerie map  allowing Australian lingerie to emerge into the competitive arena on the world stage 
Inclusive of Heidi Klum Intimates  Bendon nurtures its own established portfolio of brands  with eight company owned brands and three licensed brands in its stable of intimate apparel and swimwear 
Managing growth  Bendon has a distinguished and experienced executive team  which has built a formidable infrastructure and business operating platform that is conducive to facilitating continuous organic growth as well as the all important integration of acquisitions 
Bendon s global distribution and operations platform may turn out to be the perfect fit for NAKD  In January of 2017  NAKD entered into a Letter of Intent with Bendon Limited for a proposed merger of the two companies  Assuming the Merger Agreement is ratified by both boards  the parties expect to seek approval from NAKD shareholders during the first quarter of 2017  subject to SEC review  A merger with Bendon opens the door to tremendous growth and market opportunity for NAKD shareholders and the likelihood of shareholders not endorsing this proposed merger is low  Clearly  the advantages in consummating the deal are a boon for NAKD shareholders  noting that once NAKD is rolled up  they become part of a much larger and far more powerful company  effectively becoming Bendon 
NAKD Undressed
NAKD is bringing a modest  but consistent record of growth to the table  The company has recorded sales growth in both retail and e commerce sales  posting a 74  increase in quarter over quarter sales in the third quarter of 2016  Additionally  for the nine months ended October 31  2016  NAKD s net sales increased by 38  to  1 292 132  driven primarily by sales expansion into new department stores that include Saks Fifth Avenue  Bloomingdale s  Chico s and Dillard s 
Key partnerships are expected to drive continued growth  utilizing exclusive A list talent like Dwayne Wade  who will endorse and spearhead their Naked Truth marketing campaign  Taking advantage of Wade s tremendous social media following  estimated to be in excess of 9 million followers  NAKD capitalized on his social media strengths to launch  Wade x Naked  in October of 2016 at Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  s  Nordstrom com  and wearnaked com  The  Wade x Naked  began generating revenue in the third quarter of 2016 
Investors are anticipating growth in the next financial release  which is expected to show continued traction in all segments of NAKD s categories 
Bendon Dressed
Bendon  an iconic worldwide brand  is no stranger to delivering impressive financial results  Its global brands include some of the most recognized lingerie brands in Australia  the USA  and the UK  The company has an evergreen partnership in place with Heidi Klum  securing perpetual and mutual benefits  and has maintained focus on its core competencies in the design and development of bras  briefs  swimwear  and sleepwear Bendon has demonstrated consistent growth in revenue and earnings  with trailing twelve months revenue  ttm  of  119 million in 2016  and an impressive ttm gross margin of 50 3  of sales  The strong gross margin can be attributed to a host of synergies  but the company s highly efficient sourcing and logistics network  which provides market agility and economies of scale  acts as the primary bread winner for Bendon 
Bendon s global footprint has consistently increased over time  The company s presence is now in 34 countries  with distribution to over 4000 unique customer doors  Additionally  the company benefits from the Omni channel platform with online  wholesale  and company owned retail and outlet stores peppered throughout its worldwide operations  Sales are generated through a loyal and diverse customer base  with customers ranging in age and social demographic 
Bendon s brand portfolio is segmented into three categories  The first segment contains its global flagship products which include Heidi Klum Intimates  Heidi Klum Man  and Heidi Klum Swimwear  These lines secure tremendous online presence through the company s e commerce site  and positions the garments as a premium fashion brand for marketing and commercialization purposes  These products offer an accessible price point of between  25 and  99 per item or set 
The company s  Luxury  segment also enjoys global distribution  with specifically constructed marketing bringing the opulence of the brand to life  Utilizing premium positioning  the Luxury segment sets price points of between  50 and  170 per item or set 
Bendon s third business segment is its Moderate And Mass category  with the majority of its presence in Australia and New Zealand  For the United States market  Bendon offers its iconic  Fredericks of Hollywood  line of intimate apparel through its online distribution channel  This category provides a dominant heritage market position and sets retail price points between  20 and  69 per item or set

Bendon will immediately deliver value to NAKD  and NAKD may enjoy expanded revenue and meaningful distribution channels via Bendon  Additionally  Bendon delivers a significant global operations platform  with over 30 production partner facilities across Asia  Company owned distribution centers in New Zealand  the USA  China  and Hong Kong provide outlets to efficiently get products to their respective markets  and with supporting offices in New Zealand  Australia  Hong Kong  the USA  and the UK  logistical issues can be met directly with an executive team that is fluent with each respective market or region Dressed For Growth
Already powerful  Bendon can further set the stage to take advantage of significant opportunities generated from the NAKD merger  The merged company expects to initiate an incremental roll out of additional retail stores across new and existing markets around the globe  Bendon s distribution channels are anticipated to quickly facilitate an accelerated growth path for NAKD by allowing the efficient global platform to work its magic  expediting brand placement and offering immense logistical support to fuel and manage the projected growth of the NAKD brand 
However  it is not only the business platform that generates the efficiencies  As previously stated  the combined company will take keen advantage of Carole Hochman s talent  leveraging her expertise to build a compelling sleepwear business  focusing on building organic growth in the company  Additional category launches including resortwear  athleisure  and tween will also be in a position to benefit greatly from Ms  Hochman s talents 
What may offer the biggest opportunity for the combined business is the fragmented nature of the intimate apparel and swimwear industry globally  The company has been vocal that an acquisitive growth strategy  leveraging the capital market s platform to consolidate synergistic businesses is critical to its immediate and mid term game plan  In a market that has become highly fragmented due to the relative ease of initial entry  Bendon can utilize its expertise to take advantage of potential roll up opportunities  and continue to maintain itself in a position to consolidate segments of the industry  In that respect  the company believes that it has identified a potential deal pipeline that can generate in excess of  190 million in incremental revenue opportunity 
While the merged entity will be loaded with extremely valuable and proficient executive talent  an associate described to me the resulting entity to its core  which should cause investors to take an interested and genuine look at the value proposition this deal has to offer 
To paraphrase  he said that if Carole Hochman is placed into a role that allows her to do what she does best  which is building  developing  and acquiring new brands  then there is no limit as to how far Bendon s acquisitive ambitions can go  Investors should value her involvement  and with the Bendon muscle behind her  the investment opportunities are greatly magnified 
Taking into account all of the positives and accretive synergies to this proposed deal  investors may be well suited in considering an investment into this combined entity  So much so  in fact  that they may even feel eager and excited to join Klum and Wade   and walk around Naked

143069,364584,JWN,Are Retail Stocks A Buy As Border Tax Plan Loses Steam ,opinion,"One of the key election promises of President Trump was to levy a hefty tax on corporates who import goods into the U S   thus encouraging local manufacturing and therefore domestic jobs  The Republican controlled House of Representatives  plan for a border tax includes trimming corporate income tax from 35  to 20   while imposing a 20  tax on all imports and exempting export revenues from taxable income 
It s quite clear that the border adjusted tax would hurt the businesses of industries that rely on imports  Donald Trump had hinted that the  border adjustment  tax plan would be  too complicated   Analysts cited that the retail sector could be a victim of such a taxation policy  Nevertheless  retailers can now breathe a sigh of relief as the border adjustment tax loses some steam 
Let s Analyze the Implications
Since the past few years the  sector has been bearing the brunt of sluggish economic growth  cautious consumer spending  stiff competition  strong U S  dollar and volatile commodity costs  The implications were evident from retailers  dismal sales and earnings growth performance in the recent past  Apprehensions surrounding the imposition of border tax on imported goods further aggravated the woes 
Retailers  who are heavily dependent on imported goods to remain competitive  argue that such a tax would compel them to increase prices of merchandises such as apparel  textiles  computers  electronic items  cars and other imported goods  Ultimately  shoppers will have to shell out more 
Moreover  such a tax would also lower retailers  profits  since any significant change in prices could translate into lower volumes and sales  Industry experts believe that the border adjustment tax could wipe out retailers  earnings per share by 50  or more  Further  the trading countries could also retaliate by imposing tariffs on goods manufactured and exported from the U S 
There is another theory doing the rounds that the new tax regime would allow the dollar to appreciate against foreign currencies  This implies that companies will have to pay less to import goods  But there are concerns that if dollar fails to appreciate or does not appreciate to a level that can offset the burden  big companies will suffer  It will also be a nightmare for smaller companies who have less bargaining power to adjust cost 
Retail Stocks Likely to Benefit
The Retail Wholesale sector has not been a spectacular performer  We note that over the past one year  the sector has registered an increase of 9 5  compared with the S P 500 that advanced 14 4   However  the recent rebound in oil prices  an encouraging employment picture  and a gradual improvement in the manufacturing sector and housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode  Amid such a backdrop  the retail sector presents itself as a lucrative investment hub 
Further  as talks of a border adjustment tax plan gradually tones down amid low fanfare  it could provide the much needed impetus to the sector  Stocks like Wal Mart Stores  Inc    NYSE WMT    NIKE  Inc    NYSE NKE    Macy s Inc    NYSE M    Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY    Nordstrom  Inc    NYSE JWN    and others are likely to gain in the near term  until the tax plan comes into shape

143074,364589,JWN,Walmart Boosts Its Fashion Game With Possible Bonobos Acquisition,opinion,"America s largest retailer is seriously upping its fashion game  Wal Mart Stores Inc    NYSE WMT   is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire popular men s fashion retailer Bonobos  an up and coming brand based out of New York City 
This deal  if announced  would mark Walmart s fourth online retail acquisition through its digital chief Marc Lore Lore joined the company  last year in addition to women s online retailer ModCloth  online shoe site ShoeBuy  and outdoor gear and apparel seller Moosejaw 
According to   sources are saying both Walmart and Bonobos have agreed on a deal price  and that the transaction is in its final stages  The company generates between  100 million and  150 million in annual revenue  and was last valued at around  300 million  when it raised  55 million back in 2014 
Founded in 2007 by CEO Andy Dunn and Brian Spaly  Bonobos originally started out as an online only shop that sold high end dress pants designed to fit athletic men  The company then expanded  selling dress shirts  suits  and outerwear  with prices ranging from  98 for a dress shirt to  550 for a suit 
Bonobos also began selling its products through Nordstrom s   NYSE JWN   brick and mortar stores and e commerce site  and the department store giant became an investor in the company in 2012  Bonobos has opened physical stores of its own as well  called  Guideshops   and there are 30 locations across the U S  Here  customers can get fitted  try on numerous different items  and place orders to be delivered to their homes 
Like with its other digital acquisitions  Walmart and Bonobos  as brands  make little sense together on the surface  But if you look further  you ll see that Bonobos will likely greatly benefit from Walmart s huge retail and distribution network  something that will help the company grow and expand  For Walmart  Bonobos gives the retailer that fashion edge  helping the company potentially reach different demographics

143076,364591,JWN,What To Expect From Philip Morris  PM  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Leading international tobacco company  Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM   is all set to report its first quarter 2017 results on Apr 20  2017  before the market opens  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether the company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  Its earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average miss of 4  On the contrary  a look at Philip Morris  stock performance reveals that its shares have rallied 23 6  year to date  thereby outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 14 4  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Which Way Are Estimates Treading Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter has decreased by 2 cents  over the last seven days  However  the same has been stable at  4 89 for 2017 in the said time period 
The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 03 per share for the first quarter  reflects growth from 98 cents posted in the prior year period  Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  6 42 billion for the said quarter  which is also 5 5  higher than the year ago quarter  Philip Morris International Inc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 
   What Does the Zacks Model Unveil Our proven model does not conclusively show that Philip Morris is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Philip Morris has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at  1 03  Although the company s Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise Factors Influencing the QuarterPhilip Morris continues to benefit from its strong portfolio of tobacco brands and pricing power  Moreover  management remains focused on the growing e cigarette category and less harmful alternative tobacco products to cater to the changing consumer preferences Additionally  heatsticks and IQOS product category  Heatsticks that heat tobacco instead of burning it  are gaining popularity since its national expansion  Further  the company continues to boost presence in the unconventional tobacco category in an attempt to combat declining volumes  Regarding this  management has announced that it will invest approximately  300 million in order to convert one of its cigarette factory at Papastratos into a manufacturing plant for tobacco sticks for reduced risk product   iQOS While these factors make us optimistic about Philip Morris  upcoming results  we prefer to remain cautious about the huge excise tax increase in Argentina  the surge of illicit trade in Pakistan and the declining cigarette volumes  particularly  in Japan Further  ongoing anti tobacco campaigns and price rise to offset rising taxes are also hampering cigarette volumes  Moreover  increasing regulation over consumption of e cigarettes is also raising a concern Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat Newell Brands Inc    NYSE NWL   has an Earnings ESP of  13 79  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Energizer Holdings  Inc    NYSE ENR   has an Earnings ESP of  3 03  and a Zacks Rank  2 Nordstrom  Inc    NYSE JWN   has an Earnings ESP of  3 70  and a Zacks Rank  3

143078,364593,JWN,Wal Mart  WMT  To Buy Online Men s Fashion Retailer Bonobos,opinion,"Retail giant Wal Mart Stores Inc    NYSE WMT   is reportedly in talks to invest in Bonobos  one of the hottest men s clothing brands in the US  according to Recode  The retail giant is seeking to expand in the fast growing online retail market and compete with the largest U S  online retailer  Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN    As per sources  Wal Mart  the biggest U S  retailer seeks to invest  70 million in Bonobos  though final terms of the deal are still under wraps 
Founded in 2007 by CEO Andy Dunn and Brian Spaly  Bonobos started as an e commerce shop  catering to the needs of athletes  Later  this New York based company also started producing dress shirts  suits and outerwears  Nordstrom  Inc    NYSE JWN   is an investor in Bonobos and started carrying the brand in stores and on its e commerce site since 2012 
Other than online sales  Bonobos also has more than 30 brick and mortar showrooms  called Guideshops  where customers can customize their orders and get them delivered at homes Bonobos generates between  100 million to  150 million in annual revenue 
Bonobos  collaboration with Wal Mart will be beneficial for both parties  Bonobos will get capital from Wal Mart to expand its portfolio  while Wal Mart will be able to better compete with Amazon  The acquisition will also help the company to strengthen its footprint in the growing apparel industry in the online space 
If the deal finalizes  it will be the retailer s fourth major e commerce acquisition since the buyout of Jet com  U S  e commerce company  in Sep 2016  In March  Jet com acquired trendy online clothing seller  ModCloth  Prior to ModCloth  Wal Mart bought Moosejaw  an outdoor apparel and gear retailer for  51 million and e commerce shoe retailer  for  70 million in 2017 Wal Mart Stores  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Wal Mart is also aggressively foraying into e commerce in China with an aim to deliver goods from its stores around the world to consumers within hours  Wal Mart has acquired 12 1  stake in Chinese e commerce website  JD com Inc  in Feb 2017  in line with the company s aim to grab greater market share in the world s largest online market and expand its reach in China  where it has been struggling of late 
Wal Mart also launched its own mobile payment system called Walmart Pay in all of its 4 500 plus U S  stores in Jul 2016  This system enables shoppers to pay through its existing smartphone app  This marks another step toward accelerating the company s online business and making shopping easier and faster 
Wal Mart is also aggressively trying to get a share of the pie in the online grocery shopping and delivery industry Most recently  Wal Mart has introduced a new program wherein it is offering discounts on online items  only if shoppers pick up their orders from a nearby store  The discount given seems to be an added feature to Wal Mart s already existing delivery service called Walmart Pickup which enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free 
In Jan 2017  the company started offering free two day shipping to U S  shoppers on a minimum order of  35 on over 2 million items  This program will replace Wal Mart s existing two day shipping program   Shipping Pass   that charges shoppers an annual membership fee of  49  It is interesting to note that unlike Amazon Prime  which charges customers  99 a year for two day shipping  or Wal Mart s existing Shipping Pass program  shoppers does not need to pay any membership fee to avail the service 
However  it still faces many headwinds which are likely to impact earnings in the near term  Higher expenses  lower margins at Wal Mart U S  and currency headwinds are expected to affect the results  Nevertheless  the company s efforts to boost sales and regain investors  confidence remain impressive 
Share Price Movement
In fact  the stock exhibited a bullish run on the index since the past one year  We note that in the said period the stock recorded 4 7  growth  outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry  which showcased improvement of just 1 6   We believe there is still much value left in the stock  which is quite evident from its  of  A  

What further makes us optimistic about its performance in the near term is its low beta of 0 13 and long term earnings growth rate of 6 9   Further  the retailer delivered positive earnings surprises in the past six consecutive quarters

Two Retailers to Avoid Next Year
1       Express  EXPR  is seeing decent sales trends but they are having to be extra promotional in order to get them  This is a bad sign this holiday season  It means the discounts are going to be more extreme as December goes on just to move merchandise  And don t think the consumers don t know it

The Best Retail Stocks to Buy for 2017



	Welcome to Episode  60 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast 

	Every week  host and Zacks stock strategist  Tracey Ryniec  will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life 

	In this episode  Tracey is joined by Maddy Johnson  Zacks Editor and co host of the Friday Finish Line Podcast  to discuss the best  and the worst  in the retail sector right now 

	The retail space covers a lot of areas from apparel  to shoes  to food  to toys and even to cars  Some areas are struggling  even though the consumer is spending  Tracey and Maddy drill down into what they are seeing out at the malls  how Black Friday and Cyber Weekend are impacting the retailers  and how you can cash in 

	But there are two sides to every story  And there s a lot not to like about the retailers right now  even with a 4 6  unemployment rate  The apparel retailers  in particular  are still having a tough time  Maddy and Tracey cover their sad tales and discuss when  or if  some of them will turn around in the new year 

Two Retailers to Avoid Next Year

	1  Express  NYSE      is seeing decent sales trends but they are having to be extra promotional in order to get them  This is a bad sign this holiday season  It means the discounts are going to be more extreme as December goes on just to move merchandise  And don t think the consumers don t know it 

	2  Gap  NYSE      is still trying to right the ship at its flagship Banana Republic chain  Both Tracey and Maddy think they are on the right track but not quite there yet  This is one of the cheapest retailers  with a forward P E of 12  but Tracey is still waiting for a single digit P E before she dives in 

	Other apparel retailers that Maddy and Tracey aren t keen on for 2017 include Land s End and Ascena Retail  which owns Ann Taylor  The Loft  Dressbarn and Justice  among others 

	But all is not lost on the retail side  There are still a handful of retailers that are doing everything right  And with consumer confidence on the rise  they are poised to cash in 

The 3 Top Retail Stocks for 2017

	1  Ulta Beauty  NASDAQ      is the top retailer in America right now  It recently saw comparable store sales of 16 7  when no one else in the industry is even doing 10   It has posted company record comparable store sales the last 2 years  And growth is expected to continue for the next several years as it continues to open new stores  Makeup is hot   Tracey owns ULTA in her personal portfolio  

	2  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   NYSE      continues to be on point with both its brick and mortar operations and its online segment  Earnings are expected to grow 8  next year  Analysts have been raising earnings estimates 

	3  Home Depot  NYSE HD   NYSE      has been on quite the run  But if consumer confidence stays elevated  those kitchens and new appliances will be bought  Tracey likes it even more if the shares pull back a bit as it trades with a forward P E of 20 

	Investors have to weed through the entire retail group in order to find the winners  and avoid the losers  It won t be easy  But Tracey and Maddy give you some tips in order to be a successful retail investor in 2017 

	What else should you know about the important retail sector as we head into the new year

143096,364611,JWN,What To Watch When 4 Major Retailers Report Earnings This Week,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
Since the advent of e commerce  traditional retailers and the malls they anchor have been eclipsed as the premier destination for US consumers  As American lives get busier and more hectic  shopping from the comfort of one s home during non traditional store hours is rapidly becoming the new normal  As a result  one thing is becoming ever clearer  traditional  brick and mortar retailers are struggling to find their place in this new world 
During the coming week  four major retailers are scheduled to report  Walmart  NYSE WMT  and Macy s  NYSE M  will begin the week when each reports on Tuesday morning before the market opens  Walmart is expected to report EPS of  1 3 on  130 9 billion of revenue  while Wall Street is expecting  2 in EPS and  8 5 billion in revenue from Macy s 
TJX Companies  NYSE TJX  companies will report on Wednesday morning before the bell  investors will be looking for  1 in EPS and  9 4 billion in revenue 
On Thursday  after the market closes  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  will finish out the retail week  Wall Street is anticipating  1 15 in EPS  on  4 3 billion in revenue 
According to the latest economic release  U S retail sales beat expectations in January  Department stores sales climbed 1 2 percent  the biggest increase in over a year  Sales at clothing stores were up 1 percent  also surpassing expectations  posting the biggest uptick in almost a year 
After being undercut by Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and similar online competitors for quite a few years  is there any hope for traditional retailers 

Walmart
Just last week  news broke that after having held a position in WMT since 2005  and adding to that position in 2014   Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   worth of Walmart shares over the course of the last quarter  Considering that Buffett is regarded as one of the savviest investors in recent times  this should make every investor consider what might really be at stake before taking any new Walmart positions 
However  putting the Oracle of Omaha s decision aside  Walmart hasn t done poorly this past year  growing revenue by 0 9   0 5  and 0 6  respectively during each of the past three quarters  year over year  Its operating margins  however  are at their lowest point ever  after shrinking to 4 33  last quarter  And the effort needed to turn Walmart around will certainly put added pressure on those already shrinking margins 
On the bright side  Walmart s online efforts are increasing and might eventually be effective enough to persuade investors that the retail behemoth is still relevant  After Walmart s  3 billion purchase of Jet com in August and the acquisition of online footwear retailer Shoebuy com this past December for  70 million  last week  Walmart also bought Moosejaw  an online and conventional retailer specializing in outdoor apparel for  51 million  Add all of this to WMT s free two day shipping on shopping carts with over  35 of merchandise  and it s obvious that Walmart is making visible efforts to boost its online footprint  As of last quarter online sales grew over 20  
At  69 a share  Walmart appears to be reasonably priced  Its P E ratio of 15 reflects the uncertainty regarding its ability to compete with Amazon and other retailers  for the reasons mentioned above  One thing to like about Walmart is its rising Free Cash Flow per share alongside its declining Price to Free Cash flows  At  6 79 of FCF per share  or  10 for every dollar in FCF  Walmart is the most attractive it s ever been by those two metrics 
With  484 billion in sales TTM  Walmart has the customer base  the financial clout based on  21 billion in Free Cash Flow TTM  and judging from the success of its recent online efforts the proactive management needed to make necessary shifts and adjustments to its business and business model  Coupled with rising retail sales and Walmart s defensive nature as a cheap and affordable source of a myriad of consumer staples  as well as an almost 3  dividend that has been growing for 43 years straight with a 43  payout ratio  we think this stock is worth a second look by income investors  if not everyone else 

Macy s
Our opinion of Macy s hasn t changed during the past quarter  At its current share price of  32 and P E ratio of 15  it simply isn t a good enough value 
The company s revenues and earnings have been declining for seven quarters  The jumps in share price seen after the August and November earnings calls were driven by smaller than expected declines  Of course  the stock also gave back all of its earnings report gains and more rather quickly  since a less than expected decline isn t really cause for celebration nor for a higher valuation longer term  Still  though the news is lackluster  the company remains profitable and strong cash flows from operations in the 2nd and 4th quarters are enough to keep the company and the 4 62  dividend alive 
In addition  though there are many things about its outlook that could be considered dismal  Macy s has a huge hedge which provides a safe floor beneath its share price the growing value of its prime real estate portfolio  Not many companies can compete with Macy s on this metric 
Its midtown Manhattan flagship store sits on 2 2 million square feet of prime property  overall Macy s owns 141 million square feet of retail space in 46 states including within major cities such as Los Angeles  San Francisco  Chicago  Dallas and Houston  Though the retailer  that it would close 63 stores and cut 10 000 jobs  Macy s real estate holdings do two things for the company and its share price  the holdings ensure a minimum value for the enterprise  making it worthwhile to keep an eye on Macy s P B ratio  currently at 2 6 and buy with very little risk should it get closer to 1  and it makes the company attractive for potential acquirers 
The acquisition idea wasn t pulled out of thin air either  Canadian holding company Hudson s Bay Company  TO HBC   which owns Lord   Taylor  Saks Fifth Avenue  and others  reportedly  for Macy s struggling business in early February  Hudson s Bay has done similar deals before in Europe  buying distressed retailers and financing the acquisition by spinning off some of the acquired real estate 
Activist hedge fund Starboard  which owns about 1  of Macy s  believes the department store chain s real estate to be worth over  21 billion dollars  If this assessment is true  spinning off the retail business  or selling  it might make more sense for the company given its current struggles and the changing landscape of the retail industry 
Though we wouldn t recommend buying a stock based only on takeover rumors  considering Macy s  real estate portfolio and its still profitable stores  a P E of 10 or a P B of less than 2 would make us feel more comfortable about the risk reward ratio 


TJX Companies
TJX Companies  owns such off price and deep discount department stores as T J  Maxx  Marshalls and HomeGoods among others  and has numerous retail chains worldwide  If Amazon is eating Walmart s lunch  T J Maxx is the thorn in Macy s side 
TJX pulled in over  32 billion in revenue during the past 12 months   6 billion more than what Macy s brought in  While Macy s and other retailers are seeing flat to negative revenue growth  TJX continues to demonstrate exemplary expansion in a world of struggling retailers  It s been growing steadily at an average annual pace of 6 8  for the past decade or so  Indeed  it seems the company s business model is attractive enough to continue bringing in heavy customer traffic  Same store sales increased 5  across the board last quarter  while Macy s  decreased 3 3  
The only drag on TJX right now is its International operations  ex  Canada   TJX operates stores globally including in the UK  Australia and Germany  The company has about 2800 stores in the US  400 in Canada  550 in Europe  and 35 in Australia  It enjoys some of the industry s best operating margins at 11 8  for the last quarter  However  its European expansion isn t doing nearly as well  margins on the Continent for the recent quarter jumped to 7 9   after being held below 5  for the first two quarters of 2016 
Similarly  its same store sales  while outstanding in the US  were flat for its International segment  Needless to say  a strong dollar didn t help matters  completely offsetting 13  revenue growth driven by new international stores in Europe and Australia  For now the  it looks like the international business will continue to weigh on the company  at least until it optimizes 
The company s share price  currently  77 19  has been stagnant for the past year  trading between a narrow  75 to  80 range  reflecting market sentiment towards the retail sector  TJX s relatively high valuation P E ratio of 23  P B ratio of 12 reflects the current state of the business and the industry 
However  TJX remains a growing company  Its international segment is still a work in progress  It should start pulling its weight once local store networks are optimized for synergies and efficiency which will improve operating margins  The company s business model has proved to be steady and effective  and we believe TJX is one of the finest companies in the retail sector at the moment  It s a well run company with an already demonstrated track record that still has more growth ahead of it  We see it as one of the most attractive retail sector stocks right now 


Nordstrom
By far the most upscale retailer in our group  Nordstrom sells higher end clothing and accessories via 123 full price stores and 215 discount  Nordstrom Rack stores in the US and Canada  From a sales perspective  the company is in a good shape  it posted  3 4 billion in revenue last quarter  up by a bit over 6  compared to last year  Over the past three quarters it grew 3   which  given recent conditions for the retail sector in general  is an acceptable number 
The retailer has been on the news lately for dropping Ivanka Trump s apparel line  after noting that sales of the brand have reached a point where it wasn t financially viable to keep them in stores  The decision prompted a  denouncing Nordstrom for its  unfair treatment  of his daughter  News coverage  whether for good or bad reasons  is often positive for brands  The impact on Ivanka s brand was immediate  sales of her perfume  to the top of Amazon s best selling list  The impact on Nordstrom  between  and supporters  still remains to be seen 
A breakdown of revenue sources does show some weakness  Revenue from comparable full price stores is down 6 3  year to date  Like many others traditional retailers  Nordstrom continues to suffer from declines in its brick and morter stores  Fortunately  the slack is being picked up by Nordstrom s online offering  which grew over 10  during the same period 
Still  the growth rate of Nordstrom online dropped from 17  last year to just 10  this year  over the first nine months of the year 
The company s off price chain  Nordstrom Rack  is an attempt to limit the flow of customers leaving JWN s higher end stores for competitors such as T J  Maxx and Marshalls  and is growing at an impressive 11  rate  almost entirely offsetting the drop off in full price store traffic  However  this growth has been spurred entirely by 26 new  mostly off price store openings during the first 9 months of 2016  Comparable sales for existing Nordstrom Rack stores since the beginning of 2016 are up only 0 4   after having been down 0 2  in the same period last year 
Because it s a higher end retailer  Nordstrom is less of a defensive stock  and more of a consumer cyclical  Should a downturn in the economy occur  companies like Walmart or T J Maxx will fare better than Nordstrom  This may seem irrelevant in light of rising consumer sentiment and US retail sales  but it s still worth noting  especially for long term investors 
Nordstrom s price per share has already dropped dramatically over the past few months  from  61 in early December to its current  46  However  with a P E ratio of 25  Nordstrom s growth problems are not discounted enough  Shares sell for a price befitting a stable retail chain with small growth prospects which is  in fact exactly what Norstrom is but a deeper drill down into the components of its growth reveals a troubling pattern of slow comparable sales and slowing growth in online sales  We would not recommend initiating a position at this time  especially if the stock rises on better than expected results  as has happened with Macy s after its last two quarterly reports  ",2017-02-20,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-to-watch-when-these-4-major-retailers-report-this-week-200176185,200176185
143104,364619,JWN,American Eagle  AEO  Q3 Earnings In Line  Stock Plunges ,opinion,American Eagle Outfitters  Inc    NYSE AEO   posted in line earnings and sales in the third quarter fiscal 2016  wherein both metrics increased on a year over year basis  However  management s muted earnings outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter instilled a negative sentiment among investors  leading this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock to plunge 14  following the earnings release While American Eagle has gained 5 9  in the past six months  the company has clearly underperformed the Zacks Categorized Retail Apparel Shoe industry  which has surged 16 4  over the same time frame Third Quarter HighlightsQuarterly earnings of 41 cents per share increased 17 1  from 35 cents recorded in the prior year quarter but were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Further  total revenue advanced 2 3  year over year to  940 6 million and almost came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  940 7 million AMER EAGLE OUTF Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Notably  the quarter witnessed record sales and achieved a double digit earnings growth rate  in line with the company s guidance  Results gained from the company s constant efforts toward improvement in its digital business  product enhancement and commitment toward enriching consumer experience  Further  the company s quarterly results benefited from continued strength in its American Eagle   AE   and aerie brands Consolidated comparable store sales  comps  improved 2   compared with a 9  jump recorded last year  Brand wise  comps increased 21  at the company s aerie stores and 0 4  at AE Total Brand outlets  Notably  this marked the aerie brand s sixth straight quarter of over 20  comps growth Quarter in DetailGross profit in the quarter inched up 2 8  to  377 8 million  with the gross margin expanding 20 basis points  bps  to 40 2   The upside was driven by improvement in IMU  but was somewhat offset by a marginal rise in markdowns  Further  buying  occupancy and warehousing expenses remained flat as a percentage of sales Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses slipped 0 4  year over year to  220 million  The increase in investments due to advertising was partly mitigated by well managed expenses  Moreover  as a percentage of sales  SG A expenses declined 60 bps to 23 4   Also  depreciation and amortization expenses rose 5 3  to  39 6 million due to the investments made in technology and omni channel ventures The company s operating income came in at  118 3 million  increasing 8 4  from  109 1 million recorded in the prior year quarter  Operating margin expanded 70 bps to 12 6  Financial PositionAmerican Eagle ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  291 7 million compared with  363 1 million in the prior year quarter In the fiscal third quarter  the company incurred  47 million of capital expenditures  while it spent  108 million as capital expenditure year to date  Further  over the past year  American Eagle spent  152 million as capital expenditure  For fiscal 2016  management continues to anticipate nearly  160 million as capital expenditure  out of which roughly 50  will be spent on store openings and refurbishment  The balance will be invested in omni channel and digital projects Additionally  the company paid  92 million as dividends over the past year As of Oct 29  2016  American Eagle s merchandise inventory was  492 6 million  up 2 7  from the comparable year ago period  The company expects inventory at cost to increase in the high single digits  with units anticipated to decline in the mid single digits at the end of fourth quarter fiscal 2016 Store UpdateDuring the fiscal third quarter  American Eagle inaugurated four new AE Brand stores  six Aerie stores and one Tailgate outlet  which was acquired at 2015 end   while it closed three AE stores  Alongside  the company opened eight international licensed stores  while shutting three down    As of Oct 29  2016  American Eagle operated 1 052 company stores and 163 international licensed outlets By the end of fiscal 2016  the company expects to operate 178 international licensed stores  Its total store count at the end of fiscal 2016 is expected in the range of 1 047 1 050  Further  the company remains on track to shut down nearly 25 30 underperforming outlets this year GuidanceNotably  this was the ninth straight quarter of improvement in the company s profits  Going forward  management remains confident of performing well  as it entered the holiday season with a solid beginning with regard to market opportunities as well as the company s robust execution  Also  management remains focused on enhancing consumer experience by providing top quality products For the fiscal fourth quarter  the company anticipates comps growth in the band of flat to low single digits  However  the company projects earnings per share in the band of 37 39 cents  which stands lower than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents For fourth quarter fiscal 2016  the effective tax rate is expected to be nearly 35  Stocks that Warrant a LookSome

PVH Corp  NYSE PVH   has bucked the dismal retail trends for the better part of this year  Its catalogue of brands which include Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger continue to see strong momentum thanks to frequent discounting and a strong reputation  This should continue to improve from investments in Europe  wholesale and direct to consumer avenues  all of which will help PVH reach a wider customer base  Department stores like Macys  NYSE M  and Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   which carry PVH clothing  have also played an important role in improving financial performance  Strong fundamentals in recent quarters have certainly played a role in the 45  gains the stock has made this year

143140,364655,JWN,Q3 Earnings Season Winding Down,opinion,"Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s  report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actuals and estimates for the current and following periods  
With the Retail sector results mostly out  the Q3 earnings season is now effectively behind us  Our overall take on this earnings season has been favorable  with growth finally turning positive and relatively encouraging trends in estimate revisions for the current period  This reassuring view doesn t fully extend to the Retail sector  whose results have been mixed at best For the Retail sector  we now have Q3 results from 91 4  of the sector s total market capitalization in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for these retailers are up  7 6  from the same period last year on  5  higher revenues  with 60 6  beating EPS estimates and 42 4  beating revenue estimates This is a weaker performance than we have seen from the sector in other recent reporting cycles  particularly with respect to positive surprises  The charts below compare the sector s Q3 results with what these same retailers reported in other historical periods 

The proportion of positive EPS surprises in Q3 is not only tracking below other historical periods for these same retailers  right hand chart above   but is also the second lowest of all 16 sectors in the S P 500  Of the major industries in the Retail sector  only the department stores came out with better than expected results  largely on the back of very tight inventories  This inventory angle was apparent with all the major operators like Macy s     Nordstrom  NYSE JWN     and others  The picture emerging from all the other major industries like online vendors  restaurants  brick and mortar discounters have been mixed   The ScorecardWe now have Q3 results from 470 S P 500 members or 94  of the index s total membership  Total earnings for these 470 index members are up  3 8  from the same period last year on  2 6  higher revenues  with 73 2  beating EPS estimates and 55 3  coming ahead of top line expectations The side by side charts below compare the results thus far from the 470 index members with what this same group of index members reported in other recent periods  The left hand chart compares the earnings and revenue growth rates with historical periods while the right hand chart is doing the same comparisons for positive EPS and revenue surprises 

Positive surprises were notably tracking above historical periods earlier  but are about in line with what we have been seeing from this same group of 470 index members in the recent past  as the right hand chart above shows  The proportion of companies beating both earnings and revenue estimates are modestly tracking above historical periods  as the chart below shows  but not in a big way 

The earnings and revenue growth pace for these 470 index members is still low  but nevertheless an improvement over other recent periods  The growth picture improves notably once the Energy sector s drag is removed from the data  The Energy sector s results have come in better than expected  but they are still down in a big way from the year earlier period  with the sector s Q3 earnings down  63 3  on  12 9  lower revenues  Excluding the Energy sector  total Q3 earnings would be up  7 2  from the same period last year on  4 2  higher revenues The comparison charts below show the growth picture  with and without the Energy sector

143176,364691,JWN,It May Be Time To Buy Nordstrom,opinion,"Readers know that just because a stock has tanked  doesn t mean it s time to jump in and buy  I like stocks that are already moving higher  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  peaked in early 2015  then started lower in September  It continued down for the next 9 months  but after finding a bottom in May and consolidating  it started back higher  The chart below shows that the move up stalled as it reached the high of the April bounce 

That move took the stock over its 200 day SMA    a bullish sign  Note that it had not been over that point since it started falling  The consolidation since then has held over the 200 day SMA  with a minor pullback and retracement  The price action since April can be viewed as an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern  A break of the neckline  at about 53 10  gives a price objective to at least 71  The momentum indicators are bullish with the RSI in the bullish zone and rising while the MACD is crossing up  Finally  the Bollinger Bands  are opening to the upside to allow a move up 
So the short answer is   maybe it is time to buy Nordstrom

the case for a rate hike had grown stronger recently  primarily due to substantial job additions  Additionally  oil prices underwent a rollercoaster ride after ultimately ending the month with gains  However  expectations increased that a production cap agreement between major oil producing countries was in the offing August s PerformanceFor the month the S P 500 and the Dow declined 0 1  and 0 2   respectively  However  the tech laden Nasdaq managed to settle in the green  gaining 1   Investors continued to grapple with the timing of a rate hike  with Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen saying that the case for hiking federal funds rate has gained in strength in  recent months   mostly due to a job market rebound following a slump in hiring in spring A potential interest rate hike this year dragged the broader markets down in August since such low rates had boosted the markets for a considerable period of time  Expectations that the Fed will move closer to a rate hike call helped the dollar hit multi week highs  The dollar s strength along with crude oversupply also weighed on oil prices The oil market has already gone through a topsy turvy ride in August  While the crude oil entered bear market territory during the beginning of August on subdued demand  it did stampede into a bull market territory during the third week of last month  thanks to increase in expectations

Estimate Falls The  second  estimate for second quarter GDP came in at 1 1   lower than the initial estimate of 1 2   In the first quarter  real GDP increased 0 8    The decline in the pace of growth

adjusted rate of 5 39 million  lower than the consensus estimate of 5 57 million Job Additions Surge  Hourly Earnings IncreaseThe U S  economy created a total of 255 000 jobs in July  considerably higher than the consensus estimate of 180 000  The economy added higher than expected new jobs for the second straight month Although  the unemployment rate in July of 4 9  was higher than the consensus estimate of 4 8   it was in line with June s rate  This because the labor force participation rate had increased to 62 8  Further  the average hourly earnings gained 0 3  or 8 cents in July from June to  25 69 per hour  It was also higher than the consensus estimate of 0 2  and June s 0 1  increase while year ago gains advanced by 2 6  Oil Price Move HigherIn August  oil prices continued to move northward  During the first week  oil prices gained following a surprisingly large draw on gasoline stockpiles  Rise in oil prices helped benchmarks finish in the green for the second week  Saudi Arabia s Energy Minister Kahlid al Falih showed willingness to talk with major crude oil producers to limit oil production During the third week  crude hit a one month high  However  during the

Following a particularly disappointing inventories report  oil prices closed at a three week low during the last week of the month  However  WTI crude gained nearly 7 5  over August  the highest monthly gain since April Rate Hike Odds IncreaseFed s July meeting minutes showed that some policymakers argued that a rate hike should take place soon as the labor market was nearing full employment

Fed President Esther George said that after observing the job market  inflation and Fed s forecast for the same  she considers  that it would be appropriate  to raise rates gradually Further  Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said that levels of inflation and employment are improving and  GDP growth in the second half of the year will be strong   He added that following  very good  healthy financial conditions   it would be appropriate to raise rates Speaking at the Jackson Hole economic symposium  Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that the case for hiking federal funds rate has gained in

143190,364705,JWN,Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights  Wal Mart  Macy s  Nordstrom And Amazon,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   August 19  2016   Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says   Positive retail reports notwithstanding  the sector s overall earnings performance is still on the weak side 

Retail Improves  but Issues Remain

Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s  report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actuals and estimates for the current and following periods   

The bulk of the Q2 earnings season is now behind us  with results from 474 S P 500 members already out  Total earnings for these companies are down  3 3  on  0 1  higher revenues relative to the same period last year  with 71 7  beating EPS estimates and 53 8  coming ahead of top line expectations 
	The focus lately has been on the Retail sector  with a number of leading operators like Wal Mart  NYSE WMT      Macy s     Nordstrom  NYSE JWN      and others coming out with positive surprises and a favorable outlook  These positive reports notwithstanding  the sector s overall earnings performance is still on the weak side  Driving this weakness has been the steady decline in foot traffic as a result of sales moving online  With many of these operators struggling to deal with this shift in consumer behavior  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN     has been able to gain share by offering a compelling user experience 
	Amazon s steady gains in the apparel space is a big reason for the pain in the traditional department store space  The positive results from the likes of Macy s and others this earnings season is not reflection of a better competitive response to Amazon   Co  but largely a function of factors that will likely not endure beyond the next couple of quarters  These factors include improvement on the inventory front and very low department store expectations  Inventories finally appear to be in line with sales  which comes after two back to back quarters when these operators were saddled with mountains of unsold merchandize as a result of weather and the aforementioned reduced foot traffic issue 
	Unlike the department stores  the improvement in Wal Mart results appear to be more enduring  with the retail giant not only doing a better job at improving its core physical retail operations  cleaner stores  better assortment  and improved customer experience   but also coming out with a credible digital response to the Amazon challenge  Wal Mart s online efforts still have a long way to go  but they have been doing a lot more on that front  even prior to the Jet com purchase  than most of its peers Retail Sector Scorecard
	We now have Q2 results from 34 of the 44 retailers in the S P 500 index that combined account for 91 4  of the sector s market capitalization in the index  Total earnings for these retailers are up  4 0  from the same period last year on  4 3  higher revenues  with a below index average 55 9  beating EPS estimates and a very low beat ratio of 38 2  coming ahead of revenue estimates 

While growth is about in line with historical periods  but this is weaker than what was expected 
	We know that Amazon had a blockbuster earnings report  which is likely giving the growth pace a helping hand  Taking the Amazon results out of the Retail sector results thus far  total earnings for the rest of the space are actually down  0 2  from the same period last year on  2 6  higher revenues 

The retail sector s respectable growth pace at this stage is solely due to the Amazon report  Once we take Amazon out of the sector s results at this stage  the sector s growth pace turns out be a lot weaker 

Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard
	For Q2 as a whole  we now have results from 474 index members  with total earnings for these companies down  3 3  on  0 1  higher revenues relative to the same period last year 
	Here are the four takeaways from the results thus far First   earnings growth remains negative  but is nevertheless an improvement over what we saw from the same group of 474 S P 500 members in the preceding quarter  2016 Q1  and the 4 quarter average  We may be putting too fine a point by calling a decline of  3 3  as an improvement over a decline of  4 5   the 4 quarter average   but the Q2 decline is nevertheless an improvement over the preceding quarter Second   revenue growth is ever so slightly in the positive   0 1   for this group of 474 index members  As is the case with earnings growth for these companies  it is an improvement over what we saw from this group of 474 S P 500 members in 2016 Q1 and the average for the preceding four quarters 

These earnings and revenue growth comparisons largely remain in place even after we exclude the Energy sector s substantial drag from the reported results  Total earnings for the Energy sector are down  78 9  on  24 4  lower revenues from the same period last year  Excluding the Energy sector  earnings for the remainder of S P 500 members that have reported results would be up  0 3  from the same period last year on  3 0  higher revenues 

Third   positive EPS surprises for the 474 index members that have reported results are tracking modestly above the 4  and 12 quarter averages  This suggests that Q2 estimates may not have been that low after all  Positive revenue surprises  on the other hand  are moderately tracking below other historical periods Fourth   estimates for the current period  2016 Q3  have come down  following a well established historical trend  Total Q3 earnings for the S P 500 index are currently expected to be down  2 8  from the same period last year  which is a decline from expectations of flat earnings at the start of the quarter Estimates Beyond Q2
	Full year 2016 earnings growth expectations have now turned negative  similar to what we saw last year 

Beyond the current period  September quarter   meaningful growth is expected to resume from Q4  which is then expected to continue into 2017  Easier comparisons for the Energy sector arrive in Q4  when the sector s earnings growth turns positive  But the expected growth in Q4 and beyond isn t solely a function of easy comparisons for the Energy sector   the expectation is for positive momentum from a broad cross section of sectors  Those expectations will most likely need to come down  But it will be interesting to see to what extent they will have to come down

143196,364711,JWN,American Woodmark And Express Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   August 30  2016    highlights American Woodmark Corporation    as the Bull of the Day and Express     as the Bear of the Day 

Here is a synopsis of the two stocks  

  

Headquartered in Winchester  VA  American Woodmark Corporation    is a leading manufacturer and distributor of kitchen and bath cabinets for remodeling and new home construction markets 

The company manufactures cabinets under four major brands  American Woodmark  Timberlake Cabinetry  Shenandoah Cabinetry and Waypoint Living Spaces and sells more than 500 cabinet lines in a wide variety of design materials and finishes 

Their products are sold through a network of independent dealers and distributors  and directly to major builders  Lowe s and The Home Depot  NYSE HD  

Excellent Quarterly Results



The company reported its fiscal first quarter results on Aug  23  Net sales for the quarter increased 12  year over year to  258 2 million with growth across all channels  Net income was  21 7 million or  1 32 per compared with  15 2 million or  0 92 per share for the same quarter a year ago 

Adjusted earnings of  1 26 per share were substantially better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 94 per share  The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of last four quarters  with an average quarterly surprise of 33  

Rising Estimates 



As a result of strong quarterly report  analysts have raised their estimates for the company  Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and the next fiscal year now stand at  4 40 per share and  4 79 per share  up from  3 94 and  4 55  before the report 

Rising estimates sent AMWD back to a Zacks Rank 1  Strong Buy  

Home Remodeling Speeding Expected to Surge



According to a  by John Burns Real Estate Consulting and the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies  spending on home repairs and remodeling is expected to exceed  300 billion this year  ahead of the previous high of about  285 billion in 2007 

With very low inventories of homes for sale and rising prices  many homeowners prefer to improve their existing home instead of buying a new one  Further  American homes are getting older  leading to rising spending on repairs  With improving labor market  homeowners are also willing to spend more on upgrades and remodeling 

The study forecasts that home improvement spending will continue to grow at a fast pace over the next three years  These trends bode well for the company  Further  being a domestically focused company  it is immune to global growth concerns 

In addition the top Zacks Rank  the stock also has the Style Score of  A  for Growth as well as for Momentum and a VGM score of  B  

Rising home improvement spending bodes well for this kitchen cabinet maker 

  

It has been a very challenging environment for mall based retailers due to declining traffic  rising trend for online shopping and increasing competition from off price fashion chains  Many of them have seen declining sales of late  despite improving labor market and still low gas prices 

About the Company

Express     is a retailer of specialty apparel and accessories for women and men  The company targets the 20 to 30 year old customer  They currently operate over 600 retail stores  located primarily in shopping malls  lifestyle centers  and street locations across the US  in Canada and in Puerto Rico 

Their merchandise is also available at franchise stores in the Middle East and Latin America  Further  the company also markets and sells its products through its e commerce website 

Weak Results and Lower Guidance

The apparel chain reported weak results for the second quarter and also slashed its guidance for the year  leading to a sharp decline in shares after the report 

Net sales decreased 6  during the quarter to  504 8 million while same store sales  including e commerce sales  declined 8   compared to a 7  increase in the same quarter a year ago  E commerce sales were down 7  to  70 1 million 

Net income was  10 1 million  or  0 13 per share compared  21 0 million or  0 25 per share in the previous year quarter  Earnings were way short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 17 per share  This was the second consecutive quarterly miss for the retailer 

The management now expects adjusted earnings of  1 to  1 14 per share for the full year  down from previous guidance for  1 41 to  1 54 per share 

Falling Estimates

Analysts have slashed their estimates for the company after weak results and downbeat guidance  Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next fiscal year have plunged to  1 05 per share and  1 21 per share from  1 47 and  1 59 respectively  before the report 

Declining estimates sent the stock to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  

The Bottom Line

In addition to disappointing consumer spending and mall traffic  the retail space is going through a shift toward online shopping  With tightening labor markets   wage pressure  has also started hurting retailers 

However some retailers have been able to deliver positive surprises in the latest quarter  with significant cost cutting measures and some changes in their business model  Investors could look at a better ranked retailer Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   JCP   which currently has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The company reported a huge beat and shares surged after the results 

Shares of this apparel chain plunged after weak earnings and slashed guidance

143201,364716,JWN,Online Shopping Gaining Traction  ETFs To Buy,opinion,"Retail earnings for the second quarter and retail sales data for July went in two directions with the former bringing back long lost hopes and the latter giving a rude shock  The reason for this deviation was better than expected results from several departmental stores while web based shopping was among the sweet spots in the July retail report card 
Though these retailers performed miserably in the first quarter  most of them turned around in the second quarter  Macy s Inc    NYSE M   and Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   beat on both lines  Nordstrom Inc    NYSE JWN   and J C  Penney Company Inc    NYSE JCP   exceeded the consensus mark on the bottom line but narrowly missed the top line estimate  Nordstrom alsobeefed up its earnings guidance  All of the companies  shares soared post earnings  spreading cheer in the broader retail space  read    
Investors should note that several analysts are attributing this sudden success of retailers to extremely pessimistic earnings estimates which were in fact easy to beat  Plus  piles of inventories have finally started to level out and come in line with sales  read  
What About Earnings at Online Retailers

For the ongoing third quarter  the company expects revenues to grow 22 32  to  31  33 5 billion  Incredible growth in its Prime service  AWS division  and Prime Day sales is poised to boost its performance further in the coming months  read    
E commerce giant eBay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY  s  Q2 earnings were in line and revenues beat estimates  There was more from eBay to impress investors as management raised the guidance and the company s board approved an incremental   share repurchase program  read    
What Does July Retail Sales Say 
Retail sales were   sequentially  in July aftergrowing for the third consecutive month in June and also fell short of the market expectation of a 0 4  gain  Sales at nonstore retailers grew 1 3   the same pace as in June  Also  motor vehicles and parts dealers saw a 1 1  rise in sales  Excluding autos  retail sales last month slipped 0 3      the  since January  after a 0 9  gain in the prior month  
Other bright spots were furniture which witnessed a 0 2  expansion in sales and miscellaneous store retailers logging 0 3  rise 
Department store sales declined   Sales at gasoline stations dived 2 7   thanks mainly to muted gas prices  On a year over year basis  July sales rose 2 3   slackeningfrom a 2 7  rise in June 
Online Retailing Gaining Precedence  
 believe that Amazon s Prime Day sale on July 12 was   which in fact ate away the brick and mortar s share of revenues  If this was not enough  as per the  issued on August 10  2016  total earnings of the reported retailers are up 8 1  from the same period last year on 8 7  higher revenues  However  such flattering growth rates are mainly due to the stellar Amazon report  About 45 5   which is the below the index average  of retailers surpassed on earnings and a meagre 18 2  exceeded revenue estimates 
Which ETFs to Play 
While the recent success of departmental stores ushered in nice gains on broader retail ETFs  the undercurrent is in favor of online retailing 
Macy s announced the closure of  and also indicated that online stores have undermined conventional mediums of shopping and will keep depressing it in the coming days  Walmart  NYSE WMT  is acquiring Jet com  an online retailer operating for two years  for billion   2 3 billion  as it seeks to touch up its Internet retailing strategy in a bid to draw near Amazon 
All in all  continued migration toward online retailing can t be ignored  no matter how impressive earnings have been delivered by traditional retail stores lately 
This situation makes it crucial to go beyond broad based retail ETFs like VanEck Vectors Retail ETF   V RTH   or SPDR S P Retail ETF   Instead  investors may give a special look at pure play Amplify Online Retail ETF     Except this  it is hard to get targeted exposure to online retail  But several consumer discretionary and Internet funds serve this idea to a large extent 
For example  EMQQ Emerging Markets Internet   E commerce ETF     First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund    with considerable exposure on Amazon and eBay  Other consumer discretionary ETFs that can get you to Amazon are RTH  Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund   Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF  and iShares U S  Consumer Services ETF

143202,364717,JWN,Hot Air Prevails In The Market,opinion,"The market s disconnect with reality continued last week  With 91  of S P 500 companies reporting  the year over year decline in overall earnings remained steady at   3 5    It will be difficult at this point for the needle to get above   3    It will also mark the fifth consecutive quarter of declines  the first such streak since the Great Recession  the declines are milder  though   So naturally  the three major stock market indices are all at record highs  the first time since 1999  How s that for a good omen 
You may very well wonder how we ever got there  The  melt up  has its genesis in the Brexit rebound  and since then has thrived on options trading  technical breakouts  low volume  chart chasing and  better than expected  earnings  That last development is one of the most ominous  As a cycle ends  fears about the end grow  even if apparently unacknowledged in prices  When news is weak but not as weak as expected  prices grind higher  making illogical valuations more insane and giving rise to the classic  blow off top  phase that we are in now 
Yes  we re in one now  Many strategists would disagree with this assessment  on the grounds that it isn t like 1999  But neither was 2007  and in all probability neither will the next few tops be  either  1999 was a once in a lifetime mania 
The market is chasing its own breakout to no small extent  and same thing usually happens at the ends of bull markets  A marginal new high is accompanied by a chorus of  I told you so  from the die hards  Familiar arguments pop up as earnings growth disappears   it s time for a multiple expansion  a polite way of saying prices should go up anyway when earnings don t   the ship will right itself in a couple of years  the market is looking ahead to the recovery in earnings x quarters from now  and my personal favorite   there s too much cash on the sidelines   There s been too much cash on the sidelines for about 15 years now  going from what I hear emanating from the Street  but I hear it said quite a bit in 2007  Could it be that some are just getting out early 
People who look at hard data  including yours truly  have started exiting the market this year and advised others to do the same  prominently including heavyweight investors like Carl Icahn  Jeff Gundlach  Bill Gross  David Tepper and others  This gives the opportunity for the true heavyweights  the self styled expert day traders that populate comments columns and lunchtime television shows to now look importantly at the cameras and sneer at them  After all  prices can t be wrong  Who cares if earnings are going down  They ll come back someday  There s no visible reason for stock prices not to go up 
A big part of the problem is that when one looks at earnings and economic data in a cold light  the message is pretty clear  But that s not how these things get looked at on Wall Street  which tends to overly focus on relative expectations  For example  on Friday traders and pundits sang the praises of Nordstrom Inc  NYSE JWN  earnings   the retailer beat expectations  By this week  you will doubtless be hearing daily about the  very strong  earnings coming out of the retail sector 
But Nordstrom s sales and earnings are down year over year  in fact earnings are down quite a lot  So is the stock price  even after the near 20  rally since the earnings release  Revenue missed expectations too  but the market got better earnings than its darkest fears and so the inevitable hype follows  There s been a lot of that going around  especially with earnings and economic releases  You can a lot of trading mileage out of a dying cycle when the death isn t as gory as feared  The trouble  it s still dying
So far this month  prices have held up surprisingly well  in part helped along by a jobs report that isn t much more than an educated guess  That said  I look for the S P to pull back slightly this week  to around the 2170 level  The market is considerably overbought right now  and while August does tend to march to its own eccentric beat  I wouldn t count on it hanging in much longer  The Economic Beat
The report of the week was retail sales  one of the two monthly heavyweights  the Fed doesn t meet every month  so its statement isn t included   The lack of market reaction clearly showed how the market focus is now on two things only   the jobs reports and the Fed statements 
The initial estimate of July sales was that they were unchanged on a month over month  seasonally adjusted basis  Consensus had been for a 0 4  gain  On a year over year  unadjusted basis  monthly sales were up 0 7  over July 2015  Allowing for some inflation implies that in real terms  sales were down slightly 
One month does not a trend make  but the trailing twelve month  TTM  trend isn t particularly great either  In fact  it isn t even good  The latest TTM read is for a growth rate of only 2 48   the lowest since February  For historical perspective  in the last two business cycles sales only fell to those levels many months after a recession had begun  The rate is close  however  to the TTM increase in weekly earnings of 2 3   We are running at stall speed 
A fresh example of tape influenced news was last week s release of the labor turnover  JOLTS  survey for June  I have heard about a hundred times at least since then about job openings being up at all time highs  What you don t hear about is that actual hires in June were down from June 2015  The difference is small  leaving the rate unchanged  but that doesn t suggest employment growth  It suggests that employment growth has slowed  something we will probably find out in the fall when the actual data catches up with the seasonal guesstimates  Productivity was negative in the second quarter   0 5   for the third quarter in a row  a tie for the longest streak ever  It s partly a reflection of how so much of the growth in the labor market has come in the form of low paying service activity that don t add much to total output 
I read a wild piece of misinformation over the wholesale sales report for June  A nationally prominent economics site bragged over the  stunning  surge in sales  even though they were down year over year for the 17th month in a row on a seasonally adjusted basis  and down on an unadjusted basis as well  and talked about inventories being  too lean   Too lean   The inventory to sales ratio did ease from 1 35 in May to 1 33 in June  as it does at the end of every second quarter  but that said  it is well above the level of June 2015  1 297  and is the highest June reading since 2001  1 345   when we were in a recession  What a load of something  but as I like to remind  the tape makes the news 
Prices were up somewhat in June  as the year on year change in import export prices eased to   3 7   and   3 0   respectively  the best they ve been in some time  Producer prices fell  however  in a significant shortfall of consensus  with a   0 4   overall decline taking the TTM rate down to   0 2   overall  The  core  TTM rate  excluding food and energy  is still positive at 0 7   but it s a big drop from last month s 1 3  rate  Consumer prices  CPI  are due out on Tuesday 
The big report for next week is the release of the Fed minutes on Wednesday  They won t say much and probably nothing at all that is new  but we ll still fuss over them beyond all reasonable merit  I ll be looking more at Tuesday s release of the industrial production report  Tuesday   along with the New York Fed manufacturing survey  Monday  and the Philadelphia edition  Thursday   we ll get a look at where manufacturing activity really is  as opposed to stock market hype  The other main report is housing starts on Tuesday  with its teaser sentiment report the day before ",2016-08-16,Kevin Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hot-air-prevails-in-the-market-200148126,200148126

143207,364722,JWN,After Walmart Earnings  Which Retail Stocks Are Best Right Now ,opinion,"Shares of retail behemoth Walmart   NYSE WMT   gained about 1 75  in morning trading Thursday after the company released its latest earnings report  For the second quarter of fiscal 2017  Walmart posted earnings of  1 07 per share on revenue of  120 9 billion 
Walmart s earnings beat out the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents  while its revenue figure grew 0 5  year over year and beat our consensus estimate by 0 7   Overall  Walmart saw declines in international sales and Sam s Club  which were mostly offset by strong growth in its Walmart U S  division 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2017  Walmart expects earnings in a range of 90 cents to  1 00 per share  which would be down from the comparable quarter s earnings of  1 03 per share but in line with the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents per share 
 Also Read   
With two slight beats and relatively good guidance  Walmart s earnings report was impressive but not mind blowing  If anything  it shows us that  despite an inconsistent earnings season  the retail environment has bounced back nicely 
After Walmart s earnings  the spotlight is firmly on the retail sector  Check out these three stocks that could be poised to perform even better than WMT 
1        Dollar Tree   NASDAQ DLTR    Zacks Rank  2  Buy 
Dollar Tree  which doesn t report until September 6  looks to be set up for another strong earnings announcement after beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11 25  last quarter  The company has seen one positive estimate revision in the past 60 days  which has moved our consensus estimate up by a penny 
Dollar Tree also has a positive Earnings ESP of 4 11   which  paired with its strong Zacks Rank  implies that the company is more likely to post an earnings beat  Right now  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its upcoming earnings stands at 73 cents per share  which would represent growth of 192  year over year  This has helped earn the stock an  A  grade for Growth and an overall VGM score of  A  
If Dollar Tree can beat expectations and guide well for the remainder of the year  it should be ready to soar 
 
2        Burlington Stores   NYSE BURL    Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy
Burlington Stores is set to announce its latest earnings data next week  and the company will be looking to continue its strong run after beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 23 19  in the trailing four quarters  In the past 60 days  Burlington has seen four positive estimate revisions  sending the Zacks Consensus Estimate six cents higher in that time 
When Burlington reports next week  we expect the company to post earnings of 29 cents per share on revenue of  1 24 billion  If those figures hold up  it would represent growth of 54  and 8 3   respectively 
We have also seen six positive revisions for Burlington s full year earnings and five positive revisions for its next year earnings within the past 60 days  which means a strong report next week could be just the beginning of a lengthy stretch of success for the company 
 
3        Nordstrom   NYSE JWN    Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy 
While the previous two companies have yet to report  Nordstrom makes the list based on its strong results from last week  The company posted earnings of 67 cents per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12 cents  Since then  the stock has gained nearly 15  
As a result of its strong report  we have seen six positive revisions for Nordstrom s current quarter earnings over the past week  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has gained two cents already  This stock also has an  A  grade for Value and an overall VGM score of  A  
Nordstrom posted impressive results last week and the stock should continue to ride that momentum going forward 
 
Bottom Line
For many investors  Walmart is one of the go to stocks in the retail sector  While its earnings report was certainly not bad  Walmart did leave a little left to be desired  and the recovered retail sector is home to several other strong stocks right now  Investors looking to get into this space after Walmart s earnings announcement should definitely consider the three companies on this list ",2016-08-18,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/after-walmart-earnings,-which-retail-stocks-are-best-right-now-200148791",200148791

17 cents recorded in the prior year quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents   Results gained from the company s constant efforts toward enhancing brands via innovations  making

straight quarter of over 20  comps growth Quarter in DetailGross profit in the quarter rose 8  to  307 million  with the gross margin expanding 160 basis points  bps  to 37 3   The gross margin expansion was driven by better merchandise margins  which in turn stemmed from lower costs and higher selling prices  somewhat offset by greater delivery costs associated with digital sales growth Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses increased 2  year over year to  200 million  reflecting higher investments in brand advertising and variable selling costs  somewhat compensated by strong cost management efforts  However  as a percentage of sales  SG A expenses declined 20 bps to 24 3  The company s operating income came in at  69 million  marking a 29  rise from  53 million recorded in the prior year quarter  At the same time  operating margin expanded 160 bps to 8 3  Financial PositionAmerican Eagle ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of nearly  247 9 million compared with  327 3 million in the prior year quarter  The low cash balance is attributed to  227 million spends related to share buybacks   94 million of dividends and  135 million in capital expenditure in the past one year period In second quarter fiscal 2016  the company incurred  36 million of capital expenditure  For fiscal 2016  management now targets nearly  160

to operate 181 international licensed stores  Its total store count at the end of fiscal 2016 is expected in the range of 1 045 1 050  AMER EAGLE OUTF Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     GuidanceManagement remains confident of its near term prospects  as it entered the fall season with solid expectations with regard to market opportunities as well as the company s robust execution  Also  management remains focused on enhancing consumer experience by providing top quality products  in an attempt to place American Eagle s brands well in the evolving retail space Consequently  the company offered its view for third quarter fiscal 2016  wherein it anticipates comps growth at a low single digit rate  Further  the company projects earnings per share in the band of 40 41 cents

It seems the biggest beneficiaries of the back to school season have been the beaten down department stores as the heavyweights in the sector reported mostly better than expected earnings  The famous quip   Retail is detail   may not be as applicable today with the ease of use of technology to click  click  and have whatever you want sent to you  Still  retail has been crushed for the last year so when Macy s Inc  NYSE M   Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS   Nordstrom Inc  NYSE JWN   and JC Penney Company Inc Holding  NYSE JCP  revealed they won t go out of business in the next few days  their stocks jumped a bit  Macy s disclosure they will close 100 stores by early 2017 is consistent with the idea there is too much capacity in the industry  a deflationary environment  The Fed policy of keeping interest rates low for as long as possible is the strategy used to fight this circumstance  as well as the commodity bust  Make no mistake  the department store industry will continue to work at improving their on line presence  but even with excellent merchandising  competing with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  has been  and will continue to be  uh  a major challenge

Are Retail Earnings Really Improving 

The Retail sector is the only one where a significant number of Q2 earnings reports are still awaited at this stage  the reporting cycle has effectively come to an end for most of the other sectors  particularly in the large cap S P 500 index  plenty of small cap reports are still to come  

Almost 92  of the S P 500 members have already reported Q2 results  though results from more than 40  of the retailers in the index are still to come  We have 124 companies coming out with quarterly results this week  including 21 S P 500 members that include major retailers likeHome Depot    and Foot Locker     
	We have already seen Q2 results from 56 8  of the Retail sector members in the S P 500 index  While most of the initial retail sector reports were from online vendors and restaurant operators  most of the recent reports have been from the beleaguered department stores space with market participants pleasantly getting surprised that the sky wasn t really falling for Macy s     Nordstrom     and others 
	The problems that have been weighing on these department stores like reduced foot traffic as a result of steady migration of sales to the online medium haven t gone away  But a couple of things appear to be happening  all favorable to these retailers  First  Macy s announcement of closing 100 locations appears to be an acknowledgement of the  over stored  ground reality  Second  inventories finally appear to be in line with sales  which come after two back to back quarters when these operators were saddled with mountains of unsold merchandize as a result of weather and the aforementioned reduced foot traffic issue  Third and most important  expectations were so low from these department stores and their stocks were so beaten down that even a modest improvement have helped push them higher 
	These favorable department store results notwithstanding  the overall environment still remains challenging in this space  with the longstanding competitive pressures from Amazon    and others are only expected to increase over time  The Q2 Retail sector results that have been reported already  as a whole  are on the weak side  with growth tracking below historical periods and very few companies able to come out with positive earnings and revenue surprises  This week s reports from Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   Home Depot and others are expected to be better relative to the department stores  but the overall aggregate picture for the sector may not change much The Retail Scorecard
	As of Friday August 12th  we have seen Q2 results from 25 retailers in the S P 500 index  out of the 44 total  that combined account for 59 5  of the sector s total market cap in the index  Total earnings for these 25 retails are up  6 5  from the same period last year  on  7 8  higher revenues  with a relatively low 52  beating EPS estimates and a very low 24  coming ahead of top line expectations

However  in some cases  a few of these old guard companies may have actually found a bottom in recent trading and could be interesting choices for investors willing to play a volatile market  In particular  we take a look at three companies in this segment which are reporting this week including 
Macy s  M

143232,364747,JWN,Don t Get Caught With This Department Store In Your Portfolio,opinion,"Nordstrom Inc  NYSE JWN 
Consumer Discretionary   Multiline Retail   Reports August 10  After Market Closes
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of 55 cents on  3 65 billion in revenue  right in line with Wall Street on the top and bottom line
Nordstrom  along with Macy s Inc  NYSE M   is one of the most beaten down department stores with shares falling 40  in the past 12 months
Its off price business and online platform have been the two fastest growing segments
Department stores are losing favor with consumers thanks to the rise of fast fashion trends and online retailers  This has came largely to the dismay of iconic brands in Macy s and Nordstroms  Both companies have reported dismal earnings in the past few quarters with zero indication of turning things around  Even with the bar set extremely low  tomorrow s report from Nordstrom isn t expected to wow investors 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 55 cents  down 38  from the same period last year  That estimate has declined 35  since Nordstrom s most recent report in May  Revenue is anticipated to drop 1  to  3 65 billion  extending its streak of negative growth  Shares are down 10  year to date and a resounding 40  in the past 12 months  On average investors should expect to see a 3  drop immediately following Nordstroms report 

Nordstrom has been delivering weaker than expected results for some time  Those who can afford the top notch brands are now shopping directly from the vendor while other consumers are opting for off price retailers  This has clearly been the case for Nordstrom which saw gross profit as a percentage of net sales decline 35  compared with same period last year 
Its off price business and online sales were the two fastest growing segments within the company  Nordstrom Rack and Hautelook saw net sales increase 50  while online sales increased 11   Management has also indicated that its recent anniversary sale had a considerable impact on traffic  While a number of these initiatives are taking off  investor s will be keen to hear how Nordstrom guides future quarters before making any broader conclusions

3   Over the past several quarters  our team has been actively addressing our inventory  expense and capital  and in the second quarter  made substantial progress by bringing down inventory in line with sales   said Blake Nordstrom  co president of Nordstrom  Inc   Those efforts  along with the strength of our Anniversary Sale and a great response from customers to that event  drove better than expected results for the second quarter

143236,364751,JWN,I m Tracking These Stocks After Today s U S  Close,opinion,"NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA 
NVidia is one of the biggest winners in the tech space lately  The stock is up 80  year to date and a resounding 155  in the past 12 months  Continued strength in the gaming industry has been the primary driver of strong GPU sales  The addition of its first Polaris graphics cards is expected to be another source of revenue moving forward  Other business ventures such as automotives  data centers and major league gaming could push the stock and company to the next level  NVidia should be aware that AMD is closing the gap  AMD s most recent chips have been lauded as the best available products on the market  If AMD continues to capture more market share  don t expect NVidia to sustain its gains 
Nordstrom Inc   NYSE JWN 
Department stores  on the other hand  are some of the biggest losers lately  Shares of Nordstrom are down 40  from a year earlier as consumers are spending more on fast fashion trends and with online retailers  The considerable downturn of in store sales have contributed to weak financial performance  Fortunately  its off price business and ecommerce platform have been gaining traction  Last quarter Nordstrom saw an 11  jump in sales from Nordstrom Rack and Hautelook  Management also indicated that its annual Anniversary Sale was generating strong traffic trends  Macy s  NYSE M  and Kohl s  NYSE KSS  better than expected report this morning bodes well for Nordstrom later today  Shares of Nordstrom are up 8  in premarket trading on the good news from Macy s and Kohl s 
Planet Fitness Inc   NYSE PLNT 
Low priced and discount goods have attracted consumer across all sectors and Planet Fitness hasn t been any different  The budget gym has performed remarkably well since its IPO late last year  Since its debut on the stock exchange  shares are up 26   The company has also beat expectations in each of the past 3 quarters  Unfortunately  like many new companies  revenue growth has decelerated over past quarters  After posting double digit gains throughout fiscal 2015  growth in the first and second quarter have been just shy of 10   If this continues to be an ongoing trend expect the honeymoon period to end 
Ruby Tuesday Inc   NYSE RT 
Unfortunately the company hasn t been apart of the broader surge in the casual dining sector  Ruby Tuesday has incurred losses in 4 of its last 6 quarters  Higher labor and operating costs are taking its toll on margins and should continue to do so for the quarter to be reported  Traffic is also expected to decline as competitors implement more attractive promotional campaigns  Like its peers  frequent menu innovations  limited time offers and increased marketing efforts will help the company return to profitability

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for a 13 cent loss per share on  2 93 billion in revenue  2 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top
JCP s road to recovery includes expanding the Sephora rollout  boosting omni channel capabilities and deeper penetration of private brands
Several concerns still persist  including stiff competition  shifting consumer spending habits and high debt
Department stores have been one of the most beaten down stocks lately  but that might be changing soon  On Thursday morning both Macy s  NYSE M  and Kohl s  NYSE KSS  reported better than expected earnings  indicating they are making progress on delivering profitability  The good news was enough to send the two stock up double digits  And that bodes well for JCPenney when it announces its second quarter results Friday morning 
JCP has performed the best among its department store rivals  The company has strung together 5 consecutive beats on the bottom line  Shares have also jumped 17  in the past 12 months where Macy s and Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  stock have plunged over 35   If Thursday s reports are any indication  JCP shouldn t have a problem topping expectations for another quarter
The Estimize consensus is looking for a 13 cent loss up 67  from the same period last year  That estimate has increased 30  since JCP s most recent report in May  Revenue is expected to jump 2  to  2 93 billion  marking yet another quarter of positive comparisons  Even if the company posts better than expected earnings  the market shouldn t expect the stock to move much  Typically  shares remain flat through a report and in fact decline in the days and months after 
J C  Penney has taken on several strategic initiatives on its path to profitability  Its focus on deeper penetration of private brands  boosting online sales and expanding the Sephora brand have contributed to the strong turnaround  In many of the company s conference calls over the past year  the continued rollout of Sephora has been cited as a key to driving traffic 
Don t expect it to be smooth sailing though  JCP still faces stiff competition from the aforementioned department stores and online retailers  Consumers are also spending more on fast fashion trends which are often just as inexpensive as the department stores  Additionally  greater efforts to renovate and expand will put pressure on margins and increase operating expenses  Do you think JCP can beat estimates ",2016-08-11,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-watch:-all-eyes-on-jcp-200147503,200147503
143238,364753,JWN,Weak Retail Sales And PPI Data To Look For,opinion,"To begin the last day of the trading week   following an exemplary day in the markets Thursday  where the Dow  Nasdaq and S P 500 all hit new highs   we see new data on Retail Sales and the Producer Price Index  PPI   Unfortunately  these numbers do not look overly encouraging 

	Retail Sales for July were unchanged  following a revised June read of  0 8   Stripping out auto sales  this figure drops to  0 3   in June this was  0 9   Vehicle and furniture sales were up  whereas grocery stores and gas stations were down  July s PPI went to  0 4  after a June read of  0 5   Core PPI   ex food and energy costs   was  0 3   and this was  0 4  in June 

	Basically  these numbers are weaker than expected  and point to less upward inflation pressure than anticipated  Faltering oil prices in the month may have played a part  and we know how energy costs affect just about every other industry  but ultimately these are modestly disappointing reads 

	Futures on the major indexes that posted such strong numbers are down slightly in today s pre market  WTI and Brent oil price indexes are down a bit as well following a stronger Thursday 

	As Q2 earnings season continues to wind down  JCPenney  beat bottom line estimates but still reported a loss of 5 cents per share on revenues slightly below expectations  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   beats on both top and bottom lines this morning and the stock is up 9   as did Planet Fitness   but Dillard s  reported same store sales below estimates  and its stock is down 5  ahead of the bell ",2016-08-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weak-retail-sales-and-ppi-data-to-look-for-200147645,200147645
143239,364754,JWN,Should You Buy Retail ETFs Now  ,opinion,"Withthe Q2 earnings season reaching the tail end and retail being the only sector that is yet to come up with many reports  investors must have kept an eye on retail earnings and got sweet surprises on August 11 on a series of upbeat earnings reports 
As per the  issued on August 10  2016  total earnings of the reported retailers are up 8 1  from the same period last year on 8 7  higher revenues  However  such flattering growth rates are mainly due to the stellar Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  report  About 45 5   which is the below the index average  of retailers surpassed on earnings and a meagre 18 2  exceeded revenue estimates 
Against such a backdrop  August 11 amazed retail investors  Below we highlight the key earnings and explain why these retail stocks surged on that day  read    
Retail Earnings in Detail 
On August 11 before market  U S  department store chain Macy s Inc    NYSE M   came up with the fourth straight quarter of positive earnings surprise  Its adjusted earnings of  0 54 a share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 40 while its net sales of  5 87 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 75 billion 
What s more striking is that Macy s is to shut down   over 13 7  of the 728 stores it currently operates and augment investment in its online business to respond to sliding sales  Both beats and such a growth oriented and timely shift in the business model boosted Macy s shares by over 17  in the key trading session 
On the same day  another department store retailer Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   delivered better than expected Q2 of fiscal 2016  wherein both earnings and revenues exceeded the consensus mark Earnings of  1 22 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17 3  while net sales of  4 182 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 158 billion  However  the retailer slashed its earnings guidance due to soft comps and a tough sales scenario  But it still saw share price gains of about 16 2  on August 11  post earnings release 
Nordstrom Inc    NYSE JWN   reported after the bell on August 11 and saw the stock surge over 10 6  after hours on beefed up earnings guidance  The company posted earnings of  0 67 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 55 in the second quarter of fiscal 2016  Its revenues of  3 651 billion marginally missed our estimate of  3 654 billion  The company raised its full year EPS forecast to between    from the previous expectation of  2 50 and  2 70 
What to Expect Ahead 
While Macy s and Kohl s set the mood of the retail sector before the bell  Nordstrom s raised guidance added more cheer to the retail party  The trio acted as a cornerstone for the entire space  In fact  in the key trading session  JWN stock was up over 7 5   Another retail stock like J  C  Penney Company Inc    NYSE JCP   rose over 8 6  and added about 3 7  after hours 
Investors should also note that retail sales grew for the third consecutive month in June  Wage gains may have helped in boosting retail sales lately  Also  a dovish Fed is perhaps acting as a tailwind as a few more months of cheap dollar should boost consumers  purchases and the investing world  read   
ETFs in Focus
Given this positive trend  investors can cash in on the euphoria by investing in retail ETFs SPDR S P Retail ETF  gained over 2 4  on August 11 and also added about 1 1  after hours  read    
Other retail ETFs that gained on that day and may be in focus ahead are VanEck Vectors Retail ETF   V RTH    up about 0 9   and PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF   NYSE M    up over 1 1   
Having said this  we would like to note that consumer sentiment weakened in July from the previous month  Also  the gap between consumers  perception about the current economy and their expectations is now the  
While this can be concern for retail ETFs  investors can bet on the earnings euphoria for as long as the trend remains their friend

What Twilio Is  and Why It s a Hot IPO Stock

	Nothing says success like a billion dollar valuation and a whimsical company name  Last week  before the Brexit came in and rocked the world like a nude Kardashian photo  the word of the week was Twilio   Not to be confused with what the dilliyo  Coolio s Twitter    page or Leonardo DiCaprio in cotton twill pants  Twilio is a cloud communications company based in Unicornville USA  AKA San Francisco  California 

	The company runs a cloud based API that allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls  text messages and video chats  The advantage of this is that now small app developers can add rich communications features to their apps without breaking the bank  The scalable cloud service can grow with developers  With it  the Zacks Mobile app could potentially send you live video chats with trades to make as part of my  service 

	Twilio was founded in 2007 by Jeff Lawson  Evan Cooke and John Wolthuis  Their first real claim to fame came when they started the Rickrolling prank  It s a bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink which would trick people into watching

	That s right  the music video for the 1987 Rick Astley song  Never Gonna Give You Up   Whether it was Anonymous Rickrolling ISIS or Ted Cruz Rickrolling the Donald  it all started with Twilio  Since those early days  Twilio has added some very high profile customers  17  of its revenue comes from Facebook s    What s App  Uber uses Twilio to fuel its communications between drivers and riders  Home Depot    uses it in its 2 200 customer contact centers  Nordstrom    has been using it as a foundation for a concierge service  Competitors include Plivo  Nexmo  and Sinch  with an S  Because it s more whimsical with an S 

	The stock IPO d at  15 last week and has since jumped in  32  in spite of the citizens of Great Britain trying to burn the world down  The current price puts the company s valuation somewhere around  2 6 billion  Like many tech IPOs  the company isn t yet turning a profit but revenue grew 88  to  167 million in 2015  In 2014  revenues were up 78   During the same time  losses have widened from about  27 million to  35 5 million last year

Zacks Model Shows Unlikely Beat
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Office Depot is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Office Depot has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 6 cents  The stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  but an ESP of 0 00  makes a surprise prediction difficult OFFICE DEPOT Price and EPS Surprise
   Factors at Play
Management expects headwinds across product lines and distribution channels  Also  the company s planned store closures and a strengthening U S  dollar may hamper sales  As a result  management continues to project year over year decline in total sales in 2016  Demand for office products  paper based  has been decreasing due to technological advancements 
Smartphones  tablets and laptops are fast emerging as viable substitutes for paper based office supplies  Moreover  there has been a persistent weakness in the office products sector due to decline in business and consumer spending  The company s revenues have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing six quarters 
On the positive side  the company has been improving in store shopping experience  increasing investment in Copy   Print Depot and Tech Depot services  remodeling stores and introducing smaller format stores

143263,364778,JWN,Twilio  What Twilio Is  And Why Twilio Is A Hot IPO Stock ,opinion,"Nothing says success like a billion dollar valuation and a whimsical company name  Last week  before the Brexit came in and rocked the world like a nude Kardashian photo  the word of the week was Twilio     Not to be confused with what the dilliyo  Coolio s Twitter    page or Leonardo Di Caprio in cotton twill pants  Twilio is a cloud communications company based in Unicornville USA  AKA San Francisco  California 

The company runs a cloud based API that allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls  text messages and video chats  The advantage of this is that now small app developers can add rich communications features to their apps without breaking the bank  The scalable cloud service can grow with developers  With it  the Zacks Mobile app could potentially send you live video chats with trades to make as part of my  service 

Twilio was founded in 2007 by Jeff Lawson  Evan Cooke and John Wolthuis  Their first real claim to fame came when they started the Rickrolling prank  It s a bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink which would trick people into watching

That s right  the music video for the 1987 Rick Astley song  Never Gonna Give You Up   Whether it was Anonymous Rickrolling ISIS or Ted Cruz Rickrolling the Donald  it all started with Twilio  Since those early days  Twilio has added some very high profile customers  17  of its revenue comes from Facebook s    What s App  Uber uses Twilio to fuel its communications between drivers and riders  Home Depot  NYSE HD     uses it in its 2 200 customer contact centers  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN     has been using it as a foundation for a concierge service  Competitors include Plivo  Nexmo  and Sinch  with an S  Because it s more whimsical with an S 

The stock IPO d at  15 last week and has since jumped in  32  in spite of the citizens of Great Britain trying to burn the world down  The current price puts the company s valuation somewhere around  2 6 billion  Like many tech IPOs  the company isn t yet turning a profit but revenue grew 88  to  167 million in 2015  In 2014  revenues were up 78   During the same time  losses have widened from about  27 million to  35 5 million last year

143264,364779,JWN,Shares Of Twilio Continued To Rise Tuesday  Could It Spur More IPOs In 2016  ,opinion,"Last Thursday  cloud based communications company Twilio   NYSE TWLO   launched its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange and enjoyed a great first day of trade  Closing the day just under  29 per share  TWLO saw its share price jump a whopping 92  as investors flocked to buy in to the stock   

	TWLO continued its run Tuesday after a Brexit induced drop Friday and Monday  as the stock closed nearly 9 5  higher  It seems as though investors like what they see in Twilio  which enables software and app developers to communicate with users quickly and effectively  The company has big name clients using its services  with Facebook s   NASDAQ FB   Whatsapp  Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   and Uber Technologies being three of the largest 

	The company s platform seeks to help developers add communication features to their apps  and Twilio projects the platform will be worth upwards of  45 billion next year  The company posted revenue growth of 78  in 2014  87  in 2015  and 77 8  in its most recent quarter  making it very intriguing for growth investors 

	Despite the growth however  the company is yet to be profitable  as it continues to reinvest its earnings into the business  Twilio does not have any debt on its balance sheet  and boasts over  200 million in cash 

Bottom Line

	2016 has been a relatively slow year in regards to the IPO market  with the uncertainty of the global economy and slowing growth causing most IPO candidates to remain cautious of launching offerings  Many are hoping that despite recent volatility  Twilio s IPO success could provide some motive for other unicorns  companies with valuations over  1 billion  to consider launching IPOs of their own

143268,364783,JWN,4 Things To Watch In The S P 500,opinion,"The S P 500 is moving sideways  about 5  from its all time high and has been doing so for 2 months  With this price action it is very interesting that investor sentiment is so bearish  In the AAII poll bullish sentiment was measured recently at just 19 3   It was last at this level when the S P 500 was at the February lows  All I can say to that is wow 
There are numerous calls for recession  some saying the economy is already there  Earnings reports are being cherry picked to follow the weak  not the strong  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Walmart  NYSE WMT  knocked it out of the park  yet we want to focus on companies with dying business models like Macy s Inc  NYSE M  and Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   I cant stop that  But what I can do is move away from that noise and look at price action 
The chart of the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  below lets me do just that  When I look at it there are 4 things that pop out to me that the market is pausing not ready to crash  First is the momentum  The RSI at the top of the chart is pulling back  but through the entire 2 months of sideways action it has stayed in the bullish range  over 40 


The second is that the  pullback  has retraced only 23 6  of the move higher from the February low  With bearish sentiment this is a show of strength 
Next is that the price of the SPY remains over its 200 day SMA  This is the most basic of bullish signals  Bull above the 200 day and bear below it 
Finally at the bottom of the chart is the accumulation distribution  It shows strong accumulation from the February low that continued into early May  The slope of the accumulation distribution is flat and maybe even slightly down  but there is no selling pressure 
These four things could all change next week or next month  But until they do the price action looks to be nothing more than digestion of the move off of the February lows  Its still  W  for Win until then

Quarterly revenue came in at  502 9 million  which were essentially flat compared to net sales of  502 4 million in the fiscal 2015 first quarter  and comparable sales that include e commerce sales decreased 3  
The company reported net incomes of  19 million  or  0 25 per share  To put these results into context  Express  guidance issued in March called for comparable sales growth in the low single digit percentage range and adjusted net income of  20 million to  22 million  or  0 25 to  0 28 per share 
Express CEO David Kornberg remained positive as he highlighted the fact that his company delivered healthier merchandise margin  gross margin  and adjusted earnings per share within its guidance range   it just happened to be on the lower end 
 We believe that our product is on trend and we are providing customers with engaging experiences across each of our channels   Kornberg stated   That being said  our second quarter and full year guidance reflect the challenges presented by the current retail environment  
More specifically for the second quarter  Express anticipates comparable sales in the  negative mid single digit percentage range  and net income of  12 million to  15 million  or  0 15 to  0 19 per share 
For the full year 2016  Express also reduced its guidance to call for comparable sales to be in the  negative mid  to low single digit range  compared to previous guidance for positive comps in the  low single digits   and adjusted diluted EPS of  1 41 to  1 54 compared to  1 56 to  1 71 previously

Weakness in the retail space has taken its toll on luxury brands with Michael Kors next
Nordstrom s decision to no longer carry Kors handbags should have an immediate impact on earnings

Unfortunately  the biggest news from the company was a decision from Nordstrom to no longer carry Michael Kors handbags  Nordstrom had been feeling squeezed by Macy s to price match and discount similar Kors bags  The ongoing promotions Macy s ran was a major determinant for Nordstroms to stop carrying the bags  This clearly isn t a good thing for Michael Kors  which should expect to feel the aftermath in the remainder of the year

	But it s not leaving out on line sales  In addition to buying the appliances in the stores  JC Penney is expanding online sales as well

143279,364794,JWN,Earnings Wrap  Better Luck Next Quarter,opinion," Patience is the ability to idle your motor when you feel like stripping your gears  
 After a swift decline in January  a flat February  a strong turnaround in March and a pretty flat April  investor patience is starting to wear thin  It seems ever more difficult to discern a direction for the markets and the economy  As  Joe Calhoun has remarked in his recent writings  the indicators our firm utilizes to analyze expectations on the health of the US economy have been mixed and official economic data releases have also been contradictory  as you can see here in our    Political uncertainty is not confined to the upcoming US elections  Brazil impeached their President last week and an immigration crisis is stirring extremism across Europe  Not a surprise then  that financial markets wander aimlessly as participants wait for a resolution one way or the other 
As earnings season begins to wind down  quarter to date returns for US stocks have been lackluster with the S P 500 and Dow up 0 46  and 0 52  respectively through May 12th  Although we ve seen a majority of companies  approximately 72   posting positive earnings surprises  that is against estimates that were lowered substantially by the end of the first quarter  It has been harder for companies to beat on revenues  but according to FactSet  55  of companies have managed the feat  Thomson Reuters  data  shows first quarter earnings down  year over year  by approximately 5  
Focusing the Earnings Update report on the consumer discretionary space this time around seems rather appropriate  as retailers have been in the news daily this week and they comprise the greatest weighting in the sector  over 40   Consumer Discretionary proved a winning sector last year  returning over 10  versus the S P 500 s total return of 1 38   This year the stocks are up  through 4 29 16   but have lagged most other sectors with the exception of Financials  Health Care and Technology  Earnings released by some of the largest retailers this past week   Macy s  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   Kohl s  and Dillard s   did nothing to improve the performance of the sector as all four  and others  saw their stock prices decline precipitously  Earnings and revenues were dismal  forward guidance pretty pessimistic  Earnings and sales didn t just miss lowered expectations  they are declining outright and inventories continue to run high  Betting against the American consumer has always been a loser but 2 5  year over year wage growth has us in a stingy mood  lower prices at the pump notwithstanding 
So  in an effort to find a silver lining   it helps to be an optimist when you manage money   let s consider a couple of noteworthy economic releases today  The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April was much stronger than expected at 95 8 versus last month s 89 and a consensus of 90  The April retail sales report was another bright spot  up 1 3  in April  relative to March  to a seasonally adjusted  453 44 billion  A look at the details shows strength in autos  gasoline and non store retailers  Autos sales rebounded strongly  up 3 2  after a weak March and higher prices helped gas station sales  In the non store category is Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   one giant non store retailer that reported earnings and revenues well ahead of expectations and got a 10  stock price pop after the announcement  Cost conscious consumers continue to respond to the convenience and lower priced offerings of e commerce  Although the traditional retailers have an on line presence  they continue to struggle to compete with Amazon and some of the other e commerce sites that are relatively unburdened by the cost of maintaining a physical presence  Amazon  for now at least  appears to be eating most everyone s lunch  In retail  investors face a textbook value versus growth decision  Traditional retailers are certainly cheap but lack growth while Amazon has growth but a fancy stock price to match 
The value versus growth emphasis shifted this past quarter  Last year growth stocks were the definitive winners  while so far this year  the reverse has been true  despite the retail exception   We have seen considerable out performance in yield stocks  a subset of the value strategy  With Fed rate hikes getting pushed out   maybe to next year   income investors have bid up dividend payers to prices that probably put their  safe  reputation at risk  It may be time to trim some of those winners  Consider your personal risk parameters and time horizons in looking for less well liked replacements with quality characteristics  Adding some cheaper international stocks to your conservative equity portfolio probably makes sense here too with dollar strength waning  Diversification and patience are best friends when it comes to managing risk  Now that all boats are no longer rising with the tide  it s an important time to be vigilant and to do your homework or have a professional do it for you ",2016-05-16,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-update-200130102,200130102
143280,364795,JWN,Death Of The American Mall ,opinion,"Ahhh  the Mall  That shimmering monument to capitalism  Nothing says America like putting a purse on layaway or maxing out your store credit card on cologne and Fossil watches  Kind of brings a tear to my eye to think that malls are dying all around the country  I remember the days of being a teenager  heading to the mall to talk to girls and getting shot down like an Iraqi fighter pilot 
Strutting my stuff over to the food court at Old Orchard in my Finish Line assistant manager polo  Old Orchard still does well but the indoor malls in the Chicagoland and around the country are dying off  You know things are bad when there are roving packs of 80 year olds taking laps and playing Mahjong in the food court for four hours before they high tail it home to catch Murder She Wrote at 2pm I mean  they re not known for hanging out at rock concerts  They go to malls because they re quiet  So quiet they feel like they can take laps around them and play Mahjong in the food court  What s next  Flash mobs 
No wonder these retail earnings reports have been stinking up the place  Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   JC Penny and Macy s all reported terrible same store sales  Credit income and real estate gains accounted for 70  of Macy s EBIT 
This Thursday I ll be talking about Gap in our Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Earnings Preview Live Stream and the outlook there is grim too  I ll teach you how to bet on that thing blowing up and win big  The easy scapegoats that the retailers are using for why they stink are minimum wage and a weak consumer  I say they re wrong  Consumers are having no problem buying off of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and other online retailers  The problem is nobody wants to sift through tables full of unfolded jeans and go on an Easter egg hunt to try and find a cashier  I hate begging stores to take my money 
Brick and mortar retailers have been trying to compete with online retailers on price and are losing the battle  They need to differentiate themselves by offering a superior in store experience  I got to Ace Hardware because the old guys there help me get the right part the first time and I love flirting with the ladies behind the counter 
Why do millions of people flock to Las Vegas  It s not the sand  It s the shows  the spectacle  the gorgeous women  fire juggling acrobats and chromed out Lamborghini s bumping Fetty Wap  Make malls exciting again  Center them on an experience rather than a dusty  out dated  beat down  depressing department store that smells like Fixodent and Icy Hot  Hear that Simon Properties 
I m talking go kart tracks around the mall  ice skating rinks  an LA Fitness  an exotic car dealership  and a Tilted Kilt for Dad to runaway to while Mom is having some alone time herself

The Estimize consensus is looking for a loss of 35 cents per shares on  2 94 billion in revenue  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top
JCP has already indicated that first quarter profits will come in higher than expected  providing reassurance to investors that worry its turnaround is coming to an end 
Strong numbers have been driven by an increased focus on its omni channel capabilities  expanding store in store Sephora sales and deeper penetration of its private brand
On the verge of bankruptcy  JC Penney has made a remarkable turnaround in the past few years  Consumers are shying away from higher end department stores like Macy s  NYSE M  and Nordstrom s  NYSE JWN  in favor of discounters like JC Penney  This has been huge for the stock which is already up 20  on the year  The Estimize consensus is looking for a loss of 35 cents per shares on  2 94 billion in revenue  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top  Earnings per share estimates have increased 13  since its last report and now predict 39  growth from a year earlier  On average  the stock is a positive mover leading up to earnings and then turns negative by 2  in the 30 day post earnings period 
This quarter  JC Penney is expected to be the biggest winner amongst department stores  The low end retailer crushed the holiday season with reported earnings per share that were 15 cents higher than expectations  The quarter also featured a 4 1  increase in comparable store sales  with additional gains coming from online sales  For 2015 comp store sales grew 4 5   free cash flow improved by 130  and the company retired  500 million of debt  As a result  the stock is up over 20  since the start of year  Strong numbers were primarily driven by an increased focus on its omni channel capabilities  expanding store in store Sephora sales and deeper penetration of its private brand  JCP has already indicated that first quarter profits will come in higher than expected  providing reassurance to investors that worry its turnaround is coming to an end

143284,364799,JWN,Brick   Mortar Feeling The Wrath On Friday The 13th,opinion,"Friday the 13th of May  2016
Friday the 13th may have negative historical connotations  but we have no reason to change our daily routines  Unless  of course  our livelihoods are directly tied to the traditional brick and mortar retail space  particularly department stores 
The pain in the department store space is widespread  with J C  Penney    NYSE JCP    becoming the latest operator to come out weak numbers  Penney s has been somewhat of a turnaround story  but even supposedly better placed players like Macy s    NYSE M     Nordstrom    NYSE JWN     Kohl s    NYSE KSS    and others appear to be on their knees this earnings season 
Apparel is apparently the weakest category for these operators  with management teams appearing clueless as to what has happened to apparel demand  But that s hardly the only issue facing these operators   they are dealing with a secular shift in consumer preferences who are increasingly comfortable spending their money online at Amazon    NYSE M    instead of going to the mall 
It s not a consumer spending issue  it is more tied to evolving consumer spending habits  In other words  the question isn t how much consumers are spending  but where they are spending it  This is clearly visible in today s April Retail Sales report  which came in better than expected  with the report s internals showing a lot of momentum  Not only did the Retail Sales reading come out strong  offsetting the negative momentum from the last two months  but the report s sub category about non store retailers  includes operators like Amazon and other on line and catalog vendors  had the strongest gain of all categories 
The bottom line is that department stores need to align their businesses with evolving consumer preferences  They can t have all of their capital tied up in physical facilities when consumers are looking for convenient and easy to use online facilities  Perhaps the solution lies in the stores becoming showrooms and warehouses in their broader fulfillment chain  Perhaps the market s reaction to these retail earnings reports on Friday the 13th will really put the point across

143288,364803,JWN,Beating Analyst Expectations Is All That Matters ,opinion," Zillow Group Inc  NASDAQ Z  shares surge as quarterly loss narrows  
CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS  had a  healthy  earnings report  Sales rose but earnings actually fell by 6   How is that  healthy  
Match Group  NASDAQ MTCH   beats forecasts   shares rise 10    Well  actually real  net earnings  fell 73  and of the company s  total assets  listed at  1 9b   1 3b of that is  goodwill   Goodwill is basically fairy dust 
Perversely  it s all good as long as the  earnings  beat analyst s estimates  Of course  Wall Street analysts are simply shills in the con  Earnings estimates are there to allow all players to pretend that all is well  When companies go bad  earnings estimates are lowered until they are on the ground if necessary  And  those estimates can be buried under ground so companies can simply roll over the estimates like a liquored up wino and make everyone cheer  This is when companies become  buys  because they didn t lose as much money as analysts expected  Stock indices have been rising because earnings have been beating analysts expectations  Stocks are not rising because revenue  income  earnings  and employment has been rising  This is pure theatre and investors should read economic data very carefully with the knowledge that most of what they read is an out right lie  If it is printed in the US  there is no question it is a lie 
Statistics and  data  are there for another reason  The FRB uses this nonsense to justify their destruction of the world so central bankers can rule everything  Does it strike anyone besides me as a bit dishonest to see the central banksters pop out of their caldrons to manipulate asset prices from time to time with a few words of deceit  We will never hear the truth as long as central banksters are in business  Thus we have the current economic bubble 
The Fed s Lockhart calls June rate hike a  real option   We all have a real option to stick our fingers in a blender and set the machine on  Puree  but I wouldn t recommend that either  Why a people who entertain the idea of personal freedom tolerates these lying sinister banksters I have no idea 
And now for a little levity   courtesy the US Commerce Department  Yes  that would be the DOPE  Department Of Pathological Embellishment   Retail sales  data  was reported by the DOPE today  5 13 16  and it was hilarious  Of course we all know the backdrop  Retailers have almost all unanimously reported declining sales  Yet  the DOPE wants us to believe otherwise so they said that April retail sales in the US increased at a 1 3  rate   the strongest gain in a year  Weeeee    One of the strong points of the gain was the increase in apparel sales  Supposedly apparel sales  surged  1   Please feel free to have a belly laugh right now  Shouldn t these liars be required to post a warning before they report such hilarious idiocy  Me myself  I almost choked this morning on my breakfast because I was laughing so hard at the absurdity of such a report  If one listened closely  one could hear laughter erupting all over the world 
Does anyone besides me ever get tired of being lied to by gooberment institutions 
Curiously  the stores that sell apparel reported something totally different  Macy s Inc  NYSE M  is the largest apparel seller in the US and they said their sales were down over 5  and they were lowering full year estimates to reflect sales declines of 3   5 percent  Ditto for the Gap Inc  NYSE GPS  and Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  and Nordstrom Inc  NYSE JWN   Several other retailers have declared bankruptcy since sales increased so much  Sporting goods even rose in the the DOPE survey  Sports Authority apparently didn t get the memo as they too declared bankruptcy 
Clearly the Fed would like an opportunity to raise the fed funds rate  Clearly they are writing the news to justify such  Clearly the Fed has been buying stocks and propping up asset prices to justify such  It is a sham  But  nothing will change as long as central banksters are allowed to infect economies with cancerous policies 
Sadly  the lying liars are left in charge by the profoundly ignorant populaces 
To follow up on my article of a few months ago regarding Hillary s email server being hacked  the hacker   Guccifer   is still in jail  The story was reported several months ago by Russia Today  In the american press  the story is now  breaking news   I wish the US had an actual media like Russia does  Of course  I do understand that under tyrannical rule the  media  can t actually report truth  Anyway  the Clinton campaign said of this story   There is absolutely no basis to believe the claims made by this criminal from his prison cell  
Really  Then why is he a  criminal   Why is he in jail in the first place  Because he is accused of hacking Clinton s server      Oh  and not that it matters  the Russians say they have a few gigs of Hillary s emails  Not to worry  I m sure they were all discussing what Hillary and Bill were going to have for dinner 
And one last thing  Look for the US fed note to lose another 4  or so relative to the euro before summer starts  This should be the impetus for the Fed to move  The two currencies would then reverse course  The next few months will be interesting

143292,364807,JWN,Is The End Near For Major Department Stores ,opinion,"The end of the first quarter earnings season is approaching and it s the retail sector s turn to take center stage  This week  the department stores are on deck  pitting upscale retailer Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  against middle of the road Macy s  NYSE M  and discounters like JC Penney  NYSE JCP  and Kohl s  NYSE KSS  for retail supremacy  Shifting spending habits lately have favored the lower end stores as online retailers have taken the biggest bite from Nordstrom and Macy s  Also reporting this week is retail sales for April  with numbers expected to rebound following a sluggish March  After the next two weeks we will have a better picture as to how consumers are spending their discretionary income 

Macy s  Inc  Consumer Discretionary   Multiline Retail   Reports May 11  Before Market Opens
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings of 37 cents per share on  5 94 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  20 million below on the top  Compared to a year earlier  earnings per share are predicted to fall 31  with sales dropping as much as 4   On average  Macy s stock is relatively flat during earnings season  which is unfortunate because shares are down 44  in the past 12 months 
Kicking things off this week is Macy s  NYSE M   out with results tomorrow morning  Despite a nice beat last quarter  Macy s has struggled to drive growth into positive territory  The holiday season  typically Macy s strongest  featured a total sales decline 5 3  with a 4 8  decline in comparable store sales  The company primarily blamed the abnormally warmer weather  lower tourist spending and an overly cautious consumer for its fourth quarter blunders  Nevertheless  Macy s has undertaken extensive initiatives to propel sales and profitability  The include expanding its off price business  Macy s Backstage  implementing a new loyalty rewards program and opening more Bluemercury free standing beauty stores  The company has also begun to explore a REIT opportunity involving its flagship and mall based properties  Macy s Herald Square  NYSE SQ  location alone has been valued over  4 billion and with all its other properties  this number surpasses  20 billion  In the meantime  it will likely be more of the same for Macy s  which continues to lose market share to online and discount retailers 
Kohl s Corp Consumer Discretionary   Multiline Retail   Reports May 12  Before Market Opens
The Estimize community is looking for a earnings per share of 37 cents on revenue expectations of  4 13 billion  right in line with Wall Street on the bottom and  12 million lower on top  Since Kohl s last report  per share estimates have been cut 8  to reflect an expected decline of 33  on a year over year basis  On average  the stock is a positive mover leading up to earnings but turns negative after results have been reported  
Kohl s biggest focus lately has been on its new strategic initiative  the Greatness Agenda  designed to drive top line growth  The Greatness Agenda is a multi year plan built on five fundamental pillars  amazing product  incredible savings  easy experience  personalized connections and winning teams  The framework has already been successful in turning revenue growth positive for every quarter of 2015  In the second year of the Greatness Agenda  Kohl s aims on growing its women s apparel business  launching new formats and distribution channels  and winning new customers  to name a few  While all this sounds great  Kohl s still operates in a highly competitive industry where it is starting to fall behind  Shares of the department store are down 13 3  year to date while Macy s  Nordstrom and JC Penney are all positive this year  Meanwhile  comparable store sales of 0 4  last quarter were down from the 3 7  rate it posted in Q4 2014  Lower consumer spending habits  heavy discounting and investments into the Greatness Agenda are expected to adversely impact margins and earnings for the foreseeable future 
Nordstrom Consumer Discretionary   Multiline Retail   Reports May 12  After Market Opens
After a significant loss the last 2 quarters  expectations are generally low ahead of Nordstrom s earnings  The Estimize consensus is looking for EPS of 45 cents on  3 28 billion in revenue  right in line with Wall Street on the bottom line and  7 million lower on top  Since its last report  EPS estimates have been cut 23   which now predict a 28  loss from a year earlier  Revenue on the other hand is expected to grow 3   still slower than sales growth from past quarters  
After a dismal holiday season  Nordstrom issued a bleak outlook for fiscal 2016  High end department stores like Nordstrom have been hit the hardest by changing consumer habits  Those who can afford the top notch brands are now shopping directly from the vendor while other consumers are opting for off price retailers  This has clearly been the case for Nordstrom  which saw gross profit as a percentage of net sales decline 35  compared with same period last year  However  its off price business and online sales were the two fastest growing segments within the company  Nordstrom Rack and Hautelook saw net sales increase 50  while online sales increased 11   Meanwhile  the sale of its credit card portfolio to TD Bank  TO TD  coupled with other various growth initiatives should help deliver profitability down the road 
J C  Penney Company Consumer Discretionary   Multiline Retail   Reports May 13  Before Market Opens
The Estimize consensus is looking for a loss of 35 cents per shares on  2 94 billion in revenue  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top  Earnings per share estimates have increased 13  since its last report and now predict 39  growth from a year earlier  On average the stock is a positive mover leading up to earnings and then turns negative by 2  in the 30 day post earnings period 
This quarter  JC Penney is expected to be the biggest winner among department stores  The low end retailer crushed the holiday season with reported earnings per share that were 15 cents higher than expectations  The quarter also featured a 4 1  increase in comparable store sales  with additional gains coming from online sales  For 2015 comp store sales grew 4 5   free cash flow improved by 130  and the company retired  500 million of debt  As a result  the stock is up over 20  since the start of year  Strong numbers were primarily driven by an increased focus on its omni channel capabilities  expanding its store in store Sephora sales and deeper penetration of its private brand  JCP has already indicated that first quarter profits will come in higher than expected  providing reassurance to investors that worry its turnaround is coming to an end

143299,364814,JWN,Widespread And Worse,opinion,"When Janet Yellen testified to Congress last week  she was as usual careful with her words  Alan Greenspan once called it  mumbling with incoherence  but there is very little left to rambling in Yellen s predicament  Where Greenspan was once the  maestro  and Bernanke the  hero  Yellen is stuck holding the bag  and I think she knows it  In truth  there isn t the faintest difference between any of them  which is exactly the problem and her source of frustration  The Fed is in grave danger of being unquestionably revealed for the backward  incompetent institution it always was 
As to the recent stumble  it makes for the most uncomfortable juxtaposition between what the Fed did in December and what the economy and markets have continued to do since mid year last year  To continue on in that contradiction leaves her no choice but 

 Financial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth   she told the House Financial Services Committee   These developments  if they prove persistent  could weigh on the outlook for economic activity  

She meant that convulsions in the stock markets could harm the economy Ms  Yellen argued on Wednesday that the rest of the world was to blame  She said the crucial question confronting the Fed was whether the domestic economy is strong enough to keep growing modestly even as the global economy struggles 

As always  it has to be  overseas  because the BLS says so 

Ms  Yellen highlighted the  solid improvement  of the United States labor market  The unemployment rate fell to 4 9 percent in January from 5 7 percent a year ago  while the economy added an average of 222 000 jobs a month  Wages also rose more quickly 

Whether she actually believes the BLS figures or not is another question altogether  If this is still part of the  best jobs market in decades   where is all the spending  Not only was the Christmas shopping season atrocious  the first estimates for 2016 were even more so  While seasonal adjustments  saved  the retail sales report for January  actual store receipts bury them by agreeing with the unadjusted version 

Excluding the drug stores  the Thomson Reuters Same Store Sales Index registered a  1 0  comp for January  beating its flat final estimate  Including the Drug Store sector  SSS drops to a  1 1  comp  missing its final flat estimate  75  of retailers missed their SSS estimate The blizzard in January kept shoppers at home instead of the shopping mall that weekend  As a result  holiday clearance has not been selling well  As inventory piles up  retailers missed their SSS estimates and blamed the weather and a weak consumer spending environment 

In last year s  unexpected  snows of January  the SSSI gained slightly  while in the Polar Vortex of 2014 the SSSI grew by nearly 4   From  3 8  to  0 6  to  1 1  all in the frozen confines of three straight bracing January s leaves out any  residual seasonality  and permits only an all too well defined trajectory  Yellen claims the problem is overseas but  as I write constantly  everyone overseas is pointing right back at US consumers and US  demand  

It sure looks like a sustained period of contraction  above  and surely  unusual  weakness  Whether or not any economist wants to admit the slightest hint of recession doesn t really matter  retailers themselves are already filling in that commentary  Walmart  N WMT  missed big  forecasting no sales growth in 2016 instead of 3  to 4  in its past guidance  while Nordstrom  N JWN  set back further the economic narrative with heavy  

Analysts considered the best in class department store a casualty of the overall sluggish retail environment  particularly as it pertained to discounting across the sector 
Even as the high end store held the line on storewide promotions  its commitment to matching other stores  prices contributed to a 1 8 percent dent in its gross margin   a hit that was exacerbated by its need to mark down merchandise to clear inventory 
Paired with a conservative outlook for 2016  Nordstrom s second straight quarter of disappointing results reignited investor concern that its exposure to the high end consumer could translate into softness this year  particularly as the stock market continues to fluctuate 
But perhaps more importantly  its discount Rack stores   which have fueled much of the company s revenue growth over the past few years   posted their third same store sales decline for the year 

High end  low end  the store chain suffered at all ends even though the unemployment rate suggests to orthodox economists the economy is so very close to booming  This disconnect is not even much of one  since the only indication of that kind of possibility  the one that sustains Yellen in public  is increasingly isolated  bringing to mind closer and closer only logical fallacy  Even if it were just retailers  that might be enough of a recession hint  but it is   just  retailers or the 12  manufacturing economy 

Corporate America is in the thick of the  worst quarter for profits growth  in the past five years 

In Q4 2015  blended earnings have seen an overall decrease of 3 6 percent and will likely bottom out at 4 2 percent  If earnings continue on their downward trajectory  it will be the first time the S P 500 has seen three consecutive quarters of year over year declines in earnings since Q3 2009 Prospects are not likely to improve anytime soon  with 381 S P 500 companies  about 87 percent of the index  having already released earnings updates  The remaining companies  mostly retailers and utility companies  will report updates over February and early March 

With retailers yet to report  perhaps  4 2  might actually prove quite optimistic  Whatever ultimately the case  three straight quarters of negative earnings is a particularly difficult digression and  as much as economists want to rest all that upon just the dollar  it is  in fact  much  much more serious than earnings  Giving EPS problems the  rising dollar  makes it sound artificial  as if it is just number translations on reported ledgers  What actual businesses are finding  however  is quite real and more so disturbing in just  

In 2015  equity investors looking for yield suffered death by 394 cuts  Last year  the number of dividend reductions far surpassed 2008  according to Bespoke Investment Group  citing data from Standard   Poor s 

The ratcheting down of payouts to shareholders is a function of weak commodity prices  sluggish growth dampening corporate profits  and a tightening of credit conditions 
How is that last paragraph immediately above any different from one  The fact that dividends are being dropped on a widespread basis is an open invitation to just that potential  There is a very real cash problem here  front to back  against which the FOMC and economists place the BLS s various and sundry imputations and statistical models  The amount of corroborative evidence is overwhelming against them  including  overseas  which  again  easily traces back to the sudden and sustained drop in actual consumer activity no matter how low the unemployment drops 
If it looks like a recession from so many different angles  chances are very good that it is  It is so consistent that even the stock market has finally awoken  The problem  the real problem  is as Nordstrom s struggles suggest with inventory   it is only beginning  And that point is echoed in  tightening of credit conditions  which haven t truly tightened in any relatively meaningful way yet  The OECD  for one  is right to be suddenly alarmed  though  as usual  it would have been far more helpful and relevant last year instead of further fostering the absurd notion of  transitory   Like Bernanke was in his turn  Yellen will be the last to admit it  Sadly for her  she can t eat the unemployment rate ",2016-02-21,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/widespread-and-worse-200118956,200118956
143300,364815,JWN,5 Retailers With The Heaviest Downward Revisions Reporting This Week,opinion,"The fourth quarter earnings season has been  in a word  underwhelming  Beat rates are at a historical low for companies within the S P 500  with only 54  able to beat on the bottom line  and 41  on the top line  As it usually does  the quarter will wrap up with the retail earnings parade  This week s 5 Stocks to Watch highlights those retailers that have had the largest downward revisions heading into their reports this week 
Macy s  Inc    
Consumer Discretionary   Multiline Retail   Reports February 23  before the open 
The Estimize consensus calls for Macy s  N M  to have an EPS of  2 07  with the Estimize Select consensus  even lower at  1 94  This is still above the Wall Street consensus of  1 86  but well below guidance for  2 21  Revenue expectations of  8 822 billion are less optimistic than the Street s expectation of  8 843B  Compared to Q4 2014  this represents a projected YoY decrease of 20  and 6  for both EPS and sales  The Estimize community has been bearish on Macy s profitability in the past three months  revising EPS estimates down 23   That said  the company has consistently delivered positive earnings surprises  beating Wall Street s EPS estimates 83  of the time 

What to Watch  Despite beating on the bottom line in the third quarter  Macy s has missed both the Estimize and Wall Street consensus on the top line for 9 consecutive quarters  Failure to stimulate sales performance during the fiscal year led to share prices falling 46 7  in 2015  Comparable store sales have declined the past three quarters with Macy s cutting its 2015 full year guidance several times from  2  to  3   This past month  the company announced comparable store sales had fallen 4 7  during the last two months of the fourth quarter  Holiday sales have been crippled by unusually warm weather and competitive threats from the likes of J C  Penney  N JCP   Furthermore  international tourist sales have been hampered due to the stronger dollar  In an effort to weather the ongoing struggles  Macy s plans on closing dozens of stores and eliminating 2000 jobs  The aggressive cost cutting initiative is expected to save the company more than  400 million by 2018  Macy s has also embraced its off price business  Macy s Backstage  to stimulate growth as Nordstrom Rack  N JWN  has done for Nordstrom  That said  the company s restructuring plan and new initiatives will take multiple years to scale to a level that is impactful to investors  In the meantime  activist investor Starboard Value has urged Macy s to spin off its stores into assets to unlock the true value of its real estate  It is estimated that the flagship Herald Square  N SQ  Herald Square location in NYC is valued at  4 billion alone 
Steve Madden   
Consumer Discretionary   Textiles  Apparel   Luxury Goods   Reports February 24  before the open 
The Estimize Select consensus on Steve Madden  O SHOO  is calling for EPS of  0 44  just a penny higher than the Street  and a penny lower than the Estimize mean  Revenues of  345 7M also surpass the sell side estimate of  344 2M  Since the beginning of the year  EPS estimates have fallen 17   with revenues declining 5   The retailer has only beaten the Estimize consensus 43  on the bottom line  but surprisingly surpasses the revenue consensus 71  of the time  going against the broader trend of companies missing on the top line but beating on the bottom line 

What to Watch  This is a company that actually beat expectations in the third quarter  benefiting from the back to school shopping season and posting positive earnings growth after four consecutive down quarters  The fourth quarter  however  is expected to suffer from deep discounts and highly promotional events run during the holiday season  Steve Madden  like other shoe retailers  has been suffering from a lack of trends in women s fashion for the past couple of years  but in many ways has held up better than the competition  The company has seen a huge benefit from the strategic acquisitions of Dolce Vita  Blondo and SM Mexico last year  Unseasonably warm weather during the fourth quarter is expected to impact the sales of higher margin boot sales and other winter apparel 
Chico s   
Consumer Discretionary   Specialty Retail   Reports February 25  before the open 
The Estimize Select consensus on Chico s  N CHS  is calling for EPS of  0 02  two pennies higher than the Street  and two pennies lower than the Estimize mean of  0 04  Revenues of  637M also surpass the sell side by  5M  Since the company last reported  EPS estimates have plummeted 75   with revenues falling roughly 4   The retailer has only beaten the Estimize consensus 42  on the bottom line  and an even lower 33  on the top line 

What to Watch  The third quarter was a rough one for this retailer  with a big miss on the top and bottom line initiating a further sell off of the stock  which has fallen 41  in the last 12 months  A preview of how same store sales for the quarter was faring was not encouraging either  As of November  quarter to date results were showing a year over year decline of 4 8   This retailer has had a number of product misses in the last few years and currently appears to be going through an identity crisis  Typically known for catering to a mature consumer  Chico s is looking to revamp and freshen their brand in order to attract a younger demographic  So far these attempts have not been successful  In the fall  the retailer made public that it was considering selling itself after being approached by several private equity firms  including Sycamore Partners  This could be good for investors  but thus far no deal has materialized 
Gap Inc    
Consumer Discretionary   Specialty Retail   Reports February 25  after the close 
The Estimize community s consensus on Gap  N GPS  calls for EPS of  0 55 and revenue of  4 19 billion  one penny below the Street on the bottom line  and roughly  18 million lower on the top line  The Esitmize mean is a bit higher on revenues at  4 442B  The Estimize community has maintained a pessimistic stance on the Gap  revising EPS estimates down 17  since the company last reported  Compared to the same period last year  current estimates predict a YoY decline in EPS and revenue of 24  and 4   respectively  On average  Gap has consistently delivered positive earnings surprises  beating the Estimize consensus 67  of the time  while trumping Wall Street 85  of the time 

What to Watch  This past year has not been kind to the Gap  Declining sales for the past three quarters weighed heavily on the company  with the stock down 41 3  in 2015  This comes as a result of persisting currency headwinds and disappointing performance of its core brands  Consistent with this trend  Gap recently reported a 3  decline in net sales on a constant currency basis and a 5  decline in comparable store sales across its core brands in December 2015  Old Navy  once the savior for this retailer  also posted  7  comp store sales as the brand continues to struggle  Competitive pressure has played a major role in Gap s soft sales outlook  as fast fashion companies including H M  Forever21 and Zara have effectively cut into Gap s already dwindling market share  The retailer operates in a highly fragmented market where it has failed to offer high quality  distinguished products at a competitive price  Moreover  the company is committed to a store growth strategy with a focus on Asia  its Athleta brand and global outlet stores  Unfortunately  these efforts are not expected to mask Gap s glaring weaknesses when it reports fourth quarter earnings 
J  C  Penney Company  Inc    
Consumer Discretionary   Multiline Retail   Reports February 26  before the open 
The Estimize select consensus on J C  Penney  N JCP  calls for EPS of  0 24  three cents lower than the Estimize mean  but a penny above the Wall Street consensus  Revenues of  3 993B are in line with the Street  The Estimize community has been bearish on J C  Penney s profitability this quarter  pushing EPS estimates down 23  in the past 3 months  Historically  the company beats Wall Street 76  of the time while failing to surpass Estimize 44  of the time 

What to Watch  Driven by its strategic initiatives  J C  Penney delivered a positive earnings surprise in the most recent quarter  The company s ongoing stance on overhauling its core business has slowly begun to pay off  Between November and December this past year  comp store sales grew 3 9  on the back of strong demand for its private label offerings  higher online sales  and the exploding popularity of its in store Sephora department  Like other retailers  JCP has focused on improving its online shopping experience and omni channel reach  The company is also remodeling and renovating its stores with a goal of enhancing high margin departments such as handbags and beauty products  In store Sephora departments have been a key growth catalyst for JCP  as the strongest performing category since the relationship began in 2006  On the downside  JCP continues to face competitive pressure from all sides  both from other department stores as well as e commerce retailers  The company also carries a high debt obligation  reporting long term debt over  5 1 billion last quarter and generating negative free cash flow of  3 24 million  Poor finances may be enough to overshadow the company s recent success when it reports fourth quarter earnings 
Disclosure  Note that the Estimize Select Consensus is a weighted consensus that weights more heavily for the most historically accurate analysts and most recent estimates  This consensus beats the IBES consensus 73  of the time and vs  our unweighted consensus which is more accurate 70  of the time ",2016-02-23,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-5-retailers-with-the-heaviest-downward-revisions-ahead-of-this-week’-200119146,200119146
143301,364816,JWN,TimeTo Bail On Sears ,opinion,"Time to Dump Sears Stock 
Over the past few years  Eddie Lampert  CEO of the embattled Sears Holdings Corp  O SHLD   has been making constant excuses for why this once highly respected icon of the American retail sector has been one of the worst retailers over the past decade  Could it be time to tune him out and give up on Sears stock 
While the SHLD stock price continues to ratchet lower  down from a staggering  177 00 per share in March 2007 to the current  17 00 level  Mr  Lampert continues to offer up reasons why the store has failed so far  But tell that to the shareholders who clearly have lost hope 
Mr  Lambert is blaming the department store s woes on the rise in minimum wage and how online retailers get treated with other tax rules 
While I m not here to question Mr  Lambert s logic  I do feel Sears has rapidly fallen behind the times at a moment when retail innovation and an adaptation to the current retail environment is a must

Consumers are looking for a great shopping experience if they are at the stores  Take a look at what companies like Macy s   N M  or Nordstrom  NYSE N JWN  have done in spending big money trying to deliver a better in store shopping experience 
Now while it may be unfair to compare Sears to the two higher end retailers  a simple comparison to equally troubled J C Penney  N JCP  shows a better retail strategy 
JCP stock is also struggling to find its way in the new retail climate  but there is progress albeit  it will take time for results to show 
Just think of the last time you have been to Sears 
I did walk through a Sears a few years ago  as I made my way from the parking lot to the mall  I didn t stop until I reached the mall hallway 
This is what Sears is dealing with  Consumers like myself  who are just passing through without glancing at the products on its racks and shelves 
In the full year ended January 30  2016  the losses continued to mount  as Sears lost another  580 million  or  5 44 per diluted share  on a revenue contraction of more than 10   The critical comparable store sales fell 6 9  at Sears 
Add in a massive debt and capital lease obligations of  2 2 billion  which is greater than the value of the company  and you have a dire situation that will likely worsen 
I would rather be in J C Penney if I was looking for an aggressive trade in the retail sector  Revenue for JCP stock are estimated to grow three percent for full year 2017  which is much better than the estimated 11 1  revenue decline at Sears for full year 2017

The thing is that retailers need to constantly adapt to the ever changing retail sector or they will lose ground  just like Sears and J C Penney 
Even Wal Mart Stores  N WMT  failed to adapt and see what has happened to this once indestructible retail behemoth  It s now struggling to catch up with an e commerce overhaul 
For those looking for contrarian retail stocks that are well off their highs  take a closer look at Macy s or Nordstrom  which have both easily outperformed SHLD stock since 2009  as shown on the chart below

143304,364819,JWN,Signs Of Trouble As Central Banks Desperate To Reverse Course,opinion,"The Bank for International Settlements is nothing if not obscure  As the central bankers  bank  it seems little more than a back door  private club for monetary elites to rub shoulders  And it s located in Switzerland which has always carried a reputation for financial secrecy 
Then it has this going for it   John Keynes of  Keynesian economic theory  opposed its dissolution back in the 1940s  His was the kind of thinking that has largely influenced central banks to hijack our economies with manipulative monetary policies  So you d probably think I hate these guys 
But you ve got to give credit where credit is due  The Bank for International Settlements is one of the few financial institutions that warned of dangers to the global financial system as early as 2003 
So by time the financial crisis struck  they d been warning about it for years  Its former chief economist  William White  even dared to challenge former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan about cheap money policies that helped start the crisis 
Once again  this group is on the right side of history 
It just warned about a  gathering storm  in the global economy as central banks seem to be   They ve seen right through this  recovery  and warned that unprecedented debt levels would put the world economy in worse shape than before the 2008 crash 
Because like with any addiction  there is a point where increased stimulus just doesn t work anymore 
Just this week  China reported a 25 4  year over year decline in exports  despite continued strong economic stimulus from the government  Now  they simply pledge more stimulus like every central bank in the world 
Then there s Japan  whose economy remains in a coma after the most aggressive QE of all developed nations  Four of the last seven quarters have been negative  including the fourth quarter of 2015 
Now  Japan has joined a group of European nations in   And what do they have to show for it  Japan s stocks went down after the announcement  and it s hurting bank margins and profits that are already suffering 
But the failure of global stimulus clearly isn t confined to these two countries 
Italy s non performing loans are rising and the country looks increasingly like the next Greece  Of course  Greece hasn t exactly recovered from its debt defaults  Nor has Cyprus  Kicking the can down the road  hoping for better economies despite crushing debt and refusing to restructure it  just doesn t work 
I predict Southern Europe is going to be in  by the end of this year  In Italy  they ll probably have to a resort to a Cyprus style  bail in  where large depositors have to bail out the banks  That won t be pretty 
Speaking of bad loans  it now looks like Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  could wind up like the next Lehman Brothers  Last year  they suffered a  7 billion loss from bad loans   worse than in the Great Recession  Make money free  and banks will make bad loans  And investors will increasingly speculate 
Worse than that  Deutsche Bank has derivatives exposure up to  54 5 trillion  that s not a typo   That s higher than JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  at  51 7 trillion  Overall  there are  550 trillion in highly leveraged derivatives globally 
That isn t good for the major global banks  Most of them are trading well below book value   meaning  they ve already been crushed 
And if you think the U S  economy and stock market will continue to be the last man standing in a sea of sinking ships  think twice  S P 500 earnings are down 18  from their September 2014 peak  and that makes real P E  price earnings  ratios over 23   which can t last 
I ve also discussed how the Global Luxury Index has dropped 26  since its peak in January of 2014  Luxury brands are dropping like a rock  from Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  to Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF   to Ferrari  NYSE RACE   That s because the affluent sector is finally beginning to slow in spending as my demographic indicators have predicted 
Then there s also clear speculation in the housing market  as the dumb money   which always piles in at the last minute   has taken up flipping real estate  180 000 houses were flipped in 2015  or 5 5  of sales  compared to 4 6  in 2014  That s a big jump  And it s a clear sign that housing is about to peak again 
This is just the tip of the iceberg  Signs of trouble are popping up all over as central banks are desperate to reverse the course 
The UK is threatening a  Brexit   Mass migration from Syria into Europe is still a problem without a solution  Despite a brief reprieve  oil will continue to crash  And developed countries all over the world are marching over a demographic cliff 
This is not the time to be complacent  Now is the time to hunker down and protect yourself from the worst financial devastation of your lifetime  And even the central banks  bankers see it ",2016-03-10,Harry Dent,https://www.investing.com/analysis/secret-monetary-group-warns-a-catastrophe-is-coming-200121035,200121035
143306,364821,JWN,Black Friday Experimentation,opinion,"The initial estimates for Black Friday spending are pretty grim  you can make that interpretation based only on the press releases themselves as neither of the words  strong  or  robust  appear in them  According to ShopperTrak  actual sales  mall sales  on Black Friday itself were up almost 15  from last year but only because there was a clear revulsion against shopping on Thanksgiving Day  By their estimates  shopping the day of the holiday totaled almost  3 2 billion in 2014  which was up sharply from just  880 million on Thanksgiving Day 2012  but plunged to just  1 8 billion this year 
By quick count of that math  overall spending combined for the two  Black  shopping days was down about seven tenths of a percent   but it will likely be a larger decline than that as ShopperTrak has changed its estimation methodology turning direct comparisons against prior released data to somewhat of a discontinuity 

The figures from the National Retail Federation are far  far worse  Their total for average spending per adult  which ranges far beyond the malls  for the entire weekend was down sharply  Reported to be  380 in 2014  the initial estimates for 2015 are less than  320  That is more than 21  below the  407 in average spending estimated for Black Friday weekend in 2013  Online shopping estimates have not yet been reported  but several ancillary indications point to largely the same trends as last year  which is not good  

That leaves most analysis open to a lot of subjectivity  for those that are predisposed toward the dominant recovery narrative  this is just confirmation that Black Friday is no longer the singular event it was once  Thus  what is clearly troublesome can be framed as  somehow   strong  even though the retail tradegroups themselves are clearly avoiding that coloration 
Sales at U S  brick and mortar stores on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday were down slightly from last year  but the performance was still seen as strong in a holiday shopping season where discounts spread well beyond the weekend and many shoppers moved to the web 
Cannibalizing discounts are the last indicator that would suggest a grand consumer resurgence  just in time  too   By any rational count  that shoppers are taking advantage of discounts earlier and earlier  at the expense of Black Friday surroundings  completes instead the picture of distress  That is actually the word being passed by the retail sector itself  as it struggles under these  robust  conditions 
This year  mall discounts on Black Friday were not as hefty  the store hours were shorter and the crowds were smaller than in previous years  Fewer stores were even open on Thanksgiving Day as retailers such as all TJX stores N TJX    Nordstrom  N JWN  and Sam s Club decided to stay closed so employees could be with their families  However  some opened earlier on Black Friday 
And although it might seem like those cash registers are ringing  retailers keep warning us about holiday earnings  We ve received more negative guidance since the beginning of November  Three weeks ago  we had 12 negative guidance vs  40 today 
On the revenue side  according to Thomson Reuters  there were nine negative guidance reports on November 11 and twenty one now  Given the inventory extremes that greeted the shopping season  it is becoming clear that retailers aren t looking at  changing consumer preferences  as a positive factor but instead lost hope to ignite some kind of driven consumer opportunity  I think  ultimately  that is what the reduction in Thanksgiving Day spending is telling us  that retailers in the past few years were experimenting  trying something to boost overallholiday spending but instead finding themselves only rearranging the deck chairs 
Undoubtedly the diminishing distinctiveness of Black Friday is occurring  as holiday shopping moves elsewhere in the calendar  But that doesn t suggest the consumer rebirth  but rather the ongoing difficulties that aren t supposed to occur where incomes  jobs and Yellen s rhetoric are all rising if not soaring  Businesses  retail in particular  have followed those sentiments in holding product as inventory  but are in danger of being yet again disappointed by something greater than consumer fickleness 

It is at least curious that Black Friday behavior started this shifting trend mostly with last year s awful holiday sales environment  Further  this downward  drift  has been accomplished still without the worst elements of actual recessionary tendencies  job growth has certainly slowed but it  like production levels  has not given over to the outright and outsized reductions that typically accompany such straining imbalances  including those financial   If retailers were hoping that consumers would spend both before and during Black Friday weekend  they are once again left far short of the rhetorical recovery  Unlike last year  however   transitory  has now been fully tested ",2015-12-01,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/black-friday-experimentation-272999,272999

Back on the asphalt  results apparently were underwhelming  Here is some of what ShopperTrack had to say in its  

   preliminary sales estimate for brick and mortar retail on Thanksgiving Day  11 26 15  and Black Friday  11 27 15   The two dates accumulated a projected  12 1 billion in combined sales  which is an estimated decrease versus 2014 
The two dates also saw thinner crowds as the preliminary numbers indicate a decrease in shopper visits on both Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday when compared to last year 
Following initial numbers  ShopperTrak maintains its estimated 2 4 percent increase in sales for brick and mortar retail during the 2015 holiday season  

The disappointment could be seen in the 2 2  decrease in the SPDR S P Retail  N XRT   Trading volume surged as XRT broke down below its downtrending 50 day moving average  DMA  

Unlike the general market  like the S P 500  N SPY   XRT has yet to recover from the selling of the  August Angst 
This quick trigger reaction is of course no guarantee of future selling  However  this further confirmation of resistance at the 50DMA at such a time provides a strong case for going short  I started with put options expiring in January  The trade ends if XRT manages to close above its last high at  46  I am targeting fresh lows on XRT 
The drop in retailers created definitive bearish patterns across a spectrum of retailers  Nordstrom  N JWN  is one of the most compelling bearish charts  JWN gapped down hard from earnings in mid November  Buyers took the reins immediately and sent the stock well into its gap down  The rally notably stalled the day before and after Thanksgiving  Monday s 2 3  drop on high volume signals the return of the sellers 

Nordstrom s  JWN  impressive post earnings relief rally comes to a screeching halt in post holiday trading

Europe lower and Asia mixed to close out an upbeat week
European equities traded lower  with markets in Asia mixed and pressure on financials returning  trimming a solid weekly advance of about 4 5  for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index  Mixed earnings were in focus  while oil and gas issues were bogged down by the weakness in crude oil prices  The euro ticked higher late in the session versus the U S  dollar and bond yields in the region were mixed  In economic news  U K  January retail sales rose much more than forecasted 
Stocks in Asia finished mixed after the U S  markets snapped a three session rally yesterday  with declines in oil prices weighing on the energy sector  However  most major markets in the region finished nicely higher for the week  led by the best weekly advance in Japan in six years and the largest weekly gain in China in two months  per Bloomberg  For more on the recent wild swings in the markets  see the Schwab Center for Financial Research s article   Japanese equities fell as the yen gained ground  while stocks trading in mainland China Hong Kong ticked slightly lower  Relative stability in the global markets  noticeably in the oil and commodity markets  helped boost stocks  along with signs that the Chinese government was increasing support for its slowing economy  Australian securities traded lower  with oil and gas and basic materials issues showing some weakness  while South Korean listings ticked higher to add to their weekly advance  Finally  Indian equities gained ground with automakers and financials helping extend its largest weekly gain in four months

143313,364828,JWN,Retail Stocks Take A Pounding,opinion,"Retail stocks have recently taken a pounding  Nordstrom  N JWN  fell 15  on Friday following weak earnings  Macy s  N M  fell 14  a couple of days earlier following their earnings  All of a sudden retail is a tough business  Consumers aren t buying quite as readily as they were  We re not invested in the retail sector  so as I watched these stocks collapse I must confess to experiencing the kind of grim satisfaction that one feels when others experience a discomfort with which we re already uncomfortably familiar  A friend reminded me it s Schadenfreude  It s not just energy infrastructure names that can cause sharp  sudden financial pain to their investors  Yeah   Finally  it s somebody else s turn for a price shock  Readers who are invested in retail stocks will hopefully forgive this temporary insensitivity to their plight 
Although the S P 500 is flat for the year  there s evidence to show that individual  retail investors have had a substantially worse time of it  Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs  are predominantly held by individuals whereas U S  public equities are largely held by institutions  The 29  drop in the Alerian Index this year is substantially worse than the S P500 and has been disproportionately endured by individuals 
Closed end funds is another area where individual investors dominate  because there s insufficient liquidity to attract many institutions  The sector appeals because of the yields but also because of the opportunity to invest in funds at a discount to their net asset value  Many large funds are trading at double digit percent discounts  reflecting the diminished appetite of new money to invest and close the gap  CEF Connect lists Pimco Dynamic Credit Income  N PCI   DoubleLine Income Solutions  N DSL  and Cohen and Steers Infrastructure  N UTF   all fairly sizeable funds with a market cap of  1 6 2 6BN  with discounts of 13 17   MLP funds in this sector usually trade at a premium  since investors value the 1099 for tax reporting  since direct holdings of MLPs generate K 1s  but even these funds are at a discount to NAV  Kayne Anderson  N KYN   one of the largest such MLP funds at  2 2BN in market cap  is down 43  this year  Because they use leverage  like many of their peers  they will have undergone forced selling of positions in order to remain within their borrowing limits  causing a permanent loss of capital and illustrating some of the non economic selling in the sector  KYN has a 10 year annual return of 5 25   versus 9 4  for the Alerian Index  Leveraged exposure isn t that smart 
Activist hedge fund managers are some of the smartest guys around  It s interesting to watch their moves and copying them can be compelling  They re often on TV and the stocks they own garner outsized media attention  You don t have to try that hard either  For those unwilling to hunt through SEC filings  there is a convenient mutual fund called the 13D Activist  DDDIX  which invests in stocks targeted by activists  It s down 9 1 for the year  It owns Valeant  N VRX   which has ruined the year for a few Masters of the Universe as well as retail investors 
So it seems as if individual investors are having a pretty tough year that is not reflected simply by looking at the S P 500  Asset classes that are most favored by individuals have had a tough year  and as we head towards the Holidays  it s a time for dumping what s not working  Tax loss selling or simply cutting loose investments that have not worked is depressing certain security prices by a surprising amount  It s likely causing some of the liquidation we re seeing that often appears to be borne out of resignation rather than an assessment of new information 
My retired bond trader friend was well known for making money from bearish bets on bonds by selling first and buying later  although he always maintained that he was comfortable making money in either direction  He did this more regularly than most and enjoyed substantial professional success  However  while enduring a particularly tough period of shorting the market only to be forced to cover at a loss  he was lamenting to his wife how difficult it was to make money  Her breezy advice was to do what she did when she was fed up  go out and buy something  Of course  buy first and then sell was the answer

 Winston Churchill
As the thanksgiving holiday quickly approaches  the yearly event known as black Friday remains prominent in the minds of most retail executives  After looking at the market moving events this week  it appears the annual rites of passage will take on even greater importance  You see  two of the largest and most highly regarded retailers in our lovely land  Macy s  N M  and Nordstrom  N JWN   took it on the chin this week after their earnings reports disappointed investors  No lack of company in this department as it seems nearly every management team in corporate America is in the doghouse of Wall Street  Tough group of people to please  no doubt about it  If your business is not showing 30  growth and 90  margins  not interested  sell the stock  Bit of a high standard  you might think  Now  in fairness to the fair fellows on the street  there are legitimate reasons to be concerned about the existing state of businesses across the corporate landscape  Retail is especially challenged because of soft demand  apparently due to the warmer weather  It appears Al Gore s idea s about global warming is having an affect after all 
Obviously  anything in the commodity area has more than it s fair share of challenges  The next few months for the oil complex figure to be difficult as banks are looking at balance sheets and reserves to recalibrate whatever financing arrangements are in place  It is not unreasonable to expect bankruptcies and consolidation in the patch  especially among highly levered and smaller entities  When you consider the price performance in all parts of the commodity space  steel  iron ore  copper  grains  etc  it looks like we may see some activity in these industries as well  Not my cup of tea  but you have to think aggressive companies are going to be opportunistic over the next year  Their agents  the investment banks and private equity entities  are probably licking their chops in anticipation 
The collapse in retail and commodities have to give pause to the Federal Reserve Board as deflation is the major worry  as it has been for quite some time  Yes  wages are improving  and the official unemployment rate keeps ticking down  Still  it looked like lift off was a layup in December  Now  however  the layup has turned into a tough twenty footer  and it may get even tougher this week after more reports  Stay tuned 
On the positive side of the ledger  one retailer which surprised was Kohl s  N KSS   reporting  63 cents of earnings and raising their dividend  Still  the top line was nothing to fawn over  and you had pretty much the same thing with J C  Penney  N JCP   Of course  the stock got crushed as well  Here in Las Vegas  a casino right down the street  the SLS decided to sell one of it s towers as losing  84 million in six months apparently is not going to work  SLS might stand for so long  sucker  but if you don t attract enough of them  it may be the casino which is the sucker  Also in Las Vegas  Carl Icahn is selling his stake in the long defunct Fountainbleau  He bought it for  650 million and the property will probably need a billion of capital  but captain Carl will find a sucker to help turn his investment into money good 
In the venture capital world  Fidelity wrote down the value of its Snapchat investment by 25   along with other positions like Dropbox  Zenefits  and the well known Blue Bottle Coffee  The Snapchat position was only 10 million of capital  so don t worry about the boys in Boston as they have over a trillion of assets under management  Just want to be prudent with their marks  I m sure  as they wouldn t want to be thought of as aggressive  no way  no how 
In the political world  Donald Trump s rant this week showed a new strategy of insulting the people who you want to vote for you  Interesting approach  Based on current polls  it might be working  though at some point  usually those who might not appreciate the insult may decide another candidate would be worthy of their interest  You would think  right 
Finally  the events in France are difficult for any rational person to fathom  Like my fellow readers  my sympathies go out to the families who suffered the loss of a loved one  The attack will have implications all over the globe  especially in countries in Western Europe who may face similar circumstances as those in France  Here in the United States  maybe people will start to realize security for the citizenry is the first priority our country should think about  The world is faced with the same issue for a long time  Until our leaders listen to Churchill  the problem is not going to improve any time soon  Thanks for reading the blog this week

143315,364830,JWN,Is This Earnings Purgatory ,opinion,"For a while now  it has been the subject of some debate around the office whether the dearth of earnings and sales growth that we saw in the second quarter and are seeing in the third quarter is the beginning of the end  In other words  are the decline in earnings and revenues a forewarning of recession  Or  is it an earnings purification process as corporate America works through the effects of the decline in energy prices  slower growth abroad and the rise of the U S  dollar 
As earnings season draws to a close  it appears that this will be the first time since the second and third quarter of 2009 that the S P 500 index will have two consecutive quarters of year over year earnings contraction  It will also be the third quarter of revenue decreases according to FactSet s data compilation  There are many extenuating explanations offered again this earnings season  warmer weather than usual affecting late summer and fall retail sales  a strong dollar restricting demand from abroad  the collapse of energy prices and  you name it 
The U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics says that characteristics of a recession are  a general slowdown in economic activity  a downturn in the business cycle  a reduction in the amount of goods and services produced and sold    sounding rather familiar  In the end  this begs the question  are we proceeding through a difficult but temporary period as companies adjust to an environment of a strong U S  dollar and an energy free fall  Or is this the beginning of a recessionary downturn  Will we actually see the improvement in corporate growth  which has now been pushed out to 2016  If we are just in the midst of growing pains  then excluding unforeseen circumstances  it would make sense that as the anniversary of the shock from the collapse of energy prices passes  year over year comparisons become easier and we see a positive trajectory again 
Day to day  we have seen that as economic data and corporate announcements come in  investors vacillate from optimism to pessimism resulting in quite a bit of volatility  There is the Federal Reserve trying to right the ship  U S  economy  through monetary policy when that ship should have most likely sailed off a long time  years   ago  Whether they raise rates or not in December is a subject of excruciating concern every time one of the Fed members makes a comment in the media or a positive employment number is released  The latest Wall Street Journal survey of economists published on November 12th found that about 92  of economists surveyed now  see a December lift off  in the Fed Funds rate  The U S  political landscape with its election posturing  bi partisan tug of wars  anti business regulations and anti competitive corporate tax policies  could move forward  initiating more corporate friendly policies  Differentiating between protectionist policies versus regulatory and tax changes designed to improve our global competitiveness could be a step in the right direction 
Rather intertwined are the economic weaknesses abroad and global currency policies  Developed countries continue to strain for growth through expansionary policies that ultimately weaken their currencies versus the U S  and dampen the attractiveness of our exports  Emerging market economies are struggling from commodity dependence  currency declines and political ideology  Brazil  Argentina and Russia to name a few  are in recession and China is looking at significantly slower growth following a period of super growth  According to FactSet  the combined companies in the S P 500 generate approximately 12  of sales from Europe and about 10  from the Asia Pacific region  predominately China and Japan  By dividing the index into two groups  those that generate more than 50  of their sales abroad and those that generate less than 50  of their sales abroad  FactSet discovered a wide divergence in earnings and revenue results  The corporations with less international exposure had positive earnings growth of  4 8  versus a  10 6  decline for firms with greater exposure  For the index as a whole  the earnings decline was  2 2   The same results held true for revenues  The S P 500 companies  revenue growth for the third quarter is estimated to have declined 3 7   while those companies with greater than 50  of sales in the U S  had a 1  increase and the group with more than half of their sales from abroad had a  12 5  sales contraction 
So  is this Purgatory  Well  it is rather murky lately  Corporate capital expenditures are not what you would expect to see in an expansion  Businesses that forecast higher demand would most likely be more confident about investing in plant and equipment  Although unemployment has now fallen to 5   the consumer  which makes up about 70  of GDP still appears hesitant  Is it a demographic change or technology based change that has altered consumer buying habits  A switch from the malls  Macy s Inc  N M   Nordstrom  N JWN   to the on line retailers  Amazon  O AMZN    A greater amount of discretionary income funneled to restaurants  travel and home improvement  Or is there less disposable income available due to higher shelter expenses for renters and higher health care costs for most of us   versus the offset of lower gas prices 
As these issues evolve  at Alhambra  we are constantly re assessing the portfolio positioning and characteristics of client portfolios  We are comfortable with the more conservative asset allocation strategies that we initiated starting around a year ago  Recently  the anticipation of a rate hike has had a negative effect on most financial instruments and as always  we remind investors to keep their eyes on their long term investment goals and objectives ",2015-11-16,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-this-earnings-purgatory-271461,271461
143316,364831,JWN,Retail Reality  Another Sign A Recession And Crash Are Imminent,opinion,"Before the Paris attacks    the markets were already reeling from weaker than expected retail sales 
Profits were a big miss for upscale retailer Nordstrom  N JWN  and department store giant Macy s  N M   Nordstrom s stock fell 22  at its worst on that news  And Macy s   that sucker s down almost 50  from its July peak 
But Nordstrom is not Macy s  as anyone who shops there will undoubtedly let you know  It s ritzy  swanky  and serves a higher clientele   the affluent who ve up to this point been holding up the economy  They re the ones who peak in spending later   much later than the average person  They re the ones who have benefited most from quantitative easing  which has caused an even bigger bubble in the financial assets  which they largely own 
Now  their time has come  I ve been forecasting this affluent sector would decline starting by 2016  and Nordstrom s seems to be proving that 
But the real story comes from looking at growth rates in retail sales over the long term 
Retail sales excluding automobiles have been slowing since 2012  In 2015  they ve been approaching zero percent growth  Bad news 
They re now lower than in the worst of the 2001 recession  and much lower than when the Great Recession began in January 2008 
More bad news 
This sort of indicator is important because it tells you how the economy is doing right now 
Economists revel over lagging indicators like jobs growth that tell the story after the fact  because they re idiots   Ideally we d focus on leading indicators  but most of those don t work in an artificial QE  and ZIRP driven economy 
But retail sales correlate directly with consumer spending and therefore the economy  That makes them the ultimate consumer focused coincident indicator that you should focus on near a top 
And as you can see   they stink 

The trends are very consistent with what we ve been forecasting   a slowing economy in the second half of the year   and reveal why  amidst rising geopolitical challenges  the Fed may still keep interest rates at zero in December  despite the  strong  October jobs report compelling them to do otherwise 
To understand this  there s two numbers you need to remember  46  and 54 
46 is the age when people on average reach peak spending  after which it plateaus for a few years  We conducted a 10 year analysis many years ago that reached this conclusion 
54 is the year that plateau ends  It s also the year when the affluent   a smaller  more impactful subset of the overall group   reach their peak  and they re doing so today 
So it s no coincidence that we saw a recession after late 2007 when the average baby boomer turned 46 
Now  eight years later  they re turning 54  when they come off that plateau and the affluent peak in spending  This is also when    one of the few remaining bright spots in our economy   finally declines sharply 
But it s the affluent sector that I m most concerned about because they control so much of the spending   50  
This was not the case in generation cycles before  But that changed heading into the bubbly late 1990s when they racketed up so much of the wealth  and wealth and income inequality became as severe as in the late 1920s bubble boom 
In 1989  spending by age in five year cohorts  the best we had back then  saw the biggest dropoff come between age 50 to 54  Now  it comes between age 55 to 59 
And that s the age they reach as we step into 2016  when the real demographic cliff hits 

Nobody will see this next recession coming  as they won t see similar fallouts in Germany and much of Europe going into 2016 as well 
But you will  This year the stage has been set for a much worse collapse than we saw in 2008 ",2015-11-19,Harry Dent,https://www.investing.com/analysis/retail-reality:-another-sign-a-recession-and-crash-are-imminent-271833,271833
143322,364837,JWN,Looking For Department Store Deals  M  KSS  JWN  JCP,opinion,"Over the next three weeks we will get a read on the health of the US consumer  as a slew of retailers begin to report  This week the focus will be on the department stores  with Macy s  Kohl s  Nordstrom  N JWN  and J C  Penney scheduled to report and provide their outlook for the holiday shopping season 
The retail sector is full of haves and have nots this quarter  Despite saving more due to lower gas prices  wages haven t improved much  causing consumers to carefully consider how they allocate their discretionary income  The National Retail Federation has already warned us not to expect a great holiday season  retailers will have to offer deep discounts in order to compete  Add to that unseasonably warm weather in the Northeast and Midwest  leading to a build up of fall and winter inventory at many of the apparel names  The departments stores in particular have been losing out to specialty retailers for the past couple of years  Here s what expectations look like for the third quarter 
Macy s Inc  N M 
Consumer Discretionary   Multiline Retail   Reports November 11  before the open 
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 53  two cents higher than the Wall Street estimate  Revenues of  6 162B are just slightly above the Street s expectation for  6 155B 

What to watch  This year has not been kind to Macy s which has reported two negative quarters of profits and revenues  The company blamed those losses on the West Coast port strikes  lower spending by international tourists due to the strong dollar  and weakness in key segments such as jewelry  Heading into the holiday season the company is focusing on many growth initiatives to boost performance  The department store has been refining their M O M strategy  which stands for My Macy s localization  catering to different types of customers based on location   Omnichannel integration  helping customers shop seamlessly on line and in stores  and  Magic selling   improved customer service initiative   The company is rapidly expanding it s beauty business through its acquisition of Bluemercury earlier in the year  and is also considering opening  off price  locations like those of competitors Saks and Nordstrom  Several partnerships are also in the works  including one with Best Buy to make consumer electronics available in stores  and a collaboration with online fashion tech startup  Nineteenth Amendment 

Kohl s Corporation  N KSS 
Consumer Discretionary   Multiline Retail   Reports November 12  before the open 
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 76  a nickel higher than the Wall Street estimate  Revenues of  4 464B are above the Street s expectation for  4 445B 

What to watch  Kohl s numbers came in light last quarter  with EPS missing by 10 cents and profits falling 5  YoY  estimates indicate growth will improve to 10  in Q3  Even more disappointing were the company s same store sales figures  coming in at a measly 0 1   after the company reported it was expecting to post 2   3  for the year  The blame was put on the shift of sales in tax free states from July into August  This quarter should benefit from a strong back to school shopping season  with Kohl s already announcing in August that their inventory receipts were  well positioned for the back to school and fall seasons   A series of new endeavors should also help  such as a revamping of their loyalty program  members are spending  80 more per year at Kohl s than other shoppers   a personalized marketing campaign  and investments in omnichannel shopping ahead of the holiday season making it  easier than ever  to shop their website  Success has also been found in teen and women s apparel collaborations with designer Lauren Conrad and brand Madden Girl  Like Macy s  Kohl s is also investing heavily in beauty  launching full fledged beauty departments with top brands  and capitalizing on strength in that space  The department store will have to at least meet expectations for Q3 to avoid any further selling off of its stock  which is already down 24  this year 
Nordstrom Inc  N JWN

The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 74  two cents higher than Wall Street  Revenues of  3 394B are slightly above the Street s expectation for  3 388B 

What to watch  Muted expectations for Nordstrom only put YoY profit growth at 1 4   a return to positive growth after 3 down quarters  In a surprising juxtaposition  revenue growth has actually been relatively strong  coming in at 13  and 12  for the first two quarters of the year  Of the department stores  Nordstrom is considered higher end  a hard spot to sit as the US consumer becomes more value focused and less willing to spend on apparel  However  same store sales have remained strong  coming in at 4 4  and 4 9  in Q1 and Q2  outpacing many of its competitors  A large part of the company s success during the first half of the year can be attributed to Nordstrom Rack  Nordstrom s discount store  That segment saw sales grow 13  in Q2  the 26th consecutive quarter of double digit growth  Other initiatives such as the launch of Nordstromrack com  entry into Canada and the acquisition of Trunk Club drove a third of total sales growth in the latest quarter and are expected to do so again in the third quarter 

JC Penney Company  N JCP 
Consumer Discretionary   Multiline Retail   Reports November 13  before the open 
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of   0 55  better than the Street s expectation for   0 59  Surprisingly  however  the Estimize community is more bearish on sales  Revenues of  2 850B are below Wall Street s estimate for  2 869B  which would still be an increase on 3  YoY 

What to watch  Years later and J C  Penney is still digging out from mistakes made by former CEO Ron Johnson  who replaced discounts and coupons with everyday low prices to the chagrin of loyal customers who have yet to fully return  While profit growth has been improving  in the high double digits for the past 7 quarters  revenues have been very light  only in the low single digits  Same store sales has been a positive metric for the retailer  up 4 1  in Q2 and expected to be in the mid single digits for Q3  The company has already commented on what they believe was a very strong back to school season  but will likely suffer from unseasonably warm weather  Like its competitors  JCP is investing in beauty by expanding the Sephora beauty shops within its stores and upgrading its beauty salons  The retailer recently announced its plan to cut 9  of the workforce at its headquarters in Plano  Texas  That decision came weeks after the company announced it would be reducing its pension obligation by 25  to 35    5B   a change that could affect up to 43 000 retirees and their beneficiaries ",2015-11-08,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-for-department-store-deals---macy’s,-nordstrom,-kohl’s-and-j.c.-270577",270577
143323,364838,JWN,Major Retailer Reports Ahead  Keep An Eye On Wal Mart,opinion,"With roughly 441 of the S P 500 companies having reported their Q3  15 earnings   Factset says 444 S P 500 companies have reported   there isn t much new about the Q3  15 results that you couldn t have read already on this site for the last 8 weeks 
Given  from last week  as well as last weekend s post  it is doubtful that Q3  15 S P 500 earnings will change much 
Three retailers report this week  Macy s  N M   Kohl s  N KSS  and Nordstrom s  N JWN   and the expectation is that none of these stocks  absent a REIT transformation or some significant M A activity  will move the earnings needle much 
If readers truly want to see the damage caused to mass market general merchandise retail  check the charts of Macy s  Nordstroms  and Kohl s  Wow   Macy s and Kohl s are now trading under their 200 week moving averages  with Macy s struggling to hang on  Nordstrom is the only one of the three to be trading above its 200 week moving average  2015 has been a VERY tough year for these three stocks 
This is strictly an opinion  but these types of retailers  as formidable as the brands are  along with names like JC Penney  N JCP  are flush in the cross hairs of the death match occurring between Amazon  O AMZN  and Wal Mart  N WMT    Long AMZN and WMT 
Looking at these three charts  you begin to understand how brutally competitive retail really is  in terms of brand building and differentiation 
How Important is Wal Mart to Retail Sales  Inflation and Wage Growth  
Wal Mart doesn t report their fiscal Q3  15 until November 17th  2015  but I couldn t help wonder if the October  average hourly earnings  increase contained within the October  15 jobs report was a function of WMT s increase in wages for their rank and file employees 
Most investors don t realize that Wal Mart is the single largest private employer in the US  You would think if WMT hiked wages  it would begin to show up in the  wage growth  data in the job s reports and in the various economic reports published by the St  Louis Fed   FRED database   September s  average hourly earnings  were  0 0   versus the  0 2  expected  but October s was  0 4  versus the  0 2  expected  thus over the two month period  expectations were inline 
However  given the importance of Wal Mart to the US economy and the US employment picture  my question remains   Will Wal Mart wage hikes stir the wage inflation debate   In the early 1990s  Joe Nocera  the famed New York Times business writer  who penned the column 1 article for the Saturday edition of the New York Times business section noted that it was probably due to Wal Mart that consumer inflation  as measured by the CPI  remained so well contained  given the success of their business model and  EDLP   Every Day Low Price  mantra  and the fact that at that point in time  given their revenue and revenue growth  WMT likely accounted for mid single digit percentage growth of total US retail sales 
Today  that mantle is owned by Amazon  thanks to what may be the more formidable business model of the 21st century  In a  15 trillion US economy  of which 2 3rd s or roughly  10 trillion is consumption  the death match between the largest bricks and mortar retailers and the largest e commerce retailer could keep a lid on inflation for   well   a very long time  Think about it  is there any consumer product that can t be sold online   other than maybe an automobile  I ve often wondered why US automakers haven t started cutting out the dealer middlemen and tried marketing cars directly online  It does seem implausible  but so did e commerce 20 years ago 
If you are curious as to how much damage has been done to Wal Mart s stock   57 is the 200 month moving average  and the stock is trading just above that key level 
Many of the mainstream financial pundits have compared Amazon s market cap of  300 billion to Wal Mart s  188 billion and compared the death match between the two retailers  However  Wal Mart s expected fiscal 2016 revenue is  488 billion  ends January  16  while Amazon s expected 2015 annual revenue is  107 billion 
Don t count Wal Mart out just yet 
Analysis conclusion  A whole bunch of retailers will report in November and December  15 as is always the case in the last 2 months of each quarter  and this is a sector that is truly under siege  even with the drop in gas prices  Personally  it is my opinion that the whole sector would benefit from an extended period of mild  inflation  which would benefit retailers top line and operating margins  but the primary reason this isn t happening is that Amazon is keeping tremendous pressure on pricing 
Cisco Systems  O CSCO  also reports this coming week  and it continues to be one of the 1990s growth giants that has lagged badly off the  09 low  Cisco is facing the same dynamic as the rest of the former NASDAQ 100 leaders from the late 1990s  the core switching and routing businesses are secular low to mid single digit growers  while Cisco tries to transform the rest of the business into faster growth   Long a very small CSCO position in one long term account

143324,364839,JWN,Earnings Watch  Troubled Retailer Looks Up,opinion,"JC Penney Company  N JCP  is next in line in the retail industry to report earnings results before the market opens Friday  Competitor Macy s  N M  has boasted positive sales growth in the past few quarters and analysts are expecting the trend to continue  While the retail industry is hurting  and Macy s earnings were everything short of good  JCP couldn t be happier as its outlook has a bright spot because of a larger than expected increase in same store sales  The retailer is not what it used to be just several years ago and has been surpassing analyst expectations in 6 of the last 8 quarters  but this earnings report will plainly define the future of the company  This coming holiday season is ever important  as Estimize analysts are expecting to see a loss of 55 cents per share and revenue of  2 863 billion while Wall Street analysts are less optimistic  estimating a loss of 60 cents per share and revenue of  2 864 billion
On Wednesday  J C  Penney announced growth in same store sales of 6 4  for the third quarter  to the surprise of investors and analysts alike  Under CEO Terry Lundgren the company has been slowly digging itself out of the failures of former CEO Ron Johnson  Through a reintroduction of item promotions  the gentrification of brands carried  a partnership with Sephora  an advanced online shopping site that employs a  pickup in store  feature and a serious focus on technology  all while still closing locations  it can be said that JCP might be on the right path and is positioning itself as a serious threat to Macy s  The Plano  Texas based retailer has been experiencing increased same store sales figures over the past few quarters  but what remains to be seen is whether or not these growth expectations can be topped consistently
Furthermore  there is a plan to lay off 300 executives from headquarters  In theory  a move like this would save costs and boost profits and earnings  but investors did not react positively as shares dipped 15  last month  It appears as though the market reacted negatively because of operational concerns and insecurity regarding the long and short term plans for the firm

I have been writing this week about the deteriorating underlying technicals of the stock market  Thursday s 1 4  drop in the S P 500  N SPY  caused a breakdown of 200 day moving average  DMA  support and confirmed all the red flags  Accordingly  I have changed the short term trading call from  slightly bearish  to bearish 


200DMA support gives way for the S P 500

Note that I am still not aggressively bearish because the 50DMA is now turning upward and SHOULD provide strong support absent a definitive negative catalyst  The next assessment will likely depend on how well the S P 500 trades around its 50DMA 

Accompanying the breakdown was a plunge in T2108   trading above their respective 40DMAs plunged from 52 6  to 43 5   This drop completes and confirms the end of a month long range for T2108 


T2108 breaks down after a month long tease churning just below the overbought threshold

The volatility index  the VIX  joined the bum rush by breaking out to a 5 week high  I did NOT use this occasion to fade volatility as I often do  Besides  there is no imminent meeting of the Federal Reserve to help grease the skids for volatility  That will be a trade for mid December 


The volatility index  the VIX  is breaking out above the 15 35 pivot and looks ready for another quick run up

The number one confirmation of a bearish turn of events comes from Caterpillar  N CAT   my favorite hedge against bullishness  CAT lost 4 5  on its way through a gap down and very bearish 50DMA breakdown  Note what happened after the last 50DMA breakdown in June 


Caterpillar  CAT  breaks down again  Another down day puts recent lows into play 

Given my change in trading call  I finally sold my call spread on LinkedIn Corporation  N LNKD   It is part of a small group of tech related stocks that have diverged from the market to form a very thin spear of leaders trying to cajole the market higher 


A VERY choppy year for LinkedIn  LNKD   I still like buying its dips 

Retail is another sector that has suddenly started to suffer  Once again  we should all take pause to note how the discount on oil is NOT providing a notable boost in the prospects for many retail companies  Wal Mart  N WMT  made a big splash this earnings season with a massive post earnings loss  Surprisingly  value investors have yet to commit and the stock is down another 5  since earnings  At that time  WMT helped the SPDR S P Retail ETF  XRT  fail at 50DMA resistance  XRT attempted a meager rally soon thereafter but is now trading at a near 6 week low  It even looks ready for an extended run of losses 


SPDR S P Retail ETF  XRT  never participated much in the S P 500 s big bounce from oversold conditions  Overall  it still looks very weak 

I noticed in after hours trading Nordstrom  N JWN  fell 20  after reporting earnings  See below for a chart of what happened to Macy s Inc  N M  after it reported earnings this week  The CEO was on air blaming unseasonably warm weather in the Northeast for a shortfall in winter shopping  The irony in these excuses is that we are quick to celebrate the benefits of lower oil prices  so why not celebrate the  dividend  consumers get for not having to spend as much money on fall winter gear  Of course  part of the reason is that we EXPECT want consumers to spend the oil savings on retail goods 


Macy s  M  has had a very rough second half

Outside of tech  there are of course still some sectors doing well or at least hanging in there on the year  For example  consumer discretionary as a whole is actually doing well where retail specifically is not 


This weekly chart shows that Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR  N XLY  managed to record new all time highs during the bounce from oversold conditions  This is very strong performance relative to the S P 500 

Finally  homebuilders  in the form of the iShares US Home Construction  N ITB   has kept to a tight trading range nearly all year  This week  ITB was helped by a very strong report from DR Horton Inc   N DHI   Those gains are now on sharp retreat  I am still bullish on ITB and many of its components  but I am more cautious than ever right now  I will continue to buy dips and sell some rallies 


The iShares US Home Construction  ITB  is still stuck in a trading range that has lasted through most of 2015

 In the U S  which is our largest market  we actually see slight uptick in consumption generally from a consumption standpoint  things to us in our categories look reasonably good in the U S  and on a slight uptick       Consumer Packaged Goods 
 the short answer is this spring we re sort of seeing an uptick in all of our business  So all parts of the country  so while we have seen stronger business in some of the areas where we don t have a physical presence  we ve also seen uplift in the areas where we do have a physical presence     Apparel

The gold standard of brand advertisers has spoken  digital advertising delivers higher ROI than TV or print
 There continues to be significant savings opportunity in marketing  particularly in non media spending  By following the consumer  we re proving marketing spending effectiveness and efficiencies to deliver more  longer reach  higher frequency  greater resonance with less  We re shifting more advertising to digital media  search  social  video and mobile as consumers spend more time there  In general  digital media delivers the higher return on investments in TV or print      Consumer Packaged Goods 
Advertising agencies could be a major loser in the shift to digital marketing
 One non media cost area that offers significant opportunities is agency spending  which includes fees and production costs for agencies we use for advertising  media  public relations  package design and development of in store materials  We plan to significantly simplify and reduce the number of agency relationships and the cost associated with the current complexity and inefficiency  while upgrading agency capability to improve creative quality and communication effectiveness      Consumer Packaged Goods 
E commerce has an advantage in inventory management
 we were able to accelerate or able to flow  I should say  inventory to the e commerce business faster than we could the stores  There s an additional step in the supply chain for getting the inventory from our distribution centers to our stores  which takes a little bit of time that in e commerce you don t have that step  So  we re able to have a better inventory position in e commerce which I think drove the upside      Yoga Pants

More people claimed they had health insurance than H R Block expected  but that may be because the IRS did not force them to verify it this year
 what we found this past tax season is that more of our clients actually filed indicating non marketplace coverage for them and their household members  We think this is related to the fact that the IRS had really limited mechanisms in place really to enforce compliance  and a lot of people used the checkbox process as a way of avoiding ACA related penalties     Tax Preparation 
It will be a few years before the full impact of ACA is felt
 it will be several years before the full impact of the ACA is felt  In fact  there are several important changes coming in just the next year penalties for not obtaining healthcare will essentially double to  325 per adult or 2  of household income  whichever is greater  And finally  new documentation requirements will impact those taxpayers claiming to have employer provided or private insurance      Tax Preparation

 HIV is a chronic disease  Once you go on medications  you are on medications for life  so if you are diagnosed with HIV in your 20s or 30s  you may be taking our medications or other medications for up to four to five decades for the full period of your life      Biotech

The spring redetermination process to assess the collateral of Energy loans has been relatively painless
 The spring redetermination process is getting to the end  And so far  from our perspective  it s gone relatively well  Having said that and we expected over time  when we redetermined borrowing basis in the fall for it to go well too     Bank 
That said  variables could change between now and the end of the year that could lead to more non performing loans
 Having said all that  I would caution anybody who is looking at the industry to be careful about taking the results of this spring redetermination and then applying it to future redeterminations  because you have got to remember that there was a tremendous amount of hydrocarbons that were created in 2014  It was probably the most active year for the industry  Many of that those hydrocarbons moved into approved producing category  which is what you lend against  To the extent that our investment in the industry declines a little bit  it s likely that the rate of that growth will decline  So that s one important thing to remember  And then also  it s a function of price  Now when you calculate your borrowing basis  you are not using the market price  I think most in the industry used a significant discount to the market price  For example  we saw last fall  Having said that  as time goes by  there is always an assumption that the underlying market prices are going to increase and if oil prices stay where they are today  you are going to then be comparing lower prices to potentially higher prices in prior borrowing basis      Bank 
Miscellaneous Nuggets of Wisdom 
There are advantages to being a second mover too
 We are behind in our omnichannel strategy  but we don t look at that as a disadvantage because I think the second mover advantage is so powerfully strong  Having worked for Home Depot  NYSE HD  where we literally started from scratch in developing an omnichannel and I d argue now that Home Depot has one of the best omnichannel experiences of any brick and mortar retailer I learned a lot of lessons on the things that worked and did not work in a retail environment      Retail 
Irreplaceable assets really only come up for sale once every few years
 there are truly hundreds and hundreds of ski resorts  thousands around the world We re very focused on what I d call a handful that we think are the best  And our goal is to wait for even if it takes years truly to wait for that  because in the ski industry the good news is you can t build any other resorts we re big believers in not rushing      Ski Resorts 
Brands are platforms for innovation
 our experiences have been that those large brands are platforms for innovation which fundamentally drives market and share growth  and the historical data is very consistent on that point      Consumer Packaged Goods 
It s really hard for an upscale brand to move down market
 I understand that there is   the road is littered  It s littered with folks that haven t worked out  It s also   there is also people on that road who have been successfully  I think Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   Nordstrom Rack      Grocery

143334,364849,JWN,No Stops Go Untouched In The SP,opinion,"Chinese Devaluation Round 2

After a sluggish trade on Tuesday  the S P 500 opened last nights globex session and tried to climb higher  until China again devalued it s currency which sent the futures down 20 handles in less than an hour  and 30 handles lower into the Euro session  The futures did try to bounce  but failed  opening the regular session at 2064 25 and proceeded to sell nearly 20 handles before finding an early low of 2046 75  and in turn rallied hard in the afternoon to close at it s high tick of 2084 75  Noted by Ryan Detrick in the above image   the last time S P 500 was down 1 5   in the AM and closed higher on the day was 10 4 11  
In essence  it took all the Asian session  euro session  and U S  Morning session to take it down nearly 40 handles  and only one afternoon to take them right back up 
No stops go untouched in the S P

 Over the years  both in the open outcry and electronic markets  there has been a tendency to  run the stops   as most traders can certainly attest  Scalpers tend to use 3 5 handle stops  When the markets are moving they trail the stops up or down based on the direction of the move  Most algorithmic and program trading systems are set to move in the direction of those stops on a daily basis  The short term stops are the easiest targets to reach  but eventually  mid  and long term stops fall like dominoes  We like those extremes because it turns small moves into longer  more profitable moves  Just make sure you re on the right side and in control     Danny Riley  MrTopStep s Trading Rules

143339,364854,JWN,6 Aggressive Growth Stocks For The Rest Of 2014 And Into 2015,opinion,"Instead of looking to  beat the market  on the upside and hope for the best on the downside  my strategy is to avoid losing money  That s why I ve been cautious for quite some time now 
While my caution is most likely well warranted in this market  let s not lose sight of the fact that the market trendline is ever upward  Based upon the state of the economy and the corporate earnings trend thus far this year  I would expect any pullback to be short in duration  I can hazard a guess   and it is just that  It may be based upon extensive research  long experience  and deep reflection  but no one knows what exogenous event may occur  positive or negative  tomorrow  next week or next year 
My best guess is that we end 2014 right around where we are now and we end 2015 around 2150 on the S P 500  which would be up 7 8  from where we are today  My hope is that we get the        correction over with quickly  I d feel better about the future of the market if we have a  long overdue  correction  then recover on our way to finish at 2000 or higher in 2014 
If we simply hold this area or advance slightly on the low volume we ve seen lately for the remaining four months of the year  2015 is likely to be a lot rougher 
Aggressive Stock Ideas
At some point  I imagine the makers of luxury goods will enjoy a rebound based upon their sales in China and other Asian markets  Status is important there and external symbols of success go a long way  Companies like Coach  NYSE COH  Richemont  OTC CFRHF  LVMH  Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton  OTC LVMHF   Pernod Ricard  OTC PDRDY   Hermes  OTC HESAY  or Prada  OTC PRDSY  are all high end firms   I once made the mistake of saying to a fashion snob these sorts of brands sold  overpriced  merchandise and received a 5 minute lecture on quality versus mere utility  I guess you have to be born a believer  
There have been concerns recently about the Chinese elites making a show of stopping the escalation of extravagant gift giving  My guess is this campaign will last a few months until no one is looking  then resume with a vengeance 
We need to remember  these sorts of companies have slightly higher costs for materials  labor and marketing  but remarkably higher prices on their goods  Many of these firms have been around since the 1800s and are still going strong  selling status to the idle rich and the idle wannabe  Plus  their penetration in Asia is still rather low compared to their other markets 
None of these firms have participated in the rally of the past couple years  most are still selling within a couple points of where they were a year ago  Richemont  LVMH  Hermes  and Pernod Ricard are all in this boat  On the other hand  Kate Spade  NYSE KATE   Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   and Tiffany  NYSE TIF  have all advanced a bit 
However  both Coach and Prada have fallen on harder times  with Coach selling just a hair off its low for the year  down 31  for the past 12 months  and down 50  from its high back in 2012  Prada just bounced a few cents off its low for the year and is selling at a price not seen since August of 2012  Are these two companies past their prime  Are they no longer au courant in the fickle fashion world 
I imagine not  Especially Coach  Coach has brought on Briton Stuart Vevers as Executive Creative Director  He comes from stints atCalvin Klein  Bottega Veneta  Givenchy  Louis Vuitton  and Mulberry  where he did wonders with their handbag business  Coach has withstood assaults from Michael Kors  NYSE KORS   Kate Spade and other competitors who were supposed to eat their lunch  They re still standing and have embarked on an aggressive plan to reduce their exposure to the outlet market and re establish their positionas an elite luxury brand 
That isn t where the volume is but it s definitely where the margins are  And  of course  their penetration in Asia is just at its beginningstages  particularly in China  I think they are on the right track  You may expect to see COH again in these pages if I m correct ",2014-09-11,Joseph L.

Stocks Entering Period of Seasonal Strength Today 


No stocks identified for today 



The Markets

Stocks ended mixed on Wednesday  ending a 5 day win streak that saw the S P 500 chart new highs  The large cap benchmark remains overbought  trading over 3  above its 20 day moving average over the past five sessions  This is the second time this year that the US equity benchmark has been stretched to this extent above this short term moving average  the last being at the start of July  prior to the brief pullback of around 4   As of last Thursday  in combination with the stretched condition above the 20 day average  the US equity market was also the most stretched above its 50 day moving average since October 28 of 2011  Stocks subsequently pulled back by around 10  in the weeks that followed as equity markets unwound the stretched condition    The good news for long term investors is that short term pullbacks that have resulted from the stretched condition have frequently allowed for appealing buying opportunities for further gains in the months that followed  First level of support for the S P 500 Index can be found at the broken level of resistance around 2019 



Despite the lacklustre session for broad market benchmarks  activity was notable in the retail sector  which topped the leaderboard and charted new all time highs  as indicated by the S P Retail Index ETF  SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT    The gain of 1 86  in shares of XRT followed strong earnings from Macy s Inc  NYSE M  and Fossil Group Inc  NASDAQ FOSL   reports from Nordstrom Inc  NYSE JWN   Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS   and Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT  are expected to be released today   The retail industry remains in a period of seasonal strength through to the Thanksgiving holiday  after which underperformance versus the market is typical through the end of the year  The industry enters its next period of seasonal strength in late January 





Earlier this year we highlighted the apparent shift away from growth stocks and into value  as indicated by the relative performance of the Russell 3000 Value and Growth indexes  Growth stocks peaked relative to the market in May of 2012  while Value stocks hit a relative low  This turning point marked the end of the almost six year trend of outperformance for growth stocks  leading to the emerging trend of outperformance in value  Fast forward to April of this year  the intermediate trend has moved counter to the longer term trend as growth stocks once again took a leadership role  The countertrend has reached a pivotal point at the longer term trendlines that were established back in 2012  A breakout or breakdown appears imminent  Growth stocks may have a tough time breaking above the long term trend  growth stocks typically underperform value stocks between mid November and the end of the year  The relative trend warrants monitoring as momentum stocks  which are predominantly constituents of the growth side of the equation  have captured a lot of attention amongst investors as they gamble on future earnings that may take years to be realized  an abrupt shift away from momentum names would fuel a selloff similar to March April of this year 



Sentiment on Wednesday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended bullish at 0 81 



 Sectors and Industries entering their period of seasonal strength 







We profiled the Nikkei Average at the beginning of the month  highlighting the period of seasonal strength for the benchmark ahead that runs from November through to May for an average gain of around 8   At the time  the benchmark was pushing up against long term resistance  a level that has been holding back the benchmark for decades  The Nikkei has now recorded a move above the key declining trendline  suggesting a change of the long term trend from negative to positive  The benchmark also broke above double top resistance around 16 300  which had established the highs of the year  With new 52 week highs upon us and favourable seasonal tendencies over the next six months  the outlook for the Japanese benchmark looks promising    Next significant level of resistance is apparent at the 2007 high of 18 300  a level that if broken would imply upside potential to 30 000  based on the long term double bottom pattern that became apparent last decade The benchmark is presently overbought and vulnerable to a retracement of some magnitude  potentially allowing for appealing buying levels down the road

143342,364857,JWN,Nordstrom Inc  Undervalued Stock Based On Historical Earnings ,opinion,Before analyzing a company for investment  it s important to have a perspective on how well the business has performed  Because at the end of the day  if you are an investor  you are buying the business  The FAST Graphs  presented with this article will focus first on the business behind the stock  The

specialty retailers  Founded in 1901 as a shoe store in Seattle  today Nordstrom operates 248 stores in 33 states  including 117 full line stores  127 Nordstrom Racks  two Jeffrey boutiques  one treasure bond store and one clearance store This article will reveal the business prospects of Nordstrom Inc through the lens of FAST Graphs   fundamentals analyzer software tool  Therefore  it is offered as the first step before a more comprehensive research effort  Our objective is to provide companies that have excellent historical records and appear reasonably priced based on past  present and future data and expectations  A quick glance at the graph itself and the orange earnings justified valuation line will tell the readers volumes about how well the company has historically been managed and performed as an operating business  Simply put  the reader should ask whether this example is worthy of a greater investment of their time and effort based on the data as presented and organized  The FAST Graphs  unique advantage is the graphical articulation of the price value proposition  Earnings Determine Market Price  The following earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings  The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth  Line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after

results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 19 2  Annualized ROR  w o Div   green circle   long term shareholders of Nordstrom Inc  assuming an initial investment of  10 000  would have received an

as normal as it has been since 2003 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current P S ratio relative to its historical P S ratio  The current P S ratio for Nordstrom Inc is  95 which is historically normal  Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound and profitable performance The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing

  The best  I read all week  and in fact probably in the last month  by one of Barry Ritholtz s employees  I actually talked about in a meeting with a new prospect on Friday  August 8th  2014  From 1995 through 2000  the S P 500 rose   on average   25  per year  During the next 10 years  the S P 500 s cumulative return  from March  2000 through March  2009  was a cumulative  1 38  
  So much focus on high yield bonds of late  Christina Padgett of Moody s distributed Moody s regular North American leveraged Finance Update  I missed the conference call in late July  Moody s Analytics on their August 7th  2014 note said that high grade  investment grade  spreads could widen  somewhat  from their recent 109 bp lows  while high yield s  below investment grade  recent 418 bp s could widen to 425 by year end 2014  What struck me was that  that widening doesn t seem very worrisome  Although after the last decade of stock and high yield returns  everyone is a worry wart these days  Moody s also noted that the US high yield default rate in June  14 was 1 9   which COULD or might average 2 5  1h  15  My thought was that if the HYG is yielding 5 79  as of Friday  August 8th s close  and the high yield default rate is just 1 9   expected to rise to 2 5   that leaves 3 5  of excess spread on just the HYG  on just the expectation of defaults increasing  
Maybe the selling in high yield is now overdone  At 6 5  or 7  on the HYG  we d certainly give the asset class a hard look  I m tempted even now 
That is what I think so many miss individual investors miss on the high yield analysis  while selling the record low spread to Treasuries for the asset class is somewhat prudent  the fact that defaults stay very low as the Fed continues ZIRP  zero interest rate policy  means the excess or record low spreads  may not be that worrisome  A lot of high yield debt is being refinanced at these record low rates  which takes pressure off the balance sheet and helps ease default risk 
The HYG hasn t traded below its 200 week moving average since late 2011  or when we had the last recession scare  until this week  This week the low on the HYG was  91 32  while the 200 week moving average is  91 42 
Does anyone think a recession is imminent  
I actually like municipal high yield better than taxable  Absolute muni high yields are higher than taxable  just by a few bp s  but that is saying something  John Miller  Nuveen s muni high yield manager has done a great job this year 
  Jeff Miller s A Dash of Insight is always a must read  The new release is not out yet this weekend   is last week s blog update 
  Barry Ritholtz on the  Structural Bull Market   Barry cites Jeff Saut  a pretty good market forecaster  I happen to be in this camp  as I noted here using Blackrock data 6 weeks ago 
  Ryan Detrick on yesterday s   Detrick is seriously one of the best short term and statistical concierge s I know  We sold a little into Friday s pop on the 5 am Vladimir Putin comment about easing the tensions with Ukraine  Why is Vlad suddenly credible  
  Paul Hickey s Bespoke is a another very credible research house  Subscriptions costs are reasonable too  The weekly Bespoke Report letter published every Friday afternoon  between 30   40 pages in length  is one of the best weekly market summaries I ve ever read  Bespoke noted this week  the largest weekly drop in newsletter bullish sentiment since February   14  which from 55 6  down to 50 5  in the last week  What has been interesting about this survey over the last few years is that while newsletter writers are bullish  the average investor has remained tilted bearishly as measured by the AAII data  AAII bearish sentiment jumped this week to 38 23    the highest bearish sentiment in a nearly a year 
That   in my opinion   is the hallmark of this bull market  off the March  2009 low  average investors are still cowed  and intimidated  I graduated from college in 1982  and only knew a bull market until 2000  and then in 2008  I really knew a bear market  With last week s 4  drop  fear gauges spiked and bearishness ramped  We haven t seen a 20  correction since mid 2011 
  Per Bespoke  as of Thursday night  just 23  of the S P 500 were trading above their 50 day moving averages  Fear and risk come on in a hurry 
  Norm Conley of JAG Capital out of St  Louis on the continued  of Technology  Russell 1000 Tech continues to outpace the Russell 1 000 Growth index   is another post from Norm on the forward operating EPS of the 10 SP 500 sectors  Norm uses this to make the case for Tech  but I think Basic Materials looks pretty good too 
  The drubbing Industrial stocks have taken after q2  14 earnings releases is puzzling  There has to be opportunity there  More to come on the Industrial sector this week 
We are going to cut it off here late on Saturday afternoon  There are a lot of blogs and such out there  competing for your eyeballs  Thanks for taking a minute to read ours 
We had a decent bounce in the S P 500 later this week  One of our worst positions this year has been the TBF or the unlevered or Inverse Treasury  Gary Morrow  one of our favorite technicians notes the   Friday  August 8th  on  This Week on Wall Street   a blog to which he contributes run by Doug McKay  I m hesitant to get long duration here  since the TLT also traded down to the late May  14 yield of 2 38    2 3 this week and could not trade through  The late selloff in Treasuries Friday afternoon with the SP 500 ramp  was probably more position squaring 
I feel like this equity market correction isn t over  but another sharp leg down in the S P 500  and we d be buying for a year end rally

143348,364863,JWN,Will Lululemon Turn Sour ,opinion,The Overview Lululemon Athletica inc   NASDAQ  LULU  has been faring very well lately  Its stock has broken out of a deep base established in early 2012 to skyrocket 41 8  in three months  Currently  Lululemon is up 51 1  YTD and is hovering extremely close to its 52 week high  Moreover  Stifel Nicolaus recently raised its price target on Lululemon to  77 a share  satisfied by the ability of Lululemon to continually release styles and color palates that resonate with its customers  the success of its revamped e commerce site  and its low level of clearance activity  Lululemon is expected to report fourth quarter earnings results later this month  with analysts expecting a 53  per share gain to 49 cents  Will Lululemon continue its growth streak The Bearish CaseAs Lululemon s stock price soars  the company is attracting an increasing number of bears  They argue that Lululemon is significantly overpriced  with Lululemon shares hovering around 43 times the  1 59 per share it is expected to earn in 2013  Lululemon is also only generating about  0 22 in free cash flow for every  1 in earnings  Moreover  bears point out Lululemon shares are operating at around 260 times Free Cash Flow and the fact that  despite all the hubbub surrounding its growth  Lululemon has 0 consecutive quarters of EPS acceleration From a competitive advantage  bears point out that there are no significant barriers to entry for other apparel companies to overcome in order to establish themselves in the yoga industry  Already Nike Inc   NYSE  NKE  has established the Salvation Chain of athletic wear stores that feature a yoga studio format similar to that of Lululemon  Gap Inc   NYSE  GPS  has created the Athleta stores  which sell yoga apparel and offer free yoga classes  Nordstrom Inc   NYSE  JWN  even hired a Lululemon alum to spearhead its Zella line  which is dedicated to yoga attire  Moreover  many of these stores are  undercutting Lululemon on price   as Bloomberg   Bears also argue that the yoga craze is unsustainable and will ultimately prove to be a fad that will eventually cool down  taking Lululemon down with it The Bullish CaseYet  there is also a compelling bull case for Lululemon as well  one which I believe ultimately trumps the bear case against Lululemon  First of all  brand loyalty  as of now  separates Lululemon from the rest of the pack  Yes  there are cheaper alternatives out there in terms of yoga apparel  and there are definitely an increasing multitude of options from which yoga aficionados can choose  However  Lululemon customers are willing to pay a premium for what they consider to be not mere products  but a lifestyle  Sound familiar  This is the exact same brand loyalty that is driving Apple Inc   NASDAQ  AAPL  and its legions of die hard fans  so far it has worked out pretty well for Apple  Of course  Lululemon is a different company operating in a completely different sector  but the fact of the matter is that brand loyalty should never be underestimated  especially in the case of businesses such as Lululemon that have seen brand loyalty spur company growth year after year  Indeed  the growth Lululemon is experiencing is spectacular  For starters  it reported  1 800 in sales per square foot last year  a 20 8  increase YOY  Lululemon has a 3 Year Sales Growth Rate of 41  and a 3 Year EPS Growth Rate of 61   Moreover  the company has experienced 4 consecutive years of annual EPS growth  these figures show that Lululemon has experienced growth that has been consistently increasing for years and take away from the notion that Lululemon is simply riding on a temporary yoga craze Currently Lululemon is still going strong  Its most recently reported EPS figures constituted a 50  increase YOY and the Average EPS Growth of the last three quarters is an impressive 60   Estimate revisions for the current quarter are up and the current quarter EPS is expected to increase 53  YOY  Current year EPS is expected to be 56 96  higher than last year s  and sales for last quarter increased 31  YOY Not only is Lululemon experiencing significant growth  but it is also translating this growth into significant profitability  Lululemon s Annual Pre Tax Margin is 25 8  and its Annual ROE is 36 2  The yoga industry is definitely seeing an increased number of competitors  but this competition does not amount to a zero sum game  as many Lululemon bears have portrayed  There is significant evidence that the yoga industry is not a fad that will disintegrate due to economic woes  the continued expansion of this industry is a win win for Lululemon and its competitors  In 2001  4 3 million people in the U S  practiced yoga  in 2011  14 3 million people in the U S  practiced yoga  The percentage of people that practice Yoga increases on an average of 20 25  every year  Moreover  Americans spent  5 7 billion on yoga products  equipment  and clothing in 2008  constituting an 87  increase from 2004 expenditures  Ironically  this increase occurred in the midst of the Great Recession  banks collapsed  credit froze  houses were foreclosed  millions lost their jobs  but people still found the resources to buy  90 Lululemon yoga pants The VerdictLululemon continues to be an attractive stock despite its relatively lofty valuations  Institutional funds seem to agree  Lululemon has experienced 3 consecutive quarters of increasing fund ownership and has recently seen a 10  increase in funds owning stock
