106677,328192,DXCM,Why Diabetes Stocks DexCom and Insulet Soared 83  and 116   Respectively  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of DexCom  NASDAQ DXCM  and Insulet  NASDAQ PODD  rocketed 82 6  and 116   respectively  last year  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  The S P 500 returned 31 5  over this period 
Both medical device companies are focused on the diabetes space and were among last year s top performing large cap stocks in the healthcare space  DexCom makes a continuous glucose monitoring  CGM  system  the G6  Insulet is a leader in tubeless insulin pump technology with its Omnipod pump 

So what
We can attribute these two diabetes stocks  strong 2019 performances to the companies  robust financial performances and investor optimism about their growth potential  Diabetes is  unfortunately  a growth space  as the global incidence of the disease    both types 1 and 2    has been rising for some time and is expected to continue to increase 
Let s look at these two companies  most recent quarterly reports  In the third quarter  DexCom s revenue soared 49  year over year to  396 3 million  Adjusted earnings per share  EPS  rocketed 261  to  0 65  smashing the  0 20 that Wall Street had expected  In the third quarter  Insulet s revenue jumped 27  year over year to  192 1 million  and adjusted EPS tripled to  0 09  crushing the analyst consensus estimate of  0 03   
Now what
Investors should be getting material news next month from both diabetes companies

Insulet is slated to report its fourth quarter and full year results on Monday  Feb  24  after the market closes  For the full year  it expects revenue to increase about 28  to 29   The company doesn t provide a profitability outlook

106679,328194,DXCM,Better Buy  DexCom vs  Abbott Laboratories,news,"Healthcare stocks languished during most of 2019 as the markets fretted over political risks associated with the upcoming presidential election  But the sector picked up some steam in the last three months of the year as those worries subsided and investors turned to the sector looking for opportunities that could hold up well if the economy turns down 
DexCom  NASDAQ DXCM  and Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT  are two very successful healthcare companies that appeal to different sorts of investors  DexCom is a pure play in one of the hottest areas in healthcare  while Abbott Labs is a diversified  steady performer  Which one wins the nod as the better stock to own for the next few years 
DexCom s business
DexCom specializes in one type of medical device for people with diabetes  continuous glucose monitors  CGMs   and has been wildly successful in that space  The company s current line of monitors uses a small sensor inserted under the skin and a Bluetooth transmitter that connects to a DexCom receiver  a smartphone  or a smartwatch  The system takes blood glucose measurements every five minutes and alerts the wearer when glucose levels fall outside a safe range 

The advantages of frequent measurements and no requirement for pricking fingers have resulted in rapid sales growth for DexCom  Through the first three quarters of 2019  revenue is up a whopping 46  to  1 01 billion  and non GAAP  adjusted  earnings per share are  0 69  up from a loss of  0 19 in the first nine months of 2018 
Abbott s business
Abbott Labs also makes CGMs  but it s a broadly diversified healthcare company that s over 20 times the size of DexCom and sells more than 1 500 products  The company has four business segments  Medical devices  at 38  of revenue  is the company s biggest  along with diagnostics  nutrition  and established pharmaceuticals 
All four segments are contributing to Abbott s steady but relatively unspectacular growth  Overall  the company has grown year to date revenue by 7 4  on an organic basis  that is  excluding currency effects and the effect of a discontinued business  to  23 6 billion  Revenue from medical devices has grown 10 2  organically over the prior year  pharmaceuticals are up 6 5   diagnostics has grown 5 7   and nutrition 5 2   Earnings per share are up 10 6  to  2 29 
Abbott s glucose monitor  FreeStyle Libre  actually outsells DexCom s and is growing faster  The Abbott CGM generated  496 million in revenue in Q3  compared with  396 million for DexCom s  Sales growth for the product line was 63   beating DexCom s 49  growth in the quarter 
DexCom s growth prospects
DexCom s rapid growth will likely continue for at least a few more years  although perhaps at a somewhat slower pace  In a recent update  the company gave muted guidance of revenue growth between 17  and 21  in 2020  down from 42  growth in 2019  but the company regularly underpromises and then beats expectations 

DexCom s core customers are diabetes patients on intensive insulin therapy who need to regulate blood glucose level to within a range  That market is growing with the diabetes epidemic  and DexCom has plenty of runway  Only about 15  of the type 2 diabetes patients in the U S  on intensive therapy are using CGMs  The company is gearing up to launch an improved version of its devices in late 2020  which should boost sales and improve profits due to a lower manufacturing cost 
Longer term  DexCom has plenty of room to grow outside its core market  though  The company is growing its sales team to market to hospitals for glucose monitoring in inpatient settings and is conducting studies with pregnant women for management of gestational diabetes  Ultimately  the larger population of patients with type 2 diabetes who aren t on intensive diabetes therapy and even the 84 million people in the U S  who are pre diabetic could be part of the company s addressable market  Monitoring blood glucose could become an important part of controlling diet and exercise to halt the progression of the disease 
Abbott s growth prospects
Sales of Abbott s CGM may be growing faster than Dexcom s  but they re small compared with the overall total for the company  Fortunately for Abbott s shareholders  the company has other bright spots that are driving growth 

Abbott s MitraClip  an implant to repair leaky heart valves  is growing sales at over 30   Alinity is a family of high throughput systems for core laboratory testing such as blood chemistry analysis  and the recent rollout of the products in Europe is helping to grow that product line in double digits  Abbott s established pharmaceuticals business is focused on selling branded generic medicines into emerging markets  where demographics and improving standards of living are tailwinds for growth 
There really aren t any weak points in Abbott s highly diversified business  which makes the company s bottom line steady and very predictable  It is guiding toward non GAAP EPS growth of about 12  for 2019  and it should be able to maintain growth at about that rate for years 
Dividends and valuation
DexCom doesn t pay dividends  but Abbott is a Dividend Aristocrat  having increased its payout for 48 consecutive years  Last month it raised the quarterly dividend a healthy 12 5   and it now yields 1 6  
Shares are priced to reflect the massive growth that investors expect to see from the business  The stock sells for 122 times the analyst consensus estimate for earnings in 2020  which assumes about 33  growth from 2019 
Abbott s stock sells for about 25 times expected 2020 EPS  which is much cheaper than DexCom  but doesn t exactly put the stock in value territory given a growth rate in the low teens 
For growth  buy DexCom  Value investors will prefer Abbott
Given DexCom s strong business momentum and wide open avenues for long term growth  I think investors will continue to award the stock a high multiple and the shares will likely outperform those of Abbott Labs over the next few years  But DexCom s valuation adds risk to the stock  and there is also a good chance the investors will have a bumpy ride on the way to gains  especially if the market turns down and shuns risk for a time  DexCom would be my pick for risk tolerant growth stock investors 
Abbott Laboratories is more suitable for some investors  though  The well managed blue chip produces steady growth that s diversified across a broad portfolio  And though the yield isn t particularly high  it s a dependable dividend stock that isn t very susceptible to either the economy or the whims of the market  Conservative investors who want a stock they can buy and forget about for decades should consider Abbott Labs over DexCom ",2020-01-25,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmr9v,2067727

mammography systems  sales have been rising  This is expected to get reflected in the upcoming results For the past few months  Hologic s 3Dimensions and 3D Performance systems have been contributing significantly to the top line  The product portfolio  comprising Intelligent 2D  Clarity HD and SmartCurve  has been witnessing strong market adoption  Also  the Faxitron business  which did not contribute to organic growth in the last reported quarter  is expected to have aided the company s top line in the fiscal first quarter  backed by solid revenue contribution witnessed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  Aptima women s health test kits are expected to have maintained the previous quarter s growth momentum Further  the breast health segment has likely got a boost in the fiscal

113491,335006,DXCM,Will New Buyouts Aid Quest Diagnostics  DGX  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Quest Diagnostics Incorporated   NYSE DGX   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2019 and full year earnings on Jan 30  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings of  1 76 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 33   the average trailing four quarter positive surprise being 1 91  Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors Likely to Impact Q4 ResultsQuest Diagnostics seems well aligned with its two pronged agenda to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence  Per the company  its frequently growing partnerships with other health care leaders and prudent buyouts are creating a pool of opportunities for both the top and the bottom line  At the same time  the patient experience improved and the overall cost of care  reduced As an evidence  despite PAMA reimbursement pressuresweighing heavily on the industry  the company fulfilled all the five elements of its growth acceleration strategy through the last few quarters  We strongly expect this momentum to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results as well Going by the first element of its growth policy  to further strengthen the top line by 2  via strategically accretive acquisitions   in the fourth quarter  the company acquired Clinical Laboratory Services of Boston Clinical Laboratories in Massachusetts  N J  We hope this transaction will leave a positive impact on the company s earnings and will find reflection in its to be reported results Considering the second element of Quest Diagnostics  key growth plans  which is to expand relationships with hospital health systems  the company is executing this strategy quite successfully  Its top line outcome is expected to reflect the impact of its recent partnerships with Catholic Health Services  CHS   an integrated health care delivery system  and hc1  a bioinformatics player in precision testing  in the impending quarterly release Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise   With respect to the third element of offering its diagnostic innovation a wider access  the company has been witnessing growth in prescription drug monitoring  continued strength in tuberculosis testing in both QuantiFERON and T Spot plus STD testing and CardioIQ  Per the company  its recently inked consolidation deals are predicted to upgrade capabilities in advanced diagnostics  especially in the areas of Women s Health and Infectious Disease  These new developments are expected to have contributed to the company s fourth quarter top line About the fourth element of the company s key catalysts  which is to provide ample choices to consumers  the company s liaison with Walmart  NYSE WMT  already started adding value to this end with higher patient traffic  Moreover  the company s alliance with Safeway currently flaunts more than 200 patient service centers across its retail store locations  This positivity is likely to reflect on Quest Diagnostics  fourth quarter earnings performance The fifth element of Quest Diagnostics  list of major drivers indicates its support to population health within analytics and extended care services  In this regard  the company of late launched Quest Clinical Trial Connect  a patient recruitment service Apart from the above five elements  Quest Diagnostics endeavors to scale up productivity as part of its efforts to ramp up the operating efficiency  This  in turn  enabled the company to successfully manage headcount growth We expect these chief catalysts to replicate the company s success story in its imminent quarterly results  Also  a better than expected third quarter performance is likely to have perked up the same primary metrics in the fourth quarter We strongly believe that all these recent developments might have significantly favored the company s top line in the quarter to be reported On the flip side  Quest Diagnostics has been suffering a significant PAMA driven reimbursement pressure that remains a major headwind to structural changes in the marketplace  In the first half of 2019  Medicare rates were 10  down from the prior year level  This might have affected the company s business through the second half as well  In fact  this should get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 60 for fourth quarter earnings implies a 17 7  rise from the year ago reported figure What Our Model SuggestsThe proven Zacks model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Quest Diagnostics this season  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  increases the odds of a positive surprise  But that s not the case here

world of healthcare so much hinges on the FDA s approval or rejection of a new drug  Of course  it s imperative to look at the bigger picture  and realize what these companies are trying to achieve in terms of their respective therapies  There is no doubt  though  that especially in this sector  the market reacts dramatically to both good and bad news One such company looking forward to an FDA decision in the new year is biopharma Horizon Therapeutics  The company s focus is on rare and rheumatic conditions  and a PDUFA date of March 8 will determine the future of Horizon s teprotumumab drug  a treatment for active thyroid eye disease  TED   The disease can potentially lead to loss of vision and the drug could be the first treatment for TED to gain approval from the FDA Clinical trials in both Phases 2 and 3 have displayed positive data  and an approval will add the treatment to a portfolio that the company thinks will generate between  1 28 billion and  1 31 billion in net

Segments in Detail
Walgreens Boots reports through three segments  Retail Pharmacy USA  Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale Walgreens Boots Alliance  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

    
Retail Pharmacy USA
The segment s sales totaled  26 1 billion in the first quarter  highlighting an improvement of 1 6  year over year 
Pharmacy sales increased 2 9  from the year ago quarter on higher brand inflation  prescription volume and growth in central specialty  Pharmacy sales at comparable stores improved 2 5  year over year  while prescriptions filled in comparable stores  adjusted to 30 day equivalents  rose 2 8  in the quarter  Retail sales dipped 2 2  while comparable retail sales slid 0 5  year over year on continued de emphasis of tobacco 
Retail Pharmacy International
Revenues at the Retail Pharmacy International division declined 5 4  on a year over year basis to  2 7 billion in the fiscal first quarter  Sales were down 2 7  at CER due to lower Boots UK sales and lower sales in Chile

Our Take
Walgreens Boots exited first quarter fiscal 2020 on a sluggish note as both adjusted earnings as well as revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The year over year decline in adjusted earnings is another cause for concern 
Meanwhile  tough market conditions  particularly in retail  have been inducing sluggishness in the Retail Pharmacy International division  Margin pressure is a major overhang on the stock  Overall  the Retail Pharmacy USA division saw an uptick in sales during the quarter on account of comparable prescription growth and a strong retail prescription market 
Also  a rise in Pharmaceutical Wholesale division sales buoys optimism The recently inked agreement with McKesson  NYSE MCK  to create a German joint venture and an exclusive franchise deal in the United Kingdom with Mothercare hold promise

Ahead  1  Do Risk Free Rates Stay at Zero Much Longer Few people will be brave enough to call the end of the 30 year bond bull run  but the idea that sub zero borrowing costs may not be around forever is one people are increasingly willing to entertain Upbeat economic data  signs of a trade war truce and above all  central banks  clear reluctance to cut interest rates further have shrunk the global negative yield bond pool to  12 5 trillion from  17 trillion two months ago In Europe  Germany s long dated government borrowing costs rose above 0  recently  while 10 year yields are up 50 basis points from early September lows  Finnish  Belgian and Austrian 10 year yields are also flirting with the zero mark But are we just seeing another  bond tantrum  that will soon peter out  like for instance the Bund selloff in April 2015  It s true that sub target inflation and deeply negative interest rates in the Eurozone  Japan and elsewhere mean negative yields won t vanish anytime soon  Above all  some governments  such as Germany  still oppose increasing state spending to boost growth So  money managers will be wary of slashing bond exposure  They will be aware  though  that at such low yields  even small moves up will send bond prices crashing  risking big losses on their portfolios  Several countries  from Germany to Japan  will release third quarter growth data in coming days   a robust set of figures could push yields further toward zero  2  Where Is Consumer Price Inflation The Fed lowered interest rates a third time on Oct  30  even with the economy plugging along in OK shape  So what gives  The real concern is inflation   too little  not too much The string of quarter point insurance cuts comes amid concerns about a global slowdown spilling over  and is meant to counter low inflation  which keeps rates down and reduces the Fed s ability to fight the next downturn  Underneath it all lurks the specter of disinflation  or demand crushing Japan style deflation Wednesday brings October s Consumer Price Index  CPI   followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell s appearance before the congressional joint economic committee  Core year on year CPI is expected at 2 4  and headline at 1 7   But the Fed s favorite measure of core personal consumption expenditures is running around 1 6    hovering mostly below the 2  target since prior to the financial crisis The Fed signaled it may wait into 2020 to cut again  Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said rising inflation expectations are key  It looks like an uphill battle given that consumer inflation expectations are declining even though wages are ticking up On Friday  October retail sales and industrial production data will shed light on whether the consumer can continue to drive growth in the face of a struggling manufacturing sector and months of trade tensions  3  Keep an Eye Out for the Usual Trade HeadlinesA raft of global investors at the Reuters 2020 Investment Outlook Summit declared unwavering keenness to stay invested in a market that has done extremely well in 2019 and is expected to do just as well in the coming year Adding to that enthusiasm among business and investors are news headlines on gradual progress toward some sort of U S  China trade truce  But details remain scarce and  in fact  there isn t much to cheer in China this month Last weekend brought to a close the annual China International Import Expo in Shanghai  where American companies turned out in force October is seasonally weak because of the long Chinese National Day holiday  and recent data showed the trade war continues to take a toll on exports and demand  China s economic growth has slipped to its weakest in three decades  forcing the central bank to make its first rate cut in nearly three years and pump cash into markets Key data on lending  investment and inflation are due in coming days  Even as the hubbub over another regional bank run fades  investors expect to see proof that bank lending and social financing deteriorated further  inflation remained high on rising pork prices and investment in factories was depressed  4  The 11th BRICS Summit on Tuesday in BrazilLeaders of Brazil  Russia  India  China and South Africa meet in Brasilia for their 11th summit on Tuesday Accounting for a third of world GDP  this bloc has evolved into a political organization  which also has its own development bank It s been a long road since Goldman Sachs  analyst Jim O Neill coined the term BRIC in 2001 to describe a grouping of the four biggest emerging markets  The term has evolved from a catchy acronym to an investment concept spawning dozens of funds managing around  25 billion at their peak  Most BRIC funds have since quietly closed  but the countries themselves have adopted the grouping   only it s BRICS now  with the addition of South Africa Times are tough  however  China is mired in a trade war that s damaging its export reliant economy and India s credit rating has been cut by Moody s on worries about growth and the banking sector  Russia s economy is semi stagnant  under U S  sanctions and locking horns with Turkey for domination of the Middle East  Brazil  just emerging from a brutal recession  is struggling to pass vital reforms  South Africa  with anemic growth  risks losing its investment grade credit rating  cutting access to precious investment The upcoming summit is to focus on  economic growth for an innovative future   Given all the problems the quintet face  innovation may be key  5  Erdogan Will Meet Trump on Wednesday in DCTurkey s President Tayyip Erdogan is heading to Washington for a powwow with his U S  counterpart  Donald Trump  on Wednesday  The two have plenty to discuss  Engagement  or disengagement  of Turkish and U S  forces in northern Syria and related bilateral agreements  as well as Ankara s purchase of Russia s S 400 missile defense system  which under U S  law should trigger sanctions Then there is a U S  court case against state owned Halkbank over evading sanctions in Iran  Meanwhile  a U S  House of Representatives  vote to recognize mass killings of Armenians a century ago as genocide has rankled Ankara The two men are said to have a strong bond  according to Turkish sources  The lira   a weathervane for Turkey s economic outlook but also for the state of its geopolitical relations  especially with Washington   is on track for an 8  tumble in 2019  its seventh straight year in the red Those personal ties could prove crucial to Erdogan  who seems adept at managing his relationship with the man at the helm of its largest NATO ally  but may face much more hostility from the U S  legislative branch Zacks  1 Rank Stocks A  Dexcom This is a  198 Medical Instruments stock with an  18B market

113606,335121,DXCM,Healthcare Drives Wall Street  5 Soaring ETFs   Stocks,opinion,"Wall Street has gaining on optimism surrounding the signing of a  phase one  trade deal between the United States and China  The S P 500  in fact  crossed the 3 100 mark this week while the Nasdaq Composite Index breezed past 8 500  read    
Though there is a certain level of lingering uncertainty about how the deal will shape up  causing a safe haven rally occasionally  some sectors have been steady irrespective of the geopolitical scenario  Healthcare is among the few  
Let s dig a little deeper 
What s Driving Healthcare 
Per the  issued on Nov 13  total earnings of 95 1  of the entire healthcare market capitalization in the S P 500 that has reported so far are up 7 1  on revenue growth of 7 4   The earnings and revenue growth rates are the fifth highest among the 16 Zacks classified sectors  Meanwhile  the blended beat ratio of 70 6  is the third highest 
There are about 13 industries in the broader medical sector  out of which 12 sport a favorable Zacks Rank  Below we highlight three key industries 
Medical   Drugs belongs to a favorable Zacks industry  placed at the top 20  of 250  industries   A total of 117 companies reported this season of which 64  beat estimates and 5  met the same  Shares of the Medical   Drugs industry can be availed at 17 43x forward P E ratio against the S P 500 ETF IVV s P E multiple of 18 64x  Though a low P E is not indicative of the stock s future performance  cheaper valuation is always good news  The projected EPS growth rate of the sector is 9 72  versus 5 66  of IVV  The debt to equity ratio of the industry  0 2x  is much lower than 0 72x of IVV 
Large Cap Pharmaceuticals also hails from a favorable Zacks industry  positioned at the top 28    Only 12 companies reported this season  all of which beat estimates  The industry has a forward P E ratio of 14 73x  which reflects its undervalued status  The debt to equity ratio of the industry  0 68x  is in line with that of the S P 500 
Medical   Biomedical And Genetics also comes from a favorable Zacks industry  top 20    About 275 companies reported this season  of which 59  surpassed estimates while 5  met the mark  Though the forward P E ratio of 25 19x is pretty higher in comparison to IVV  the projected EPS growth rate is also higher  10 93   than the S P 500  5 66   
Apart from favorable financials and valuations  the sector is brimming with good news starting from a wave of merger and acquisitions to the release of upbeat drug data  Recently  Biogen   NASDAQ BIIB   spread optimism in the healthcare sector following its Alzheimer s treatment report  The biotech company decided to go ahead with the approval of aducanumab  a treatment for early Alzheimer s diseases  after the drug met the primary endpoint of a Phase 3 Emerge study 
Investors should also note that the healthcare sector offers a slightly defensive approach and thus could be a good bet if there is any uncertainty regarding the trade deal

past few months  the medical device space has witnessed exceptional progress when it comes to innovation   R D to be precise  Some of the path breaking inventions such as wireless brain sensors  Bluetooth enabled smart inhalers  artificial pancreas  human brain pacemaker  precision medicine and many more have helped the medical device space to grow significantly Strong demand in the emerging markets is likely to bolster the performance of the industry participants in this reporting cycle  According to a  report  as stated by Moody s  the medical device makers are likely to exhibit mid single digit revenue growth fueled by product innovation across most of the companies and categories  Additionally  sales in emerging markets are expected to display a double digit percentage rise Backed by the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity  emerging economies are witnessing strong demand for the medical products  In fact  a geriatric population  relaxed regulations  cheap skilled labor  increasing wealth and the government focus on healthcare infrastructure make these markets attractive to the global medical device players However  the U S  Medical Products industry has confronted short term hurdles pertaining to the trade war with China  Per a Medical Imaging   Technology Alliance  MITA  survey  tariffs will cost the companies nearly  138 million every year It is important to note here that the medical product space is facing a significant bottom line pressure  particularly the companies that have production in China  owing to the imposition of U S  tariff

a look at the following five Medical Products players that are set to release quarterly results on Jul 31 McKesson Corporation   NYSE MCK    The company s U S  Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions

Health segment  Within this business  growth of the Breast Imaging and Interventional Breast Solutions sub segments are expected to contribute to the to be reported quarter s results  This apart  the

real time CGM  Moreover  the company has a sizeable international market opportunity on account of the demographic trends and lifestyle in countries outside the United States and Europe  To that end  we expect the company to deliver higher international revenues in the to be reported quarter  However  the company projects restructuring related cost to approximately range between  15 million and

113640,335155,DXCM,DexCom s Wall Street Darling Status In Danger,opinion,"In previous articles  we ve discussed numerous stocks  which brought their investors great returns in the past decade  Today s material will focus on one that beats them all   DexCom   NASDAQ DXCM    a medical device company  headquartered in San Diego  California 
In November 2008  during the throes of the Financial Crisis  DXCM stock plunged to as low as  1 36 a share  In August 2019  the price reached an all time high of  178 45  The math says this is 55 8  compounded annually for a total return of 13 000  in less than eleven years 





In contrast  the low at  1 36 in 2008 was the result of a selloff from  26 70 in April 2006  It turns out DexCom stock is not immune to price declines after all  The danger is that after many years of huge gains investors tend to forget the fact that no trend lasts forever  So let s examine DexCom s bull market through the prism of the Elliott Wave principle and see what s left of it 

DexCom s weekly logarithmic chart reveals that a complete five wave impulse pattern has been formed  What the bulls probably don t want to hear is that according to the Elliott Wave theory  every impulse is followed by a three wave correction in the other direction

Fed Chair Powell initially suspended the three year monetary policy tightening program this year and has now signaled rate cuts if needed  The Fed is closely monitoring the implications of trade tensions on the economy and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion  given a strong labor market and inflation near 2  target

Additionally  recovery in U S  housing market  Trump s suspension of the planned tariffs against Mexico and wave of mergers and acquisitions added to the strength  Further  the American economy is on a slower growth path buoyed by strong job growth  rising consumer confidence  and higher consumer spending

113757,335272,DXCM,3 Stocks Setting Up For A Potential Big Time Breakout,opinion,"With the market pulling back in let s take a look at a few charts that may be the next breakouts in play 
Inspire Medical Systems Inc  NYSE INSP  is a recent IPO  from May 2018  that is trading in a tight range on the weekly chart just below its all time high  Note that volume was well above average when  INSP cleared resistance at  48 and closed above the downtrend line  which is a bullish sign 
 INSP lacks earnings but does have four quarters in a row of  80  revenue growth 
A move through the highs of the current three week trading range is the obvious buy point  though the daily chart can be monitored for a lower entry on partial size with the idea of adding on strength  Look for a significant pick up in volume on the move out to confirm the technical pattern 
Reports earnings Feb  26

DexCom Inc  NASDAQ DXCM  gapped above the downtrend line and the 10 week moving average on a pick up in volume a few weeks ago and has since been trading in a tight range  The current tight range is a handle  short term and tight consolidation   which should be monitored closely for a buy point  The obvious entry is over the recent swing high but an earlier entry could develop such as a break of the downtrend line connected from the high of 1 22 to 2 6 
 DXCM also lacks earnings but has impressive revenue growth at  40  the past two quarters and over eight quarters in a row of  20  
Reports earnings Feb  21


Freshpet Inc  NASDAQ FRPT broke out to new all time highs in 2018 after clearing the prior high at  26  The prior high was set in 2015 just a few months after its IPO in November 2014  Like the two setups above   FRPT also cleared the downtrend line on a pick up in volume  The pullback off the recent swing high is deeper in  FRPT than in  INSP or  DXCM  but the pullback did find support above the rising 10 week moving average 
The price action surged above the short term downtrend line this week  which is a positive sign if the price holds above  36

113791,335306,DXCM,Can CAG Growth Steadily Drive IDEXX  IDXX  In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,IDEXX Laboratories  Inc    NASDAQ IDXX   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 1  before the opening bell  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7 14   Notably  the stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four reported quarters  the average being 6 37  Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Key CatalystsIDEXX should continue with its momentum in the fourth quarter  courtesy of a strong global rise in Companion Animal Group  CAG  Diagnostics  revenues  In the third quarter  this upside was driven by strong consistent gains from recurring CAG revenues  high premium CAG instrument placements and consistent high growth in digital business  This trend is expected to be retained further In terms of 2018 outlook  IDEXX expects to deliver full year organic growth trend in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues to be around 13 2   supported by steady strong growth in the United States and expanding international consumable revenues IDEXX Laboratories  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  474 million for CAG Diagnostics revenues represents an 9 4  improvement over the last reported quarter For the fourth quarter  the company anticipates revenue growth in the range of 7 9   net of an estimated 2  foreign exchange headwind  IDEXX hopes to retain high recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains in the quarter under review  aided by sustaining strong trends in the United States The company is projecting moderate overall organic growth in the 9 11  band related to tough prior year comparisons in global instrument placements and expectations for lower revenues in LPD  Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics  business  In this regard  the company forecasts mid to high single digit revenue declines in LPD organic revenues for the fourth quarter Other FactorsWe pin considerable hopes on progress in the Water Business  lying on a growth trajectory of late on the back of encouraging test results in the United States and benefits drawn from the global go direct initiatives  Moreover  the business witnessed 9  organic strength in the last reported quarter The company earlier stated that it is perfectly on track for a continued high single digit organic revenue boost in this business through 2018  The consensus mark for Water revenues stands at  30 98 million for the yet to be reported period  translating into a 7 3  improvement from the year ago number IDEXX constantly expands its global footprint  It has been significantly getting advantages from bountiful opportunities in the emerging companion animal diagnostics markets  Further  management s regular share buybacks underscore the company s robust free cash flow reserve On the flip side  adverse foreign currency movement is a major headwind  Another concern is the company s heavy reliance on third party distributors  The purchasing dynamics of distributors leave a significant impact on the company s sales of instrument consumables and its rapid assay products  Moreover  IDEXX has been witnessing a rise in operating expenses due to increased head count along with higher investments in portfolio development as well as expansion in the United States and internationally Additionally  a competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX s performance  Thus  the struggle to gain market traction might be a drag  which in turn  can hurt fourth quarter results Here s what the quantitative model predicts Our proven Zacks model clearly shows that a company with a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  IDEXX has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  it has an Earnings ESP of  0 28   which leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as the company also needs a positive ESP to be confident about a likely surprise  Thus  this combination fails to suggest an earnings beat for the stock this season You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering from the same space as these comprise the

113796,335311,DXCM,Can Boston Scientific  BSX  Q4 Earnings Fuel Overall Growth ,opinion,Boston Scientific Corporation   NYSE BSX   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results  before the opening bell on Feb 6 In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 94   Moreover  it delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four reported quarters  the average beat being 7 5  Let s see  how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Preliminary Results at a Glance Notably  Boston Scientific recently projected an impressive fourth quarter performance and expects to meet the upper end of its own expectations on the revenue front  In the to be reported quarter  Boston Scientific expects total revenue growth of 6 3   up 8 2  on operational basis after excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  on a year over year basis to  2 56 billion  in line with the current Zacks Consensus Estimate However  this meets the upper end of the company s earlier provided revenue guidance of  2 525  2 565 billion  A firm top line is primarily expected on the back of growth across all the company s segments and geographical regions   Read more    Key CatalystsAlike the prior quarter  we are upbeat about strong contributions from Boston Scientific s Cardiovascular business group  which comprises Interventional Cardiology  IC  and Peripheral Interventions  PI   In the last reported quarter  the company generated around 38  of its total revenues from this highest revenue generating segment Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   We are optimistic about the IC business that will help the company maintain impressive global growth  courtesy of an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams  Complex PCI  percutaneouscoronary intervention  products within IC are growing strongly on successful global expansion efforts  According to Boston Scientific  the global Complex PCI results are largely offsetting the recent decline in the company s coronary drug eluting stent business Within Structural Heart  we are looking forward to Boston Scientific s WATCHMAN  ACURATE and IRIS product lines that are expected to contribute to the top line in the to be reported quarter  The company expects revenues from WATCHMAN and ACURATE TAVR franchise to total approximately  450 million in 2018 This apart  the recent acquisition of Claret Medical should largely aid Structural Heart s top line  Notably  Claret Medical brought Sentinel  the only cerebral embolic protection system approved in the United States and Europe  to Boston Scientific s Structural Heart portfolio Per the preliminary fourth quarter result  sales from the company s IC were up 5 1  on a reported basis  up 7 6  operationally  on a year over year basis The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IC revenues is pegged at  669 million  indicating an increase of 5 2  on a year over year basis In recent quarters  the PI business consistently demonstrated a solid uptick across segments like peripheral arterial disease  venous and interventional oncology  In the last reported quarter  the company commenced the launch of Eluvia in the United States  According to Boston Scientific  Eluvia has significant market opportunity  given the large addressable patient population  differentiated  sustained release technology and superior clinical outcomes with reduced need for reintervention  We believe  this launch will be accretive to the company s fourth quarter results Meanwhile  the preliminary release highlights the fact that in the fourth quarter  the Peripheral Interventions business was up 9 3   up 11 4    Accordingly  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter PI revenues stands at  295 million  reflecting a 6 5  rise year over year Other Factors at PlayAmong the other segments  MedSurg is estimated to demonstrate a steady performance led by endoscopy  Urology and Pelvic Health are also projected to surpass market levels  driven by investment strategies in the key international geographies Within endoscopy  the company is expected to display sturdy results  riding on a promising EndoChoice performance  particularly in pathology and infection prevention  Urology and Pelvic Health business should also continue to maintain its growth momentum on robust global performance  Boston Scientific s recent acquisitions have added several products  though many are under development  with immense potential to its portfolio  The buyouts of Apama MedicalSecurus Medical in Electrophysiology  Augmenix in Urology along with EmCision in Endoscopy deserve special mention The company is gradually fortifying its presence in the emerging markets of Brazil  Russia  India and China  BRIC   In third quarter 2018  business from the emerging markets registered 20  growth owing to a commendable progress in China and Latin America Boston Scientific is gaining traction in India as well  It is currently targeting about 10 emerging markets for additional emphasis  The company is also pinning hopes on its core cardiology segment  which is gradually stabilizing with growth in the BRIC nations  This trend is expected to sustain in the to be reported quarter as well However  the ongoing tensions between the United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports have raised concerns for major MedTech players as a single adverse move might affect top line numbers in the coming quarters Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of  2 56 billion represents an increase of 6 24  from the prior year quarter  Also  earnings estimates of 37 cents reflect an 8 8  rise on a year over year basis What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven Zacks model clearly shows that a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has high chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   which makes surprise prediction difficult  Thus  this combination fails to suggest any likely earnings beat for the stock this earnings season Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth

113889,335404,DXCM,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Bio Rad Laboratories  Mazor Robotics  Tactile Systems  Eli Lilly And DexCom,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 26  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Bio Rad Laboratories  Inc    NYSE BIO    Mazor Robotics Ltd    NASDAQ MZOR    Tactile Systems Technology  Inc    NASDAQ TCMD    Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   and DexCom  Inc    NASDAQ DXCM   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  4 MedTech Stocks to Explode in 2018The medical devices industry  which was once acclaimed for its high paying jobs and research and development opportunities  has been subject to the much controversial 2 3  medical device excise tax  The MedTech fraternity is leaving no stone unturned to permanently do away with the dreadful tax   but has not been able to Interestingly  the year 2017 has been quite an eventful one  courtesy of a series of socio political occurrences that favored the space  The year witnessed the much talked about election wherein Donald Trump took over the nation s charge as President  Not only were the new administration s health schemes thoroughly criticized but the reforms that were brought in taxation schemes became a much talked about subject  Needless to say  these developments kept investors on their toes Standing at the threshold of 2018 it is imperative for the investors thus to find the means which can dilute the macroeconomic woes and help them gain more  But before guiding you to make prudent investments for the year let s take a look at the various developments that have taken place within the space and see what awaits the investors in the coming year Health Policy Qualms to Continue in 2018   It has already been a year since trump became the President   However  his policies continue to be the most debated issue in the space  The new administration s Obamacare  repeal   replacement  effort through Congress and the latest  Executive Order   which apparently has been designed to provide quality healthcare to the nation at affordable rate  has already posed a serious threat to the healthcare community Per critics  this order  forsaking the consideration of pre existing health conditions has been designed to push people into  junk  insurance plans  The American Hospital Association has put forward an extremely bearish view on the executive order related to promote health care choice and competition  The association apprehends that the executive order will solely allow health insurance plans that cover fewer benefits and give lesser consumer protections Tax Reform May Hit Hard in 2018  According a report by Business Insider  the Republican tax plan repeals an itemized deduction that applies to healthcare expenses  If the new bill gets implemented  families with high healthcare expenditure will be impacted as these expenses will no longer be deducted from their taxes  Hence  people will no longer be interested in expensive healthcare or MedTech procedures   A report by The Hill says that the Section 4303 of the Republican tax bill plan imposes a 20  excise tax on goods manufactured overseas by subsidiaries of U S  companies  Under the U S  tax code  Puerto Rico is considered a foreign land which implies that U S  parent companies will have to pay excise taxes if they purchase from their subsidiaries in the island  In this regard  the FDA recently found that around 30  of Puerto Rico s gross domestic product was driven by pharmaceuticals and medical devices in 2016  Undoubtedly  the latest tax plan has created an uproar among MedTech players who might witness a huge reduction in their turnover with the approval of the bill Medical Device Tax Returns in 2018  The medical community was extremely hopeful about Trump s regulatory agenda as it promised to abolish the infamous 2 3  medical device tax that was first was included in the 2010 health care reform law The dreaded tax  imposed on the selling price instead of net profit and amounting to a stupendous sum  wiped out almost a quarter of the profit of medical technology companies  Realizing this  the U S  House and Senate temporarily suspended it for two years at the beginning of 2015 Going by the available data  it is quite evident that this partial two year repeal of the medical device tax has benefited the sector s development  Per data provided by the medical device trade group  in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller   within this period  there was roughly an 83  rise in research and development  R D  investments by MedTech players The Republicans however have tightlipped on this tax raising the probability of its return in 2018  Undoubtedly  its comeback will be an additional burden for the MedTech fraternity  largely discouraging R D activities  Per an article by Matt Murphy in wbur  sectors which are going to be hampered most by reimposition of this levy are X ray and MRI machines  surgical instruments and pacemakers Use of  PRO  Concept May Delay Regulatory Process in 2018  The Center for Devices and Radiological Health s  CDRH  strategic priorities have been recently published where it has elaborately discussed the Value and Use of Patient Reported Outcomes  PROs  in Assessing Effects of Medical Devices  According to a Medcitynews article by John Speer  CDRH  the umbrella organization at the FDA  talked about a plan that would entitle patients to have access to high quality  safe and effective medical devices  PRO basically means a patient s assessment of their own health status or quality of life This is especially impactful because the majority of medical devices in the United States are cleared by FDA via the 510 k  premarket submission where patients have no voice as such  With the new PRO concept  this is no longer going to be valid  Per the report   given the expected behavior of the FDA by industry  it might increase the time taken to get through the regulatory process and increase costs to produce Class II devices   This is because  now they will have to conduct some sort of PRO study if this becomes a requirement  Also they will need additional funding to support the study activities FDA User Fee Increase  May Pose a Threat  Per an Emergo Group report  the FDA s 2018 user fees  established by the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017  MDUFA IV   will increase for all registration related categories  including a sizeable fee increase for 510 k  premarket notification submissions by larger companies  In addition  FDA Establishment Registration fees will jump 37  to  4 642 for the 2018 fiscal from  3 382 in 2017  This implementation may pose a huge burden for the digital health industry and small companies in the medical device space 4 Stocks to Brave the ThreatsIn such a tumultuous scenario  to save investors from the time taking process of identifying the powerful MedTech stocks who may brave the industry threats in 2018

113900,335415,DXCM,Lessons From The Dexcom Breakout,opinion,"Five months ago   for bottom fishing in DexCom  NASDAQ DXCM  following the news of competitor s Abbott  NYSE ABT  product approval  The trade was looking shaky a few weeks later when the stock made a minor new closing low from that price collapse  November earnings produced the catalyst to confirm the bottom  and the stock was off to the races for a little over a month 
Soon after the stock started drifting downward  an analyst downgraded the stock to underperform  The selling was enough to create a breakdown below 50 day moving average  DMA  support  I stopped out my position to preserve my remaining profit   concerned that the market s response validated the analyst action  DXCM never traded lower even after cutting revenue guidance a few days later  After two months of additional consolidation  DXCM broke out on Monday 
DexCom  DXCM  printed a very bullish breakout above its 200DMA on a 6 6  gain  A close of the September gap down is now within sight 
While the volume did not surge on the breakout  the move still looks bullish given the context  an on going push to fill September s massive gap down and the contrary buying pressure in the wake of a bearish downgrade and a somewhat disappointing earnings report  On Tuesday  DXCM will appear at the Barclays Global Healthcare Conference  I assume that investors are anticipating very good news 
I received a reminder of a very simple lesson  the power of the confirmation or the lack thereof  In this trade  I was too eager to preserve my profits ahead of confirming a breakdown  A confirmation would have been a lower close  I should have used my profit to buffer against the emotional urge to react with the crowd  Moreover  the stock was over extended below its lower Bollinger Band  BB  and thus over stretched  the hurdle was high for the stampede to continue exiting the stock 
Note well DXCM s breakout needs its own confirmation  a higher close 
Be careful out there

113918,335433,DXCM,Here Are Two Pivotal Trials To Watch During Late 2017,opinion,"The next twelve months promise to be a busy period in the biotechnology sector  A number of companies are about to kick off pivotal trials that   if successful   could bring new and updated treatment options to populations for which there currently exists a large unmet need 
Here are two companies to keep an eye on near term  with a look at the treatments in question and the catalysts that could get each moving 
VBI Vaccines Inc  NASDAQ VBIV  
VBI Vaccines is a young biotechnology company that s working to bring a host of different treatments to market  most of which are rooted in a technology it calls its envelope virus like particle  eVLP  platform  The technology allows the company to create vaccine candidates  primarily preventative  but not limited to such  that stand to offer patients an improved option over the current standard of care therapies in their respective indications  The company s lead program right now is rooted in hepatitis B and it revolves around an asset called Sci B Vac 
Sci B Vac is a prophylactic vaccine that VBI hopes can compete against GlaxoSmithKline s  NYSE GSK  Engerix B  which is the vaccine that dominates this space right now  The latter has certain limitations  it s been shown to lack efficacy in immunosuppressed patients  for example  and Sci B Vac may be able to overcome these limitations and offer patients in this population an improved rate of seroprotection 
VBI has collected a large amount of safety and efficacy data from both real world administrations  the drug is already approved in a number of regions globally  but none of the major markets  and from investigator sponsored trials and the company is about to initiate a global phase III program that will underpin regulatory applications in the US  Canada and Europe  That s the plan  at least 
The program is split into two parts  one of which is further broken down into two separate  but concurrent  primary endpoints  The first part is a lot to lot study that s set up to demonstrate consistent quality  The second is a study that s designed to prove both that Sci B Vac is non inferior to Engerix B in patients ages 18 years and older  the first co primary endpoint  and that it is superior to the latter in patients ages 45 years and older  the second co primary endpoint  
The trial is pretty small for a pivotal in a vaccine indication  with VBI seeking to enroll just 4 800 patients  This is rooted in the above mentioned legacy data  which the health authorities in the regions for which VBI is targeting approval with this study have suggested they are willing to accept as part of the submission 
The trial should kick off before the end of this year and it s a fifteen month study  so catalysts derive from initiation  an interim release  which the company hasn t confirmed  but the protocol allows for at least some safety and early efficacy data after a couple of the pre planned three doses are administered  and  of course  completion and topline  The latter should hit press during the first or second quarter of 2019 
The second pivotal trial sees us switch from hepatitis to diabetes and  specifically  to a company called Tandem  NASDAQ TNDM   This one might not be immediately recognizable to some reading but there s a reason we re highlighting this one as a trial to watch   it s heavily tied to diabetes giant  DexCom Inc  NASDAQ DXCM   The latter developed and had approved its Continuous Glucose Monitor  CGM  a couple of years ago and the product is now widely used among sufferers of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes  For those not familiar with the technology  it s an implant style asset that   as the name suggests   allows for the continuous monitoring of glucose in a patient and  when combined with certain other technologies  we ll get to one in a little more detail shortly  can provide a sort of closed loop system that helps a diabetes sufferer stay on top of their disease 
Right now  one of the companies that DexCom works with and one a company that provides the secondary component of the above discussed system is Tandem Diabetes Care Inc  Tandem s technology  what s called the t slim X 2 insulin pump  combines with DexCom s CGM to administer the insulin patients need as and when they need it  The CGM monitors blood glucose  notifies the t slim pump when insulin is required and the pump does its job 
So what s under investigation 
Tandem has developed an algorithm that it believes can combine with the DexCom CGM system and its own t slim pump to improve on the stability and   by proxy   efficacy of the system  It s called the Predictive Low Glucose Suspend  PLGS  algorithm and the way it works is pretty neat  In a nutshell  it is able to predict when blood glucose levels are about to fall and pause insulin delivery accordingly  Conversely  it can predict when blood glucose levels are about to rise and can ramp up insulin delivery in anticipation of said increase 
That s the theory  at least  Right now there s plenty of mid stage data that seems to validate the tech  but this is the US biotechnology industry and  as such  the company needs to prove efficacy and  perhaps more importantly in this instance  safety as part of a large sample phase III before the algorithm can be built into the on shelf product 
And it s this pivotal that qualifies the two companies for inclusion here  The trial is actually already underway  having kicked off mid August  and it s expected to close out at some point during early 2018  It pitches the DexCom Tandem combination against the same  but with the PLGS algorithm built in  in 90 diabetes patients ages 6 and older  The endpoint on this one is the demonstration of a reduction in the percentage of CGM values below 70mg dL for patients using the algorithm based tech  as compared to the standard already approved system 
Beyond trial readout  which we can realistically expect as early as first quarter next year  the major catalyst on this one is the submission of a registration application to the FDA  which  assuming the trial hits its endpoint  should come the mid year 2018 
As a final note  it s worth touching on why this algorithm is important and why it could be a game changer for Dexcom and Tandem in this population  Stability of these sorts of automatic systems is tough to achieve when compared to manual administration insulin  A diabetes sufferer knows when he or she is going to eat  Right now  the technology doesn t  This lack of predictive technology  and by proxy  the reactive nature of the system as opposed to the predictive nature  is one of the hurdles companies like Dexcom and Tandem have to overcome in order to convince patients and physicians this is the right route  If the company can prove its algorithm is effective to the above stated aim  there s a good chance a large portion of the undecided patient population will make the switch from manual to automatic insulin ",2017-08-18,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-are-two-pivotal-trials-to-watch-during-late-2017-200208105,200208105

113927,335442,DXCM,4 MedTech Stocks To Explode In 2018,opinion,"The medical devices industry  which was once acclaimed for its high paying jobs and research and development opportunities  has been subject to the much controversial 2 3  medical device excise tax  The MedTech fraternity is leaving no stone unturned to permanently do away with the dreadful tax   but has not been able to 
Interestingly  the year 2017 has been quite an eventful one  courtesy of a series of socio political occurrences that favored the space  The year witnessed the much talked about election wherein Donald Trump took over the nation s charge as President  Not only were the new administration s health schemes thoroughly criticized but the reforms that were brought in taxation schemes became a much talked about subject  Needless to say  these developments kept investors on their toes Standing at the threshold of 2018 it is imperative for the investors thus to find the means which can dilute the macroeconomic woes and help them gain more  But before guiding you to make prudent investments for the year let s take a look at the various developments that have taken place within the space and see what awaits the investors in the coming year Health Policy Qualms to Continue in 2018   It has already been a year since trump became the President   However  his policies continue to be the most debated issue in the space  The new administration s Obamacare  repeal   replacement  effort through Congress and the latest  Executive Order   which apparently has been designed to provide quality healthcare to the nation at affordable rate  has already posed a serious threat to the healthcare community Per critics  this order  forsaking the consideration of pre existing health conditions has been designed to push people into  junk  insurance plans  The American Hospital Association has put forward an extremely bearish view on the executive order related to promote health care choice and competition  The association apprehends that the executive order will solely allow health insurance plans that cover fewer benefits and give lesser consumer protections Tax Reform May Hit Hard in 2018  According a report by Business Insider  the Republican tax plan repeals an itemized deduction that applies to healthcare expenses  If the new bill gets implemented  families with high healthcare expenditure will be impacted as these expenses will no longer be deducted from their taxes  Hence  people will no longer be interested in expensive healthcare or MedTech procedures   A report by The Hill says that the Section 4303 of the Republican tax bill plan imposes a 20  excise tax on goods manufactured overseas by subsidiaries of U S  companies  Under the U S  tax code  Puerto Rico is considered a foreign land which implies that U S  parent companies will have to pay excise taxes if they purchase from their subsidiaries in the island  In this regard  the FDA recently found that around 30  of Puerto Rico s gross domestic product was driven by pharmaceuticals and medical devices in 2016  Undoubtedly  the latest tax plan has created an uproar among MedTech players who might witness a huge reduction in their turnover with the approval of the bill Medical Device Tax Returns in 2018  The medical community was extremely hopeful about Trump s regulatory agenda as it promised to abolish the infamous 2 3  medical device tax that was first was included in the 2010 health care reform law The dreaded tax  imposed on the selling price instead of net profit and amounting to a stupendous sum  wiped out almost a quarter of the profit of medical technology companies  Realizing this  the U S  House and Senate temporarily suspended it for two years at the beginning of 2015 Going by the available data  it is quite evident that this partial two year repeal of the medical device tax has benefited the sector s development  Per data provided by the medical device trade group  in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller   within this period  there was roughly an 83  rise in research and development  R D  investments by MedTech players The Republicans however have tightlipped on this tax raising the probability of its return in 2018  Undoubtedly  its comeback will be an additional burden for the MedTech fraternity  largely discouraging R D activities  Per an article by Matt Murphy in wbur  sectors which are going to be hampered most by reimposition of this levy are X ray and MRI machines  surgical instruments and pacemakers Use of  PRO  Concept May Delay Regulatory Process in 2018  The Center for Devices and Radiological Health s  CDRH  strategic priorities have been recently published where it has elaborately discussed the Value and Use of Patient Reported Outcomes  PROs  in Assessing Effects of Medical Devices  According to a Medcitynews article by John Speer  CDRH  the umbrella organization at the FDA  talked about a plan that would entitle patients to have access to high quality  safe and effective medical devices  PRO basically means a patient s assessment of their own health status or quality of life This is especially impactful because the majority of medical devices in the United States are cleared by FDA via the 510 k  premarket submission where patients have no voice as such  With the new PRO concept  this is no longer going to be valid  Per the report   given the expected behavior of the FDA by industry  it might increase the time taken to get through the regulatory process and increase costs to produce Class II devices   This is because  now they will have to conduct some sort of PRO study if this becomes a requirement  Also they will need additional funding to support the study activities FDA User Fee Increase  May Pose a Threat  Per an Emergo Group report  the FDA s 2018 user fees  established by the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017  MDUFA IV   will increase for all registration related categories  including a sizeable fee increase for 510 k  premarket notification submissions by larger companies  In addition  FDA Establishment Registration fees will jump 37  to  4 642 for the 2018 fiscal from  3 382 in 2017  This implementation may pose a huge burden for the digital health industry and small companies in the medical device space 4 Stocks to Brave the Threats

113946,335461,DXCM,Weighing The Week Ahead  Possible Stimulus And How To Pay,opinion,"It is a short week without much new data  Even FedSpeak is on holiday  The big story will continue to be the Trump transition  I expect the punditry to be asking a dual question 
How much economic stimulus and how to pay  
Last Week
Once again  last week s economic news was nearly all good  but not the focus of discussion 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  I predicted that it would be  all Trump  all of the time   And so it was  Speculation about the effect of Trump policies is rampant  usually wrong  and revised daily  This is profitable for media sources and the punditry  so we can expect it to continue 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this   He captures the continuing rally as well as the late week weakness  despite options expiration  

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis grounded in data and several more charts providing long term perspective 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
This week s news was quite good  If I missed something for the  bad  list  please feel free to suggest it in the comments 
The Good 
Jobless claims decreased to 235K  the lowest since 1973 despite a larger labor force  Amazingly  some are looking for any modest uptick in this series to be some sign of disaster 
Heavy truck sales slump over 
OPEC might be on track for a deal on production limits  The market is skeptical  so this would be a real plus for oil prices   See also OPEC news below under  bad  
Earnings continued to show the strength we have been reporting for several weeks  The earnings recession is over 
Small business optimism is higher  Since uncertainty and weak confidence has been cited as a drag on business investment  it will be interesting if this indicator starts to show more strength 

Housing starts beat expectations with a shift from multi family to single family   has been right on target with this trend  as well as the overall growth rate 
Retail sales were strong up 0 8  on top of upward revisions for the prior month  The reports handily beat expectations  See Doug Short s Big Four update in the Quant Corner 
The Bad 
Industrial production continues to lag with a flat report instead of the small expected increase 
Pre OPEC actions  The market still seems to appreciate higher oil prices  Iran and Iraq continue to increase production in front of the meeting   But see OPEC above  

The Ugly 
Fake News   and the reaction  The bogus news sites had  during the election campaign  This led Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  to   prohibiting sites that traffic in lies to make money 
Do we need social media sites as editors  deciding what is fake and what is not  Izabella Kaminska explains the consequences 

The rot at the core of media has little to do with the propagation of fake news on the fringes  Alternative news sites and underground press with questionable journalistic practices have been a phenomenon since forever  In free societies  the public sphere tolerates single issue publishers  special interest groups or anti establishment newsletters  because we know that for every outlet which propagates nonsense there s another that might be ahead of the curve on a topic of great cultural  commercial or political significance 


Accepting the fringes   which includes fake news   is what liberty and a free press is about  It s our greatest strength  especially when positioned within the constructs of a fair and reasonable slander  libel and defamation framework  Suppressing marginal views is not the answer 

Tyler Cowen  that this is little different from misleading forwarded emails 
There is no easy answer  but we must start by asking whether it is really a problem  We expect consumers of information to discriminate 
The investment world has seen an avalanche of lies and deceptive information from the most popular sites  The lesson from losing money does not seem to have much effect  This is a bad omen for issues where there are less direct financial consequences 
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  No award this week  Nominations are welcome 
The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar 
We have a normal week for economic data  with most of the reports concentrated on two days before the holiday 
The  A  List 
New home sales  W   Important sector for improved economic growth 
Michigan sentiment  W   Strength continuing after the election 
FOMC minutes  W   Probably no surprise  Confirmation of a tilt to a hike in December 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
The  B  List 
Existing home sales  T   Not as important as new homes  but still a good read on the market 
Durable goods  W   Volatile series  Any signs of strength in a sluggish sector 
Crude inventories  W   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 
Earnings season is ending  The limited Fedspeak is early in the week 
Next Week s Theme 
This should be a very quiet week  There is little data  Most of the A Teamers will be taking some time off   Not me  A competitor used to suggest  Talk to Chuck   He must have been hard to get on the line  but you can still  Talk to Jeff    We can expect more Trump speculation from the B Team  It can t be worse than we have already seen 
Analyzing the Trump effects requires a good analytic framework and a non political approach  I hope these concepts will be familiar to regular readers  I was delighted to read a great piece from Prof  Aswath Damodaran  covering both themes  He produces this excellent diagram 

That is a lot on the plate for the punditry  It is all requiring some digestion   Sorry  I can t help it  At least I took it out of the title  
I expect the initial focus to be on taxing and spending 
How large will the stimulus be  and how will it be financed 
I am always delighted when a theme I am working on is delivered to me in Barron s on Saturday morning  Their cover story is  The argument is very good and this chart is especially helpful 

Barry Ritholtz joins in  suggesting what he calls     He offers many points supporting the desirability and probability of a major debt refinancing 
There is a lot of complexity facing investors  Right now  the stimulus plan is probably the most important  As usual  I ll have a few ideas of my own in today s  Final Thoughts

Best of the Week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be Bill McBride s cold water splash in the face for those who have been spending too much time on the wrong sites    It is a nice  objective summary of overall conditions  His summary hits the high spots  citing the relevant data and providing his customary charts  Here is his conclusion 
Sure  there are problems  Not everyone has participated in the current expansion  Wealth and income inequality are record extremes  There is too much student debt  And climate change is posing a real threat to the economy in the future  I could offer proposals to address those issues without negatively impacting the current expansion  and we will see if those issues are addressed in the coming years 
However  the bottom line is the cupboard is full  The expansion should continue for some time  What could possibly go wrong 
Here is an example of the several helpful charts  how population will drive housing expansion 


Meanwhile  plenty of financial  cyclical  technology  and homebuilding stocks are trading at recession pricing 

Backing up this conclusion is  yet another  great entry by  Davidson  via   He emphasizes the significance of single family housing for the overall economy  Here is a key quote 

Housing Starts and financing go hand in hand  The T Bill U S  10 Year Treas spread used by banks in mtg lending decisions narrowed to 1 2  in July 2016 indicating a potential slowing in housing which this data reflects  This morning this spread has widened rapidly since the election to 1 8  and the trend looks higher  10yr rates should continue to rise faster than T Bills and this will confound many forecasters 


The election of Trump has not yet been factored into housing  I would buy Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL  and Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN  at current levels with their excellent CEOs  Single Family Housing starts should be higher by June 2017 after Trump strips away some of the impediments to mtg lending

Seeking Alpha Editor Gil Weinreich s Financial Advisors  Daily Digest is a must read for financial professionals  The topics are frequently important for active individual investors  That is especially true this week as he highlights key questions  among others  about what advisors do and their   I especially  with analysis and links you can use to see whether you would benefit from an advisor  Here is a key quote 

A true leader educates clients on what are the key principles that should define their financial decision making  how does one invest  how one can increase his savings rate  spending restraint  etc  The best advisors do this  The worst follow the same trends as Johnny come lately investors  I still recall Wall Street Journal articles in the aftermath of the dot bomb detailing how many brokers made it big promising the moon and stars to all too eager clients 

This is very true  In my first interview with clients I try to align expectations with reality  especially in keeping risk under control  One woman had  2 million to invest and needed to turn it into  6 million in three years  I suppose she found someone who told her that he would do that

Market Outlook 
Plenty of sources  mostly of the permabear variety  cited low interest rates as bad news for stocks  Now that rates are moving higher  that is also supposed to be a negative  Scott Grannis effectively explains this relationship   
I ve been arguing for years that higher interest rates won t be a problem  since they would be symptomatic of stronger growth  Higher rates won t lead to an exploding deficit  because the stronger growth that pushes interest rates higher will also work to reduce the deficit by boosting tax revenues  Interest rates have been low because the market has had a very pessimistic view of the future growth potential of the U S  economy 
I agree 
Watch out for  
 Cheap  put protection  The oft cited advice to buy puts when markets are calm is 
Mixing up your politics and your evaluation of the business cycle     
Coal stocks  The President elect may not be able to deliver on this front as along as natural gas prices are so low    
Final Thoughts 
The stimulus infrastructure theme is getting a lot of attention   of the needs  labor shortages  and implementation problems 
My conclusion is that something major on infrastructure needs will be approved  Here are three key reasons 
Congress loves to spend money and point to the effects in specific districts 
It is easy to imagine a bipartisan coalition  This week showed support from the GOP side via Barron s and the Dem side via Barry Ritholtz  The philosophies are in alignment 
It is the right thing to do  There are important needs  The exact term of new bonds is up for debate  but locking in low rates seems pretty obvious 
Time Frames encourage a wide range of conclusions  Many are predicting that Trump policies will all end badly   eventually 
Moody s Mark Zandi has  

The firm s  outlook for the U S  and global economies has been shaken up by the shocking election of Donald Trump as president of the United States   writes Zandi in the firm s latest monthly economic outlook   Based on our analysis to date  the economy under President Trump will likely perform a bit better in the near term but ultimately it will be diminished  


Zandi is projecting that GDP growth under four years of President Trump will be less than 2  per year  below the 2 2  he had been forecasting before the election   That is not a big difference in any given year  but it is meaningful over a four year period   writes Zandi 

Ed Yardeni  in a thoughtful analysis  asks     His analysis does not have an easy conclusion  but deserves some thought about each point 
 increasing inequality  paving the road to ruin  He sees skewed tax effects and a shortage of skilled tradespeople for proposed programs 
My own perspective for investors is about one year ahead  None of the key issues permit longer forecasts  The immediate stimulus effects will be positive  Investors should do a regular reassessment of progress 
Digestion  There is plenty to do  Here are the key issue areas in my planning for the Trump administration  Each requires study of political dynamics as well as overall impact  Most of the punditry is still reaching far beyond what they know  writing on deadline  driving too fast for the reach of their headlights  
I am starting with the most general and important themes  I welcome suggestions about interesting topics or themes I have omitted  In each case I am evaluating probabilities  impacts  and stocks affected

Infrastructure
Tax cuts
Financing

Health stocks   biotechs  pharma  insurance  hospitals   all different

113948,335463,DXCM,4 Stocks To Watch Today  CPE  SLCA  COO  MELI ,opinion,"The stock market had a very tough session on Wednesday  They had a pop at the opening  and then the S P 500 rolled over in a 5 wave decline and took the Nasdaq 100 with it  However  some of our stocks did do well  We are going to take a look at both longs and shorts here  so you ll get to see both 
Callon Petroleum Company  NYSE CPE   one of our favorites  has a long channel of waves with the fifth wave up underway  up 3 19  or 22   to 17 64  on 11 5 million shares traded on Wednesday  It could very well reach 20 21  which is our original target  With the overall structure of the big base that was broken  it may very well get into the high 20 s  or thereabout 
U S  US Silica Holdings Inc  NYSE SLCA   a swing trade of ours and an old favorite  was up 5 42  or 12   to 50 61  on 6 million shares traded on Wednesday  It made a significant move out of a wedge pattern and hit a new high at 51 31  What is beckoning to me  is something in the high 50 s 
Stocks on the Short Side   
The Cooper Companies Inc  NYSE COO  really got smacked down 5 66  or 3 33   to 164 49  on 1 36 million shares traded  The top pattern of this chart has been completed  it formed a bear flag  another bear flat  a bear wedge  and then had a breakdown on Wednesday  I think this may lead to a test of at least 158 00  but more than likely  we ll see a test of 150 00 
MercadoLibre Inc  NASDAQ MELI  looks like it may have broken its bear flag on Wednesday  It formed a top  broke down  formed a rising bear flag to resistance  and then rolled over  dropping 5 09  or 3   to 157 82  on 2 7 million shares traded  I m looking to see if it can test 145 00  and then head down toward 125 00

Cemtrex Inc  NASDAQ CETX  has had a nice little move since the swing trade  It popped  pulled back  formed a wedge  exploded out of the wedge  formed a breakaway gap  and ran up  On Tuesday  it was up 67 cents  or 9   to 8 05  on 1 9 million shares traded  My target is 8 8 1 4  It s already up in my target zone  so I would look for some pullback consolidation  Ultimately  this could be a stock that reaches in the low teens  maybe 12 or 13 
Depomed Inc  NASDAQ DEPO   on rumors of a takeover  popped 2 32  or 13   to 20 34  on 6 million shares traded on Tuesday  and closed at the upper end of the range  Key resistance now lies at about 21 1 2  Watch the gap and double top  If it gets through that  look for it to be a 24 1 2 25 dollar stock  It has 9 5  
Geo Group Inc  NYSE GEO  extended its move and broke out  up 50 cents  or 1 39   to 36 43  on 648 589 shares traded on Tuesday  Its volume needs to be a little bit better  but it looks like it s making a run up towards 371 2 38 short term  and then 40 intermediate term  There s 3 28  
Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ SUPN  may be on the verge of coming out of a wedge  On Tuesday  it popped up through  up 70 cents  or 2 77   to 25 95  on 365 319 shares traded  If it can get the volume up to about 400 000  this stock could be a 32 34 dollar stock

113955,335470,DXCM,Dexcom Shares  Potential Rise In The Next 3 Years,opinion,"Recently  shares of the DexCom Inc  NASDAQ DXCM  have probably made the bottom and started a new uptrend  Dexcom is a medical device company  The company is focused on the development of continuous glucose monitoring systems  Let s look at the price movement of this stock  which is traded at  85 13 now  from the technical point of view  Here is the monthly chart 

Clear motive Elliott Wave structure
There is a pretty clear and obvious motive Elliott Wave structure here  started in 2009  The top of the wave 1 occured in April 2011  followed by the mid term downtrend presented by the wave 2  a zigzag pattern   which was ended in November 2011 
After that  the motive wave 3 took place till September 2015  And in the September 2015   December 2016 period we can see the wave 4 that seems like a  running flat  correction pattern  There is a high possibility that the new motive wave 5 is beginning right now  Everything fits into a correct trend channel  Here is a motive Elliot Wave structure with a channel shown schematically  
Wave symmetry
Wave 1 had 1 147  growth and 29 months length  Wave 3 had 1 417  growth and 46 months length  The coming wave 5 should have the same or comparable percentage of growth and the same or comparable length  So there is a high possibility of at least 1 100  growth in the next 3 years  compared to the recent bottom at  57  The calculated price target is around  600 by 2020 
Trend channel
By the trend channel rules  we can see the similar price and time targets 

The price is likely to make the next top at the upper line of the trend channel  which shows us   680 somewhere in 2020  Moreover  the trend channel can help us to recognize early if the forecast is incorrect  in the unlikely case the price fails to reach the target and falls below the lower line of the trend channel  then this wave structure will become invalid and we need to re analyse it and get out of the market 
The year 2020  Again 
Dexcom is another asset that is gonna have long term reversal in 2020  See my previous articles

Broadcom  O BRCM 
Broadcom  BRCM  had been moving higher off of an October 2014 low until it spiked in May  That spike sold off  making a low with the market in August  Now it has hit resistance and backed off to a higher low and is rising again toward resistance  The RSI is rising and in the bullish zone along with the MACD  Watch for a push through resistance 
CF Industries  N CF 
CF Industries  CF  started lower in July in a falling wedge  These are often thought of as bullish  but it broke the wedge to the downside  It made a low at the end of September and consolidated a few days before a strong thrust higher  Now it is at resistance and making a series of higher lows  The RSI is rising and on the edge of a move into the bullish zone with the MACD rising 
DexCom  O DXCM 
DexCom  DXCM  was a pharma favorite all of 2015 until the August meltdown  The stock quickly recovered making a new high before the pharma biotech sell off of September brought it down 30   It has bounced off of that and built a small bull flag  Friday saw it push through the top of that flag  The RSI is at the mid line after a bounce off of oversold levels as the MACD is crossed up and rising 
FirstMerit  O FMER 
FirstMerit  FMER  ran higher to a peak in June  The pullback from there found a bottom with the market in August and has been consolidating since  Friday saw a push through the important 18 30 level and to the 200 day SMA  The RSI is moving into the bullish zone and the MACD is rising  both supporting continued upside 
JB Hunt Transport Services  O JBHT 
JB Hunt Transport Services  JBHT  traveled lower in a falling channel until it pulled off that road to the downside when the market sank in August  Since making a low  it has bounced in a wide range against resistance  It is back against resistance again and has support for a push through to the upside from the rising and bullish RSI and MACD

113972,335487,DXCM,5 Stocks To Watch  DBD  DXCM  ITW  LUV  OSK,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Diebold  N DBD 
Diebold started a move lower after topping in June over 38 on a big one day move  After a 255 drawdown  it bounced in a  W  fashion  finally heading higher to start October  The move touched the prior high area near 38 but pulled back again  This time it was a shallow pullback though and Friday found the price back at resistance on strong volume  The RSI turned back higher at the mid line and is bullish  while the MACD is about to cross up  Both support more upside 
DexCom  O DXCM 
DexCom had a long run higher until topping over 102 in September  It pulled back hard with all healthcare related stocks in September finding a bottom after breaking through the 200 day SMA  Since then  it has moved back higher as consolidated at resistance  This price level was important as resistance in August and then support in September  Many battles here  The RSI is trying to move up off of the mid line while the MACD has turned flat after rising to zero  Look for a break higher to participate 
Illinois Tool Works  N ITW 
Illinois Tool Works went through a long channel lower from March through August before  exploding to the downside with the market at the end of August  After some consolidation  it started back higher in October and is now back at resistance  The RSI is rising and bullish and the MACD is about to cross up  The Bollinger Bands  are starting to open after a squeeze as well  A break above resistance could run to new highs 
Southwest Airlines  N LUV 
Southwest Airlines had a strong run higher from a base at  8 from the end of 2012  Bags fly free is apparently winning some business  But as the calendar turned into 2015  it started a pullback  The stock retraced 38 2  of the move up and then started back higher  Last week it had made it back to resistance again  and started a small pullback  Momentum is supportive with the RSI in the bullish zone  having reset and turning back higher  The MACD has pulled back a bit and a turn higher would also confirm the upside 
Oshkosh  N OSK 
Oshkosh pulled back from a double top at 55 in May  It made a double bottom in August and has been consolidating since against resistance  The RSI is trending higher as it consolidates along with the MACD rising  A break over the top triggers a trade opportunity  with a more conservative entry over the 200 day SMA 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the shortened Thanksgiving Holiday week sees the equity markets have moved strongly higher maybe a bit too fast in the short run 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue lower while crude oil consolidates in its downtrend  The US dollar index is consolidating with an upward bias and US Treasuries are moving higher in the consolidation range  The Shanghai Composite looks ready to resume the move higher out of consolidation and Emerging Markets are biased to the upside short term in their downtrend  Volatility looks to remain low adding some wind to the backs of the equity index ETFs N SPY  N IWM and O QQQ 
Their charts look good in the short term  with the SPY and QQQ moving higher and the IWM biased higher in consolidation  Longer term  the SPY and QQQ look ready to attack their all time highs  while the IWM lags behind  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

113978,335493,DXCM,The Week Ahead  Has The Rotation From Bonds To Stocks Begun ,opinion,"We have a normal week for economic data  and a big week for earnings reports  The last Presidential debate will grab headlines  We have been monitoring these factors for weeks  but something new is showing up in the data  Let s call it a  stealth rotation  from bonds to stocks and from bond substitutes to less favored stocks  If the punditry carefully watches the data  they will be asking 
Has a market rotation begun  
Last Week
Last week s news was pretty good  despite the negative reaction in stocks 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  I predicted special attention to the early earnings reports and questions about whether the earnings recession was ending  That was a reasonable guess  although most of the commentary seemed to focus on a couple of big earnings misses  There was also plenty of competition from some surprising China data  the ongoing Fed debate  and of course  the election news 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this  from Doug Short  Stocks had a negative week  You can see the opening gap on Thursday after the Chinese trade data  and also Friday s failed rally 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all of the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis grounded in data and several more charts providing long term perspective 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
The Good 
JOLTS continues to show a solid labor market  Chair Yellen uses it as a signal for a tight labor market  The healthy  quit rate  shows that many people are comfortable in voluntarily leaving jobs  Some reports focused strictly on the number of job openings  which is a poor use of the data 

Initial jobless claims also show labor market strength 

Retail sales provided the week s best economic news  rising 0 6   the best increase in three months    
Corporate earnings nicely beat expectations   has some interesting early data   76  of the reporting companies have beaten earnings expectations and 62  have beaten on sales 



The Bad 
Import container counts are again lower  Steven Hansen    smooths out the effects of the Hanjin Shipping bankruptcy and finds a troubling trend  Does it portend weak holiday spending  The chart below is the year over year change in the three month moving average 

Chinese exports and imports both declined more than expected 
Q3 GDP estimates edge lower as more data is reported   summarizes the move from various sources  Here is one example 

Michigan consumer sentiment slips to 87 9 in the October preliminary report   updates the story and the terrific Doug Short chart combining multiple elements of the story in a single look 

The Ugly 
The political sideshow  There were polls to determine the  winner  of the debate  Not so long ago debates were seen as a way for the trailing candidate to show equality of stature   same stage  same rules  etc  Many challengers have used this effectively  It is also a way to demonstrate that a  Presidential  image  If an expert from years ago  without any context  read the transcript of this  town hall forum  debate s he would not believe it  Campaigns are ever more focused on the undecided or uncommitted voters  especially in the key states  Suppose for a moment that these voters may not have been the ones sitting at the front of the class  What do we expect the campaigns to do  The sound bite negative ads are one approach  but this is reaching a whole new level   and not a high one 
The most important thing you can do as an investor is to vote your conscience while still using sound  unemotional judgement concerning your personal finances 
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  No award this week  Nominations welcome  I also note that Dr  Ed Yardeni joined us in applauding the  on CAPE  Dr  Ed provides his own thoughts about market valuation and the advantages of forward earnings 

I am not a fan of valuation measures based on trailing earnings  especially if they trail over the past 10 years  I believe that the stock market is forward looking and discounts analysts  consensus expectations for earnings over the year ahead  More specifically  I use S P 500 12 month forward consensus expected operating earnings  which is a time weighted average of analysts  expectations for the current year and the coming one 

The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar 
We have a fairly big week for economic data  as well as earnings reports  I watch everything on the calendar  so you do not need to  Check out WTWA to focus on what is really important   and ignore the noise 
The  A  List 
Housing starts and building permits  W   Important forward looking data on a crucial sector 
Industrial production  M   Volatile September data  Any sign of a rebound from last month s loss 
Fed Beige Book  W   Prepared for the next FOMC meeting  this provides color from each Fed district  going beyond the data 
Leading indicators  Th   Widely followed  despite some controversy  Rebound expected from last month s negative reading 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
The  B  List 
Existing home sales  Th   Without the impact of new homes  but still a good read on the overall housing market 
CPI  T   Inflation is still not very important  and it will not be until there are a few higher months 
Philly Fed  Th   Has earned some respect as one of the few regional indicators that can move markets  The first October data 
Crude inventories  W   Often has a significant impact on oil markets  a focal point for traders of everything 
More important than the economic data will be continuing earnings news 
Next Week s Theme 
The Presidential campaign and the final debate continue to dominate the news  The regular economic data this week include important leading indicators about housing  These will not get the attention deserved  Corporate earnings reports will also get some attention  but the emphasis seems to be on spectacular  misses   Did you even realize that the earnings season is positive so far  Unless you look at the FactSet data  you would not know 
Through this haze there have been a few glimmers of a new trend  If you are alert  you will see more attention to the question 
Has a market rotation begun  
There is some evidence 
The 10 year note has moved noticeably higher while the yield curve has steepened 
Utilities are losing ground while banks are gaining  Brian Gilmartin astutely asks  whether banks are assuming that role 
Economic skepticism remains intense   but perhaps the result of the election  Chris Matthews    notes that concern about the economy has grown even as data show improvement 

 a voter s political beliefs and the overall political environment instead drives how they feel about their economic circumstances 


There s no better way to interpret the latest results from the latest Marketplace Edison Research Poll   of Americans are very fearful they will lose their job in the next six months  up 10  from last year 


And also  

A particularly telling figure in this year s survey  While 37  of those surveyed said their personal economic situation has improved over the past year versus 21 5  who said it got worse just 30 3  said the overall economy improved  What s more  36 9  said it got worse 


If more people s financial situation improved than deteriorated  why do more people think it s the opposite for the economy in general 

As always  I ll have a few ideas of my own in the conclusion 
Quant Corner 
We follow some regular great sources and also the best insights from each week 
Risk Analysis 
Whether you are a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  Think first about your risk  Only then should you consider possible rewards  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update 
The Indicator Snapshot 

The Featured Sources

Brian Gilmartin  Analysis of  for the overall market as well as coverage of many individual companies 
Doug Short  The Big Four Update  the World Markets Weekend Update  and much more  
RecessionAlert  Many  for both economic and market analysis  While we feature his recession analysis  Dwaine also has a number of interesting approaches to asset allocation 
Georg Vrba  The   and much more   for an array of interesting methods  Georg  Bob Dieli s enhanced aggregate spread  considering when it might first give a recession signal  Georg thinks it is still a year away  It is interesting to watch this approach along with our weekly monitoring of the C Score  This week  his unemployment based indicator  still not signaling a recession as you can see from the chart below 
 that the ECRI s growth index remains solid  despite a marginal fall last week  Meanwhile  the ECRI continues its prediction of  stagflation lite  and Fed criticism 
This is a good time to review the    vastly superior to anecdotes and headlines

Best of the Week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be  of a client question about real estate versus stocks  In a generic sense  it is a common question faced by nearly everyone  Neal realizes that everyone s situation differs  Using the couple s investment goals and time frame  he compares three alternative choices  From this analysis one of the choices is easily eliminated  It is an excellent demonstration of sound contextual analysis  To appreciate the result  you should read the whole post  Here is an intriguing chart 

Stock Ideas 
Chuck Carnevale s most recent idea is CVS Health Corporation  NYSE CVS   His analysis shows that the stock has moved from overvalued territory to fair value   and with plenty of upside 
Our newest trading model  Holmes  has joined our other models in a weekly market discussion  Each one has a different  personality  and I get to be the human doing fundamental analysis  We have an enjoyable discussion every week  with four or five specific ideas that we are also buying  This week Holmes likes Dexcom  DexCom Inc  NASDAQ DXCM    Check out the post for my own reaction  And his choice from last week  Air Products and Chemicals  NYSE APD   has now been endorsed by Athena  Check out the post to see the other picks  ask questions  and choose your favorite model

Market Outlook 
Mark Hulbert notes the seasonal strength typical of year s end  Could there be a    
Final Thoughts 
There is a continuing gap between perception and reality when it comes to economic progress and risks  This has translated into extremely defensive investment decisions  emphasizing anything that seems to provide yield  The incessant political accusations have made this worse 
The resulting environment encourages stories   even by unbiased journalists   seizing upon the dramatic  I am seeing the  R word  thrown around much more often  and by people without any special experience or track record 
The developing market rotation is still some weeks away from popular recognition  but there are signs it is getting closer  This  is well worth watching  Lee s market read and forecasts have been excellent for years  He has remained bullish  and for the right reasons  I am encouraged when I see him commenting on the themes that I am also seeing

113980,335495,DXCM,Stock Exchange  Great Chart Ideas Include WB  DDD  DXCM  and APD,opinion,"Each week Felix and Oscar host a poker game  We listen in on current trading ideas in the few minutes before the game starts  They like to call this their  Stock Exchange   I am the only human present  and the only one using fundamental analysis  Their methods are excellent  as you will learn if you join us for a few weeks  Since the time frames and risk profiles differ  so do the stock ideas 
Do the markets predict future events  Or should you use fundamentals to predict the markets  
That is an ongoing debate at the Stock Exchange 
This Week s Ideas 
Our technical experts have some very aggressive ideas this week 
Felix 
I look for long term themes  and I have a great one this week  This week I am revisiting technology  specifically Weibo Corp  NASDAQ WB   There are not too many social media platforms that are available for trading  but this is one that is  we hear  popular in China  It sounds pretty interesting and maybe  if not  already  will show up here soon 
Just look at the chart  What a strong momentum play   

Our question for this week s post is from  of SeekingAlpha  as follows 

I really appreciate your work Jeff  and group   Felix  and Jeff   I am wrestling with my current position in BMY   should I stay or should I go 

Felix responds 
BMY is on my sell list  a negative rating   There are many better choices 
 Jeff  The 20 multiple is pretty rich for the stodgy recent growth rate  3  dividend is OK  If the expected earnings growth for 2016 17 comes through  it is probably fairly valued  I agree with Felix that there are better choices 
 Felix  Please keep your questions coming  I could use the overtime pay 
Oscar 
It seems like every week that we have some crashing  dynamic stock that we can liken to a pinch hitter or an offensive lineman  My choice for this week is a change of pace  Take a look at the moving averages on 3D Systems Corporation  NYSE DDD  below  This reminds me of the long  smooth strokes you see from the US Olympic Rowing team  Sure  it may not be as exciting as the MLB Division series   but it sure is pretty  Here we ve got steady  sustainable growth from a major name in the broader sector of 3D printing  What s not to like  The chart is very encouraging  Breakout coming 

 Jeff  With a PE over 40  this might be breaking hearts rather than breaking out  This makes sense only as a speculation 
 Oscar  I am good at speculating 
Holmes 
I am the rebounding specialist  Here is a  fetching  opportunity  Dexcom  DexCom Inc  NASDAQ DXCM   hit an all time high around 97 in September of 2015  sold off to a low of 53 before rebounding back to 95  this most recent sell off gives us a nice technical entry into this name looking for a run back to 95  with a stop around the 200d MA  75 17  

 Jeff  Do you know what it means when you look for the multiple on a stock and see  NMF  
 Holmes  What s a multiple 
 Jeff  It stands for  not meaningful   You see it when a stock has no earnings  It is important for determining value 
 Holmes  I get paid nicely for stock rebounds whether there are earnings or not  The chart tells the story 
Athena 
I have a very interesting choice this week  Air Products and Chemicals  NYSE APD  
 Jeff  That has a familiar sound  Didn t we just discuss that pick 
 Holmes  Yes  It was my choice last week  She is copying  I was stopped out with a small loss 
 Jeff  I did not care for it last week  and I still don t  The price is a bit lower  but not low enough for me 
 Athena  I need not copy from humans and dogs  The Holmes rebound play did not work  APD fits my style just fine  My average holding period is about four months  We can revisit this after some time  Here is the updated chart 

Questions 
If you want an opinion about a specific stock or sector  even those we did not mention  just ask  Put questions in the comments  Address them to a specific expert if you wish  Each has a specialty  Who is your favorite   You are allowed to choose me  although my feelings will not be hurt very much if you prefer one of the models  
Cast of Characters
Felix is fussy  precise  and very cautious  He looks for what is working  but it also must have upside potential  He is an investor who thinks long term  Felix will not usually announce new picks  but he will answer questions  saying what he thinks about specific stocks  He will also comment on favorite themes and sectors 
Oscar is naturally optimistic and a bit excitable  He definitely likes to go with winners  and focuses on a one month time frame  He trades either sector ETFs  or a basket of stocks  equally weighted  that reflect a sector  Oscar will mention a favorite sector each week  and will also answer questions about sectors 
Holmes is a trader  but a cautious one  Holmes emphasizes asset protection through profit taking  stops  and trailing stops  He is careful in selecting new positions  and generally looks at an intermediate time frame  While he does not know the definition of  mean reversion  he loves rebounds  There is no set holding period  but two or three months is not unusual  Holmes will tell us one stock recommended that week  For those who sign up for his email list  no charge  privacy respected  holmes at newarc dot com  he will report exits with a one day delay 
Athena trades more frequently than the others  but still limits risk  Her inspiration helps to find good ideas  Her excellent quant skills find attractive risk reward opportunities  Her wisdom leads her to exit trades that are not working  Athena will provide a new idea each week 
Jeff usually has some comments about stock or market fundamentals  Unlike the other witty participants  he sounds like an old prof 
An Important Note to Readers   from Jeff 
All of the characters  except me   are models  carefully engineered and tested by one of the leading developers of the last thirty years  I humanize them to make it easier to understand the characteristics in their design  I always remind readers that my posts are informational  not investment advice  and that is especially true here   While we are trading based upon all four models  we are always watching and can act quickly when necessary  The models are not suitable for all investors  If you like the approach  reach out to us  info at newarc dot com  and we will provide more information
