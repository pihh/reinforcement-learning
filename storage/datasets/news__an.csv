106687,328202,AN,Four senior executives leave AutoNation amid restructuring  bleak outlook,news," This January 7 story corrects headline to clarify four senior executives are leaving the company  not its four top executives  
 Reuters    AutoNation Inc  NYSE AN  said on Monday four senior executives including chief operating officer are leaving the company as it restructures to cut costs and expects automotive retail to be challenging this year 
The top U S  auto retailer is consolidating its regional structure from three regions to two and expects the restructuring to save about  50 million annually  it said 
AutoNation said COO Lance Iserman and Chief Technology Officer Tom Conophy will leave effective immediately  while its chief human resource officer  Dennis Berger  will leave at the end of the month 
Fort Lauderdale  Florida based AutoNation appointed company veteran James Bender as executive vice president of sales 
It also said Donna Parlapiano  executive vice president  franchise network  merger   acquisitions  and corporate real estate  elected to retire on Jan  3 
The restructuring comes as analysts forecast a dip in U S  vehicle sales this year  New vehicle sales in the United States are expected to drop as higher interest rates and rising prices could prompt customers to hold off their car buying plans  the National Automobile Dealers Association said last month 
Recently  the company introduced a used car subscription service from auto leasing startup Fair through its network of more than 300 U S  dealers 
In October  CEO Mike Jackson told Reuters the company planned to reduce investment following an  elevated period of brand extension investment  in higher margin service and used car operations to offset the squeeze on profits from new vehicle sales 
AutoNation did not immediately respond to a query about any potential job cuts due to the restructuring ",2019-02-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/four-senior-executives-leave-autonation-amid-restructuring-bleak-outlook-1767946,1767946

DETROIT  Reuters    AutoNation Inc  N AN   the largest U S  auto dealership chain  on Monday named a new chief executive four months after picking someone else for the position  while posting a stronger than expected quarterly profit

LOS ANGELES  Reuters     United Parcel  Service Inc  NYSE UPS  on Wednesday said it is ordering 10 000 electric delivery trucks from the UK based Arrival Ltd and teaming with self driving startup Waymo as package carriers work to cut costs and tail pipe pollution 
The UPS Arrival partnership includes a minority investment from the world s biggest package delivery firm and lands four months after customer turned rival Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  ordered 100 000 electric vans from Rivian  a Michigan startup partially funded by the world s largest online retailer 
Its six month test with Waymo  the self driving unit of Google parent Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc  starts next month  UPS will pay Waymo to use autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans to shuttle packages from Phoenix UPS stores to a nearby sorting center several times a day  starting with one route 
The Arrival and Waymo projects  will help us continue to push the envelope on technology and new delivery models that can complement the way our drivers work   Juan Perez  chief information and engineering officer at UPS  said 
Amazon s growing delivery network is piling pressure on UPS and rival FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX   which are racing to squeeze more profits from surging e commerce deliveries that are upending their business models 
Electric vehicles have no tailpipe pollution   which is critical as more cities worldwide crack down on emissions from idling delivery vehicles  Broad corporate adoption of electric vehicles could cut sticker prices and make them cheaper to operate and maintain than fossil fuel burning vehicles  Eventually  removing human drivers might cut costs further 
Perez said the Waymo test will not replace the driver on the affected route  That driver will still make the scheduled daily UPS Store stop

Atlanta based UPS plans to take ownership of all 10 000 Arrival zero emission electric vehicles by 2025  The first trucks should hit streets in Paris  London and undisclosed U S  cities in the second half of this year 
The Arrival trucks have a modular design that promises to be cheaper to build  maintain and customize 
Vehicle components are swappable and designed to be changed in 15 minutes or less  For example  left and right headlights are the same and can be installed in any size truck   almost like putting Legos together   said Scott Phillippi  senior director of automotive maintenance and engineering at UPS

Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising  Notably  AutoNation has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   We expect an in line return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-11-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/autonation-an-up-08-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-continue-200488751,200488751
106699,328214,AN,Why AutoNation  AN  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider AutoNation  NYSE AN   This company  which is in the Zacks Automotive   Retail and Whole Sales industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This auto retailer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8 71  
For the most recent quarter  AutoNation was expected to post earnings of  1 11 per share  but it reported  1 18 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 31   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 08 per share  while it actually produced  1 20 per share  a surprise of 11 11  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for AutoNation lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
AutoNation has an Earnings ESP of  13 54  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 11  2020 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-autonation-an-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200501507,200501507
113419,334934,AN,Avis steers into crowded field for managing ride services fleets,news,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT  Reuters    When  Avis Budget  Group Inc  O CAR  reports its results on Wednesday  executives under pressure from restive shareholders will likely point to the potential for profits from managing fleets of vehicles for ride services and robo taxi companies 
Avis  however  won t be alone in chasing revenue from the same ride service companies that are undermining the rental car business 
Fleet management is a catch all term for a complex suite of services ranging from financing car purchases to maintaining  cleaning  fuelling  repairing and selling used vehicles 
Fleet managers use real time data to track vehicles for customers like Uber Technologies Inc  UBER UL   Lyft and General Motors Co s  N GM  Maven to maximum vehicle usage and cut down on the downtime that leads to lost revenue on expensive assets 
 Saying  I want to go into fleet management  is easy   said Hans Werner Kaas  a senior partner at McKinsey   Company s Detroit office   But fleet management is very capital intensive and is different from what many of those companies do today  
Even Element Fleet Management Corp  TO EFN   an established fleet manager  has stumbled recently with an expensive  complex big data platform deployed to manage large vehicle fleets 
Element manages more than 1 million vehicles for corporate customers and spent  70 million on a big data driven platform for customers using artificial intelligence and predictive analytics 
But the system s glitches cost Element s former chief executive his job and helped send the company s shares down more than 50 percent this year  Element said it is fixing the problems and will spend  35 million more in 2018 on product enhancements 
 The bumps we ve had in rolling out a new platform is indicative of the complexity of pivoting to new transportation models that are still being invented   said Michele Cunningham  Element s senior vice president for products and services 
CONFRONTING THREATS
Years of heavy U S  automobile sales have depressed used car values  hurting Avis and others that depend on selling vehicles into the secondary market  Avis is trying to beef up prices but said last month that  unexpected pricing and fleet cost challenges  have cost it  300 million over the last two years 
It expects to post 2017 adjusted pre tax income nearly 13 percent lower than in 2016 
The company s largest shareholder  SRS Investment Management LLC  has proposed three new nominees for Avis  board and said it must formulate  top strategic priorities  to confront a present threat from Uber and Lyft  and a future threat from robo taxi operators such as Alphabet Inc s  O GOOGL  Waymo or GM s Cruise 
Avis owns ride sharing service Zipcar  which rents cars to Uber drivers  and last June announced a service agreement for Waymo s self driving car fleet starting in Phoenix  sending its shares soaring 
Avis is testing a fleet of connected cars in Kansas City to build fleet management expertise and  to see how we can do this for others as well   Chief Executive Officer Larry De Shon said 
Stanford economist Tony Seba and tech investor James Arbib estimate that self driving cars in  transportation as a service  will grow from zero U S  passenger miles in 2020 versus traditionally owned vehicles to 95 percent of the 6 1 trillion passenger miles in 2030   For a graphic  see   
The fleets required for those services mean  a lot of money on the table  for fleet managers  said Doug Mehl  a partner in A T  Kearney s automotive practice 
That potential is drawing a crowd 
Avis rivals  Hertz Global Holdings Inc   N HTZ  and Enterprise Holdings Inc are staking out positions in fleet management  as are car auction giants Manheim and  KAR Auction Services Inc   N KAR   which already have facilities to handle millions of used vehicles annually 
KAR said this month it was buying fleet management software company STRATIM to enter the business 
Manheim is talking to partners about larger fleets and expects to invest in new facilities in the next three years as demand grows  said Grace Huang  president of inventory solutions at Cox Automotive  Manheim s parent company 
Car dealers want in as well  AutoNation Inc  N AN  last November signed a service agreement with Waymo  a deal that boosted its shares 
 Dealers are a natural fit   National Automobile Dealers Association spokesman Jonathan Collegio said   Because they re everywhere  they ve already made the investments and have the expertise  ",2018-02-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/avis-steers-into-crowded-field-for-managing-ride-services-fleets-1287305,1287305

Walmart shoppers in Phoenix metropolitan area can order groceries on Walmart com and as their order is being prepared at the store  self driving cars will transport them to the store and bring them back  Waymo said 
Waymo has also teamed up with U S  shopping center owner DDR Corp to offer shoppers and diners rides in its self driving vehicles to and from the Ahwatukee Foothills Towne Center in Chandler  Arizona 
Additionally  Waymo has expanded its existing partnerships with AutoNation Inc  NYSE AN  and Avis Budget Group Inc in Phoenix  AutoNation will offer customers a Waymo  rather than a loaner car  to get around while their personal vehicles get serviced 
Avis Budget Group  which keeps Waymo vehicles charged and refueled for an upcoming ride  will provide its customers these self driving vehicles as a last mile solution to help them pick up or drop off their rental cars 
Having worked on self driving cars since 2009 and with 5 million miles  8 million km  driven on public roads under its belt  Waymo is generally considered to be ahead of rivals in the development of autonomous vehicle technology 
Global automakers  suppliers and tech companies like Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc are pouring resources into the development of autonomous driving systems and launching networks of test fleets aimed at pushing the technology forward 
The complex challenges of self driving and the high costs of research and development has led to a host of partnerships between automakers  suppliers and others ",2018-07-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/waymo-selfdriving-cars-to-ferry-walmart-shoppers-in-arizona-trial-1544309,1544309

113533,335048,AN,U S  used car glut is a dealer s dream  automakers  nightmare,news,"By Nick Carey ORWELL  Ohio  Reuters    Three years ago if a customer walked onto Dan Reel s used car lot seeking a late model off lease Ford Escape  his answer was short  tough luck   The supply of lightly used cars and trucks was tight because automakers had drastically cut back on bargain leases during and after the Great Recession  Recently  though  a computer search for available used vehicles within 150 miles of Reel revealed an eye popping figure  668 Escapes  That s enough to put more than 40 percent of the inhabitants of this small northeastern Ohio town  population 1 600  into the popular crossover   A search for the Chevrolet Equinox  a comparable crossover  showed 461 available    The automakers have flooded the market   said Reel  owner of Reel s Auto in Orwell  Ohio  about 40 miles east of Cleveland  That deluge is good news for used car dealers  auto auction houses and car buyers  who stand to benefit from a bountiful supply of high quality  off lease vehicles rolling into the U S  market  By the end of 2019  an estimated 12 million low mileage vehicles are coming off leases inked during a 2014 2016 spurt in new auto sales  according to estimates by Atlanta based auto auction firm Manheim and Reuters  That s helping independent dealers such as Reel  who can turn a quick profit on vehicles bought cheaply from auction companies   Big players like AutoNation  NYSE AN  also aim to benefit from selling late model vehicles at a discount versus brand new cars  Chief Executive Mike Jackson said rising off lease car numbers means  a higher supply of pre owned vehicles at a more attractive price   Consumers seeking great deals are in luck  Used vehicle prices at auction fell about 3 percent last year  according to Carmel  Indiana based  KAR Auction Services Inc   N KAR   which facilitated the sale of 5 1 million used and salvaged vehicles in 2016  Used prices should drop around 3 percent annually for the next couple of years  according to KAR s chief economist Tom Kontos  General Motors Co  N GM  and  Ford Motor Co   N F  say prices for its used vehicles  which consist largely of nearly new ones coming off lease to consumers  fell 7 percent in the first quarter versus the same period in 2016  GM says it expects a 7 percent decline for 2017 compared to last year   DETROIT THREE NOT CELEBRATING While many used car dealers and their customers are spoiled for choice  the glut bodes ill for GM  Ford and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV  N FCAU   MI FCHA  and is one reason the Detroit Three s share prices are stuck in neutral  Demand for new vehicles is slowing after seven consecutive years of rising sales  Meanwhile  carmakers  discounts on new vehicles have surpassed record levels set during the Great Recession  Those discounts have been averaging over 10 percent of a new vehicle s average selling price  according to industry consultants J D  Power and LMC Automotive  Slumping prices also hurt automakers  in house lenders  They price leases using a car s  residual value    an estimate of the vehicle s worth after its lease ends  If that value is lower than expected when the vehicle is resold  profits suffer   That risk was highlighted last November when Ford lowered its financial service arm s pretax profit forecast by  300 million  citing falling resale values for off lease vehicles  Still  carmakers show no sign of abandoning leasing  In the first quarter  leases made up 31 06 percent of sales to consumers  just below the record set in the second quarter of 2016 of 31 44 percent  according to data from Experian   For a graphic showing leasing activity  see     Wall Street is worried carmakers are repeating past mistakes  Shares of GM and Ford barely budged last month after their earnings both beat analyst expectations But when the companies reported disappointing April sales last week  GM s shares fell 3 percent and Ford s 4 percent  Automakers contend there is little cause for alarm   In late April  GM chief financial officer Chuck Stevens said off lease vehicles were  an issue   but insisted that  overall the used car market is absorbing that supply    Others see it differently  KAR CEO Jim Hallett said there s now an oversupply of off lease vehicles   The flood of lease cars puts a lot of pressure on automakers and their dealers to get new cars sold   he said  COOKIE CUTTER VS  UNICORN In a market teeming with product  attention is now on auction sites  a critical link in the used car food chain  The U S  trade is dominated by Manheim and Adesa  a unit of KAR  These companies re sell cars and trucks returned to automakers from rental car companies and consumer leases  Franchise dealerships get first dibs on inventory  The leftovers are available to independent dealers through online and live auctions  KAR s Hallett says the company makes money on the volume of cars sold  so rising supply boosts business  Manufacturers are also using more of KAR s ancillary repair and finishing services to make vehicles look as good as possible for sale  he said  Supply is currently so swollen Adesa now offers used dealers a guarantee  they can return any car they buy online within 30 days if it doesn t sell and only end up  50 out of pocket  Used car dealers are also tweaking their strategies for a glutted market  Reel  the Ohio dealer  hunts for unique vehicles that can command a slight premium  Joe Mok  general manager of Gmotorcars in Chicago  doesn t care about unicorns  His strategy is to sell cheap  He recently bought 15 virtually identical 2015 Ford Fiestas for  6 900 and sold them for  7 600    What s going to make somebody come to my store if we all have the same color Toyota Camry with the same miles   said Mok  who owns two dealerships   They ll come to me because of the price   With used car prices falling  the pressure is on dealers to sell vehicles fast before they lose value  Rather than keep too much inventory on his lot  Reel entices customers with the prospect of almost unlimited choice on the auction sites  
 I can get almost any off lease car a customer wants within48 hours   he said   The only question is   What color do you want   ",2017-05-12,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-used-car-glut-is-a-dealer’s-dream,-automakers’-nightmare-483490",483490

for GM vehicles were up  1 500 in the second quarter from a year ago  She predicted  continued momentum  in the second half as the company launches new models and increases production of trucks and sport utility vehicles   Fiat Chrysler said earlier this week it expects North American demand to  remain strong  and Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne predicted  positive pricing going forward  in the market  However  Marchionne warned that unless the company can negotiate more competitive labor deals with the United Auto Workers  it will stop building sedans and compact cars in the United States  The slump in Fiat Chrysler s sedan sales reflects a broader shift   no longer is consumer demand strong across all market segments and body styles  The call on the North American vehicle market matters to investors because U S  sales of light trucks and SUVs generate the bulk of global profits for GM  Fiat Chrysler and Ford   Ford said it expects the U S  economy to grow 1 9 percent to 2 3 percent this year  lower than Ford s previous expectation of 2 1 percent to 2 6 percent growth  The Federal Reserve last month trimmed its forecast for U S  economic growth to 2 percent from 2 2 percent in March  SIGNS OF STRESS Ford on Thursday reported weaker than expected profit in the second quarter  and its results showed signs of stress in various ways  In North America  revenue grew 2 percent to  23 8 billion for the quarter   But discounts took  999 million more out of the latest quarter s pretax profit than in the second quarter a year ago  and pretax profit in the region fell by 5 percent to  2 7 billion   The competitive environment has increased as demand has slowed   Chief Executive Mark Fields said during a conference call with investors   This has resulted in higher industry incentives     as various competitors protect their share    Ford s operating automotive margin in North America was 11 3 percent during the quarter  down from 12 2 percent a year earlier  Shanks said Ford believed it could sustain North American margins in an 8 to 10 percent range from peak sales to trough  Analysts said some of Ford s problems appeared related to product and competitive issues  rather than macro economic factors   GM said recently that it will have more truck production in the second half of the year to meet some demand that they ve been leaving on the table   said David Whiston  autos analyst with Morningstar  Meanwhile  Ford will be taking on heavy costs to roll out a new line of Super Duty trucks  Also  Shanks said a weaker British pound following the June 23 vote by Britain to leave the European Union  known as  Brexit   cost the company about  60 million in the second quarter   The 2016 impact of Brexit on Ford is expected to be  200 million  he said  and each year until Britain leaves the EU will cost the company  400 million to  500 million  Shanks said   Ford said its costs also rose for safety recalls  which are counted as part of its net income  The expense to cover recalls relating to air bag inflators made by Takata Corp  T 7312  was about  100 million in the quarter  Shanks said

113609,335124,AN,GM gets boost from smaller pickups  but doubters question for how long,news,"By Ben Klayman DETROIT  Reuters    General Motors Co  NYSE GM  s return to selling smaller pickups in the United States has resuscitated a moribund market segment  but new data highlights the risk that the automaker s new trucks are cannibalizing sales of higher priced models   Since the launch last autumn of the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon  the midsize pickup segment has grown to more than 2 percent of the total U S  car and light truck market from 1 4 percent last summer  Some industry executives believe the segment could double annual sales to 500 000 vehicles  which would have been 3 percent of last year s market  However  beneath the encouraging numbers for the Colorado and Canyon are some less positive trends  said IHS Automotive analyst Tom Libby  Nine of the top 10 vehicles previously owned by buyers of the Colorado and Canyon are GM cars and trucks  Owners of full size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks made up more than 16 percent of the consumers who switched into both smaller GM pickups  according to IHS data    That was ominous   Libby said   There may be a deeper issue here  related to the potential for undercutting sales of higher margin models   Libby said it was early in the life of the new midsized trucks and the actual number of consumers who switched from other GM vehicles was small by comparison  GM officials said the IHS data fails to take into account new buyers and Canyon marketing manager Kenn Bakowski said more than half of all the sales of the new trucks are buyers new to the company   THREE TRUCK STRATEGY GM s new trucks have taken a bite out of long time midsized pickup segment leader  Toyota Motor Corp s Tacoma  Last month  GM President Dan Ammann called the smaller trucks  a very good investment    It s a sleeper segment with huge opportunity   Rich Latek  GMC s director of marketing  said in an interview  GM recently added a third shift at the Wentzville  Missouri  plant where their trucks are built because demand is so strong  The automaker plans to offer a diesel version to expand the appeal of the models   The Colorado and Canyon represent one leg of what GM executives call a  three truck strategy   The other two are the large and heavy duty versions of the Silverado and Sierra trucks  which are bigger and sell at higher prices  The Colorado and Canyon  like the Toyota Tacoma  are aimed at people who want the utility of a pickup  but more for recreation   such as carrying bikes or camping gear   than for hauling lumber or oil field gear  The Colorado starts at about  20 120  about  6 000 less than the larger Silverado pickup  Dealers say they are happy with the new trucks   It s the right truck at the right time   AutoNation Inc  NYSE AN  Chief Executive Mike Jackson said   They saw something that others doubted   Still  it is not clear that demand will soon surpass the 1986 peak  when smaller pickups made up more than 9 percent of the market with more than 1 4 million sales  according to GM   Midsized trucks generate less than the  10 000  12 000 in profit per vehicle of the full size models according to analysts  but GM officials said they are money makers and a component of their strategy to achieve 10 percent profit margins in North America  Since their launch last fall  GM has sold 37 351 Colorado and Canyon trucks through March  MIXED VIEWS Demand for larger pickups remains much greater  however  Chevrolet sold 45 193 Silverados in March alone   LMC Automotive sees the midsize segment hitting 2 percent of the overall market this year but slipping back under that by 2020  LMC forecasts Colorado sales to hit just over 74 000 this year but to fall by 8 4 percent over the next five years  and Canyon sales to hit almost 29 500 this year but slide almost 21 percent in the subsequent five years  Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Matthew Stover said GM s smaller trucks will generate decent profit  but the smaller trucks are more significant for Latin America and Asia   Too many other products have emerged in the market to fill the place of the midsized pickup truck   Stover said    Toyota  meanwhile  is gearing up to defend its position in the United States with a redesigned Tacoma due to launch this fall  The Tacoma has lost share in the segment  but its sales are still up almost 13 percent so far this year    Our biggest issue right now is trying to keep our dealers supplied   said Bill Fay  group vice president for Toyota s U S  sales  Toyota added a third shift at its truck plant in Baja  Mexico  Fay predicts the midsized truck segment could rise as high as 500 000 U S  sales  which would be double last year s level  Tacoma sales could improve by more than 6 percent this year to about 165 000 trucks  he said  and rise another 10 000 or more next year  And the segment will likely grow more crowded  Hyundai Motor Co is eyeing the smaller end of the market  and Daimler s Mercedes has said it will focus initially on non U S  markets  However  GM s U S  rivals   Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  NYSE FCAU    are still unconvinced of the viability of smaller trucks

113642,335157,AN,AUTOSHOW UPDATE 1 AutoNation cuts new vehicle orders by 60 pct,news,"By Poornima Gupta
 DETROIT  Jan 11  Reuters    AutoNation Inc   the
largest public car dealership group  has scaled back its orders
for new vehicles from automakers by 60 percent this month as
weak demand has increased inventories of unsold vehicles  Chief
Executive Mike Jackson said on Sunday 
  Inventory is high for everyone   Jackson told Reuters in
an interview on the sidelines of the Detroit Auto Show   Orders
have been scaled back dramatically      have been scaled back
60 percent for January  
 Jackson said the plunge in U S  sales has caused cars and
trucks to pile up on dealer lots and he does not expect any
improvement in demand during the first quarter 
  You may see some signs of life by end of March   he said 
 Jackson said the U S  auto industry was at  depression
level sales  at the current annual sales rate of about 10
million units 
 The poor sales environment was affecting the mood at the
Detroit auto show  Jackson said   I have seen a better mood at
funerals   he told Reuters TV 
 Economic uncertainty was the key theme at the auto show
media preview that opened Sunday as the battered industry
shelved the glitz to save precious marketing dollars and braced
for another rough ride in 2009 
 U S  auto sales fell 18 percent to about 13 2 million
vehicles in 2008 from the prior year  battered by the downturn
in the economy and most automakers expect sales to decline from
there in 2009  The rate has hovered just above 10 million on an
annualized basis in the last couple of months 
 Jackson said he expects a gradual improvement in the U S 
market in the second half of the year  given the massive
stimulus package being considered by the incoming Barack Obama
administration 
  In 2010  you could be back between 13 million and 14
million units   he said 
 Jackson said lack of credit remained a key issue for
consumers 
  If credit was not an issue  we could be running at a SAAR
of 12 million and 13 million  units    he said  adding that the
restoration of credit availability is critical for the
improvement in auto demand

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 11  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This auto retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 15 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 6  
Revenues are expected to be  5 57 billion  up 2 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 36  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change

Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AutoNation 
For AutoNation  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  13 54  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that AutoNation will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AutoNation would post earnings of  1 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 18  delivering a surprise of  6 31  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AutoNation appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/autonation-an-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200504509,200504509

113826,335341,AN,5 Broker Friendly Stocks To Combat Trade   Geopolitical Woes,opinion,Concerns of global economic sluggishness owing to the trade war between the United States and China and tensions with the likes of Iran and North Korea have hurt the broader equity market on various occasions this year However  irrespective of market conditions  investors strive to design a winning portfolio of stocks  They  after all  are putting their hard earned money into stocks  Amid the prevalent confusion  it is almost impossible for individual investors to come up with a winning portfolio of stocks without proper guidance  Therefore  it is in the best interest of investors to seek advice from  experts in the field  Who Are These Experts The  experts  in the field of investing are brokers who are equipped with thorough knowledge about the space  Brokers  irrespective of their types  sell side  buy side or independent   have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors To attain their objective  they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations  Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock Direction of Earnings Estimates Serves as a Proper Guide Since brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage  they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  Naturally  their estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock For example  an earnings outperformance by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north  Similarly  lackluster earnings often lead to stock price depreciation  Investors tend to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving broker recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks Do Not Ignore the Top Line However  designing a strategy based solely on the bottom line is unlikely to result in a winning approach  Actually  according to many market watchers  a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds  To address top line concerns  we have included in our screen price sales ratio  which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric Screening Criteria   Up  Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top  75  This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks    change in Q  1  est   4 weeks    Top  10  This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter  We have also added the following screening parameters to ensure that the strategy is a winning one Price to Sales   Bot 10  The lower the ratio the better  companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10  of our universe of over 7 700 stocks with respect to this ratio  Price greater than 5  as a stock trading below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most of the investors

5 Broker Friendly Stocks to Combat Trade   Geopolitical Woes
Concerns of global economic sluggishness owing to the trade war between the United States and China and tensions with the likes of Iran and North Korea have hurt the broader equity market on various occasions this year 
However  irrespective of market conditions  investors strive to design a winning portfolio of stocks  They  after all  are putting their hard earned money into stocks  Amid the prevalent confusion  it is almost impossible for individual investors to come up with a winning portfolio of stocks without proper guidance  Therefore  it is in the best interest of investors to seek advice from  experts in the field  
Who Are These Experts 
The  experts  in the field of investing are brokers who are equipped with thorough knowledge about the space  Brokers  irrespective of their types  sell side  buy side or independent   have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors 
To attain their objective  they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations  Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock 
Direction of Earnings Estimates Serves as a Proper Guide 
Since brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage  they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  Naturally  their estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock 
For example  an earnings outperformance by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north  Similarly  lackluster earnings often lead to stock price depreciation  Investors tend to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy 
To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving broker recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks 
Do Not Ignore the Top Line 
However  designing a strategy based solely on the bottom line is unlikely to result in a winning approach  Actually  according to many market watchers  a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds  To address top line concerns  we have included in our screen price sales ratio  which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric

113828,335343,AN,Earnings Preview  AutoNation  AN  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"AutoNation  NYSE AN  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This auto retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 08 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 3  
Revenues are expected to be  5 33 billion  down 1 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 09  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AutoNation 
For AutoNation  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 93  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AutoNation will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AutoNation would post earnings of  0 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 05  delivering a surprise of  14 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AutoNation doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-autonation-an-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200440220,200440220

What s Next for AutoNation 
While AutoNation has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for AutoNation was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

113862,335377,AN,Top Analyst Reports For Comcast  Deere   Exelon ,opinion,"Thursday  February 28  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Comcast  CMCSA   Deere  DE  and Exelon  EXC   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Comcast s shares have outperformed the S P 500 in the past year  gaining  6 4  vs   2 9   The Zacks analyst thinks Comcast is benefiting from solid growth in residential high speed Internet customers  Expanding Wi Fi coverage along with innovative xFi control features is improving customer experience  The company s Xfinity Mobile is now used by more than one million customers  
Additionally  Green Book s Best Picture Oscar win bodes well for Comcast division Universal Pictures  Further  the Sky acquisition expands Comcast s international reach  Notably  the company will enter the streaming market through NBCUniversal s upcoming service  
However  the streaming market is highly competitive and significant investment is needed to gain footprint  Hence  incremental spending on content can hurt Comcast s margin expansion  Moreover  the company continues to lose voice and video subscribers due to cord cutting  Additionally  high debt level is a headwind 
 You can   
Shares of Deere have increased  11 7  over the past six months  outperforming the S P 500  which has declined  3 6  over the same period  Deere s first quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings and revenues rose on a year over year basis aided by demand growth in key markets  Earnings missed expectations while revenues beat the same  
For fiscal 2019  Deere projects net sales growth of 7  year over year and net income of  3 6 billion  The Zacks analyst thinks the company will benefit from improving construction markets and growing replacement demand for agricultural equipment  The acquisition of Wirtgen  which enhances Deere s exposure to global transportation infrastructure  will be a catalyst  Introduction of advanced technologies in its products will fuel growth  
Raw material cost inflation  elevated expenses and unfavorable foreign currency impact will hurt margins in the near term  Nevertheless  Deere remains well poised for long term growth backed by population and urbanization growth 
 You can   
Exelon s shares have gained  30 4  in the past year  outperforming the S P 500 which has gained  2 9  over the same period  Although Exelon s earnings per share during the fourth quarter were in line with estimates  the bottom line improved from the year ago level  The improvement was due to new rates at PHI and higher energy efficiency earnings at ComEd  
The Zacks analyst thinks Exelon is likely to benefit from its  23 billion planned capital investment  focus on zero emission electricity generation and cost savings  The company continues with its hedging program to manage market risks and protect the value of its generation  Strong cash flow generation capacity will help it lower debt levels and increase value of its shareholders  
However  Exelon is subject to the impact of commodity price volatility and price fluctuation in the wholesale markets  Stringent government regulation is also a cause of concern

Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook

113864,335379,AN,Analysts Estimate AutoNation  AN  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when AutoNation  NYSE AN  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 26  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This auto retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 92 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 9  
Revenues are expected to be  5 22 billion  down 0 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 18  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AutoNation 
For AutoNation  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  6 52  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AutoNation will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AutoNation would post earnings of  1 14 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 10  delivering a surprise of  3 51  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AutoNation doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-autonation-an-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200408773,200408773
113865,335380,AN,Bear Of The Day  AutoNation  AN ,opinion,"AutoNation  NYSE AN  is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and it fell to that Rank last week and that is a bad sign as the company is set to report earnings at the end of the week   Let s review how this stock fell to the lowest Zacks Rank in this Bear of the Day article 
Description
AutoNation is the America s Largest Automotive Retailer  AutoNation is constantly innovating and striving to change the way America buys   services their vehicles  AutoNation offer a diversified range of automotive products and services  including new vehicles  used vehicles  parts and service  which includes automotive repair and maintenance services as well as wholesale parts and collision businesses  and automotive finance and insurance products  which include vehicle service and other protection products  as well as the arranging of financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources 
Earnings Estimates
The Zacks Rank is primarily driven by the movement in earnings estimates   If estimates are moving up the Rank moves in a similar direction   When estimates slide  the Rank tends to follow suit
For AN the estimates for the current quarter have been falling   90 days ago  the Zacks Consensus Estimate was at  1 09  that fell to  0 94 as of 30 days ago and that has slipped to the current level of  0 92 
There is a similar story for the next quarter  as numbers fell from  1 10 to  1 05 to  1 03 over the same time period 
The full year estiamte carries more weight than the quarterly numbers on the Zacks Rank   Those numbers are moving lower as well   90 Days ago the 2019 estimate was at  4 56 and now it is down to  4 14 
Earnings History
AN does not have the worst earnings history I have ever seen  but it is not the best   Of the last four reports  there have been two beats and two misses   That isn t a big problem  as 3 of the 4 reports were a beat or a miss of a single penny 
That said  the last two reports were misses so there is a recent trend 
Valuation
As a growth investor  I look at the topline   I see contraction of 4 78  on an annual basis  so I am not thrilled   Then I see the price to sales of 0 16x and I see the market does not really value their sales   
A 9x forward earnings multiple is low  but so is the price to book multiple of 1 26x 
The valuation is low  but depressed earnings tell you that we could see a lower valuation still

113866,335381,AN,GPI Or AN  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Automotive   Retail and Whole Sales sector might want to consider either Group 1 Automotive  GPI  or AutoNation  NYSE AN   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Group 1 Automotive is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while AutoNation has a Zacks Rank of  5  Strong Sell   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that GPI has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
GPI currently has a forward P E ratio of 7 56  while AN has a forward P E of 9 02  We also note that GPI has a PEG ratio of 1 87  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  AN currently has a PEG ratio of 3 51 
Another notable valuation metric for GPI is its P B ratio of 1 22  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  AN has a P B of 1 24 
These metrics  and several others  help GPI earn a Value grade of B  while AN has been given a Value grade of C 
GPI stands above AN thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that GPI is the superior value option right now ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gpi-or-an-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200409680,200409680

113923,335438,AN,Momo  AutoNation  Amercia s Car Mart And Lithia Motors Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 29  2017   Momo  NASDAQ        as the Bull of the Day  AutoNation  NYSE AN   NYSE        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Amercia s Car Mart  NASDAQ        and Lithia Motors  NYSE        

	Here is a synopsis of all four stocks 

   

	When looking for the Bull of the Day I typically try to find a stock that has an interesting combination  Most of the time it s a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock that s breaking on through to new highs  That s fantastic but I really like when I can uncover a gem not too many people are talking about within an area of the market they are very excited about  Today s stock sits at the middle of a few exciting trends  China  mobile and gaming 

	I m talking about Momo  NASDAQ         Momo Inc  operates as a mobile based social networking platform in the People s Republic of China  The company s platform includes its Momo mobile application and various related features  functionalities  tools  and services that are provided to users  customers  and platform partners  It offers Momo mobile application that enables users to establish and expand their social relationships based on locations and interests  and Hani  a live video application 

	The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank here is the huge jump in our current year and next year s Zacks Consensus Estimate  Based on analysts  earnings estimates  we ve seen a move from  1 20 to  1 40 on the current year number while next year s number has jumped from  1 73 to  2 06  Add this to the series of recent earnings surprises to the upside and you see why this is ranked the way it is 

	You can see this data on the Detailed Estimates page we have on Zacks com  On the same page you see some eye popping growth numbers  Revenue growth for the current year is slated to come in at 126  year over year while next year s growth is expected to be 38   If you look over to EPS  the current year is calling for 97  EPS growth while next year should come in at 46  growth 

	These huge numbers have provided plenty of fuel for a rally in shares of MOMO  So far 2017 has been a banner year  with the stock pushing up from the high teens to  46 before running out of gas  The recent retracement here has seen the stock pull back to  37  dipping below the 50 day moving average  The commodity channel index is oversold right night  indicating the stock could be due for a bounce soon 

Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies

	It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively 

	And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation  

  

	The risk of peak auto is lingering over the automakers right now  Some pent up demand helped spike auto sales to multi year highs but now with rates turning the corner and a glut of cars coming back on leases there is pressure on sales  As a result  analysts have becoming increasingly bearish on the industry as a whole 

	Today s Bear of the Day is in this industry under pressure AutoNation  NYSE         AutoNation  Inc   through its subsidiaries  operates as an automotive retailer in the United States  The company operates in three segments  Domestic  Import  and Premium Luxury  It offers a range of automotive products and services  including new and used vehicles  and parts and services  such as automotive repair and maintenance services  and wholesale parts and collision services  The company also provides automotive finance and insurance products comprising vehicle services and other protection products  and arrangement of finance for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources  As of December 31  2016  it owned and operated 371 new vehicle franchises from 260 stores located primarily in metropolitan markets in the Sunbelt region of the United States 

	AutoNation is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock because of the bearish actions of analysts covering the stock  Over the last sixty days  seven analysts have dropped their earnings estimates for the current year while six have dropped their numbers for next year  The bearish attitude has dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from  4 01 to  3 90 while next year s number has gone down from  4 46 to  4 17 

	Shares of AN have come under pressure this year  running out of steam under  53 in late January  From that elevated level the stock came crashing down under  40  The good news is buyers stepped in to prop up the stock in the high  30s  The first bounce off the lows in April took the stock to the 50 day moving average before ultimately running out of steam at  45 35 in late April  Another retest of the lows was met with a bounce that ended at  43 13  With a firm bottom at  38 20 long term shareholders should keep an eye on this level 

	Investors looking for other stocks in the automotive industry are going to be hard pressed to find ideas with favorable Zacks Ranks  The highest ranked stocks in the industry are Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocksAmercia s Car Mart  NASDAQ        and Lithia Motors  NYSE        

Today s Stock from Zacks  Hottest Strategies

	It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively 

	And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation

113929,335444,AN,Hurricane Harvey Lifts Used Car Stocks  CVNA  KMX  AN ,opinion,"Hurricane Harvey has caused massive devastation to Houston and the surrounding area since it made landfall last week  but the used car industry has already experienced some gains as the storm has left hundreds of thousands of cars submerged under water     
Floodwaters cover America s fourth largest city  with Harvey already the cause of what will likely amount to over  100 billion of damage  And just one day after President Donald Trump visited Texas  the tropical storm hit land once again on Wednesday  This time it hit southwestern Louisiana  as well the Houston area again 
FEMA  along with countless other groups and individuals  are currently conducting rescue and recovery efforts and seeking to provide food  water  clothing  and housing for those affected by the storm  Almost  for financial assistance 
But the economies of Houston and southwestern Louisiana won t be halted forever  and one of the first consumer facing industries that could experience a big boost is the used car market 
Roughly half a million vehicles are possibly damaged beyond repair  according to Cox Automotive  Now  car retailers  especially used car dealers  are set to benefit 
 It s supply and demand   chairman of the Houston Automobile Dealers Association  Steven Wolf said on  on Wednesday   And obviously there s going to be a tremendous demand for vehicles  I think that you re going to see some price pressure on used cars  
Wolf also offered a vote of confidence in auto insurance companies   The insurance companies are going to step up and do the right thing and get these claims handled quickly   He noted that companies will  send more people down there to help with the claims  
All of this signals a potential windfall for car dealerships in the area  but also for online car sellers and rental car companies 
Shares of used car giant CarMax   NYSE KMX   jumped 3 82  on Wednesday  while online car dealer Auto Trader   ST AUTO   climbed 2 49   The relatively new  online only used car dealer Carvana Co    NYSE CVNA   saw its stock price skyrocket 11 37   AutoNation   NYSE AN    a massive automotive retailer that sells both new and used vehicles mostly in the Sunbelt  shares gained 4 09

Auto
Hurricane Harvey dented thousands of new vehicles that were in dealership lots  according to a new analysis from   These new cars and trucks perhaps  have to be scrapped  as per  of AutoNation  NYSE AN  
The car shopping website estimates that Harvey affected 366 000 new vehicles across Texas  Since several of these are high profit trucks and SUVs  the trouble is deep for automakers  So  repurchase of cars will gain traction over the medium term on higher replacement demand for the damaged vehicles   
AutoNation s CEO also emphasized that  there will be a substantial snapback either in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year because that s the American way   First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund   a Zacks Rank  2 fund  can thus gain ahead  read

113944,335459,AN,Plunger s Big Trade  Short Oil,opinion,"The big trade of this year would position one for the upcoming US recession  When it comes to speculating and investing  if one can get the main concept right  everything else falls into place  Various trades will branch off from this theme 
The trade is not priced into the market at all since we are betting against the accepted narrative  We can use various proxies to play the trade  as just about anything economically sensitive may qualify  Base metal producers  car companies  sub prime financiers  retail establishments  the list goes on  The main vehicle I have chosen to execute the trade is the oil price  I have chosen this because both fundamentals and technicals indicate to me it is overpriced and due for a fall  It trades deep and has a record of falling under distressed economic conditions 
 All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream   Edger Allan Poe
That s what we have lived over the past eight years  an economic mirage  A historic Fed fueled reflation rally  that was just a dream  Central banks led by PhD academics who applied their unproven pet theories of substituting credit conjured from thin air in place of accumulated savings to stimulate demand  We are now going to see if their theories worked  Von Mises explained in  Human Action  that a credit fueled boom ends in one of two ways 

 Either the banks continue the credit expansion without restriction and thus cause constantly mounting price increases and an ever growing orgy of speculation  which  as in all other cases of unlimited inflation ends in a  crack up boom  and in a collapse of the money and credit system  Or the banks stop before this point is reached  voluntarily renounce further credit expansion and thus bring about the crisis  

That is where we are right now  at the beginning of the credit restriction  The crisis will then follow  Its time to take the trade before its begins to be priced into the market 
The oil market is rife with false understandings that should soon be exposed  Chief among them is that OPEC is in control  A belief in an OPEC put reminds me of the belief in the central bank put which existed in 2008  That dream was soon blown away  The false idea that producers will simply shut down production once they reach their all in costs is simply wrong  Sovereigns and independents have bills to pay  the costs of infrastructure can be written off 
Diego Parrilla has written a wonderful book  The Energy World is Flat  wherein he describes forces converging on the energy markets which ultimately work towards lower prices  These forces have converged to put crude oil on the defensive  Substitution  regional convergence  lower transportation costs have essentially transformed oil into strictly a transportation fuel  Oil was once the source of power generation but is no more  Oil now competes at a disadvantage with virtually all other energy sources 
Consumers have defended themselves in various ways and even geopolitics no longer adds much of a premium to price  with ample storage capacity and diverse supplies  It turns out  peak oil turns was a very linear statistic view of the world  It ignored the dynamism of the market  These are forces that will exert a downward pressure on prices for years to come and when a faltering economy runs headlong into the largest spec long position of any commodity in history prices will drop 
Distressed producers and investors 
Reversion to the mean is a statistical certainty  The only question is what duration do we use to determine it  If one is to look at the oil price spanning the entire modern era  post WWII  the mean price  in today s dollars  would be around  35  So its not hard to imagine a dip below the mean during a mean reversion cycle 

Capturing that move below  35 is what this trade is all about  As I said earlier what makes this the Big Trade is not the percentage move  but in getting the theme right and using that theme in your other investments 
Yesterdays Geniuses Tomorrows Suckers
People always invest the most money at the wrong part of the cycle  I believe this is what happened in the oil patch  The big asset players  the Blackstone s  Carlyle s  Blackrock s and others bought at what they thought was the bottom  They believed they were the distressed buyers in 2015  Perhaps Jesse Livermore would say they are still suckers  but just suckers in a higher class  These private equity players all bought using debt and are highly levered  But I believe the game isn t played out yet  If prices drop precipitously these guys will be selling at fire sale prices 
Mechanics of the trade 
This is a broad theme  hence the name The Big Trade  One could pick various entities to short  General Motors  NYSE GM   Chrysler  NYSE FCAU   AutoNation  NYSE AN   CarMax  NYSE KMX  and subprime auto lending companies such as Ally Finance  NYSE ALLY   Navient  NASDAQ NAVI   Santander  MC SAN  Consumer USA Holdings  NYSE SC   Avis Budget Group  NASDAQ CAR  and Hertz  NYSE HTZ  would be a good place to start  Energy companies with a large amount of debt are also prime candidates  But let s for now focus on oil 
I have taken an initial short position using an option spread on the United States Oil ETF  NYSE USO   I have also shorted outright the VelocityShares 3x Long Crude Oil ETF  NYSE UWT   One can tailor one s risk reward by adapting different levels of leverage using options  These are trades I hold and am in no way giving specific advice to anyone else in constructing their own trade positions  We are all our own managers here 
When oil starts its downward impulse I will likely buy a direct put on one of the oil ETFs and buy VelocityShares 3x Inverse Crude Fund  NYSE DWT  or ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil  NYSE SCO   But I will try to time the moment to reduce the amount of decay that one carries while holding that instrument 
Back to the Big Picture
Looking again at the big picture phase chart we see below  I believe we are in phase II of the secular bear market which started in 2008  I suspect it won t be over until the end of the next recession  I have no idea how low oil could go  but I presume the 2015 lows will be tested as a minimum 

So for those still thinking about that  obvious  H S bottom we see over the past 2 years  let s take a look at another chart you should be well familiar with 

We all know that gold s price just kept on going down and the H S was never was valid  I suspect the same thing will play out with oil 
Another Retracement in an ongoing bear market
What we have witnessed over the past year in the oil market is likely just another retracement of the decline from  114  Oil got bombed out at the bottom just like gold did in 2015  All the sellers left  It could only bounce up  Mr  Bear needed a recharge so he put on a cyclical bull to draw in the usual suspects  the oil bugs  close cousins to the gold bugs 

But according to chartology the bounce took the form of a giant bearish rising wedge which lasted about one year and recently broke down out of the wedge  It is now in an aggressive backtest which offers a low risk short entry 

Here is a close up 2 hour duration chart depicting the OIL ETF in its recent retracement after falling out of its massive one year retracement wedge  IMO this recent bounce over the past 3 weeks was fueled by initial bearish psychology  Several newsletter writers advised their flocks to short oil using leveraged vehicles after the initial breakdown had occurred  I am on record of entering my short  using UWT right at the initial break  I closed out the trade after the second bounce on March 23rd  The aggressive bounce starting on March 27th I view as a short squeeze jacking all the Johnny come lately s  That s how initial breakdowns often develop  Mr Market needs to squeeze out the shorts and retest the original breakdown level 
The run up to resistance since Mar 27 has several interesting features  Note the three running gaps in the chart  These are caused by urgency and cry out to be filled  Also price was projected precisely to the point of overhead resistance by the blue breakout to breakout 5 6  measurements  Finally  I found it interesting that price retraced just above FIB 61 8   If you go back to Part I and look at the chart labeled the great retracement you will see the oil price retracement from 2009 to 2011 retraced exactly the same amount  just above the 61 8  level  All of these points lend credence that the bounce may now be over and its time to enter short 

Here is todays action  There is a chance we have a top with the break of the short term NL 

Risk Factors
It s easy to be wrong so I have controlled risk of potential loss by buying call options at higher strike prices  Waking up tomorrow to find the Iranians have blocked the straits of Hormuz would be painful  but not a wipeout  However I consider this a low risk entry because if prices close above the February highs I close out the trade  That s only  3 per bbl of risk above today s price  That s limited exposure  despite leverage  Above that point we reevaluate our investing premise and if its still valid we wait for the next entry set up 
Normally I don t short when above a rising 30 W EMA  however I see this as a unique set up with defined risk exit points  When weekly stochastics turn down and the 30 W EMA tilts down it would be appropriate to add to the short position  Until then its a starter entry  The plan is to ladder into the trade as the technicals improve and we increase the probability of success 

By shorting UWT and selling in the money Jan18 USO calls it aligns the decay of these vehicles in favor of the trade  This also skews the risk reward favorably 
So that s the Big Trade  My objective is to earn 50 60  on my capital deployed over a period of 10 months  If the oil price drops to  30 35 this should be achieved  What makes the trade big is not the rate of return but the economic implications  Again  get the main theme right and other things fall into place  Other trades will be related to this central theme

113986,335501,AN,Don t Bet On Rising Auto Sales With This Stock,opinion,"Late last year  it was announced that Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  agreed to acquire the privately held Van Tuyl Group  one of the largest auto dealer networks in the United States  Investors may be tempted to follow in Buffett s footsteps by making a similar bet on the United States  rebounding auto sales and low gas prices   but we don t think the famous  rising tide lifts all boats  analogy applies here  Some dealers are better positioned to benefit from the rebound than others and some dealer stocks are just plain dangerous  The latter is what investors are getting in Sonic Automotive  NYSE SAH  
Sonic operates 118 franchisees in 13 states covering major markets in Texas  California  the Southeast  the West  and others  The company s sales mix is 56  luxury brands  31  import brands  and 13  domestic  BMW alone makes up 22  of the company s sales  with other leading brands Honda and Toyota making up 15  and 10  of sales  respectively 
Where s the Growth 
Investors in SAH have had a good run since 2011  as the company s stock price has increased over 100  while the S P has risen just 86   However  this appreciation was based on misleading earnings growth 
Since 2010  Sonic s return on invested capital  ROIC  has declined from over 6  to just 4   while GAAP net income has increased by 2  compounded annually  The rise in GAAP net income  however  is mostly due to a reduction in the interest expense the company is paying  When we remove the effect of interest expense  we can see that the company s core business operations have become consistently less profitable over this timeframe 
Figure 1 shows this discrepancy between GAAP net income and ROIC 
Figure 1  Rising GAAP Net Income Masks Declining Profitability

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Last quarter  Sonic grew revenue by 5   less than competitors Asbury Automotive  13   and CarMax  NYSE KMX   14    both of which have more favorable brand exposure  In 2014  half of Sonic s dealership acquisitions were of luxury brands 
Why is this a problem  One of the key reasons that Sonic has missed out on the increased auto sales  despite its favorable revenue exposure to hot selling brands like BMW  Mercedes Benz and Audi  is its low exposure to the  light trucks  segment that has been driving auto sales since 2014  The top selling car list last month was dominated by light trucks from Ford  GM  Dodge  and Nissan  and Sonic only has no more than 7  exposure to each of these brands 
We Made These Adjustments to Sonic s Reported Financials
To reveal this misleading trend in Sonic s operating profitability  we ve made a number of adjustments to the company s reported earnings over the years  In 2014 we 

Removed  78 million in reported non operating expenses  mainly due to interest expenses on Sonic s large debt 
Removed  31 million in implied interest expenses from Sonic s load of operating leases 

These adjustments allow us to see that Sonic s after tax operating profit  NOPAT  of  168 million is much higher than its reported net income of just  97 million  This may look good on the surface  but consider that the same process led us to increase the company s 2010 net income of  89 million to a NOPAT of  212 million  So while the company s GAAP net income may indicate that Sonic s profits are rising  its NOPAT  along with its ROIC above  actually shows that profits are moving in the wrong direction 
Sonic also has  476 million in off balance sheet debt from operating leases  19  of its debt and 40  of its market cap  
The biggest adjustment we make to Sonic s reported numbers is holding the company accountable for  655 million in accumulated asset write downs  43  of net assets   This large amount of write downs represents a substantial amount of value destruction over the years  For every dollar on its balance sheet  Sonic has written down 43 cents  We add this full amount to Sonic s invested capital  as it represents capital that the business once expected to generate a return on  but failed to do so 
Weakest Player in a Highly Competitive Field
Sonic competes with other large auto dealer networks such as Asbury Automotive  NYSE ABG   Penske Automotive  NYSE PAG   Group 1 Automotive  NYSE GPI   AutoNation  NYSE AN  and Lithia Motors  NYSE LAD  
Figure 2  At the Bottom of the Industry

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
The first thing to note is that Sonic as at the bottom of the list in terms of ROIC 
The second thing to note is just how consistently thin after tax margins are across the industry  No company except the impressive CarMax   which only manages a 5  after tax margin   can cross above the 3  margin  We think it s more likely that margins will fall rather than rise  as these businesses attempt to extend this cyclical boom in auto sales by offering attractive discounts 
Valuation Ignores Current State of the Business
Sonic s rising stock price has followed the company s rising reported net income  but belies the company s falling profitability  To justify its current valuation of  24 share  Sonic would need to grow NOPAT by over 5  compounded annually for the next 15 years 
Seeing has Sonic has grown profits by a total of just 7  since 2000  we think this level of solid  sustained growth is unlikely  If Sonic can instead grow profits by a still optimistic 4  compounded annually for the next 15 years  the stock is worth  15 share  a 37  downside from current levels 
Why Sonic s Buyback is a Poor Use of Capital
Sonic currently offers a small  0 10 annual dividend  and has around  79 million remaining in its  100 million share repurchase program  While this dividend  which amounts to just over  5 million annually  isn t substantial  we think it s foolish for the company to buy back stock at these record high levels 
Watch Out for These Catalysts That Could Hit SAH
We think that the cyclical boom in auto sales is coming to an end  as automakers have exhausted much of the pent up demand from the recession  Out of the six automakers that reported their April sales last week and provided estimates ahead of time  five reported sales that came in well below estimates  with the exception of General Motors  NYSE GM  
As delinquency rates among car loans rise to near recession levels  scrutiny regarding the practice of subprime auto lending is increasing  This is an issue for Sonic because much of the rise in auto sales has been on the back of these subprime auto loans  If any regulation is put in place restricting the ability of companies to issue these loans  expect auto dealers to suffer  especially ones like Sonic  which derive over 25  of their revenues from used car sales 
Insiders Not Selling  but Also Not Buying
In the past six months  insiders have bought 20 000 shares and sold 20 000 shares for a net of 0 shares traded 
Short Interest Not Too High
Short interest stands at 3 3 million shares  or over 10  of float

113988,335503,AN,The Recession And Bear Market Of 2016 In 2 Charts,opinion,"Good friend Michael Pollaro just sent a couple of charts that show the US economy heading for a brick wall  The first illustrates what happens when business sales  the green line  turn negative  In the previous two boom bust cycles  when sales started falling the economy either tipped into recession shortly thereafter or  it was discovered in retrospect  was already well into a contraction 
Meanwhile  junk bond yields  the blue line  start rising before recession hits and then spike during the contraction  as falling sales hit the weakest borrowers hardest  causing a wave of defaults 
Now compare the previous two busts with today  far right of the chart   Business sales turned negative a year ago and are now heading south fast  Junk yields bottomed in 2014 and are now spiking  If history is a reliable guide  the US is either in recession right now or will be within a quarter or two 
There is one difference  however  Heading into both previous financial crises short term interest rates  represented here by the Fed Funds rate  red line  were above 5   giving the central bank some leeway to cut rates and thus stimulate new borrowing  But not this time  Instead  short term rates are zero or thereabouts and the Fed has just begun a tightening cycle 
 Here s Michael s take 

What is Junk Market getting that broad equities are not getting  Oh yeah  the economy is decelerating and liquidity is being withdrawn  Basic starting point  learned from my years on the sell side  Pay attention to the junk market  That market is much smarter than the equity market 

The next chart shows the causal relationship between new factory orders and industrial production  i e   the amount of real things being produced by US factories  Again  the trend is ominous 

Michael s take 

Note how ISM New Orders leads Industrial Production  Janet  where is your accelerating economy  I guess in Health Care spending  My insurance is going up 10  next year and is up 50  in 6 years  How about yours 
No doubt autos are big part of what strength there is in manufacturing  I wonder what the recent rise in rates credit spreads might do to auto sales  then auto production  Car Max numbers may be a hint 

Speaking of CarMax 


 Fool com    The auto industry has been extremely strong in 2015  with automakers on track to report what might be their best sales figures ever  Yet coming into its fiscal third quarter report on Friday  used car specialist CarMax  NYSE KMX  hadn t enjoyed the same success that the new car segment had shown  and investors wondered whether the company s high growth phase might have come to an end  Even as new car nationwide chain counterpart AutoNation  NYSE N AN  struggles with its own internal challenges  CarMax s latest quarterly report showed signs of further deterioration in the used car arena  Let s look more closely at how CarMax did this quarter and what some shareholders are more nervous than ever about the company s future prospects 
CarMax s fiscal third quarter results were unexpectedly weak  Revenue climbed just 4 1  to  3 54 billion  falling well short of the 6  growth rate that most investors had hoped to see from the car seller  Net income fell 1 4  to  128 2 million  and that worked out to earnings of  0 63 per share  which was a nickel per share less than the consensus forecast among investors 
Looking more closely at what CarMax said about the quarter  the slowdown that investors have seen during much of 2015 continued  Total used vehicle unit sales rose 3 2   but comparable store sales of used cars fell 0 8   The company said that store traffic fell during the quarter  and the improvement in getting sales completed wasn t enough to offset that downward pressure  Wholesale vehicle sales were up nearly 7   but CarMax s tiny new car sales figures fell by more than a fifth  showing some of the same trends that AutoNation has seen pop up recently 

Car sales have joined student loans as the credit bubble du jour and will have to pop soon  given the combination of record high sales and soaring subprime lending  If used car sales are an indicator of the future of new car sales  then overall business sales and industrial production will  surprise analysts  by plunging next year ",2015-12-21,John Rubino,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-recession-and-bear-market-of-2016,-in-two-charts-376508",376508
