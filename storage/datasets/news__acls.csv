23466,244981,ACLS,Can Logitech Sustain Its Outstanding Momentum Amid Risks ,opinion,Investors have been buoyed by Logitech International S A  s   NASDAQ LOGI   recent earnings streak  as Logitech hasn t missed estimates in the trailing 19 quarters  which is a remarkable feat  We believe the thriving cloud based video conferencing services  strategic product launches and complementary acquisitions will continue to be growth drivers  going forward Backed by impressive growth drivers  the company s stock has had an impressive run on the bourse in the past year  having appreciated 36 1   ahead of the  s average growth of 12 1   We believe that the company s impressive traction across markets and strong product portfolio will drive growth Read on to find out the key drivers for the company right now Factors at PlayLogitech has been able to leverage software and go to market capabilities to drive market share gains and growth  Logitech is focused on venturing into new businesses and in the past three years  it has grown successful businesses including Bluetooth Speakers and Video Collaboration  Moreover the company s cloud based video conferencing services are also among the key catalysts  The company has manufactured innovative offerings like fastest performing mouse and keyboard switches  wireless mouse with longest battery life  With a diverse product roster and excellent demand  the company is highly confident about the market traction of its offerings  going forward Growing adoption of new mobile platforms in both mature as well as emerging markets are fueling the demand for Logitech s peripherals and accessories  The company s second quarter fiscal 2018 results were benefited by robust sales growth across Asia Pacific  along with strong momentum in Gaming and Video Collaboration businesses  For instance  the company witnessed double digit sales growth across most of its regions and main product categories Moreover  the company s solid financial health also allows it to take up acquisitions to boost core business areas  Recently  the company completed the  85 million acquisition of Astro Gaming   a popular console gaming headset maker   in a step that will help it carve a deeper niche in the gaming peripheral market  Astro Gaming is expected to enable the company to explore the console gaming market and consequently help accelerate the long term growth of its gaming business This apart  the company s successful measures to trim infrastructure spend  which are a part of its aim of focused cost control and disciplined spending  are proving conducive to margin expansion  Further  the company has been divesting non profit assets to reduce costs  Along with this  the company expects to focus on making selective investments to ensure disciplined cost management in the coming quarters Despite these positives  declining demand in the company s most profit maximizing products like desktops and diverse porting tools can be a headwind for it  Moreover  the company s sales are impacted by end user consumer demand and consequently  unanticipated shifts in consumer buying patterns can negatively affect the business Further  the market where the company operates is highly competitive and characterized by short product life cycles  constant new product introductions  rapidly changing technology  evolving customer demands along with aggressive promotional and pricing practices  Consequently  the need to bring in newer products in the market to survive the competition brings significant surges in R D expenses Considering growth drivers and the risks that the company faces  we have a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  on Logitech Stocks to Consider Some better ranked stocks from the same space include Axcelis Technologies  Inc    NASDAQ

23479,244994,ACLS,Entegris  ENTG  Hits Fresh Highs  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Entegris  ENTG   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 8 4  over the past month  ENTG hit a new 52 week high of  39 10 in the previous session  Entegris has gained 27 6  since the start of the year compared to the 9 5  move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 12 7  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 26  2018  Entegris reported EPS of  0 47 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 42 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 9  
For the current fiscal year  Entegris is expected to post earnings of  1 84 per share on  1 51 billion in revenues  This represents a 27 78  change in EPS on a 12 46  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  2 06 per share on  1 62 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 12 23  and 7 47   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Entegris may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for ENTG  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Entegris has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 21 1X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 17 6X versus its peer group s average of 13 2X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 88  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Entegris  Inc  Price and Consensus   Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Entegris currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Entegris fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though ENTG shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Entegris Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Entegris have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Ultra Clean Holdings   NASDAQ UCTT    Axcelis Technologies   NASDAQ ACLS    and MKS Instruments   NASDAQ MKSI    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 3  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ENTG  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-06-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/entegris-entg-hits-fresh-highs-is-there-still-room-to-run-200324569,200324569

23622,245137,ACLS,Nikon  NINOY  Q2 Earnings Decline Y Y On Top Line Weakness,opinion,Nikon Corporation s   OTC NINOY   second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings declined significantly over the comparable quarter last fiscal  as the company generated a net profit of  5 1 billion   45 9 million  compared with profit of  7 5 billion last year Operating income for the fiscal second quarter increased 16 5  year over year to  10 6 billion   95 5 million  For the first half of the year  net profit attributable to owners declined 37 1  over the comparable period last year  to  13 9 billion   125 2 million   This was due to decline in revenues  Earnings per share for the first half of the fiscal year came in at  35 09  slumping 37  year over year Inside the HeadlinesIn the quarter  Nikon s net sales declined 9 4  year over year to  158 1 billion   1 42 billion   The top line was negatively impacted by decline of sales volume of FPD lithography systems  which was somewhat offset by lower deficit in the Semiconductor lithography business For the first half of the fiscal  net sales fell 4 5  to  328 4 billion   2 96 billion   dragged by negative growth in Imaging Products Business as well as in Precision Equipment Business  year over year For the first half of the fiscal  sales for the Precision Equipment Business recorded a decline of 15  year over year to  98 billion   882 9 million   The segment s operating profit came to  20 1 billion  down from  25 1 billion in the prior year period  Both revenues and operating profit were dragged by decline in sales volume of FPD lithography systems The Imaging Products Business witnessed a decline in sales as the top line shrunk 1 7  year over year to  175 2 billion   1 6 billion   However  operating profit recorded an increase of 4 1  to  15 4 billion compared with  14 8 billion in the prior year period  The unit s operating profit improved on account of shifting to and focusing on high value add products in spite of market shrinkage The Healthcare Business remained relatively steady  with the top line coming in at  25 2 billion   227 million   up from sales of  24 billion recorded in the comparable quarter last year  The units  revenues were driven by impressive sales of Retina diagnostic imaging equipment outside of the United States  The segment recorded an operating loss of  2 1 billion  wider than the loss of  0 6 billion in the prior year period  The figure was dragged by upfront investments in Bioscience and ophthalmological diagnosis fields The Industrial Metrology and Others posted sales of  29 8 billion   268 5 million  in the first half of the fiscal  up from sales of  26 billion recorded in the year ago period  Increase in revenues was primarily attributable to strong performance of image measuring system and X ray inspection system for Industrial Metrology  This segment also recorded an operating profit of  1 5 billion  higher than the profit of  1 2 billion in the prior year period Nikon Corp  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Liquidity   Cash FlowAs of Sep 30  2017  Nikon s cash and cash equivalents were  327 6 billion   3 billion   up from  271 6 billion recorded a year ago Total liabilities came out to be  498 9 billion   4 5 billion   up from  455 9 billion a year ago GuidanceConcurrent with present market scenario  Nikon raised forecast for fiscal 2018  The company currently expects net sales to come at around  710 billion up from its previous forecast of  700 billion  The company anticipates sales in the Imaging Products Business to be stronger than previously expected  However  it reiterated the guidance for operating profits  which remains at about  45 billion Restructuring Plan   Business SegmentsEarlier  Nikon unveiled a plan to undertake company wide structural reform  as it seeks to enhance operational profitability and create value The restructuring was prompted by the fact that Nikon has not been able to derive value from its existing businesses  The company s Semiconductor Lithography Business Imaging Product business is still not profitable  while the Imaging Product Business has been grappling with foreign exchange headwinds In light of the above  Nikon planned to discontinue the current  Medium Term Management Plan Update   Instead  it has initiated a company wide restructuring to help shift to a strategy which pursues profit growth instead of revenue growth The plan includes reassessment of the strategy of the Semiconductor Lithography and Imaging Product Businesses  Additionally  Nikon intends to optimize manufacturing  sales and R D on a global basis along with streamlining and optimizing its workforce  As part of the initiative  Nikon stated it will be declaring a voluntary retirement program for about 1 000 employees Further  this quarter  Nikon announced some restructuring with respect to its business segments The company integrated two of its business units  Microscope Solutions BU and Medical Business Development Division into Healthcare BU  which will fall under a separate  new segment named the Healthcare Business  Further  the Industrial Metrology BU was reclassified under the new Industrial Metrology and Others segment  along with Customized Products BU  Glass BU  and Encoder BU The business structure was reorganized to facilitate collaboration and streamline operations  The Precision Equipment and Imaging Products segments remained unchanged Current Business ScenarioFor its Semiconductor Lithography Business  the company plans to cut back its investment in ArF immersion scanners and channelize these resources to other lithography systems and businesses in growth field  We believe that the company s R D initiatives make way for some breakthrough discoveries for the medical business  consequently aiding it to reap benefits in the long run However  Nikon has been suffering in recent times as its chip making equipment business has been underperforming  as it struggles with slowing demand and stiff competition with overseas rivals  The company is presently facing some risks in the Imaging Business unit  with slowdown in digital cameras interchangeable lens type  interchangeable lenses and compact digital cameras sales  Further  a rapidly shrinking market share of digital camera market is adding to the company s woes Nikon currently carries a Zacks

23629,245144,ACLS,5 Top Ranked Winning Stocks From Trump s Year One ,opinion,Even as Donald Trump completes a year in office  it is increasingly difficult to believe that his ascension on election night was initially greeted with severe trepidation  At first  Trump s advance was followed by a 900 point slump in the Dow  But on the first day of the Trump era  the Dow gained 257 points  hitting a new all time high  a feat which it has bettered on several occasions since then Over the first year of Trump s presidency  the Dow has gained more than 25  moving from 18 000 to break the 23 000 level  The S P 500 has gained nearly 21  over the same period  Economic growth has remained strong for most of this time while unemployment has fallen steadily Quarterly earnings results have also shown steady improvement with third quarter numbers largely coming in well above estimates  Meanwhile  prospects of tax cuts continue to offer catalysts for stock gains  In such a scenario  investing in top ranked stocks which have notched up strong gains over the last one year makes for a prudent option Booming Economy  Bullish EarningsDuring Trump s first year in office  nearly 1 8 million jobs have been added to the U S  economy while unemployment has dipped to a paltry 4 1   per the latest jobs report  In the second quarter  GDP increased at a 3 1  annual rate  a pace which is likely to continue for the rest of the year  According to the Commerce Department s first estimate  the U S  economy expanded at a 3  pace in the third quarter  which represents only a marginal decline from the preceding quarter   Following two successful quarters of earnings numbers  U S  companies posted all time record earnings in the third quarter  As of Nov 3  we had received Q3 results from 406 S P 500 members that combined account for 85 4  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these companies are up 7 5  from the same period last year on 6 3  higher revenues  with 73 9  beating EPS estimates and 66 7  beating revenue estimates   Read   Will the Good Times Last Given these two factors powering the economy  some market watchers have gone on to comment that the current market rally may well have been characterized as a Hillary trade had she won  But Trump has time and again claimed credit for the markets  success during his tenure  In fact the S P 500 s surge is the third best for any U S  president s first year since the Second World War  The index has hit 60 all time highs during his first year  the highest for any U S  president For sure  Trump s deregulation and tax proposal measures have enthused investors to a great extent  Additionally  his failure to repeal Obamacare and push through immigration reform has been largely ignored by investors This can only mean that the market s rally has more to do with strong earnings performances and a resilient economy than Trump s actions as president  And this is why it is likely to last longer than many naysayers project Our ChoicesStocks have posted record gains during Trump s first year as president  powered primarily by a strong economy and bullish earnings  If Trump does manage to push through his tax cuts  markets could receive yet another fillip This is why it makes good sense to invest in stocks with strong fundamentals which have racked up gains during his first year in office  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM

23632,245147,ACLS,Fujifilm  FUJIY  Braves Headwinds On Robust Growth Drivers ,opinion,We issued an updated research report on premium multinational firm  FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation   OTC FUJIY   on Aug 24 Shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock yielded a return of 2 9   as against the loss of 24 5  incurred by the   in a month s time Notably  the attractiveness of this stock as a safe investment bet is further accentuated by its favorable  Score  A  Existing ScenarioIncreased inventory investment in the United States  expansionary policies undertaken by the Chinese government authorities  improving employability  and corporate earnings in Japan and gradual economic recovery of certain European and Asian end markets helped in bolstering Fujifilm s revenues and profitability over the past few quarters  The company anticipates benefiting from these tailwinds even in the quarters ahead  However  geopolitical risks in Germany and Brexit induced uncertainties in Europe are expected to drag overseas revenues and profitability in the near term Fujifilm had implemented a medium term management program from Apr 1  2014 through Mar 31  2017  Under this  the company boosted its financials on the back of sturdy healthcare  document and highly functional market demand  strategic sales promotion activities  and advanced product launches  The company noted that its stellar revenues and earnings performance in first quarter fiscal 2018  ended Mar 31  2017  was primarily stemmed by the benefits accrued from this program  Fujifilm mentioned that it would continue to reinforce its overall competency  moving ahead  on the back of another new medium term management plan  to be announced on Aug 30  2017  Fujifilm has always tried to reinforce its business on the back of strategic business acquisitions  For instance  acquired assets of Cellular Dynamics International and Ultra Pure Solutions have been strengthening the company s regenerative medicine business and competency in the semiconductor trading domain respectively since acquired in fiscal 2016  Also  in April 2017  the company acquired Wako Pure Chemical Industries in a bid to fortify its Fine Chemical business  The company noted that Wako acquisition helped boost sales of its chemical and reagents products in the fiscal first quarter  Fujifilm anticipates that it would further improve revenues and realize decent amount of synergies on the back of the Wako integration in the near term The company even believes that its new contract wins and constant attempt to improve operational efficacy will likely support top  and bottom line growth trajectory  moving ahead  For instance  the company noted that it would soon roll out the Work Style Innovation program  which will likely help augment the productivity of its workforce  Moreover  the receipt of seven new Synapse Enterprise Imaging U S  contracts will play a key role in fortifying the company s Imaging Solutions business over the long term However  we notice that overseas business expansion exposes Fujifilm to risks of unfavorable foreign currency translation  For instance  the company stated that operating income of its Documents Solutions business plunged 28 1  year over year in the fiscal first quarter  primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign currency translation  We believe that currency headwinds such as appreciation of the Japanese Yen or depreciation of Asian currencies might continue to hurt the company s profitability even in the quarters ahead Additionally  each business segment of Fujifilm faces stiff competition  Extensive business rivalry increases the bargaining power of end users and thus  exposes the company to risks of market share loss Furthermore  Fujifilm noticed that revenues of its Oceania end markets weakened in the fiscal first quarter due to dismal sales volume of office products and office printer businesses  Also  poor demand for small monochrome models adversely affected results in Asia  Reduced Oceania and Asian sales have been depressing the company s Documents Solutions business performance for the past few quarters  Persistence of this dismal trend might dent the company s aggregate top line performance  moving ahead Stocks to ConsiderA few better ranked stocks in the industry are listed below Applied Optoelectronics  Inc    NASDAQ AAOI   delivered an average

Balance Sheet
As of Dec 31  2016  cash and cash equivalents were  139 6 million compared with  32 8 million a year ago

Guidance
Acacia expects second quarter 2017 revenues in the range of  108  114 million  Non GAAP earnings are anticipated to be in the range of 22 35 cents per share for the quarter 
Revenues are expected to decline 21 7  sequentially  mostly due to softening demand from China

The company also anticipates a rise in operating expense in the second quarter  This is because some outside silicon under repayment and some development payments are due with milestones for their 16 nanometer development process due in the second quarter

Acacia has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

Existing Scenario
Fujifilm has been enhancing its competency by commencing new and advanced businesses through strategic mergers and acquisitions  as well as flexible rearrangement of its internal resources and organization  It also intends to boost near term profitability on the back of greater operational efficiency  Under this  the company checks the effectiveness of its research and development expenses  realigns production and development systems  and constantly tries to minimize input costs and equipment manufacturing expenses Moreover  Fujifilm noted that it would soon introduce the  Work Style Innovation  program that would help augment the productivity of its workforce  The company anticipates accruing operating income worth  185 billion in fiscal 2018  estimating a 7 4  of year over year increment  Notably  it intends to satisfy the interests of shareholders through improved dividend and share buyback offers However  over the last three months  Fujifilm s shares lost 9 69   wider than the loss of 8 11  incurred by the Zacks categorized  industry 

The company generates a large proportion of its revenues from international operations  However  overseas business expansion exposes Fujifilm to risks of unfavorable foreign current translation  For instance  it noted that the top line performance of its Imaging Solutions and Information Solutions segment was hurt due to appreciation of the Japanese Yen in fiscal 2017  
In addition  depreciation of few local currencies in the Asian end markets weighed over the revenues of the company s Document Solutions segment in the fiscal 2017  Negative foreign currency impact might continue to depress this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s results in the upcoming quarters

Axcelis Technologies  Inc  CEO s Comments

 Since the start of the year we have made significant progress on our penetration plans  placing Purion products in thirteen new customer fabs  including seven new customers and six new fabs for existing customers   said President and CEO Mary Puma   These Purion penetrations position Axcelis for success as the industry enters a strong investment cycle  creating a strong foundation for growth in both 2017 and 2018  
 We remain focused on executing against gross margin initiatives that have already delivered solid increases in Purion product margins  Since ramping production of the full Purion product line with the Purion H in Q1 of 2015  system standard margins have improved 680 basis points on a rolling four quarter average   added Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Kevin Brewer   These actions along with additional planned improvements should allow us to achieve our goal of 40  gross margins by the end of 2017
