3895,225410,R,Exclusive  UPS weighs strategy to deliver bulky goods to boost growth,news,"By Eric M  Johnson  Reuters     United Parcel  Service Inc  N UPS  is in talks with at least one U S  trucking firm to launch an in home delivery service for large  heavy goods such as couches and treadmills  as the world s largest package deliverer looks to cash in on one the fastest growing segments of online retail  UPS and its rival FedEx Corp  N FDX  currently deliver parcels up to 150 pounds  68 04 kg  in weight to a person s door step  and neither carries packages into a person s home or handles so called  white glove  services such as product assembly or installation  UPS told Reuters it is now eyeing the furniture delivery business   one of the fastest growing segments of online retail   with Amazon com Inc  O AMZN    Wayfair Inc   N W  and other e commerce companies competing for market share against chains like Crate and Barrel and big box stores  A source familiar with the matter said UPS is in talks to hire trucking company Werner Enterprises  O WERN  to help it compete in this area  potentially by the end of the year  Werner launched its  final mile  service in 2016  and has been building it out over the last year  Details of a potential partnership remain unclear given the early stages of the discussions  the source added   Werner declined to comment on the matter  and UPS would not identify who it is in talks with  Final mile delivery is a market that Transport Futures economist Noel Perry said could grow to about  12 billion over the next decade  from about  3 7 billion today  thanks in large part to a growing appetite from younger consumers to buy everything from BBQ grills and mattresses to dining room tables online   Outsourcing to a trucking firm would allow UPS to enter into the final mile business without committing its own capital up front to expand its fleet or acquire end of line  final mile infrastructure such as terminals   R W  Baird analyst Ben Hartford said   That could be welcome news to UPS investors waiting on Chief Executive David Abney s promise to deliver higher margins by pumping billions of dollars into network upgrades and expansions   When asked about the strategy with bulky goods in an interview with Reuters  UPS Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber said the company has decided it can t ignore the rising demand for in home deliveries of furniture  mattresses  and treadmills  and was evaluating different ways to handle the larger cargo   You got bigger products moving through networks across the globe   said Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber   What we have to do is try and figure out the right way to get them in the right network as we move forward   Barber did not confirm talks with any specific company  and said that UPS has not made a final decision  because you have to balance it with our Express network  our labor constraints and our strategy going forward    Other trucking players include Schneider National  N SNDR    Ryder System Inc   N R   Seko Logistics  and J B  Hunt  which have expanded final mile capabilities organically or through partnerships and acquisitions in recent years  hoping to lure major retailers with their scale  Schneider and  XPO Logistics   N XPO   the largest provider of final mile bulky deliveries in North America  told Reuters they had not met with UPS to discuss handling final mile deliveries  J B  Hunt and Ryder declined to comment  Seko did not immediately respond to a request for comment  As it is now  most of the major trucking and logistics firms in this final mile bulky goods business hire regional contract carriers   and there are hundreds nationwide   to haul products from warehouses to living rooms across the country  If UPS moves forward  it would give UPS  retail customers including Wayfair  Amazon com  Walmart Inc  N WMT   IKEA AB and  Target  Corp  N TGT  a  big and heavy option  in their online shipping portals so consumers can receive shipments across the country  the source said   It could also set up UPS to hit its goal of being a one stop shipping partner for retailers while also solving the problem of sofa sized boxes unexpectedly showing up in trailers they pick up from retailer warehouses and take to parcel sorting hubs   UPS has worked for years to limit the sizes of unwieldy   or  non conveyable    items as it invests to speed up its package sorting operation  It charges big premiums to handle the freight   UPS main rival FedEx said in March the expansion of its Memphis hub will include an area for oversized shipments and announced it bought UK based deliverer P2P Mailing Limited  But a company spokesman said FedEx does not yet do in home heavy goods deliveries in the United States  BULKY RISKS Entering the bulk goods delivery business adds new complexities and risks compared to traditional parcel delivery  For example  hauling a dresser to an upstairs bedroom and assembling it is a more intricate and physically demanding affair than dropping off a pallet at a warehouse s loading dock  XPO Logistics  Chief Information Officer Mario Harik said in an interview it was training drivers on etiquette and how to use mobile devices to log deliveries and customer complaints for large or heavy deliveries   Truckers can charge more for  white glove  services   which include varying degrees of installation  product assembly  and repairs   but the margins are often no better than other types of deliveries because stiff competition for new business has held down the prices carriers can charge retailers   But deliverers are hoping they can hike prices and boost margins as they increase delivery  density   or the number of deliveries they make in a region on a given day  said Hartford  the R W  Baird analyst   Heavy goods deliveries through UPS would likely include two workers willing to spend 20 minutes in a home  versus more complex installation and repairs  the source said  
UPS declined to discuss the growth potential  but the source familiar with the strategy said UPS was looking initially for a trucking partner that could make or manage as many as  tens of thousands  of deliveries daily ",2018-05-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-ups-weighs-strategy-to-deliver-bulky-goods-to-boost-growth-1426579,1426579

110564,332079,R,Ryder launches asset sharing platform for commercial vehicles,news,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT  Reuters    U S  truck leasing and rental company  Ryder System Inc   NYSE R  said on Tuesday it is launching an asset sharing platform for commercial vehicles  paving the way for owners to rent out under utilized vehicles from vans to big rigs the same way consumers use apps to share cars and homes 
Ryder has been testing its new platform  called COOP  in the Atlanta area since January with 100 vehicle fleet owners and will formally roll it out in that market in April  Miami based Ryder expects to roll it out in several other major U S  markets in 2019 
Chief Executive Officer Robert Sanchez told Reuters that Ryder s telematics data from the 200 000 vehicles it leases and rents to fleet customers showed that around 25 percent of them sit idle more than one day a week 
Companies that lease trucks still have to pay for them even when they are idle  representing a fixed cost COOP can offset  he said 
 We saw this as a way to take the disruptive trend of asset sharing and ride sharing and apply it to trucks that are not being fully utilized   Sanchez said  likening the service to short term accommodation rental company Airbnb Inc 
Automakers are rushing to develop car sharing services in the belief that future consumers would rather make short term use of those assets than own them outright 
COOP handles insurance  compliance with federal requirements and payments  which Ryder says have hampered past efforts to grow peer to peer asset sharing services  Ryder s new service will charge a percentage of the rental revenue 
CEO Sanchez said rentals on COOP range from one day up to 30 days  The system uses an app showing renters the location and size of available vehicles in their area 
Lake City  Georgia based automotive supplier Dixien  LLC  which provides metal stamped parts and molded plastic parts to automakers and top tier suppliers has used COOP in its test phase 
Company vice president Alex Garcia said Dixien has two leased 26 foot  8 meter  trucks it uses to haul parts between facilities on Monday through Thursday  They sit idle the rest of the time 
Garcia has rented those trucks out twice from Friday to Sunday and said if he can rent them out every weekend  it will make a huge dent  in his leasing costs 
This could enable him to add trucks to Dixien s fleet  because on the days when I use them I need more than I have  ",2018-03-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/ryder-launches-assetsharing-platform-for-commercial-vehicles-1363789,1363789

 NEW YORK  Oct 22  Reuters    The Dow industrials gained on
Thursday on strong earnings reports from several components 
while the Nasdaq fell on weakness in Ericsson and other
technology names 
 A number of Dow members reported better than expected
results  with 3M Co  Travelers Cos Inc  AT T Inc and McDonald s
Corp all rallying on profit beats 
 While more than 70 percent of S P 500 companies have
exceeded expectations so far this earnings season  according to
Thomson Reuters data  investors are concerned the market has
overvalued future prospects in a weak economic environment 
  The market has risen so much that earnings would need to
gain another 50 percent to make it fairly valued   said Joseph
Battipaglia  market strategist at Stifel Nicolaus in Yardley 
Pennsylvania   More and more  earnings aren t packing the same
punch they used to  
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 47 31 points  or
0 48 percent  to 9 996 89  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index rose
0 23 points  or 0 02 percent  to 1 081 63  The Nasdaq Composite

gains  Apple stock fell 0 4 percent to  204 19 
 Also pressuring the market was an unexpected increase in
weekly jobless claims 
  We ve built up expectations that we re going to have a
robust recovery  but the data isn t substantiating that  
Battipaglia said 
  Anything less than the idea of a V shaped recovery  which
would mean falling claims  throws cold water on the ongoing
rally

The Miami based transportation and supply chain management provider lowered its earnings estimate  after reporting lower than expected earnings growth over its current quarter in its fleet management solutions division  The company also said on Monday that it is experiencing lower demand than expected among its used vehicle division 
Consequently  Ryder System expects to report comparable per share earnings between 1 72 and 1 74 for its current quarter  down from previous forecasts of 1 82 to 1 87 for the three month period  Analysts expect Ryder System to report comparable earnings of 1 86 per share  including exclusions for one time items 
 We are confident that during the fourth quarter we will resolve the temporary execution issue related to our unprecedented growth  We have adjusted our technician labor model to accommodate this growth and are reducing out of service vehicles to a normalized level   Ryder Systems CEO Robert Sanchez said in a statement   The lower outlook also accounts for our expectations of the used vehicle sales environment  In commercial rental  we anticipate continued strong demand  as evidenced by recent trends and supported by growth in the overall customer base  
 We are pleased that we continue to deliver increased year over year earnings  while also realizing strong top line revenue growth driven by secular outsourcing trends and the enhancements we ve made to our sales and marketing efforts  
Despite the subdued earnings outlook  Sanchez is optimistic that strong growth among the company s leasing division can partially offset the losses in other segments  For the entire year  Ryder System expects to realize lease fleet growth between 5 000 and 6 000  falling near the high end of prior estimates 
The company now expects to have full year earnings per share of 6 17 to 6 29  down from previous forecasts of 6 45 to 6 55 per share

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Ryder shares have added about 23 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5

AMAT    Ubiquiti   NASDAQ UI   and Aspen Technology   NASDAQ AZPN   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Anaplan  Inc  has beat on the estimate all five quarters since it went public at the end of 2018  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is expected to grow revenue in the double digits both this year and next Anaplan runs a subscription based platform in the category of Connected Planning  Its large global customers use the platform to connect people  data and plans to allow real time planning and decision making The company has 20 global offices and more than 1 300 customers worldwide Another Beat in the Fiscal Third QuarterOn Nov 21  Anaplan reported its third quarter fiscal 2020 results and beat the Zacks Consensus for the fifth quarter in a row  It hasn t missed since its 2018 IPO Earnings were a loss of  0 08 versus the Zacks Consensus of a loss of  0 13 Anaplan is a growth company and you can see that in the revenue which jumped 44  to  89 4 million year over year  Subscription revenue rose 47  to  79 7 million While it still saw a loss per share  it has been cutting that in the year over year numbers  The  0 08 loss in fiscal 2020 was down from the  0 18 loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 It has cash and cash equivalents on hand of  310 8 million Raised Full Year GuidanceGiven yet another beat and the hot revenue numbers  it s not surprising that the company raised its full year outlook Total revenue is now expected to be between  346 to  347 million  up from prior guidance of  339 to  343 million  That s revenue growth of 44 1  Non GAAP operating

the last 3 months  they have been treading water  and are actually down 2 3  The  pause  in the rally could be a buying opportunity for those looking for a mid cap tech growth name For those investors looking for new technology names  Anaplan is one to keep on the short list  Ryder System  Inc  is still growing revenue but saw an earnings loss in the third quarter thanks to a change in vehicle residual value estimates of all power vehicles  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is expected to see earnings decline 81  in 2019 Ryder operates in commercial fleet management  dedicated transportation and supply chain solutions Another Beat in the Third QuarterOn Oct 29  Ryder reported its third quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents  Earnings were  1 52 versus the

billion a year ago  Dedicated Transportation Services also saw a 5  gain to  359 million  Only Supply Chain Solutions saw a drop  of 2   to  618 million So what s the problem The used vehicle market softened in late second quarter and intensified in the third quarter which led to a triggering review and change in residual value estimates on all power vehicles The earnings outlook was adjusted downward even as it expects solid revenue growth New Full Year GuidanceThe most significant negative impact to earnings will be in the third quarter  and is expected to decline each quarter after that but fourth quarter 2019 isn t going to be a picnic either As a result  the full year 2019 EPS forecast was revised down to between  1 00 and  1 10   9 estimates were revised lower  sending the Zacks Consensus down to  1 06 from  5 64  That s an 81  decline from 2018 s  5 79 2020 s Zacks Consensus was also cut dramatically to  2 60 from  5 99 60 days ago  2 more estimates were even cut in the last month which could indicate that the used vehicle market remains soft Shares Under Perform the S P 500 in 2019It s been a roller coaster ride ever since shares hit a new 52 week low at the end of December 2018 They ve gained just 7 6  in 2019  under performing the S P 500 which is up 24  during that same time period However  the company is shareholder friendly  It has paid a quarterly cash dividend for 43 years  or 173 consecutive quarters It s currently yielding an impressive 4 2  But with the earnings guidance cut  the shares now look  expensive  on a P E basis as they are trading at

state oil firm Aramco The IPO will be the elephant in the OPEC meeting room because the oil price at the time will be key to the listing  expected in mid December A year ago  OPEC and non OPEC countries agreed to lower crude supply by 1 2 million barrels per day to prop up prices in the face of slowing oil demand  In July  they extended that deal until March 2020 Seasoned OPEC watchers know never to exclude the possibility of a surprise decision but sources within the group seem pretty sure the supply cut pact will be extended further into 2020  After all  an oil price tumble is

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Ryder due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Ryder s Q1 Earnings   Revenues Surpass EstimatesThe company s adjusted earnings of  1 11 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents  The bottom line also improved on a year over year basis on revenue growth and a better operating performance Total revenues grossed  2 180 million  above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 131 million  The top line also rose 15  year over year with growth across all segments  As the company is investing substantially in its lease and rental fleets  capital expenditures  net  soared 62 6  year over year to  1 01 billion during the first quarter of 2019  Operating cash flow was  485 million in the reported quarter  up 43 9  Segmental ResultsFleet Management Solutions  Total revenues amounted to  1 35 billion  up 9  year over year  Operating revenues  excluding fuel  summed  1 14 billion  up 10  year over year  Increase of 15  and 8   each in commercial rental and ChoiceLease revenues  drove this segmental performance Dedicated Transportation Solutions  Total revenues came in at  349 6 million  up 17  from the year ago quarter  Operating revenues  excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation  also rose 17  to  235 6 million on the back of volume growth  new businesses and customer expansions Supply Chain Solutions   Total revenues were  635 7 million  up 28  year over year  Operating revenues  excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation  improved 25  year over year to  477 1 million  Segmental results were boosted by volume growth  new businesses  higher pricing and the acquisition of MXD Group  completed last April LiquidityThe company exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  62 8 million compared with  68 1 million at the end of 2018  As of Mar 31  2019  the company had total debt of  7 1 billion compared with  6 6 billion at 2018 end Q2   2019 OutlookFor the second quarter  Ryder estimates adjusted earnings of  1 34  1 44 per share  lower than  1 46 reported in the year ago period  Based on healthy demand conditions  the company has raised its full year adjusted earnings forecast to  6 05  6 35 per share from  6  6 30  expected earlier  This compares with  5 97 per share reported in the prior year  While the current year earnings guidance is encouraging  the company s free cash flow projection is projected to be a negative of  1 1 billion in the year 
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates  The consensus estimate has shifted  8 08  due to these changes 
VGM Scores
At this time  Ryder has a great Growth Score of A  though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C  However  the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side  putting it in the top 20  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook

110689,332204,R,Ryder  R  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Ryder  R  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This truck leasing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 40 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 26 billion  up 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 52  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ryder 
For Ryder  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 07  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Ryder will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ryder would post earnings of  0 99 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 11  delivering a surprise of  12 12  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Ryder appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ryder-r-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200443256,200443256

This truck leasing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 6 34  
For the last reported quarter  Ryder came out with earnings of  1 11 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 99 per share  representing a surprise of 12 12   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 81 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 82 per share  delivering a surprise of 0 55  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Ryder  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Ryder has an Earnings ESP of  0 07  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on July 30  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

110712,332227,R,As Transportation Stocks Reclaim The Spotlight  3 Look Set To Charge Higher,opinion,"It s been a roaring start to the year for equities  The benchmark S P 500 and blue chip Dow Industrials are both up at least 11  in 2019  each recovering from a massive drop as 2018 came to a close 
The rally has been helped for the most part by the Federal Reserve s recent dovish shift  which last month sent the clearest signal yet that its three year drive to tighten monetary policy is close to an end 

While Wall Street has been busily focusing on the once sexy  tech sector FAANGs  there s a more old fashioned corner of the market that s quietly been outperforming the major averages  To little fanfare  the Dow Transports have gained 15 4  so far this year  thanks mostly to the rebound seen in the broader market  proving the truth of the old adage   a rising tide lifts all boats  
As well  renewed analyst interest in the space helped boost the sector 

Of the 20 stocks in this group  considered the lifeblood of the economy and an important pillar for the stock market  three names looked poised to charge higher in the months ahead due to a number of positive factors  including upbeat full year earnings outlooks and a bullish technical picture 
 1  Avis Budget Group 
Avis Budget Group Inc  NASDAQ CAR  is a leading rental car provider to the commercial segment  serving business travelers at major airports around the world  The company operates a variety of brands including Avis  Budget Rent a Car  Budget Truck Rental and Zipcar  which it acquired for  491 million in January 2013 
Investors have warmed up to Avis after the stock shed almost half its value during 2018  as most of the headwinds the company is facing  include increasing competition from rivals like Hertz Global  NYSE HTZ  and ride hailing companies like Uber  appear priced in  according to Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino 
In a research note published on Feb  11 ahead of the company s Q4 report  Tamberrino upgraded Avis to buy all the way from sell and hiked his 12 month price target on the stock to  35 from  30  He also said 

 With CAR s valuation below historical averages  we see an opportunity for the company s multiple to mean revert as we believe data points on volumes and pricing are stabilizing and the company can start realizing benefits from cost savings actions  

Avis shares plunged nearly 49  last year  notching their worst annual performance since 2008  The stock has rallied roughly 57  so far in 2019 

It posted a big fourth quarter earnings beat on Feb  20  Earnings per share jumped 18  to 53 cents  much higher than consensus estimates of 37 cents  Revenue grew 2  to  2 05 billion  broadly in line with expectations 
Another positive figure for investors to digest  Avis  Americas per unit fleet costs declined 7  during the fourth quarter  excluding exchange rate impacts  Moreover  Avis is optimistic about 2019  estimating revenue between  9 2 and  9 5 billion  and earnings between  3 35 per share and  4 20 per share 
Despite its recent stock price rebound  shares which closed yesterday at  35 44 are still attractive as the rental car specialist looks set to enjoy expanding margins  Nonetheless  it must figure out how to adapt to ride sharing and other changing trends in the rapidly evolving automotive transport industry 
From a technical perspective  Avis shares rose above their 200 day moving average on Feb  21  the first time its been above that level since June 2018  indicating buyers are in control 
2  Ryder Systems
Ryder Systems  NYSE R  is one of the largest U S  transportation rental and leasing services  known especially for its fleet of rental trucks  It s been a stellar year for the Miami  FL based company  with shares rising almost 29

The company saw revenue growth in all key segments and expects this to continue in 2019  boding well for the future  Fleet management solutions revenue was up 11  with operating income rising 10   thanks to growth in its ChoiceLease rental service division 
The company also saw success in the fourth quarter from used vehicle sales  Units held for sale were at 6 900  up 900 units compared to 12 months ago  Proceeds per unit were up 18  for tractors and 8  for trucks 
Even when taking into account the strong rally at the start of the year  the stock  which closed at  62 yesterday  is still well below its 2018 peak levels  suggesting it has further room to run  It needs to rise above its key 200DMA near the  72 level in order to confirm the next breakout 
3  Norfolk Southern
Norfolk Southern Corporation  NYSE NSC  is a holding company engaged in the rail transportation business  primarily in the U S  Southeast  East and Midwest  The company s bullish guidance for 2019 and beyond is the main reason shares have gained about 21  so far this year  The stock closed yesterday at  180 51

110714,332229,R,Delta  DAL  To Report Q1 Earnings  A Beat In The Offing ,opinion,"Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   is scheduled to report first quarter 2019 results on Apr 10  before market open The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last reported quarter  Also  it boasts an impressive earnings history  having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  the average being 4 2  
Things seem to be looking up for the company this soon to be reported quarter as well with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter earnings being revised 1 2  upward over the last 7 days 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Delta is likely to beat on earnings this reporting cycle  as it has the perfect combination of the following two key ingredients 
Earnings ESP  Delta has an  of  0 54   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Delta currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Notably  the stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 have significantly higher chances of beating estimates 
Thus  the above combination makes us reasonably confident of a likely earnings surprise in the upcoming reporting cycle 
Conversely  stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions Delta Air Lines  Inc  Price
 

   Factors Likely at Play
On the unit revenue front  Delta is expected to perform well despite headwinds like the 35 day partial government shutdown  In fact  the carrier expects total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  to increase approximately 2   The upside can be primarily attributed to healthy corporate travel demand  Moreover  the extension of the credit card deal between Delta and American Express   NYSE AXP   is likely to first quarter TRASM to the tune of 1 point 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  is pegged at 14 78 cents  above 14 74 cents reported a year ago  However  the estimate is below 15 43 cents registered in the fourth quarter of 2018 
For first quarter TRASM  the consensus mark stands at 16 70 cents  lower than 17 18 cents posted fourth quarter 2018  The partial government shutdown  which resulted in fewer government contractors and employees traveling  might be responsible for the lower projection  After all  Delta s CEO Ed Bastian had mentioned that the longest ever political standoff did cost the company  25 million in revenues during January  2019 
However  with oil prices declining in excess of 20  from the highs of  76 a barrel touched in October 2018 levels  operating expenses should be reduced  thereby supporting bottom line growth  Average fuel price is estimated between  2 03 and  2 08 per gallon for soon to be  reported quarter  The mid point of the guided range is much lower than the  2 42 posted in the fourth quarter of 2018 
Moreover  cost control measures have aided non fuel costs  The metric for the soon to be reported quarter is expected to either remain flat or increase up to 0 5  year over year  This should aid bottom line growth as well 
Other Stocks to Consider
Investors interested in the Zacks  sector may also consider Ryder System   NYSE R   and Werner Enterprises   NYSE R   as these stocks too possess the right mix of elements to beat on earnings in the next releases 
Ryder has an Earnings ESP of  3 44  and a Zacks Rank of 3  The company is scheduled to release first quarter earnings on Apr 30 
Werner Enterprises has an Earnings ESP of  1 75  and a Zacks Rank of 3  The company will report its first quarter financial numbers on Apr 25  You can see

110752,332267,R,Ryder  R  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Ryder  R  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 14  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This truck leasing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 81 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  32 1  
Revenues are expected to be  2 17 billion  up 12  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ryder 
For Ryder  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ryder will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ryder would post earnings of  1 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 64  delivering a surprise of  0 61  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Ryder doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ryder-r-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200385058,200385058

What s Next for Ryder 
While Ryder has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Ryder was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

110788,332303,R,The S P 500 Is Overvalued These 10 Dividend Growth Stocks Are Not  Part 3 ,opinion,"Introduction
This is the third of a five part series presenting 50 dividend growth stocks that I have screened for current fair value  With this article  I will be covering 10 additional dividend growth research candidates with moderate to higher yields in addition to the initial 20 that I presented in part 1 and part 2  This will be the last part of this series where I am primarily presenting dividend growth stocks with current dividend yields of 3  or better 
As I have been moving down the dividend yield curve  the reader might notice that both historical and estimated earnings growth and or cash flow growth will be higher on many of these companies  Therefore  there will be several candidates in this group that I believe can generate above average total long term returns in addition to consistent dividend growth  Nevertheless  the future total return will be a function of the relative current valuation in conjunction with each company s earnings and dividend growth potential 
The Ying and Yang of Valuation
Since this part 3 represents the middle of this five part series  I felt it only appropriate to provide insights into the opposite of fair or attractive valuation  On many occasions throughout this series  I alluded to finding value in an otherwise generally overvalued market  Therefore  I offer the following earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs on the S P 500 
For those not familiar with FAST Graphs  there are three important lines on the graph that I would like to focus the reader s attention on  The first two lines  orange and dark blue  represent important valuation references 
The orange line is generated based on a widely accepted formula for valuing a business   or in this case the S P 500  What s important to note is that the orange line on this graph is calculated as a P E ratio of 15  To be clear  each year s earnings reported at the bottom of the graph are plotted as a multiple of 15  Therefore  the orange line is a P E ratio of 15 across the entire graph  This reference line is offered as a theoretical fair or optimum value calculation 
The dark blue line is essentially a normal P E ratio calculated as a trimmed average over this time frame  Trimmed average simply means that one high and one low valuation is removed to normalize this valuation reference  However  please note that the normal P E is exaggeratedly high due to the initial high valuations  The dark blue color coded rectangle in the  FAST FACTS  boxes to the right of the graph indicate that the dark blue line  the normal P E ratio that the market has applied over this time frame  is drawn as an historically normal multiple of 18 5 
The third line I draw the reader s attention to is the black line  which is simply a plotting of the S P 500 s monthly closing stock prices over this timeframe  Consequently  whenever the price is above the dark blue line is a time when the S P 500 s P E ratio is above 18 5  and when the price is above the orange line is a time when the S P 500 s P E ratio is above 15  Simply stated  this represents a rational and or normal valuation range for the S P 500 since 1999 
With these perspectives in mind  important insights into the S P 500 s historical and current valuation are revealed  For starters  we see the effects of extreme valuations for the S P 500 during the  irrational exuberance  time frame 1999 through 2000  Utilizing the built in FAST Graphs return calculator I have included a performance calculation on the S P 500 from its peak valuation in September 2000 to its trough valuation on April 30  2009 
It should be obvious and clear to the reader that this was not an optimum time to be invested in the S P 500 index  More importantly  it should also be obvious and clear that the principal culprit that led to such poor long term returns for the S P 500 can be primarily attributed to overvaluation  Of course  negative earnings growth over the time frame 2007 through 2009 also contributed to what has been referred to as the  lost decade  

With this next screenshot of the S P 500 I provide a calculation of performance from its trough valuation on March 31  2009 to its current high valuation on its April 11  2018 closing value  I suggest that this provides a clear and factual illustration of the extreme importance of valuation as it relates to long term performance 
Furthermore  there are additional insights that this second example also provides  Close examination reveals that the market rationally tracked the orange fair valuation reference line through September 2013 from which it has become more and more overvalued to current time 
Importantly  we also can see that valuation has gone outside of its historically normal range  the 15 P E ratio orange line and the 18 5 normal P E ratio dark blue line   This clearly illustrates why I have been suggesting that we are now in an overheated  overvalued  stock market  Additionally  the reader is also given a perspective of just how  long in the tooth  this bull market has gotten  Moreover  I would further suggest that based on its current valuation  now is not a good time to be investing in the S P 500 index 
As an interesting aside  readers may also find it valuable to review the article I published on April 7  2011 titled  Q1 2011  The S P is Fairly Valued  
This article was published during a time when investor sentiment was quite negative  Moreover  the comment thread in this article might be more valuable to read than the article itself 

Most  Dividend Aristocrats  are Currently Overvalued
Next I offer an earnings and price correlated FAST Graph on the Dividend Aristocrat and Champion General Dynamics Corporation  NYSE GD  as a clear example of overvaluation  I chose this specific example because it offers several significant aspects and lessons on the importance of valuation  From 1999 through July 2008  General Dynamics  stock price was clearly tracking earnings  In other words  where earnings went  price followed 
However  the Great Recession that followed brought on an extended period of extreme undervaluation  I believe this speaks loudly to the point I made in part 1 as follows   Unfortunately  although I believe it is inevitable that stocks will move into alignment with true worth valuation  the exact timing of that occurrence is unpredictable   With this example  it took the better part of five years before General Dynamics  stock price inevitably moved back into alignment with fair value  back to the orange line  
In contrast  starting in October 2016 to current time  General Dynamics has clearly become significantly overvalued relative to both historical norms and rational intrinsic value calculations  Consequently  I now contend that General Dynamics has become dangerously overvalued  But once again  there is no way to predict precisely when price might move back into alignment with fair value  On the other hand  I do believe it is an inevitability

The following portfolio review provides a summary of important metrics for the next 10 highest yielding  fairly valued research candidates  The reader should note that the last 2 columns  light brown  provide annualized total return estimates based on the consensus 3 to 5 years trend line analyst estimates of either cash flows or earnings  The first light brown column provides total annual return estimates based on earnings  and the second light brown column provides total annual return estimates based on cash flows 
It s also important that the reader understands that the primary attributes that each of these 10 research candidates have in common is fair valuation coupled with a higher yield than the average company  Moreover  each individual candidate will not necessarily be an appropriate investment for every dividend growth investor  I believe is vitally important that each investor builds portfolios according to their own unique goals  objectives and risk tolerances  For example  some of these candidates might be appropriate to boost the yield of an existing portfolio while others might be more appropriate for investors seeking a higher total long term return  Therefore  I suggest that readers might pick and or choose to examine only those that meet their own personal needs  I will be elaborating more on this important aspect in the FAST Graphs analyze out loud video to follow

In the following video  I will briefly illustrate why I believe each of these 10 research candidates are currently fairly valued  Additionally  I will provide commentary on what type of portfolio or dividend growth investor they may be appropriate for  Furthermore  a word of caution relative to recent market volatility is also in order  With the stock market fluctuating as much as it recently has been  valuations and current dividend yields are presently very dynamic 

Summary and Conclusions
Most of the fairly valued dividend growth stock research candidates presented thus far have offered moderate to high current yields  As a result  many of these candidates provide low or perhaps only moderate future capital return potential  Consequently  most of these companies would be most appropriate to those dividend growth investors desirous of current income 
However  as I move down the yield curve into Part 4 and finally Part 5  we will begin to discover dividend growth stocks with higher historical and forecast earnings growth rates  Consequently  I believe that readers will find greater total return opportunities among the candidates presented in these forthcoming articles 
Finally  please remember that as a rule  and there are always exceptions to every rule   investors generally face a trade off between growth and income  This same principle applies to risk  In theory  investors must be willing to take on greater risk to achieve higher rates of return  These principles speak directly to why investors need to invest according to their own goals  objectives  and risk tolerances

110844,332359,R,Ryder System  R  To Report Q2 Earnings  Is A Beat In Store ,opinion,"Florida based Ryder System  Inc    NYSE R    one of the world s largest providers of integrated logistics and transportation solutions  is scheduled to report second quarter 2017 results on Jul 26  before the market opens 
Last quarter  the company s earnings failed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a substantial 2 4   Ryder has outpaced estimates in two of the past four quarters  with an average earnings miss of 5 9  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise  
Our proven model shows that Ryder is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of the two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP  Ryder has an  of  3 23   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 96 cents  higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents  A positive Earnings ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  
Zacks Rank  Ryder holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which increases the predictive power of the ESP  Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2 or 3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates 
However  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
The combination of  the company s Zacks Rank  2 and  3 23  ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat on Jul 26 Ryder System  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Reasons for Better than Expected Earnings
The company s efforts to grow its lease fleet are impressive  The continuous rise in ChoiceLease revenues is encouraging  which is driving growth at Ryder s primary division   Fleet Management Solutions  The company is poised to achieve or even exceed its 2017 guidance for lease fleet growth of 3 500 vehicles 
Ryder s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividend payments look promising  In Jul 2016  the company hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 7 3  to  0 44 per share  This was the twelfth hike by the company since 2005  It continues to boost shareholders wealth by paying uninterrupted dividend for more than 40 years 
The company s strong customer base is also a positive  Moving ahead  we believe Ryder s top line in the second quarter should benefit from a strong product portfolio 
However  softness pertaining to commercial rental demand might hurt overall results  Furthermore  the demand for used vehicles is expected to remain soft until mid 2018   The company s high debt levels also raise concerns 
The price performance of Ryder System was depressing for the last six months  The stock witnessed a loss of 3 2  as opposed to 6 9  growth of its  

Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other companies from the above industry you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Skywest  Inc    NASDAQ SKYW   has an earnings ESP of  3 45  and holds a Zacks Rank  1  It is scheduled to release second quarter 2017 results on Jul 27 
Copa Holdings  S A   NYSE CPA   has an earnings ESP of  5 04  and sports a Zacks Rank  2  The company is scheduled to release second quarter 2017 results on Aug 9

110852,332367,R,Is Ryder System A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put if  Ryder System  Inc    NYSE R   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Ryder System has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 18  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for theS P 500 compares in at about 20 04  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Ryder System s current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 63  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Ryder System has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 79   which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Ryder System has a P S ratio of about 0 56  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 16 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Ryder System currently has a Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Ryder System a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Ryder System might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives R a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been favorable  Both the current year and next have seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 1 4  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched upper by 2 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Ryder System  Inc  Price and Consensus    The stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineRyder System is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a strong industry rank  among Top 44  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence on the stock In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars This proven stock picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing  You can apply it to your portfolio starting today ,2017-08-16,Zacks Investment

110867,332382,R,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Delta Air Lines  United Continental Holdings  JetBlue Airways  Allegiant Travel And Ryder System,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   April 25  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   NYSE           United Continental Holdings  NYSE           JetBlue Airways Corporation  NASDAQ           Allegiant Travel Company  NASDAQ          and Ryder System Inc  NYSE R    NYSE          

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  

Transportation Stock Q1 Earnings for April 25  JBLU  ALGT and More  

	The Q1 Earnings season has picked up pace with 95 S P 500 companies   representing 24 9  of the index s total market capitalization  having already revealed their quarterly numbers  According to our latest  report  the performance so far is extremely encouraging with the earnings and revenues expanding 14 3  and 4 6   respectively  on a year over year basis 

	While 72 6  companies have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate with respect to earnings  62 1  beat expectations on the revenue front  In fact  51 6  of the companies in the S  P 500 space outperformed both with respect to earnings and revenues  We will get a clearer picture by the end of the current week  which will see nearly 800 companies reporting their respective results  including 191 players in the S P 500 space 

	The report predicts that the bottom and top lines  in the S P 500 Index  expand 9 1  and 6   respectively  at the end of the Q1 earnings season  Both figures compared favorably to the readings in Q4  when bottom line expanded 7 4   highest growth in almost two years  and revenues grew 4 7  

	Nevertheless  the transportation sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  does not share the rosy picture  The bottom line for the S P 500 companies in this highly diversified sector is projected to contract 20   due to higher costs  In fact  this reading compares unfavorably to the segmental bottom line contraction of 18 2  in Q4 

	In fact  40  of the sector participants have revealed their quarterly reports so far with earnings contracting 25 6  year over year  the worst performance among the Zacks sectors   For example  Q1 earnings at Delta Air Lines  NYSE         contracted 41 7  on a year over year basis due to higher costs  At United Continental Holdings  NYSE           the bottom line contracted 66 7  year over year 

	Given this backdrop  investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await earnings reports from players like JetBlue Airways Corporation  NASDAQ          Allegiant Travel Company  NASDAQ          and Ryder System Inc   NYSE          on Apr 25 

	According to our quantitative model  a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase the odds of an earnings surprise 

	The Long Island City  NY based JetBlue Airways focuses on providing high quality customer service  The chances of this low cost carrier beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in Q1 are less  as it currently has an Earnings ESP of  4 17   Most Accurate estimate is 1 cent below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents  and carries a Zacks Rank  3  You can see   

	Our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier either  When we issued its    the company had an earnings ESP of  12 00  while the Zacks Rank remained the same  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   

	Based in Las Vegas Allegiant Travel Company is the parent company of Allegiant Air  This low cost Allegiant Air offers air travel both on a stand alone basis and bundled with hotel rooms  rental cars and other travel related services  The chances of the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in Q1 are less  as it currently has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   Most Accurate estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 58  and carries a Zacks Rank  3 

	Our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier either  When we issued its    the company had an earnings ESP of  2 27  while the Zacks Rank remained the same 

	Next  is a third party logistics company C H  Robinson Worldwide  which is based in Minnesota  Our quantitative model hints at an earnings beat for this Zacks Rank  3 company in Q1  This is because it has an Earnings ESP of  2 50  the Most Accurate estimate of 82 cents is 2 cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  in addition to the favorable Zacks Rank  Read more     

Finally  Ryder System  Inc    a Florida based corporation founded in 1933  is recognized as one of the world s largest providers of integrated logistics and transportation solutions  The chances of this company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in Q1 are less  despite its Zacks Rank  3  This is because it has an Earnings ESP of  1 19  as the Most Accurate estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents per share by a penny  Read more

110896,332411,R,2 Transport Stocks To Bet On As Curtains Fall On Q2 Earnings,opinion,"The widely diversified transportation sector  which includes airline companies  truckers  shippers and railroads  to name a few  is facing a number of headwinds like surge in terror attacks  Brexit vote uncertainty  declining coal shipments and labor problems  Most of the sector participants  including all the S P 500 transportation players  have revealed their quarterly numbers 
According to our latest  report  year over year earnings growth for the transportation players in the S P 500 space is  12 4  year over year which cuts a sorry picture compared to the first quarter 2016 growth of  3 3   As per the report  the top line has shrunk 1 3  in Q2 whereas in 1Q revenues decelerated 0 9  on a year over year basis Earnings Beats Fail to Drive Stocks
Despite the sluggish year over year growth rates  the Q2 earnings season has seen a healthy proportion  66 7   of the S P 500 companies beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings  Important sector participants like Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   American Airlines Group  AAL   JetBlue Airways Corporation  JBLU   Ryder System  NYSE R  and Norfolk Southern Corp   NYSE NSC  have outperformed with respect to the bottom line 
Despite the earnings outperformance  the stock prices of the concerned players have remained subdued and most of the transportation players continue to have bearish Zacks Ranks  For example  Delta  despite the earnings beat  continues to carry a Zacks Rank   5  Strong Sell  while JetBlue and Ryder System still carry a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  each   Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter of 2016 earnings was much lower for most players than a year ago following a series of downward revisions by analysts  thereby making an earnings beat easier  For example  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Airlines  second quarter of 2016 earnings was  1 65 per share  much lower than the year ago figure of  2 62 
In view of the above scenario  it is of little wonder that the earnings beats did little to boost the stock prices despite the bottom line outperformance Oil Prices Not as Low 
Low oil prices act as a major tailwind as it represents one of the major input costs for any transportation company  Oil prices have been weak for over two years now  Thus  it is no surprise that analysts have accounted for this while arriving at their estimates for earnings 
Although it is true that the current oil prices of just over  40 a barrel are way off the  100  mark witnessed in mid 2014  prices have bounced back from the 12 year low of  26 21 touched in February this year  This is also not good news for transportation players Zacks Industry Ranks for Sub groups
The bearish Zacks Industry ranks of the different sub groups of the transportation industry are also reflective of the headwinds confronting the space  For example  the Transportation Airline  Transportation Truck  Transportation Ship and the Transportation Equipment  Leasing units carry a bearish Zacks Industry rank of 247 253  206 and 237  respectively among the 260  industries How to Pick the Winners 
Given the tough times confronting the sector and the large number of participants in the transportation industry  it is by no means an easy task to shortlist stocks that have the potential to beat earnings  This is where the Zacks proprietary methodology comes in handy  It narrows down the list by helping select stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive  
Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  It helps in choosing stocks that have high chances of posting a positive earnings surprise in their next earnings announcement  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   Here  we have selected two stocks from the transportation sector with the right combination of elements to report an earnings beat this season Transport Stocks Likely to Outperform
With the help of the above methodology  we have identified 2 transportation stocks likely to trump the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the second quarter of 2016 LATAM Airlines Group S A     based in Santiago  Chile  offers domestic and international passenger and cargo air services  The carrier is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter of 2016  with results expected to be revealed on Aug 11  LATAM Airlines  second quarter earnings ESP of over  100  and Zacks Rank  3 make it our first choice Star Bulk Carriers Corp     is a Greece based leading global shipping company in the dry bulk sector  The carrier is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter of 2016  with results expected to be revealed on Aug 29  Star Bulks  second quarter earnings ESP of over  13 33  and Zacks Rank  2 make it a potential outperformer

110899,332414,R,Ryder System  R  Down To Sell On Guidance Cut,opinion,"On Aug 19  2016  Zacks Investment Research downgraded Ryder System   NYSE R   to a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Going by the Zacks model  companies holding a Zacks Rank  4 are likely to underperform the broader market over the next1 3 months 
Why the Downgrade 
While releasing its second quarter results  Ryder System trimmed its earnings guidance for full year 2016  The company now expects 2016 adjusted earnings in the band of  5 90 to  6 05 per share  old guidance   6 10 to  6 30   Lower rental demand coupled with soft used vehicle volumes led to the dull view 
Further  the company s guidance for the third quarter is disappointing  Moreover  the transportation company reported a 5  decline in second quarter 2016 earnings on a year over year basis  Foreign exchange issues hurt the company s top line in the quarter 
Additionally  the company continues to face headwinds in the form of unstable economic conditions  high capital expenditures  mounting debts  stiff competition and federal regulations which add to its woes  We are also concerned about the weak balance sheet of the company  Ryder System exited the second quarter of 2016 with over  5 6 billion of debt as against  5 5 billion at the end of 2015  Cash and cash equivalents were only  66 million at the end of the second quarter which raises concern 
We are  however  encouraged by the company s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividend payments  In Jul 2016  Ryder System hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 7 3  to 44 cents per share  In the second quarter of 2016  the company repurchased 322 000 shares at an average price of  68 05  During the quarter  the company started implementing its 2 million share anti dilutive buyback program

110917,332432,R,Are Transports Hinting At Recession ,opinion,"Is a recession around the corner  Some analysts believe the key to that answer resides with transportation companies like FedEx  NYSE FDX   Union Pacific  NYSE UNP  and Ryder System  NYSE R   Specifically  if less and less unfinished goods are being moved to manufacturers  wholesalers and retailers  then one might anticipate sluggish growth  or even economic contraction 
How might one determine the collective well being of transporters  The iShares Transportation Average ETF  ARCA IYT  tracks the investment results of an index comprised of airline  railroad and trucking corporations  Perhaps surprisingly  the transportation sector appears to be struggling in spite of cheap oil 

Unlike exchange traded trackers for the Dow Industrials ETF  ARCA DIA  or the S P 500 SPDR Trust  ARCA SPY    broader stock market proxies that have hit all time highs in 2015   IYT has not reached a new pinnacle since December 29  In fact  since the  Bullard Bounce  ran its course between mid October and late November of last year  the transportation sector has run into heavy resistance 
The IYT SPY price ratio is another way to look at the changes that are taking place  For example  a rising price ratio might be indicative of a generally favorable perception for the health of the domestic economy  Indeed  the momentum for IYT relative to the broader market s SPY is evident for the better part of the last eighteen months  IYT SPY effectively held above a critical trendline 

More recently  however  the favorable trend has been waning  The change in sentiment appears to have occurred around the beginning of November  Did something significant transpire at the tail end of October  Back on October 29  the Federal Reserve formally ended the third iteration of its controversial quantitative easing program  QE3   Ever since  economic forecasts as well as economic realities have been diminishing 
There are those out there who extol the virtues of the relationship between the Dow Transports proxy  ARCA IYT  and the Dow Industrials ETF  ARCA DIA   In particular  if IYT does not eclipse its December 29 highs resistance level and DIA breaks below lows set in January  the market environment might then become bearish  Right now  even as DIA falls below a short term 50 day moving average  it does not appear ready to plunge below late January lows 

Nevertheless  the Fed lowered its growth expectations for the US economy for 2015  2016  and 2017  Equally concerning  we ve already witnessed Fed officials suggest that they will not be impatient  nor will they necessarily raise overnight lending rates at any time in 2015  Making matters more delicate  GDP growth expectations for Q1 as recently as February have been scaled back to as low as 0 2   by some models  from a previously more upbeat 2 5   Others would not be surprised by a negative number   How crazy does a recession sound if GDP comes in negative for Q1 and the Fed is still talking about possible tightening in the summertime  
As unlikely as an upcoming recession may seem  IYT and the transportation sector may be more prescient than anyone would like to believe  My colleague Rob Charette uncovered some statistical evidence based upon the 35 stock bull markets since 1900  In brief  if the current uptrend does not surpass its March 2 peak in the next 30 40 days  there is a high probability that the next bear market   What s more  bears in major stock averages tend to be leading indicators of recessionary pressure 
Recession possibilities notwithstanding  I doubt the will power of the Federal Reserve to raise overnight lending rates beyond a face saving 0 25  in the 2nd half of 2015  They may do so to maintain a measure of credibility  On the other hand  they will likely speak about the action in the same way that they removed the word  patience  from their forward guidance  that is  they may discuss an ultra slow path of rate changes that may not even project a path of getting toward 1 0  by year end 2016  as well as mentioning data dependency that would allow them to revert back to QE stimulus as necessary 
We are already seeing the volatile consequences of trying to back away from the electronic creation of currency  U S  stocks are wobbly  The yield curve is flattening  And without greater Fed assurances of economic strength or monetary policy neutrality  investors may need to consider a diverse approach to   National munis via iShares S P National Muni Bond Fund  NYSE MUB   reverse carry trade currencies like CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust  ARCA FXY  as well as precious metals like SPDR Gold Trust  ARCA GLD  combine to provide a measure of protection  All three of these ETFs exist in the FTSE Custom Multi Asset Stock Hedge Index  MASH Index  ",2015-03-26,Gary Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-transport-stocks-hinting-at-recession-246388,246388
110920,332435,R,3 Likely Transportation Winners This Earnings Season,opinion,The transportation sector comprises players from multiple fields including airline companies  truckers  shipping companies and railroads  The sector has benefited immensely from the weakness in oil prices since oil costs form one of the major input costs for any transportation company  The transportation sector performed exceedingly well in the fourth quarter of 2014  with 63 6  of the companies beating earnings estimates and an equal number coming ahead of revenue expectations  The sector is expected to continue its healthy performance in the first quarter of 2015 riding on an improving U S  economy and low fuel costs  Total earnings for the sector are expected to grow 37 5  on 3 1  growth in revenues  So far  about 25  of the companies in the transportation sector have reported their first quarter results  with 66 7  of them registering positive earnings surprises   For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others  please read our  and   Low Fuel Costs Aid Airlines the Most Airline stocks  within the broader transportation sector  have benefited the most from plunging oil prices given the inversely proportional relation between crude prices and the value of stocks  Crude prices have remained weak over the recent past due to an over supplied oil market  especially in the face of lackluster global demand  Crude prices have been hovering around the  50 a barrel mark  This represents a significant decline from the approximately  105 per barrel witnessed in July last year  In fact  oil prices have been fluctuating wildly after hitting a 6 year low of under  44 in Mar 2015  Low fuel costs have aided fourth quarter 2014 results of most carriers like Alaska Air Group Inc  NYSE ALK   Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  and American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL   Weak oil prices are expected to benefit earnings in the first quarter as well  Although it is a fact that most carriers hedge at least some of their fuel costs  the majority of them should still continue to benefit considerably from the plunge in oil prices Disappointing Q1 in Store for Railroads  Even though the broader transportation sector is expected to perform impressively in the first quarter  stocks in the rail road space are likely to suffer a setback  Major railroad operators like Norfolk Southern Corporation  NYSE NSC        and Kansas City Southern have recently come out with below par first quarter guidance  Norfolk Southern  which will report first quarter results on Apr 29  stated that it expects first quarter 2015 earnings to come in at  1 00 per share  which is 15  below the first quarter 2014 number  Further  the company expects to report first quarter revenues of  2 6 billion  which is 5  below the year ago figure  on account of weak demand for coal  Likewise  Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   which will report on Apr 21  predicted its first quarter 2015 revenues to be flat on a year over year basis reflecting adverse foreign currency movements  low fuel surcharge revenues and slow carload growth from the energy sector An Overall Positive Sentiment The struggle of the railroads notwithstanding  the broader picture for the transportation sector remains more or less a positive one  Consequently  it is a profitable strategy to zero in on a handful of transportation stocks that are poised to beat earnings estimates this quarter How to Pick the Right Stocks  In view of the diversity prevalent in the transportation space  it isn t an easy task to shortlist stocks that have the potential to report better than expected earnings  Here our proprietary methodology comes in handy  This is simply to look for stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive Zacks   Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their next earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   An earnings beat more often than not gives a boost to investor confidence in the stocks  which translates into quick price appreciation  Below we present three transportation stocks that are expected to report better than earnings in their upcoming releases United Continental Holdings Inc  NYSE UAL   the holding company of United Airlines  was formed through the merger of Continental Airlines and UAL Corp  on Oct 1  2010  The Zacks Rank  3 stock currently has an earnings ESP of  3 55   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter 2015 earnings is pegged at  1 41  The company has a decent track record with respect to earnings   it has delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 4 04   The company will report its first quarter 2015 results on Apr 23  before the commencement of trading Ryder System  NYSE R   Based in Miami  FL  this Zacks Rank  2 equipment and leasing stock currently has an earnings ESP of  3 96   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter 2015 earnings is pegged at  1 01 per share  This company too has a decent history with respect to earnings   its earnings have outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  with a four quarter average beat of 2 50   The company will report its first quarter 2015 results on Apr 22  before the commencement of trading Global Ship Lease Inc  NYSE GSL   Based in London  this Zacks Rank  3 shipping stock has an earnings ESP of  100 00   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter 2015 earnings stands at a penny  The company has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 26 67   The company is scheduled to report first quarter 2015 results on Apr 30 The Bottom Line We believe transportation stocks will continue to perform well  going forward  on the back of favorable factors like cheap oil and an improving economy  Thus  for the time being  you can safely rely on the industry outperformers that possess significant earnings strength ,2015-04-21,Zacks Investment

110944,332459,R,EDAP  Undervalued With An Alternative Treatment For Prostate Cancer,opinion,In doing some fresh scans for 2013  I found a company that has a very small market cap of only  38 million but competes in the very large market of prostate cancer  EDAP TMS SA  EDAP  looks like a very solid speculative play not only because of its future revenue prospects  but also because it brings in significant revenue right now  I always like to see companies who grow responsibly  In the pharmaceutical industry  a company with a low market cap that isn t burning a lot of cash relative to its size is pretty rare  Let s take a closer look  Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in men with  new cases annually  The market for this disease is estimated to grow to  by 2015  Clearly  even a small fraction of this type of money would make an incredible difference to a company as small as EDAP  Of course  there are big players who put significant resources into capturing these revenue streams  Companies such as Merck  MRK   Pfizer  PFE   Novartis  NVS   Dendreon  DNDN   and Endo  ENDP  all have marketed drugs for prostate cancer  EDAP develops and markets Ablatherm  the most advanced and clinically proven choice for high intensity focused ultrasound  HIFU  treatment of localized prostate cancer  HIFU treatment is shown to be a minimally invasive and an effective treatment option with a low occurrence of side effects  Ablatherm HIFU is generally recommended for patients with localized prostate cancer  stages T1 T2  who are not candidates for surgery or who prefer an alternative option  In addition patients who failed radiotherapy treatment are good candidates  Approved in Europe as a treatment for prostate cancer  Ablatherm HIFU is currently undergoing evaluation in a multi center U S  Phase II III clinical trial under an Investigational Device Exemption  IDE  granted by the FDA  the ENLIGHT U S  clinical study  The company is also developing this technology for the potential treatment of certain other types of tumors  EDAP TMS SA also produces and commercializes medical equipment  the Sonolith R  range  for treatment of urinary tract stones using extra corporeal shockwave lithotripsy  ESWL   In   EDAP held a pre  Pre Marketing Approval  PMA  meeting with the U S  FDA to discuss the submission for the company s Ablatherm HIFU Phase II III clinical trial for the indication of low risk  localized prostate cancer  Based on the guidance received in this FDA interaction  EDAP is finalizing its PMA file for submission in January 2013   was jointly developed by   French Institute of Medical Research  and EDAP TMS in the early 1990s and is based on technology that creates a precise and irreversible coagulation necrosis of the targeted tissue while preserving the surrounding tissue  This means the cancer cells are killed by essentially being starved of the oxygen and nutrients necessary to survive  In 2011  the company  results from a 10 year study of the device  The study showed 83  of patients had no biopsy evidence of disease after treatment with Ablatherm HIFU  supporting the technology as a standard primary treatment for localized prostate cancer  Study results were presented at the American Urological Association  AUA  2011 Annual Meeting  Washington  D C  The largest  long term study ever presented on HIFU reported outcomes from 2 552 patients treated throughout Europe  where Ablatherm HIFU is currently available  Patients diagnosed with stage T1 T3 prostate cancer with low  moderate  or high risk for disease progression were treated with Ablatherm HIFU  Outcomes were followed using a secure online registry database  which tracked progression as measured by prostate specific antigen  PSA  levels and prostate biopsy data  Results from this robust  multi center study were remarkably consistent across progression risk groups  demonstrating that HIFU is effective at controlling prostate cancer for all patients  These favorable clinical outcomes were also highly reproducible  which has a critical real world impact on how effectively HIFU can be used to treat the disease worldwide  Another product that EDAP is excited about is its Sonolith Praktis which is a modular lithotripter  This is used for a medical procedure that uses shock waves to break up stones in the kidney  bladder  or ureter  tube that carries urine from your kidneys to your bladder   After the procedure  the tiny pieces of stones pass out of your body in your urine  As part of a new modular endourological platform

systems for better utilization During the 2012   EDAP spoke about its progress  Marc Oczachowski  EDAP s Chief Executive Officer  commented  Our revenues for the first nine months of 2012 reflected the robust sales growth of our renewed lithotripsy device platform  We continue to pursue sales and marketing initiatives around the globe and recently strengthened our U S  sales team with the appointment of a Senior Sales Manager experienced in lithotripsy The Company showed 13  revenue growth at the end of the third quarter of 2012  as compared to last year  and we foresee additional positive momentum for the remainder of this year  As we approach the last week of November  our replenished device backlog is comprised of nineteen lithotripsy devices and three Ablatherm HIFU devices  During the conference call  the company also noted that in October 2012  EDAP appointed Bill Brown as its U S  based Senior Sales Manager  With more than two decades in the medical field and over ten years in lithotripsy device sales  Mr  Brown joins EDAP s U S  team to enhance and strengthen the EDAP U S  expansion program  Also in October  urologists with long term Ablatherm HIFU experience participated in a panel discussions at Third International Symposium on Focused Ultrasound  in Washington  D C  On two separate panels  they outlined their experience using ultrasound guided Ablatherm HIFU to treat prostate cancer and highlighted Ablatherm HIFU s substantial clinical track record  with more than 32 000 prostate cancer treatments successfully performed  Other recent highlights    Recorded robust 13  sales growth over the nine month period    Strong lithotripsy sales in third quarter and replenished fourth quarter device backlog in lithotripsy and Ablatherm HIFU    Generated positive cash flow during third quarter 2012    Held productive pre PMA meeting with U S  FDA for Ablatherm HIFU Phase II III clinical trial  EDAP recently broke out of an extended down trend dating back to November  shown in maroon  and has moved past the psychological resistance at  2  The stock also has formed a new uptrend that could push this much higher  It has found new support at that level and appears it wants to make a break higher to test  2 80  If we can get a large enough volume break at that point there is not much stopping it from testing  3 80 especially for such a low floater  When EDAP received European approval in 2006 the stock shot over  20  Obviously  the stock has been beaten down to around  2 share since  I would typically expect this scenario to be a result of big dilution which is not the case with EDAP  The revenue coming has allowed continued development without harming shareholders even more by printing tons of shares to raise cash  If a European approval could spark the stock this much six years ago  a U S  approval would certainly seem very significant mainly because of this lack of dilution  This is why I like a reasonable long play or at least an option play where you can minimize your risk while creating high reward potential  In addition  the company has also filed for Chinese approval  Since China tends to piggy back on American FDA decisions of this nature  it could add to the positive nature of an FDA approval  I will be watching the movement of this stock and its related options closely this year  Disclosure  I have no positions in any stocks mentioned  but may initiate a long position in  EDAP  over the next 72 hours ,2013-01-03,Scott

110954,332469,R,Why It Is Essential To Own Physical Gold,opinion,Gold prices have failed to hold above the key resistance level of  1400 an ounce even though the fundamental driving forces behind the precious metal have not changed and as the global monetary system remains as precarious as ever   While some investors may think they are getting wealthier because they see the value of their equity portfolio increase  others are seeing the value of their hard earned cash gradually erode due to the low interest rate environment  And  while mainstream media particularly in the USA claim that the economy is recovering due to the recent stock market rally  this rise in prices is due to an economic stimulus programme engineered by the US Federal Reserve and has nothing to do with a vibrant economy   If you believe that there is not going to be any repercussion from central banks unprecedented money printing and that governments will be able to sustain their current record high levels of debt when interest rates rise  then you have nothing to worry about  However  if you believe as I do  that these monetary policies will result in further currency devaluation  rising commodity prices  steep inflation which may end in hyperinflation and then a complete collapse of the current global monetary system  then you had better prepare yourself now   It is obvious that the policies of central bankers have been a total failure when it comes to stimulating economic growth  The scenario they have created seems to be playing out in an almost textbook manner  And  if history does repeat itself  then this nominal rise in asset prices will be followed by a period of rising inflation  The ensuing increase in interest rates will prevent governments from being able to pay the interest on their debt which will lead to a total loss of confidence in their respective currencies   Meanwhile  Western governments continue their insidious actions to rob their citizens of their hard earned wealth and individual liberties  These bankrupt Western governments will blame the war on terror  or the war on drugs  and will impose new taxes  and capital controls on their citizens as they try to inflate their way to higher tax revenue  They will also continue to interfere and manipulate the markets  Only recently  Bloomberg reported that traders at some of the world s biggest banks manipulated benchmark foreign exchange rates to set the value of trillions of dollars of investments   Evidently  employees have been front running client orders and rigging WM Reuters rate by pushing through trades before and during the 60 second windows when the benchmarks are set   According to certain traders  dealers colluded with counterparts to boost chances of moving the rates  This happened daily in the spot foreign exchange market and has been going on for at least a decade  affecting the value of funds and derivatives  two traders said   The currency market  estimated at around  4 7 million a day is the largest market in the world as well as one of the least regulated   While hundreds of firms participate in the foreign exchange market  four banks dominate  with a combined share of more than 50   according to a May survey by Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc  Deutsche Bank is No  1  with a 15 2  share  followed by New York based Citigroup with 14 9   Barclays Plc   with 10 2  and UBS AG with 10 1    The Financial Conduct Authority  Britain s markets supervisor  is considering opening a probe into potential manipulation of the rates  after three lenders were fined about  2 5 billion for rigging the London Interbank offered rate  or Libor  Regulators also are investigating benchmarks for the crude oil and swaps markets   Singapore s monetary authority has ordered  20 banks at which 133 traders tried to manipulate the Singapore interbank offered rate  swap offered rates and currency benchmarks to set aside as much as S 12 billion   9 6 billion  at zero interest pending steps to improve internal controls   Nineteen firms were asked to post reserves ranging from S 100 million to S 1 2 billion    depending on the severity of the attempts by their traders to manipulate rates    for a year and will earn zero interest on that money   As governments together with their financial leaders try to manipulate the currency markets  financial markets and stock markets  they also attempt to suppress the prices of gold and silver  Owning gold and silver is taking money out of the system  something which governments despise and something that every single individual should do   In his speech at the Open for Growth conference at Lancaster House in central London on Saturday  UK prime minister  David Cameron pledged to tackle tax evasion and transparency at the upcoming G8 summit on Monday  Cameron claims that trade  tax and transparency are vital factors in the global effort to eradicate poverty   During their meeting in Northern Ireland which began on Monday  one topic clamping down on tax havens  launching EU US trade talks and progress towards a Syrian peace conference  British Prime Minister David Cameron has put clamping down on tax avoidance top of the agenda for this G8 summit  Cameron is seeking an agreement on clamping down on corporation tax loopholes  and creating an international registry of company ownership to stop companies hiding profits in shell companies registered in tax havens   Emma Seery from aid agency Oxfam said   We don t even know the scale of how much developing countries are losing because there are so many secretive deals and tax havens are secretive places  but we know that just because of companies are dodging their taxes  developing countries lose  160 billion every year    While so called tax havens receive more bad publicity once again  nothing is said about the billions of tax payers  money that governments have squandered in hopeless aid programmes as well as financial assistance to corrupt governments  not to mention the cost of financing all these so called aid agencies   Over the last 50 years  developed countries have dished out more than  2 5 trillion of tax payers  money in foreign aid and yet there is still an overwhelming amount of poverty  Approximately  568 billion was spent on aid programs in Sub Saharan Africa from 1960 to 2003  yet  corruption and poverty remain its defining features  The region remains poverty stricken while corrupt government officials become very wealthy  Add to this the cost of on going wars as well as the cost to finance ever expanding governments  Suddenly  a few offshore bank accounts look insignificant to the amount of money governments have wasted  Furthermore  industrialised nations are under no obligation whatsoever to provide any aid to developing countries  contrary to what many politicians in Africa may like believe   The African Union estimates corruption costs the continent  150 billion annually  far outstripping global development spending  The World Bank reckons over a quarter of its entire lending portfolio has been tainted by graft  Yet aid agencies funded by tax payers  money continue to pour hundreds of millions into this bottomless pit every year  Personally  I think leaders such as David Cameron  together with the Secretary General of the OECD  Angel Gurr a  should focus their energies on clamping down on global government corruption instead of trying to invent ways to extract more taxes from legal companies and hard working individuals who have legitimate offshore bank accounts  And  they should be held accountable  for squandering tax payers  money by funding these corrupt governments  They should receive a prison sentence for all the hundreds of millions of tax payers  money that simply disappears into the bank accounts of corrupt politicians  Unfortunately  while governments continue to waste tax payers  money  they also continue to bully their citizens with their tax authorities  Also  they expect individuals to tolerate their actions as they invade your privacy  devalue currencies  manipulate markets  and destroy the value of your savings and pensions  As an individual you cannot change the system  but you can take certain steps to prevent yourself from being totally wiped out by these insidious actions  One way is to make sure you own physical gold and silver  TECHNICAL ANALYSIS As gold prices fail to break above the key resistance  R  of  1400 oz   I expect to see more consolidation before prices move upwards

performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 9  Annualized ROR  w o Div   green circle   long term shareholders of Ryder System Inc  assuming an initial investment of  10 000  would have received an

110975,332490,R,Commodity Decline Looms,opinion,I continue to find the very same behavioral biases that provided prescient contrarians the initial clues  chasing the Greenspan Put   i e  Moral Hazard  to start moving away from one asset class toward another  on the back side of the cycle    with investors that are anything but contrarian and long past prescient    In 2000 and 2001  as the pendulum was swinging away from equities toward the safe r  haven and sturdier shores of the commodity sector  the Fed reached for the monetary fire hose to provide both structural and psychological liquidity to a financial system under duress  And although it initially provided momentary support for equities and the seeds for the secular bull market in commodities  stocks eventually succumbed to the path of least resistance  It was a bear market and the psychological bid of the Greenspan Put was now immaterial to the larger forces at work   QE And Commodities Today  we have a very similar dynamic in the now matured commodity sector with the prospect of QE and central bank interventions on the table  Whether emanating from the Fed  the ECB or the PBC    resource investors now work with a dangerous level of moral hazard in the face of reality within their respective investment theses  The general thought has been  more easing    higher commodity prices  And although this causality helped drive dramatic returns since the fall of 2008  the several dozen easing initiatives by the world s major central banks over the past year have done very little to arrest the decline in the commodity sector that began in May of 2011  And although I have looked at the Nasdaq and the NDX  circa 2000 2002  comparative over the past year repeatedly    the shoe continues to fit in various iterations and along multiple timeframes with the resource and precious metals sector  Fear FactorDespite a more dramatic decline in the Nasdaq between 2000 and 2001  I believe we will see a similar pattern unfurl in the CRB as the trend continues along the path of least resistance    and as late and dogmatic investors turn from denial to fear  The immediate set up for a turn lower is primarily based on the extreme negative relative strength and technical structure of the CRB s low in June and the very strong retracement rally that now appears to be rolling over at the 61 8  fibonacci level from the yearly low ,2012-08-13,Erik Swarts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/commodity-decline-looms-132751,132751
110976,332491,R,The Presidential Election 2012  The Economy And The Stock Market,opinion,What impact will the economy and stock market have on the upcoming Presidential election  What impact will the Presidential election have on the stock market With President Barack Obama seeking re election in 2012  I examined every Presidential race since 1932  During this 80 year period  11 of the 20 Presidential contests involved incumbents seeking re election  On only three of these 11 occasions did the incumbent lose  In each of these cases  it was the economy that was underperforming that resulted in the incumbent s defeat  In 1932  President Herbert Hoover  R  lost to Franklin Delano Roosevelt  D   The United States was in the midst of The Great Depression  the unemployment rate was at 25   and the stock market as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined by 89  between 1929 and 1932  In 1980  President Jimmy Carter  D  lost to Ronald Reagan  R   That year inflation as measured by the consumer price index reached 13  and U S  Treasury Bills were yielding 14   The stock market in 1980 rose prior to the election  Finally  in 1992  President George H W  Bush  R  lost to Bill Clinton  D   The U S  was in a recession leading up to the election and the unemployment rate was relatively high 7 5   The stock market in 1992 also rose prior to the election From the above  it was the economy that appears to have contributed to the incumbent s defeat in all three cases  Only in 1932  did the extremely poor performance of the stock market also portend the incumbent s defeat With this 80 year track record in mind  what conclusion can be reached with respect to the upcoming Presidential election  The first lesson is that incumbents rarely lose their re election bids  However  when they do  it seems to be directly related to the economy  With the election just two months away  how will voters interpret the state of the U S  economy The unemployment rate is currently at a very high 8 3   This monthly statistic will be updated on September 7  October 5  and November 2  just four days prior to the election  The current estimate for second quarter Gross Domestic Product growth is an anemic 1 7   well below the recent historical average of 2 5    3 0   The initial estimate for the third quarter will be released on October 26  less than two weeks before the election  The Standard   Poor s 500  by contrast  has risen about 12  so far this year and has doubled since its low on March 9  2009  just seven weeks after President Obama was sworn in  The U S  economy has been gradually recovering from the Financial Crisis of 2008  which resulted in the most severe recession since the Great Depression  Will the Republican candidate  Mitt Romney  be able to convince a majority of voters that the economy has underperformed sufficiently that the incumbent should be replaced  Or will President Obama persuade voters that the economy has improved substantially since 2008 9  and that he deserves to be re elected  Historical precedent indicates that it is the economy rather than the stock market that is likely to determine the result of this election Once this election is decided  how is the stock market likely to perform over the next four years  Going back to 1965  the S P 500  on average  has performed better with a Democrat in the White House than with a Republican  The average annual compounded gain for the S P 500 with dividends included  equaled 10 9  under a Democrat President  versus 7 3  with a Republican President The compounded annual gain over this entire period was 9 1   Since there is a large variability between the performance of the stock market across each four year presidential term  one cannot forecast with precision how the stock market will do in the near future  However  this result is worth noting  Note  I was a classmate of Mitt Romney at Harvard Business School in a corporate finance course during the Fall 1973 semester  ,2012-09-04,David Kass,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-presidential-election-2012:-the-economy-and-the-stock-market-135060,135060
110977,332492,R,Cowardice Leads To The Fiscal Cliff,opinion,If you regularly read or watch the news  especially on financial TV  you will undoubtedly have more than your fill of the term  fiscal cliff  over these last few weeks of the year  That we have to hear it at all is a tribute to our feckless legislators  who have shown true political cowardice in failing to deal with the country s burgeoning debt problems Earlier this year  faced with the task of making at least a dent in our trillion plus dollar annual deficit and the resultant growing debt  Congress punted  Admitting their inability to craft even the beginnings of an agreement  our leaders scheduled  the sequester  for yearend  such a  horrible of horribles  that no legislator would dare let it unfold  Supposedly with that deadline for across the board budget cuts scheduled for December 31  even mildly enlightened lawmakers would certainly forge an agreement before doomsday  Now that we re less than 40 days from the self imposed deadline  with no progress made and the holidays complicating schedules  the chances of any substantive agreement range from slim to none  The best we can reasonably expect is a sketchy outline of actions that will be negotiated in 2013 in return for deferral of the sequester for a few months  At the same time  some  split the baby  compromise on expiring tax breaks might buy time for the promise of a more serious examination of comprehensive tax reform Or perhaps not  In which case  we will tumble over the cliff  If we do suffer that perilous fall  economists have forecast various impacts ranging from about a 1  to 4  decrease in 2013 s GDP  With GDP forecasts clustering around 2  for the year apart from the cliff any appreciable impact may well push the economy into another recession  On Wednesday of this week  Fed Chairman Bernanke added his voice  warning that failing to deal with the cliff would  topple  the economy back into recession In discussing possible outcomes  most commentators talk about  solving  the fiscal cliff  One can only talk about  solution  in the context of preventing all its consequences from hitting in the same time period  In a static analysis  every dollar of tax forgiveness that continues past its deadline is another dollar of deficit and cumulative debt  Every dollar that is sequestered out of government expenses may cut the deficit  but also cuts GDP  By spending more than we have earned for about three decades  we ve painted ourselves into a corner from which there is no complete escape  All extrication actions have negative consequences We are faced with the unpleasant choice between accepting economic pain today or deferring some of that pain with the probable cost of even greater pain tomorrow  Given the political reality that candidates are rarely elected by promising pain today and a possibly better tomorrow  we can count on our dysfunctional Congress to kick the can as far down the road as possible  If they succeed  they may be retired before the consequences of their cowardice are fully realized Unfortunately  past delays may have already pushed the economy to a day of reckoning  Harvard economics professor Martin Feldstein said recently that the U S  may fall into recession even if the worst effects of the fiscal cliff are deferred  Should Congress go all out to avoid immediate negative consequences to the economy  however  deficit and debt prospects will suffer  The major bond rating agencies have already warned that the US s debt rating will take another hit if we fail to take meaningful action to control our deficits and debt There is no  solution   We as a populace  through our legislators  have to decide how and when we want to square our books  We have lived and spent beyond our means for years  and our bills are coming due  Every one of us should be lobbying our legislators to act like statesmen and to make sure that we don t leave a legacy of excessive debt to our grandchildren and their grandchildren Tom s Plea To His LegislatorsThe following is a letter Tom sent out today to his Arizona legislators  Senator John McCain  R   Senator elect Jeff Flake  R  and Representative Ron Barber  D   He urges you to make your voices heard in your own constituencies For years I have written and spoken about the dangers arising from our politicians  unwillingness even to approach a balanced budget  The consequences of that negligence are becoming increasingly manifest with the most immediate of which  the fiscal cliff  only weeks away I am enclosing my most recent blog entry encouraging readers on our own site  plus those of other sites which regularly pick up my work  to lobby their legislators to act like statesmen instead of ideological vote solicitors in addressing the many questions related to our deficits and debt  I am a constituent who cares deeply about the condition of the country that we will leave to subsequent generations  I implore you to act with a conscience that treats the rights of generations ahead equally to those of today s voters  Please work in the upcoming years to change the venal image of Congress  Make us proud of legislative bodies that work toward long term positive outcomes rather than ideological victories before the next election ,2012-11-25,Thomas J.

110982,332497,R,Market Outlook  A Chill In The Air,opinion,Per custom  the Christmas and New Year s issues of MarketWeek will be holiday length  some might call this my gift to readers   It s a good exercise in being concise   After I heard President Obama s somewhat testy tone on fiscal cliff questions at a Tuesday press conference  I started buying index puts and selling equities  Upon listening to deputy whip Representative Kevin Brady  R  from Texas Friday evening on Bloomberg television  it looks to me as if we are going over the cliff and I should have bought more puts   This is not a political column  so I am not going to argue anyone s position  Suffice to say that the political calculus for the House of Representatives is always different than that of the President  any President  and Senate  or their party s national committees  Listening carefully to both sides  it appears that they are going to stick to their guns  The tones have subtly shifted  Before  each side was trying to appear reasonable while suggesting that the other side is intransigent  That s still mostly true of course  with the difference being that the tone is shifting from laying the blame for what might happen  to a kind of weary resignation and blame for an event that has already happened   I now doubt that a deal will be struck before the new Congress is seated  and even the latter event will only marginally improve chances  The outlook for the debt ceiling battle now appears much worse  However  there is still a decent chance at some kind of continuing spending resolution before year end that tries to avoid cuts to defense and unemployment benefits  Both that deal and the process are likely to be ugly   A resolution just might be enough to steady markets in the last few days of the year  as Friday afternoon s buying made it clear that there is still a fair amount of money with an interest in propping up the tape until year end  Others are convinced that the Santa Claus rally is a law of nature  and some are in both camps  However  the resolution is likely to be ugly enough  and the standoff deep enough  that the chances for an unpleasant market episode over the next three months have gone up considerably  The last five trading days will be more a roll of the dice   US markets close early on Monday  December 24th  with a 1 00 PM close for the stock market  Banks and financial markets are closed on Christmas Day  I wish the merriest of Christmases to all   The Economic Beat  in holiday time   As usual  the data releases were neither as bad nor as good as popular headlines made them out to be  Last week I said that the consensus estimates for the New York and Philadelphia Fed surveys were suspiciously low  around zero  give or take  when some Sandy rebound effect should have been expected  The Philadelphia Fed district includes south New Jersey and Delaware  so why the consensus was around minus one is beyond me  The actual result of  8 1  and  10 7 for new orders  is a modestly decent recovery number   The New York district was minus   8 1   but it wasn t from an increase in respondents reporting declines  Rather  a chunk of respondents went from reporting  higher  orders to  same   Taken together  the reports indicate no real change in their regional economies   New orders for durable goods in November   0 7   also beat a doubtfully low consensus  with the business investment category reporting a second month of increase in a row at 2 7   As usual  media talking heads fawned over the number  and as usual they were wrong  Capital spending had been suppressed for several months  and I had written earlier that we were due for some restocking  Add in a little more rebound effect from Sandy  the expiring investment tax credit  50  bonus depreciation goes away  and the need to use up 2012 budgets  and we should see a third month of increase in December  Yet spending is still flat year over year with one month left to go   Even so  we are likely to soon hear talk again of the economy reaching  escape velocity  after 3rd quarter GDP was revised all the way back up to 3 1   It will again be wrong  and just turn out to be more oscillation around the basic trend  With our roughly 2  annual growth rate  we get some quarters near 1   and others near 3   The third quarter got a big lift from increased government spending and a decline in imports  with the former clearly transient and the latter not a sign of a healthy economy  Non residential fixed investment continues to decline  with the silver lining being that someday  somewhere we should get a rebound  I didn t see anything in the underlying components of the GDP data that suggest a sea change  The Chicago Fed National Activity index had a Sandy bump  but the 3 month average remains negative   The rebound in personal income  0 6   was nice  but it was a rebound  October November combined produced an increase of about 0 3   which is in line with the very modest 2012 trend  What s more  there is some disturbing weakness lately in the weekly claims data that is being masked by rather large adjustment factors  Claims have been remarkably consistent in 2012  running about ten percent better than last year  The difference has dropped in recent weeks to about five percent or less  in unadjusted terms   and the latest 4 week moving average is only four percent better than a year ago  Some of it is due to dates not overlapping perfectly  and it s too brief yet to call it a trend  but it worries me   The housing data was in line and remains modestly better  while retail sales appear to be mixed  The Kansas City Fed reported a small increase in its manufacturing index  but the Leading Indicators declined   Reports of interest next week include new home sales on Thursday  pending home sales on Friday  and the Chicago purchasing manager s index on Friday ,2012-12-23,Kevin
