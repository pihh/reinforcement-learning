196418,417934,MGM,Opening Bell  Shanghai Index Rises  Futures Waver  Global Stocks Sell Off,opinion,"China s Shanghai Index was the sole Asian benchmark showing gains today  likely due to government stimulus
China based tech companies continue to remain idleOil barely hovers above  50Key Events
Earlier today  U S  futures followed global stocks lower as the still spreading coronavirus stoked mounting fears of the disease and its impact on world wide economic growth 
Nevertheless  safe havens such as Treasurys and the yen were lower too  though gold moved higher as the dollar weakened  Bitcoin plunged 
Global Financial Affairs
All four major U S  future indices for the S P 500  Dow Jones  NASDAQ and Russell 2000 slumped this morning  though currently they re wavering  having trimmed most of the day s losses 



Contracts suggest the underlying benchmarks will extend their Friday selloffs when Wall Street begins trading  confirming existing bearish signals  Media and travel firms pulled the STOXX Europe 600 Index to a lower open 
While just about all Asian indices closed with losses today  ironically  it was China s Shanghai Composite that was the sole green beacon    0 5    in a regional sea of red  That s puzzling since China s economy is most directly impacted by the coronavirus 
Equally baffling  Chinese shares are rising for the fifth straight session  even as global tech giants continue to face the chaos of their China based suppliers still not being fully operational  Case in point Zhengzhou based Foxconn  the world s leading maker of iPhone  NASDAQ AAPL  components  is located just a few hundred miles from the virus s ground zero  Wuhan  Thus  even as Apple s primary supplier warned shareholders that the epidemic would keep its work force idle  thereby shutting down production  China s leading index sees substantial  repeated gains  

Similarly  the offshore yuan strengthened  even though its country of origin continues to face tremendous uncertainty as the virus  death toll climbed to 908 within China and the number of confirmed cases rose to 40 171  Reports  that  many doctors believe that deaths and infections from the current epidemic are  being  undercounted in China   due some say to the strain on health facilities  there are also mounting reports of mass coverups 

We can only guess at the reasons for this market incongruity  Perhaps it s the Chinese government s resolve to provide a safety net in the form of ongoing liquidly  This bullish action seems to imply that investors can be assured that China cares about the economic cost of the current situation  So they re seeking profitable returns by joining the ride 
Yields are up  including for the benchmark U S  10 year note  though well below their highs  suggesting the flight to Treasurys may need a breather before continuing  since indicators suggest yields reached oversold levels  overbought Treasurys  and flipped to a bullish posture 


The 50 DMA increased its distance after finding resistance by the 200 DMA 

The U S  Dollar Index took a step back after a five day straight rally  though the greenback strengthened vs the Japanese yen 
Gold pushed higher for a fourth day 



Bitcoin  however  dropped as much as 4   The cryptocurrency is now 3  lower  falling back below the  10 000 level  Its overbought levels are turning around  suggesting an additional decline 


Crude is attempting to remain above the psychologically critical  50 level despite extreme oversold conditions  Expectations for an OPEC brokered production cut agreement with Russia as a way of bolstering sagging oil prices continue to fade

Global Financial Affairs
This morning  contracts for all four major U S  indices are building on the strength of yesterday s gains for their underlying benchmarks  

S P 500 futures are struggling against the Feb  6 all time highs 
Mining shares and carmakers  as well as strong numbers from tourism and travel company Tui AG NA  DE TUIGn   helped catapult the STOXX Europ 600 Index to a new record high on Tuesday 

The index formed an upside breakaway gap as it cleared the resistance line in place since the mid January highs 
Earier this morning in Asia  South Korea s KOSPI and Hong Kong s Hang Seng each rose by at least 1  and China s Shanghai Composite posted gains for a sixth day  even as the coronavirus spread continued  With more than 43 000 cases of the flu like illness reported worldwide  and the number of fatalities now above 1 000  World Health Organization  WHO  Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the death toll may be just  the tip of the iceberg  
The total 5 5  rally for China s major index follows the 7 7  drop that was halted after the country s regulators increased financial stimulus 
Yesterday  during the U S  session all four major indices closed at the top of their sessions  with the S P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite each hitting fresh records  Nine of the SPX s 11 sectors advanced  with Technology shares leading the charge   1 35    Energy underperformed   0 5    Shares of takeover target Sprint  NYSE S  soared in after hours trade after it was reported that T Mobile U S   NASDAQ TMUS  could be poised to win court approval for its  26 5 billion proposed takeover 

Yields  including for the U S  10 year Treasury   picked up momentum after yesterday s Wall Street session  setting the stage for a rising flag  bearish after the downside breakout of the rising channel since the Sept  3 bottom  The 50 DMA extended the fall from the 200 DMA 
The Dollar Index edged higher  continuing the USD s rally for a 7th session  Yesterday was also the second day the greenback strengthened against the yen 

However  the global reserve currency struggled to maintain a six day rally versus the euro  after breaking a support in place since Oct  15 

Gold fell after a four day rally  even while the dollar rose  The precious metal is developing a bullish triangle on the very support of the August September highs  
Bitcoin slipped for a second day  Technicals are showing the cryptocurrency is likely to fall even further  

Oil opened higher and extended a rebound from a one year low  as it fights to remain above the critical  50 level  The  52 area is crucial  it marks the cut off line between a reversal and another leg down below the psychological price level

196420,417936,MGM,Fed Chair Takes Podium As Virus Fears Ease  Under Armour Gets Ripped,opinion," Tuesday Market Open  With one eye on China and the other on Washington  investors continue to send stocks higher ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell s testimony to Congress Tuesday  
Even though coronavirus remains a huge factor  there appears to be growing confidence in the market that China the epicenter of the illness is doing a decent job containing it  That doesn t mean things can t get worse  but the number of new reported cases is slowing  according to the latest data  This might help explain why most Asian markets rose Tuesday and U S  stocks built on Monday s gains in pre market trading  
That said  coronavirus and other factors hit some stocks like  Under Armour   NYSE UAA   which got smacked this morning  The stock fell more than 15  in pre market trading after UAA reported a Q4 loss and said sales will fall in 2020  Revenue and earnings missed analysts  estimates  and UAA is just trying to find its way  Like some other companies reporting recently  UAA cited coronavirus as one factor hurting sales in Q1 
On just about every earnings call now  investors might want to listen for coronavirus updates  It s like tariffs last year  a theme that nearly every executive gets asked to address  If companies start lowering their guidance based on the outbreak  analysts might have to start pulling back their own estimates for overall earnings growth in Q1 
That said  Q4 earnings season approaches the finish line with a little more muscle  Last Friday  FactSet forecast 0 7  earnings growth in Q4  up from its original estimate for a 1 7  decline  Expected revenue growth of 3 5  is also slightly better than the firm originally thought  These still aren t great results by any stretch of the imagination  and coronavirus could take a bite out of Q1 numbers  So it s probably too early to put a lot of optimism into the earnings picture 
Earnings are kind of light this afternoon  but Wednesday morning brings CVS Health  NYSE CVS  and Trivago TRVG   followed that afternoon by Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  and MGM Resorts  NYSE MGM  
There s more deal news today  with shares of Sprint  NYSE S  surging more than 60  after The Wall Street Journal reported that its merger with T Mobile U S   NASDAQ TMUS  will be approved by a federal judge  These are the third and fourth largest U S  wireless carriers  
Some of the defensive metrics remain elevated  but they indicate slightly less fear this morning  The 10 year yield climbed just a touch  and crude is back above  50 a barrel  Volatility eased  with the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX  tipping below 15  Still  there s a struggle right now between the surging stock market and this sense of caution  see more below  
Powell Steps To PodiumAfter Monday s nice little rally  Fed Chair Jerome Powell steps to the podium today to take Q A from Congress  Generally  the Fed has sounded more optimistic about the economy lately  and seems content to stay on the sidelines with rates  Powell would probably have to change his tone in a pretty big way to have much of a market impact today  There was nothing in his pre testimony statement released early Tuesday to shake things up too much  The Fed is watching coronavirus closely  Powell said  and the big risk is China slowing down  That s not surprising to hear While rate policy  economic growth prospects and the possible impact of coronavirus all could end up being front and center  other topics might also come up  For instance  consider listening for anything Powell says about U S  debt  which continues to grow and has a chance to threaten all time highs on a percentage basis in coming years  according to some analysts Powell might also discuss the potential economic impact of Boeing  NYSE BA  shutting down 737 MAX production last month  Many economists think the BA situation combined with coronavirus could make for some rough sledding this quarter in U S  economic growth There s also concern about how overseas economies might be doing  even beyond China  For example  a lot of people got spooked last week when Germany reported soft industrial orders data for December  What does Powell think of all this and its potential impact on the U S   and does he see any signs of the Fed having to adjust policy if things get worse  Is he encouraged by recent stronger U S  data  It s A Tug Of WarIf you haven t already noticed  there s a kind of tug of war going on in the markets  and it would be hard to find a better example than Monday  The cyclical Information Technology sector helped lead a rally on Wall Street even as the defensive unit gathered strength on the field amid gains in bonds and gold  The 10 year Treasury yield stayed below 1 6   Crude oil lost ground  falling below  50 a barrel in another sign of possible demand worries before clawing back above  50 this morning 
This seems counterintuitive  If everyone s so cautious about coronavirus  why would tech stocks be climbing  Is the stock market getting ahead of itself without enough people thinking about the risks  or are the bond and gold markets just not seeing what stock traders see 
First  it s possible that semiconductor stocks which helped lead the parade Monday with big gains for Nvidia  NASDAQ NVDA  and Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  could actually be getting a lift from the virus  One school of thought says even though the virus might hurt these companies  production chains in China  the resulting lower output could lead to higher chip  prices which could potentially offset any losses from production issues 
Chips and the rest of the big tech stocks which we ll stretch to include Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  since it s well established as a tech player even if that s not its official sector designation could also reflect more of that  best house on a bad block  sentiment we ve seen the last few years  
In other words  with things looking a little shaky around the world  investors might be seeking safety not just in U S  bonds and the dollar  but also in some of the U S  mega tech stocks  Briefing com noted  These shares also include Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   which both rose Monday  AMZN hit new record highs after a tough second half of 2019  and seems to be getting an extended boost from strong earnings 
Whatever the case  it s probably a good idea to keep your eye on the semiconductor sub sector  because it s one of the most cyclical  You could argue that strength in the chips sends positive signals about the global economy because they go into so many everyday electronic products from games to phones  If they start to wilt  that could send the opposite signal  That s also something that could possibly be said about cloud computing  where MSFT and AMZN compete with many other large tech firms 






CHART OF THE DAY  YIELDS VS  SOX  In this six month chart  you can see 10 year Treasury yields  TNX candlestick  descending toward last summer s lows even as the semiconductor sector  SOX purple line  maintains strength and approaches last month s highs  This might seem counter intuitive  because semiconductors tend to do well in a strong economy while bond yields tend to weaken when the economy is soft  Data Sources  Cboe Global Markets  Philadelphia Stock Exchange  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Mall Shopping  It s no secret that mall owners have been under pressure in recent years  as shoppers increasingly choose to shop and buy online  and as mall mainstays such as Sears Holdings  Carson s parent BonTon  and others file for bankruptcy  So it might be tempting to dismiss Monday s announcement by Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  that it will be acquiring rival mall operator Taubman Centers  NYSE TCO  in a  3 2 billion all cash deal as a defensive move in a deteriorating industry  But many see the move as a sign the mall space has turned a corner  with operators such as SPG as key players in an industry that s become a hybrid of retail and entertainment  And when you consider the acquisition price a 52  premium over TCO s closing price last Friday and about double where shares were trading a week ago it does look like a signal of strength  
Have you been to the mall lately  If not  you might be surprised to see that aside from the ones that have shuttered completely many have been evolving  from functional to experiential  In the olden days  the typical mall featured a few anchor department stores such as Macy s  NYSE M  and JC Penney s  NYSE JCP   flanked by boutique apparel shops  jewelry kiosks  and a food court  The modern mall  however  is an experience  with former anchor stores converted into movie theaters  escape rooms and  increasingly  theme park attractions  In other words  the mall has become a day of fun for the entire family  And while you re there  you may as well pick up some bric a brac  a soft pretzel  and one of those orange drinks 
Find a Job  We ve talked about some of the things to keep an eye on with Powell s testimony today  His assessment of the economy  projected growth and anything he has to say about future rate policy all go without saying  Other things shouldn t be overlooked  however  For instance  last week s January payrolls report showed strong job gains and low unemployment  both of which Powell s likely to touch on  However  what about some other aspects of the data  For instance  the number of people working only part time because they couldn t find full time jobs and those  marginally attached  to the workforce stayed stuck in January  Does Powell have thoughts on why  
He s also likely to be asked about wages  which have been outrunning inflation but still aren t rising as much as some economists expected  or as much as some politicians probably want to see as they hope for re election   Is there a chance for wages to rise more steeply without threatening inflation  If not  what s keeping wages from growing faster  and does Powell still think it s important to let inflation move even higher than the Fed s 2  goal if it can pull more people into the economy  What s the limit on the inflation he d be comfortable allowing 
Investors Jumped Back in Last Month  Getting back to the markets  the Investor Movement Index   IMXSM  increased to 5 68 in January  up 2 34  from its December score of 5 55  The IMX is TD Ameritrade s proprietary  behavior based index  aggregating Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets  Equity markets reached all time highs last month and investors responded by increasing exposure to U S  markets  ending the period as net buyers of equities  
January ended with some uncertainty  and coronavirus worries still have volatility elevated  So we ll see if investors change their stock market exposure in the next report  Meanwhile  in January  retail investors at TD Ameritrade net bought popular names during the January IMX period  including MSFT  AAPL  BA  and Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   They net sold AMZN  Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Twitter  TWTR   and Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Millennial investors sold Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  and jumped into shares of Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   which might seem surprising  However  they could be interested in XOM s yield  and maybe also hope crude oil might bottom soon

196515,418031,MGM,Should You Avoid MGM Resorts This Summer ,opinion,"MGM Resorts International  NYSE MGM   one of the biggest names in the casino and entertainment world  has had a wild year on the stock market that s seen share prices for the company plunge to dismal levels  MGM Resorts actually started 2018 off with a solid performance on the stock market  wowing investors and critics alike with a sizable jump in share prices  but the casino empire s stock value has since plummeted to heartbreaking levels 
Should you avoid MGM Resorts stocks this summer  The casino company has come far  and not all recent news surrounding its business empire is dire  but it remains a risky investment that only the boldest of investors should consider over this summer 
MGM Resorts Is struggling
While MGM Resorts is set to open up some new casinos that could boost revenue figures for the company  it s been having an incredibly rough year that s seen share prices struggling to stay high  For the remainder of June  investors should expect little positive movement from MGM Resorts stock  which is dipping into annual low territory and unlikely to make a speedy recovery  Recent announcements from the government  however  including the legalization of sports betting  could serve to offer MGM Resorts an appealing way out of its current  dire straits 
MGM Resorts owns nearly half of all resorts on the Las Vegas Strip  an extraordinarily impressive empire that s worth a serious chunk of change to investors  Thus  we obviously shouldn t expect MGM to tank overnight anytime soon  MGM Resorts is truly international in scope  however  and those trying to size up its prospects in the market need to take into consideration the sizable overseas holdings and operations of MGM Resorts 
The company saw net revenue from domestic resorts pile up to  2 1 billion recently  for instance  largely thanks to its holdings in Las Vegas  Mississippi  and Michigan  The  2 1 billion in domestic revenue the company posted is actually a 1 percent decline from the same quarter last year  however  illustrating that while MGM Resorts has serious financial heft  it s not exactly in a thriving situation  The company saw sizable declines in the amount of revenue it was deriving from rooms at its resorts  too  which could be worrying to hospitality minded investors interested in its shares 
Not all of the news facing MGM Resorts is bad  however   indeed  the company has a slew of things to look forward to in the near future that could help it escape its current nosedive in the market  Sports betting has recently been legalized  for instance  which will doubtlessly help MGM Resorts reap in additional revenues  The casino king could tap into the soon to arrive sports betting market  which some experts consider to be holding a potential  60 to  70 billion 
Down But Not Out
MGM Resorts should consider the official Supreme Court ruling that legalized sports betting to be a lifeline that could pull it out of its current situation and into better financial prospects  After all  MGM Resorts remains one of the chief architects of the Las Vegas Strip  no small title  and can easily cash in on the heyday of sports betting we re soon to witness in Nevada  Las Vegas isn t the only area MGM Resorts can focus its resources on  either  the company derives a sizable portion of its revenue from its casino online and overseas operations  for instance  and can also focus on other areas in the United States like Mississippi and Michigan 
In Macau  MGM Resorts draws in more than  2 billion in revenue alone  The bulk of the company s earnings come from the cash flow heading into its coffers from its many resorts  but its ability to move into overseas market could seriously help it escape the death spiral it s currently suffering from in Western markets  With MGM Resorts already possessing a foothold into the Asian gaming market in the form of its Macau holdings  it could easily expand its presence into nearby countries like Japan  too  in an attempt to cash in on that country s gambling legalization efforts 
While the near term prospects for MGM Resorts don t look good  and the stock could continue to suffer for the remainder of the summer  long term investment angles for the company aren t exactly terrible  While MGM Resorts has built an empire for itself in Las Vegas  the company could easily start churning out more money by building additional resorts and casinos overseas  The success of its operations in Macau show that there s clearly a heavy international demand for MGM Resorts and its gambling services  though it remains unclear if the company is truly intent on going on a foreign spending spree  Keep your eye closely on MGM Resorts stocks as the rest of the summer unfolds   the near term prospects for the casino magnate are grim  but MGM Resorts could bounce back to life with a long term strategy that s focused on overseas development ",2018-06-29,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-avoid-mgm-resorts-stocks-this-summer-200328596,200328596

196531,418047,MGM,Las Vegas police chief says response to gunman came  as quick as possible ,news," Reuters    Las Vegas police are getting closer to finding an explanation for why a gunman carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U S  history  the city s police chief said on Wednesday  as he defended the speed of the department s response to the massacre  Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo  who oversees the police department  told the Las Vegas CBS television affiliate in an interview that police officials were not trying to cover anything up a day after revising the timeline for the shooting  The revision on Monday showed hotel security was aware of a gunman six minutes before he started firing into a crowd of more than 20 000 people  killing 58  The revised timeline raised new questions  including why gunman Stephen Paddock ceased firing on concertgoers once he began  and whether hotel security and police coordinated as well as first believed   No matter what that timeline was  the response was as quick as possible  I don t think the response could have been any faster   Lombardo said in a video posted on the station s LasVegasNow com website  Paddock  64  injured hundreds of people attending a music festival in a hail of bullets fired from the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel  He then shot himself to death before police stormed his room  Lombardo on Monday said Paddock shot a hotel security guard Jesus Campos  who was checking on an open door fire alarm on the same floor  six minutes before beginning to fire on the crowd  Officials initially said Paddock  who had placed hidden cameras outside the room to monitor activity  first fired into the concert and then stopped shooting after strafing the hotel hallway through the doorway of his room when Campos was apparently detected by the gunman  Earlier police accounts also said a wounded Campos helped direct police to the room occupied by Paddock  who by then had quit firing on concertgoers  Lombardo originally said police officers reached the 32nd floor within 12 minutes of the first reports of the attack   We will have a pretty good assessment of the reasons why  but it is going to take time   he said  adding  there are going to be questions that will never be answered   Las Vegas police officials were not immediately available for comment  MGM Resorts International  N MGM   which owns the Mandalay Bay  questioned the latest chronology from police  saying in a statement on Tuesday that it may not be accurate  ABC News reported on Wednesday the gunman s girlfriend  Marilou Danley  has been put on a U S  government watch list that will notify authorities if she attempts to leave the country on a commercial airline flight  
Danley  62  has been called a  person of interest  in the case  Her lawyer said she had no inkling of Paddock s plans ",2017-10-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/las-vegas-police-chief-says-response-to-gunman-came-as-quick-as-possible-540318,540318

196533,418049,MGM,5 Things Investors Should Know About China This New Year,opinion,"Last Friday marked the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year  also known as the Spring Festival  China s most important holiday  The fire rooster struts off stage  clearing the way for the loyal earth dog  According to CLSA s tongue in cheek  health care  consumer and paper products are favored to outperform early this year  followed by internet  utilities and tech leading into the summer 
Around this time I always pay close attention to transportation and industrials   Chunyun   which translates to  Spring Festival Transportation   is a 40 day travel season that s known as the world s largest human migration  This year  as many as 390 million Chinese travelers more people than live in the U S  and Canada combined are forecast to put roads  highways  passenger trains and airlines through their paces as they visit families  go on vacation and travel abroad  Airlines alone are expected to serve 65 million passengers  a 10 percent increase from last year 
As the size of China s middle class continues to surge and incomes rise  this upward trend in flight demand and overall consumer spending appears sustainable  creating some very attractive investment opportunities 
Below are five additional things I think investors should know about China and the surrounding region in the New Year 
1  China is a veritable wealth factory 
Speaking of disposable income  Last year  the China region added more new billionaires than the U S  for the first time ever  UBS and PricewaterhouseCoopers   PwC   found that the total number of Asian billionaires rose to 637  followed by the U S   563  and Europe  342   China alone minted 67 new billionaires in 2017 and is now home to nearly 320 
Combine this with a surging middle class already the largest in the world and the consequences on consumption could be huge 
As I ve shared with you before  China is still in the early stages transitioning from a manufacturing to a consumption and services based economy  According to the World Economic Forum  WEF   Chinese household income is projected to grow around 5 percent annually between now and 2027  elevating approximately 180 million people into the middle income bracket  This will contribute to greater demand for everything from appliances to smartphones to automobiles to luxury goods 
Gold jewelry demand  for instance  grew 10 35 percent year over year in 2017  And it wasn t just the super wealthy making purchases  the China Gold Association reported  Less affluent consumers also had an appetite  helping China maintain its ranking as the world s largest buyer of gold for the fifth straight year 
Heavier spending is also showing up in Macau casinos  which saw revenues jump an incredible 36 4 percent year over year in January  This was the gaming territory s 18th straight positive month and its largest such increase in nearly four years  suggesting Macau is well on its road to recovery after Chinese president Xi Jinping s anticorruption crackdown 
This month  Macau welcomed its newest casino resort  the  3 4 billion MGM Cotai  increasing MGM s gaming table count in the territory nearly 30 percent to 552  according to Reuters 
2  But don t count Chinese manufacturing out just yet 
Despite China s de emphasis on manufacturing as its main growth engine  a lot of value still remains  Chinese manufacturing began the year strong  expanding at a healthy clip with a purchasing manager s index  PMI  reading of 51 3  This was down slightly from December but in line with the previous January 
Expectations are especially high for electric vehicle  EV  production and sales  as the Chinese government sweetened the incentive for families to trade in their gas powered automobile for one that runs on a battery powered electric motor  Those with a range greater than 400 kilometers  249 miles  on a single charge now come with a 50 000 yuan   7 881  cashback incentive  up from 44 000 yuan   6 937  last year  according to Bloomberg  The government also increased the number of kilometers a car must be able to travel on a single charge to qualify for the incentive  from 100 last year to 150 
 Sales volumes for new energy vehicles exceeded 700 000 last year  and this number is further expected to increase to more than 2 million in 2020  and to more than 5 million in 2025   Kevin Li  a senior analyst with Strategy Analytics   early this week 
Several Hong Kong listed carmakers and their suppliers had a fabulous 2017  Guangzhou ended the year up 97 percent while Geely gained more than 265 percent  The government s policy change appears to be another tailwind 
Robotics and artificial intelligence  AI  is another space that China is expected to dominate  According to UBS  China overtook the U S  and Japan in 2016 in installed robotics systems  and by 2020 it s set to manufacture up to 40 percent of all robots globally  By 2030  its AI industry could be worth as much as  150 billion 
3  China has an insatiable appetite for energy  both clean and traditional 
As its generous incentive for EVs suggests  the Chinese government is serious about combating air pollution  especially in highly populated metro areas  As such  the country imported a record amount of natural gas  which burns more cleanly than coal  According to customs data  China consumed 68 57 million metric tons of the fossil fuel in 2017  up 27 percent from the previous year 
That doesn t mean the Asian giant is done entirely with other fossil fuels  though  The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  reported last week that China imported more crude oil than the U S  for the first time in 2017  It brought in an average 8 4 million barrels per day last year  compared to 7 9 million barrels per day for the U S 
As I shared with you last week  China is now the largest consumer of U S  crude oil other than Canada  according to Reuters 
4  Nearly 40 percent of the world s unicorns call China home 
As you probably know  a  unicorn  is a company valued at more than  1 billion that hasn t been listed yet  Think Uber  Dropbox  Airbnb and more 
A September report by Deloitte and China Venture found that China is home to 98 of the world s 252 unicorns  accounting for 38 9 percent of the total number  Only the U S  has more at 106 unicorns  or 42 1 percent 
Like U S  unicorns  the ones in China come mostly from information technology  including online payment services and e commerce 
Among the largest is smartphone maker Xiaomi  which is valued at a whopping  100 billion  It  and several others  are highly anticipated to go public this year  with a showdown brewing between Hong Kong and New York 
According to CNBC  close to 140 Chinese companies raised  32 2 billion in initial public offerings  IPOs  in 2017  a figure that could be exceeded this year if Xiaomi  Uber competitor Didi Chuxing  content platform ByteDance  and more  decide to list 
5  China hosts the most and biggest bitcoin mining facilities  But for how long 
Another Chinese unicorn that could be eyeing a possible IPO soon is Bitmain  the world s largest manufacturer of bitcoin mining rigs  It also operates Antpool  a cryptocurrency  mining pool  that generates digital coins using the pooled resources of a number of different miners  The Beijing based Bitmain  whose valuation is reportedly  in the billions   claims to have built around 70 percent of all mining rigs in operation around the world today 

It s little wonder  then  that three quarters of bitcoins globally are mined in China  according to a Mining concentration is especially high in the southwestern province of Sichuan  where miners have managed to strike deals with hydroelectric power companies 
 China is the country that hosts most mining facilities and uses the highest power consumption of all countries for cryptocurrency mining   the study s authors write 
That could soon change  however  The Chinese government has already clamped down on bitcoin exchanges and banned initial coin offerings  ICOs   and now it seeks to shutter the mines themselves  Last month  a governmental taskforce on internet finance asked local authorities to assist in shutting down operations that produce cryptocurrencies 
At the moment  there doesn t seem to be a deadline  but miners are already scouting the world for new mining locations  Bitmain  which also has a presence in Switzerland  is looking at potential sites in energy rich Quebec  according to Reuters  and other miners could be following suit

196553,418069,MGM,Executing Trades Based On Ex Dividend Dates,opinion,"of our covered call positions is rare but possible  When it does occur  it is frequently related to an ex dividend date  These are dates that we must own the shares in order to be eligible to receive the dividend on the distribution date  Premium members can access ex dates of the eligible stocks in our Premium Stock Reports in the column on the far right as shown below 

In the two rows highlighted in brown we see 
GLW  top  has an ex date of 5 26 2017
MGM  bottom  has an ex date of 6 7 2017
Both ex dates fall within the June 2017 monthly contracts
When should we write the calls if we want to avoid potential early exercise of shares we want to hold 
The BCI guidelines are to write the call the day of or the day after the ex date when that ex date falls within the first week of a monthly contract or to sell a 2 month option if the ex date falls in the latter part of the monthly contract  The rationale for this is that the time value erosion    of an option is logarithmic in nature for near the money strikes which means that the longer we wait to sell the option  the less premium we receive  This is seen graphically in the chart below 

Time decay and Monthly contracts
There are 26 calendar days in the June 2017 contracts  If we wait to sell the covered call on the ex date of these two securities  the percentage of calendar day time decay lost is as follows 
Corning Incorporated  NYSE GLW   6 26   15 4 
MGM Resorts International  NYSE MGM   17 26   65 4 
MGM is impacted even more than the percentages reflect because more time value is lost the closer we get to expiration Friday 
Best time to execute covered call trades based on these ex dates
GLW  5 26 2017 or the next trading day
MGM  Write a 2 month call  July expiration  after expiration of the May contracts  thereby moving the expiration date far away from the ex date  making early exercise highly unlikely  although possible  
Technical versus practical application
From a technical perspective  call holders are better off selling the call  buying the stock prior to the ex date and then capturing the dividend  assuming there is a time value component to the option premium   However  most retail investors will still exercise the option to capture that dividend so all call writers who want to retain the underlying must take these position management strategies seriously 
Discussion
For many of us  early exercise is not a problem  It results in maximum returns for the current trade and having our cash back early to then re invest  But for some  retention of current shares is important and so circumnavigating ex dividend dates must be mastered  If the ex date falls in the first week of the contract  we can write the call on that date of the next trading day and still generate decent premium for that month  If the date comes later in that contract month  writing a 2 month call after expiration of the previous month s contracts is the better approach  Selling   when available  is another way to circumnavigate ex dates and avoiding the covered call position the week of the ex date

196590,418106,MGM,Kirk Kerkorian  casino tycoon  movie mogul  auto investor dies at 98,news,"By Will Dunham  Reuters    Kirk Kerkorian  the son of poor Armenian immigrants who used his gambler s instincts to become a multibillionaire Las Vegas casino tycoon  Hollywood mogul  airline owner and auto industry investor  died at age 98  Kerkorian  who founded MGM Resorts International  N MGM  and was its largest shareholder  died in Los Angeles on Monday night  the company said in a statement on Tuesday  He passed away after a brief illness  the Las Vegas Review Journal reported  Kerkorian had little formal education and dropped out of school at age 16  In his youth he was known as  Rifle Right Kerkorian  for his punching power as a small time boxer  He would become an enduring American business heavyweight with a knack for placing winning bets in the corporate world  Last month  Forbes magazine estimated Kerkorian s wealth at  4 2 billion after he took a hit on his investments in 2008  when the magazine said he was worth  16 billion  Three different times   in 1969  1973 and 1993   Kerkorian built the world s biggest hotel in Las Vegas  the desert gambling capital where he first made his fortune in the 1950s and 1960s   On his way to becoming a casino magnate  he befriended  Rat Pack  stars Frank Sinatra  Dean Martin and other Las Vegas headliners  Kerkorian owned some of the biggest and best known Las Vegas hotels and casinos  at one time owning more than half the hotel rooms on the famous Las Vegas Strip  He also was instrumental in turning Las Vegas into a family destination rather than merely a naughty pleasure spot for adults  Kerkorian bought and sold the venerable MGM film studio three times  acquired the United Artists studio and tried to buy Columbia Pictures  Yet  even as a studio chief  he would stand in line to buy movie tickets at a theater with everyone else rather than attend private screenings  Kerkorian mounted high stakes pursuits of U S  automakers but never acquired one  He twice tried to buy Chrysler  triggering a massive legal tussle  and made big investments in General Motors  N GM  and Ford  N F   He was a skilled aviator who flew dangerous missions delivering warplanes from Canada to Britain during World War Two and later opened a charter flight business serving gamblers wanting to get from Los Angeles to Las Vegas more quickly than a 10 hour drive  He began buying property in Las Vegas in 1962 after selling his charter airline  which he later repurchased  and was on his way to becoming a Las Vegas power player   When you re a self made man you start very early in life   Kerkorian once told the Las Vegas Review Journal       You get a drive that s a little different  maybe a little stronger  than somebody who inherited   He later bought and sold airlines including Western Airlines  started the failed luxury airline MGM Grand Air and launched an unsuccessful bid for Trans World Airlines  In the business world  he was known more for making a deal than for nurturing a company over the long haul  often taking a major risk  reaping the benefits and getting out  For example  MGM under Kerkorian often languished artistically and even sold off such items as its studio lot and movie props including Dorothy s ruby slippers from  The Wizard of Oz    He s a born gambler with a sixth sense for sniffing out value   former auto executive Lee Iacocca  who joined Kerkorian in the unsuccessful Chrysler takeover bid in 1995  told the Los Angeles Times in 2005   Doing deals is what keeps him alive   Kerkorian agreed   I m a gambler at heart   he told the Times   That s my life   The only other person with a resume like his   an aviator and owner of an airline  film studio and Las Vegas casinos   was fabled billionaire recluse Howard Hughes  who died in 1976  LAS VEGAS LIFESTYLE Kerkorian enjoyed the Las Vegas lifestyle  and his second wife was a Las Vegas showgirl  They had two daughters  Tracy and Linda  whose names he combined to create the name of his holding company  Tracinda  and his charity  the Lincy Foundation  Kerkorian remained vigorous into old age  He was an avid tennis player despite not starting until age 50  and liked to play lengthy doubles matches with friends in Beverly Hills  Kerkorian s third wife was former women s professional tennis player Lisa Bonder  who was 49 years younger than him  They were married for just 28 days in 1998 and went through a nasty 2002 child support fight  Court papers showed Bonder falsified a DNA sample in order to claim Kerkorian was the biological father of her daughter  DNA tests later revealed Hollywood producer Steve Bing as the father  A security guard working for Kerkorian nabbed dental floss from Bing s trash to obtain the crucial DNA sample  Kerkorian testified in 2008 in the trial of his lawyer  Terry Christensen  who was convicted of conspiring to wiretap Bonder during the dispute  Bonder had sought  320 000 in monthly child support for her then 3 year old daughter  including  144 000 for travel   14 000 for parties and play dates  and  436 for care of the girl s bunny and other pets  In 2014 the Las Vegas Sun reported that at age 96 Kerkorian had married Una Davis  who was many years younger  Kerkorian s charitable work has included hundreds of millions of dollars in support of Armenia  He started providing medical and other supplies following a damaging 1988 earthquake in Armenia and helped build homes and repair infrastructure  Kerkorian avoided public events  usually shunned publicity and rarely spoke to the media but was not a recluse  He was born as Kerkor Kerkorian in Fresno  California  on June 6  1917  the youngest of four children of Armenian immigrant parents  His family lost its farmland amid financial difficulties in the 1920s and he had to work to help out  
Kerkorian was sent to reform school and dropped out at age 16  A friend with whom he worked installing furnaces changed his life by taking him on a flight in a single engine plane  Kerkorian then paid for flying lessons with famous woman pilot Pancho Barnes by milking cows and shoveling manure at her ranch  His love of flight launched his business career ",2015-06-16,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/kirk-kerkorian,-casino-tycoon,-movie-mogul,-auto-investor-dies-at-98-346833",346833

196594,418110,MGM,Q2 Earnings Remain Strong  But TWTR  MGM    LUV Disappoint,opinion,"Thanks to decent jobless claims figures and a plethora of strong earnings reports  stocks moved higher almost across the board early Thursday  With Q2 earnings season panning out well for most  there s an even harsher spotlight on the few companies like Twitter   NYSE TWTR    Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    and MGM Resorts   NYSE MGM   that disappointed investors this morning 
Interestingly enough  all of the aforementioned companies actually surpassed earnings estimates  but their share prices are slumping for a variety of other reasons  For example  Twitter s loss of two cents per share was significantly narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents  but investors were more focused on the company s stagnant user figures 
MAUs in the quarter were 328 million  which was unchanged from the first quarter of 2017 and up just 5  year over year  DAUs were up about 12   Total revenues slumped about 4 7  to  573 8 million  although that result did surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  536 8 million  also read    
Despite beating on both the top and bottom line  shares of Twitter opened at  17 36 on Thursday  nearly 11 5  lower than Wednesday s close  The stock dipped to an intraday low of  16 85 per share in morning trading  and investors will hoping to avoid a double digit loss on the day will now need quite the mid day bounce 
Southwest was also able to post a double beat  with earnings of  1 24 per share and revenues of  5 74 billion surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates of  1 20 and  5 73 billion  Revenue per available seat mile the ever important RASM figure was up a respectable 1 5  year over year 
Southwest s problem was its outlook for the third quarter  a period that includes most of the busy summer travel season  The company is expecting RASM growth of just 1   and unit costs excluding fuel  special items  and profit sharing are expected to increase about 2  to 3   Higher costs and sluggish unit revenue is  of course  not a great combination for an airliner  also read    
Shares of Southwest opened about 5  lower on Thursday  eventually hitting an intraday low of  53 77 in morning trading  However  the stock has already started to bounce back a bit  shares were down less than 3  heading into the afternoon 
Casino giant MGM Resorts also reported on Thursday morning  The company posted earnings of 31 cents per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents  but revenues of  2 64 billion lagged our consensus estimate of  2 66 billion 
Improvements in Las Vegas helped MGM s profits growth more than 19  year over year  but weak results at MGM China contributed to its revenue miss  MGM China s net revenue fell 1  year over year to  449 million due to lower revenues from main floor table games  which isn t the best result considering the overall improvement of the Macau region  also read    
MGM shares quickly slumped to an intraday low of  32 31  a drop of more than 4 6  from yesterday s close  The stock has since recovered slightly  but it is unlikely to win over too much investor favor given the relative strength of its competitors  earnings reports so far

196653,418169,MGM,MGM Resorts  MGM  Q2 Earnings  Will Macau Hurt Results ,opinion,"MGM Resorts International   NYSE MGM   is set to report second quarter 2016 results on Aug 4  before the opening bell  Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 23 08  
In fact  the company has posted positive earnings surprises in three out of the trailing four quarters  with the average positive earnings surprise being 90 84  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
MGM Resorts  earnings in the to be reported quarter are expected to benefit from improving demand at its properties in Las Vegas  thanks to a higher employment rate and a rise in the number of tourists  With the Las Vegas Strip recording high occupancy rates over the past year  the company has seen a solid rise in resort revenues  which should boost the top line  Further  the diversification of its resort portfolio and non gaming options should propel second quarter revenues as well 
However  the sluggish environment in Macau is likely to keep revenues under pressure as high stake gamblers have been reducing their spending amid the ongoing economic weakness in China  The region has also struggled due to the Chinese government s anti graft corruption drive  which has reduced footfall at the casinos  Also  credit growth concerns  tighter restrictions on visas and a partial smoking ban in casinos have impacted revenues in the region 
The weakening of yuan is likely to further dent Macau s gambling revenues as it gets more expensive for Chinese gamblers to place bets  Further  a slowdown in the Chinese economy is hurting the mass market segment  which will in turn hurt revenues in the to be reported quarter 
Nevertheless  a comparatively better performance at main floor and non gaming segments can somewhat make up for the slowdown in the VIP gaming business in Macau MGM RESORTS INT Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that MGM Resorts is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Its Earnings ESP is  24 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 19 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 25 cents 
Zacks Rank  MGM Resorts  Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise 
Meanwhile  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some stocks in the consumer discretionary sector that investors may consider  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Eros International Plc   NYSE EROS    with an Earnings ESP of  7 14  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Red Lion Hotels Corporation   NYSE RLH    with an Earnings ESP of  100  and a Zacks Rank  3
