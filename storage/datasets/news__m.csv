203258,424774,M,Mild weather boosts U S  job growth  jobless rate ticks up,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  job growth accelerated in January  with unseasonably mild temperatures boosting hiring in weather sensitive sectors  indicating the economy will probably continue to grow moderately despite a deepening slump in business investment  The Labor Department s closely watched monthly employment report on Friday  however  showed the economy created 514 000 fewer jobs between April 2018 and March 2019 than originally estimated  The strong start to 2020 is a boost to President Donald Trump who is seeking a second term in office in the Nov  3 election  but the biggest downgrade to payrolls over a 12 month period since 2009 showed the labor market was not as robust as the Republican president has boasted   Strong job creation in January provided reassurance that the record long economic expansion still has room to run   said Lydia Boussour  a senior U S  economist at Oxford Economics in New York   But this latest health report also points to a maturing labor market  with benchmark revisions showing it isn t as youthful as it has pretended to be over the last two years   Non farm payrolls increased by 225 000 jobs last month  with employment at construction sites increasing by the most in a year amid milder than normal temperatures  the government s survey of establishments showed  There were also strong gains in hiring in the transportation and warehousing industry  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would rise by 160 000 jobs in January  Some said the unusually warm weather was likely throwing off the model the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data  juicing the numbers  With the coronavirus hitting the Chinese economy hard  U S  payrolls growth could slow in the coming months  The Federal Reserve on Friday flagged the coronavirus as a risk to the U S  economy   Until it is clear that the hiring was due to an upward shift in the overall economic growth rate  we have to assume that there are weaker numbers coming sometime during the next few months   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania  The economy grew 2 3  in 2019  the slowest performance in three years  after logging 2 9  growth in 2018  Growth this year is seen around 2   The benchmark revisions left job gains in 2019 at 2 1 million  the fewest since 2011   Trump  speaking ahead of a trip to North Carolina  described the job numbers as  fantastic  and added that  jobs continue to be great  our country continues to do great   U S  House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi  a Democrat  said the sharp downgrade to payrolls in the 12 months through last March  shows the rot at the heart of the Trump economy   She noted that  three years in  the Trump economy is creating 42 000 fewer jobs a month on average than the last three years of President Obama    Graphic  Participation in the U S  labor market     UNEMPLOYMENT RATE RISES Economists said the size of the benchmark revisions  which showed substantial downgrades to manufacturing employment from August through December 2018  suggested the government might not be fully capturing the impact on payrolls of Trump s 19 month trade war with China  which has contributed to the longest downturn in business investment since 2009    Graphic  U S  employment      Tariffs hit activity and employment in a way that the BLS did not incorporate at the time   said Samuel Coffin  an economist at UBS in Stamford Connecticut   We believe the same is happening now   Stocks on Wall Street retreated from record highs as investors focused on the benchmark revisions  The dollar  DXY  traded higher against a basket of currencies while prices of U S  Treasuries rose   Economists said the report supported the Fed s desire to keep interest rates unchanged this year The government also introduced updated population estimates to its smaller household survey data  The unemployment rate is calculated from the household survey   The labor force participation rate  or the proportion of working age Americans who have a job or are looking for one  rose two tenths of a percentage point to 63 4  last month  the highest since June 2013  As a result  the jobless rate rose to 3 6  from 3 5  in December   Economists said the higher participation rate  if sustained  suggests the economy needs to create about 130 000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working age population  instead of the 100 000 estimated by Fed officials   Despite the downward pressure from an aging workforce  the participation rate has edged higher over the past few years amid a vigorous rebound in prime age  especially women s prime age  participation   said Sarah House  a senior economist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Securities in Charlotte  North Carolina  With slack still remaining in the labor market  wage inflation remains tame  Average hourly earnings increased 0 2   last month after gaining 0 1  in December  That lifted the annual increase in wages to 3 1  in January from 3 0  in December  The average workweek was 34 3 hours for a third straight month in January   The construction industry added 44 000 jobs in January  the largest since January 2019  after payrolls increased by 11 000 in December  Employment in the transportation and warehousing industry accelerated by 28 000  driven by gains in the hiring of couriers and messengers  Payrolls in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 36 000 jobs  Healthcare and social assistance employment rose by 47 200 jobs  There were also gains in hiring in the professional and business services  and wholesale trade industries  But manufacturing employment declined by 12 000 jobs after falling by 5 000 in December  The industry has been the hardest hit by the U S  China trade war  Though Washington and Beijing signed a Phase 1 trade deal last month  U S  tariffs on  360 billion of Chinese imports  about two thirds of the total  remained in place   Graphic  U S  labor market by sector     Manufacturing is also being

The retail giant acquired Story in 2018 and launched the boutiques in some of its department stores less than a year ago  describing it as  a retail concept that changes every few months to bring a new narrative experience to life through curated merchandise and event programming   The deal was really seen as an  acqui hire     buying a business to obtain the creative force behind it  In this case  Story founder Rachel Shechtman was brought on board as Macy s brand experience officer  a job that gave her responsibility for improving the entire chain s in store experience 

A story without a happy ending
Macy s  like many of its retail counterparts  has been struggling to retain its relevance as changes in consumer preferences have altered people s shopping habits 
In the statement announcing the boutique closures  Macy s maintained that its purpose in integrating Story into its department stores was to learn what customers were looking for in an in store experience  and asserted that the concept  will remain an important part of Macy s gifting strategy  
But the retailer continues to flounder  It also announced it was closing an additional 125 Macy s stores and firing 2 000 employees  around 9  of its workforce  as part of a three year plan it calls its Polaris Strategy  which is intended  to stabilize profitability and position the company for growth  ",2020-02-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ptb-k,2080622
203260,424776,M,Hudson s Bay Co seeks to bolster Saks off price stores with staff move,news,"By Melissa Fares
NEW YORK  Reuters    Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson s Bay Co  TO HBC  on Monday named a president to lead its off price business  known as Saks Off 5th  the latest example of a department store chain trying to bolster its outlet stores 
Until now  the discount apparel unit Off 5th was run by the president of the main Saks Fifth Avenue chain   We ve had mostly department store people running the business   Hudson s Bay Co  HBC  Chief Executive Officer Helena Foulkes told Reuters   So now it s a chance for people to come in who have real expertise as off price folks and allow them to take it to the next level  
Under the watch of Saks Fifth Avenue President Marc Metrick  the Saks Off 5th team has been evolving its buying strategy to be more nimble in terms of its merchandise  according to Foulkes  Going forward though  Off 5th will be led by Paige Thomas  who most recently served as executive vice president and general merchandise manager of Nordstrom s men s and kid s departments  Prior to that  Thomas spent more than five years as executive vice president and general merchandise manager of Nordstrom s off price  Rack  business 
In recent years  several of America s legacy retailers including Saks   Nordstrom Inc   N JWN  and Macy s Inc  N M   have grown their off price outlets  once seen as a bargain bin for unsold merchandise  into standalone retail operations to compete with discounters such as  Ross Stores Inc   O ROST  and TJX Companies Inc  N TJX  
But this strategy has come with new risks 
 The department stores are fighting with their feet tied together and one hand tied behind their back as they struggle to deal with the problems of their current business model   said Joshua Varghese  a portfolio manager at Signature Global Asset Management  a division of CI Investments  HBC s twelfth largest shareholder   Creating and growing an entire new business while dealing with such large internal challenges will be difficult and costly  
Hudson s Bay currently operates 114 Saks Off 5th and 41 Saks Fifth Avenue stores  Saks closed 15 Saks Off 5th stores in 2019   The company conducted a fleet review to optimize our store footprint and identified the 15 closures   an HBC spokeswoman said 
And just last week  Macy s announced it would close 125 of its least productive stores over the next three years and cut more than 2 000 corporate jobs as a part of its cost savings effort 
The Cincinnati  Ohio based retailer also said that with Backstage and its Bloomingdale s outlets being the  highlight of the company s performance   it would continue to expand Backstage over the next three years  In 2020  the company said it would open an additional 50 Backstage store within store locations and seven additional freestanding  off mall Backstage stores 
Seattle  Washington based Nordstrom operates 116 full price stores and 248 off price shops  In 2018  it opened a total of 12 off price stores and one full price store  It closed two full price stores and no off price stores 
 I have to say I worry that  off price retail  becomes the silver bullet at times if your full price business isn t good   said Ron Frasch  the former president at retailer Saks Fifth Avenue as well as its rival Bergdorf Goodman   You can see that with the dramatic increase with many of the major players in outlet  retailing  said Frasch  an operating partner at private equity firm Castanea Partners ",2020-02-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/hudsons-bay-co-seeks-to-bolster-saks-offprice-stores-with-staff-move-2081169,2081169

The S P 500 Index gained 1 5   but the NASDAQ was the real outperformer  it jumped more than 2  and reached a new record high  as the sentiment pendulum shifted from a flight to safety to a rush for profit

203264,424780,M,The Secret To Safe 7  Dividends  With Upside  In 2020,opinion,"I m annoyed with this bubbly stock market  It s making it nearly impossible for regular people to find decent dividends 
Sure  we ll always take upside  and despite overdone drops due to the coronavirus  the market has handed us a 4  total return since the New Year  building on the 31  it delivered last year 
But where the heck do we invest our gains 
Truth is  if you want to deploy cash into higher payers  you re in for a tough slog  the S P 500 yields just 1 7  today  a low we ve only seen a couple times since the financial crisis 
US Stocks Rarely Pay so Little






Treasuries  The 10 year is a shade worse  yielding just a hair under 1 7   And we can thank folks outside America s borders for that 
With  11 trillion of bonds paying negative yields around the world  foreign investors think a 1 7  payout looks good  So money is moving into US Treasuries  driving up prices  cutting yields and leaving American retirees  and near retirees  in the cold 
It s an infuriating situation  when all we really want are 
7   dividend yields  enough to fund a retirement on a nest egg that a regular person not a millionaire could save up Monthly payouts because bending over a spreadsheet trying to fit a quarterly cash flow into a monthly bill payment schedule is no retirement  That s why two of the three funds I ll show you below pay you every month  And we want to get our high payouts from  Reliable companies  I know you don t want to spend your golden years poring over quarterly reports from tough to value firms like business development companies  BDCs   guessing if your payouts are safe And you sure don t want to be forced to bet on outrageous dividends  like the 9 7  paid by Macy s  NYSE M   Right now  the retailer pays 113  of its cash flow in dividends  That s a dividend cut waiting to happen 
We want to pull our 7   payouts from steady cash generators we know well 
So let s go ahead and do that 
Here s the twist  we re going to do it while adding some huge international dividends to our portfolios 
I know that sounds like a contradiction  but hear me out  because American companies are giving investors a raw deal in the dividend department  Payouts here are pathetic compared to what investors in other countries get 
In the UK  for example  investors are bagging a 4 6  average dividend  French investors are getting 3   Even Canadians are getting 2 9  from their companies  nearly double what S P 500 firms dribble out 
Luckily  there s an easy way for us to tap these same huge international cash payouts and better still  we re going to double them 
And no  you won t have to jet off to Paris  London or Toronto to do it  You can grab these big cash payouts  I m talking 7  average yields here  right from your brokerage account  What I m going to show you is exactly the same as buying shares of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  or Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   save for the 7  dividend  of course   
Think of it as turning the tables on those international bond investors I mentioned earlier  While they re contenting themselves with a 1 7  yield  we ll be grabbing 7   payouts from their best companies 
To show you how  I m going to roll into the three investments I want to tell you about today  All are  run by management firms that are big names in the CEF space 
3 Global CEFs With 7  Average Yields






Global CEF No  1  A 7 3  Dividend With Deep US Roots

Let s start with the CBRE Clarion Global Real Estate Income Fund  NYSE IGR   managed in Pennsylvania by CBRE Clarion  which has been investing in real estate for 36 years 

IGR holds   which boast high yields REIT benchmark Vanguard Real Estate ETF  NYSE VNQ  pays 3 3   nearly double the S P 500 average 
The nice thing about IGR is that it gives us global diversification and a strong base in the US  with 49  of its portfolio in American REITs  Top US holdings include cell tower owner Crown Castle  NYSE CCI   warehouse operator Prologis  PLD  and data center landlord Equinix  NASDAQ EQIX   Globally  we ve got Australian diversified REIT Mirvac  UK office REIT Segro and Japan s Mitsui Fudosan  owner of offices  warehouses and malls 
This global approach has paid off in the last three years  with IGR clobbering VNQ and delivering most of its gain in cash  too  thanks to its gaudy 7 3  dividend 
IGR Beats the REIT Competition in Cash






The best part  the fund s 8 4  discount and the likelihood of lower interest rates tonic for REITs set us up for more upside in the months ahead 
Global CEF No  2  A Diversified Bond Play With a 7 3  Payout
Chicago based Nuveen one of the world s biggest and oldest investment firms  with  1 trillion under management and roots stretching back to 1898 

Its Nuveen Global High Income Fund  NYSE JGH  holds corporate bonds  with at least 65  of its portfolio rated below investment grade  That s where the highest yields live  and Nuveen gives us an extra margin of safety by holding 320 different bonds  so even if a handful were to run into trouble  the portfolio wouldn t suffer 
And even that s not very likely  given that corporate bond default rates are low around 3  in the US  according to Moody s  That leaves us to enjoy JGH s 7 3  payout and potential upside  thanks to its 7 9  discount 

JGH is young  launched in November 2014  but it s beaten both the corporate bond benchmark SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF  NYSE JNK   in red below  and the VanEck Vectors International High Yield Bond ETF  NYSE IHY   in orange 
JGH Beats the ETF Competition






Finally  let s move on to  
Global CEF No  3  A Surging 6 4  Dividend From Down Under 

For our final play  we ll add another high yield sector utilities through the Macquarie Global Infrastructure Total Return Fund  NYSE MGU  

MGU also gives us a base in North America  with top holdings like utility NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE  and pipeline operators TC Energy  TSX TRP  and Enbridge  NYSE ENB   plus global cash generators like Sydney Airport  as in Sydney  Australia   the UK s  National Grid   LON NG  and toll road operator Transurban Group  also out of Australia 
The first number that pops out with MGU is 10 6   the fund s discount to NAV  It s completely ridiculous when you consider that MGU s 6 4  dividend is surging 
A 6 4  Dividend That Doubles







And yes  this fund  too  has outrun the comparable ETF  more than doubling the SPDR S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Infrastructure ETF  NYSE GII  over the last decade 
Another Global Outperformer






Add in the 10 6  discount and the insatiable need for more and better infrastructure  and we can expect even more upside from MGU in 2020 
This Turns a  10 000 Income Stream Into  40 000 Instantly 
A 7  dividend is great  but what if I told you I d found a proven way to boost that yield to a growing 8   payout 
That s no small jump  It means going from  35 000 in income on a  500K nest egg to more than  40 000 
And if you re like most folks  even a 7  dividend is a pipe dream  You re probably scraping by on 2   or less  in income from your portfolio  If that sounds familiar  what I m going to show you now could increase your dividend stream 4 TIMES 
So under our  500K example  your  10 000 in dividends becomes  40 000 
Got more  Great  A  750K investment gives you  60 000 in dividend income  A mil  How does  80 000 in yearly dividend cash sound  With this kind of income  you can live on dividends alone  without having to sell a single share in retirement 
You ll find everything you need to make this dream scenario a reality in my new    
And we haven t even talked about the upside yet  If you followed the simple strategy behind this breakthrough portfolio  here s what would have happened to your cash in the last decade

Private label explosion
Private label goods are arranged and sometimes even made by a retailer outside of conventional wholesale supply channels  Rather than relying on familiar names like Nike or Levi Strauss   Co   a department store chain taps a manufacturer directly  While such goods are considerably cheaper to purchase  the burden of marketing them falls entirely on the store selling them 

It s a bigger business than most consumers realize  with many shoppers regularly purchasing in house products without realizing it  Target s clothing lines Cat   Jack along with Prologue  for instance  are both private label brands  Market research firm NPD estimates that private label goods now account for roughly one third of the United States   400 billion dollar consumer apparel market 
The Macy s opportunity
Macy s in house brands include International Concepts and Alfani  both of which the retailer believes will generate at least  1 billion in annual revenue apiece within the next five years  Style   Co  and Charter Club are also private labels Macy s intends to turn into billion dollar franchises by 2025 
Even at one fourth of its total business  Macy s house brands exposure would still not match that of more experienced department stores  Private label goods drive 45  of Kohl s sales  according to estimates from Jungle Scout  jibing with other estimates about Kohl s business mix  At one point around half of JC Penney s was produced by house brands ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prmrj,2077338
203283,424799,M,Is Macy s  M  A Great Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now 
One stock to keep an eye on is Macy s  NYSE M   M is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and an A for Value  The stock is trading with P E ratio of 7 57 right now  For comparison  its industry sports an average P E of 11 60  Over the past 52 weeks  M s Forward P E has been as high as 8 42 and as low as 5 30  with a median of 7 07 
M is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1 01  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  M s industry has an average PEG of 1 39 right now  Over the past 52 weeks  M s PEG has been as high as 1 04 and as low as 0 71  with a median of 0 90 
We should also highlight that M has a P B ratio of 0 90  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This company s current P B looks solid when compared to its industry s average P B of 1 30  Over the past 12 months  M s P B has been as high as 1 40 and as low as 0 70  with a median of 1 03 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  M has a P S ratio of 0 21  This compares to its industry s average P S of 0 25 
Finally  investors will want to recognize that M has a P CF ratio of 2 84  This metric takes into account a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 4 25  M s P CF has been as high as 3 99 and as low as 2 25  with a median of 3 18  all within the past year 
Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics  but the above data helps show that Macy s is likely undervalued currently  And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook  M sticks out at as one of the market s strongest value stocks ",2020-01-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-macys-m-a-great-value-stock-right-now-200500731,200500731

203285,424801,M,Analysts  2 Big 8  Dividend Stocks to Buy  And 1 to Sell ,opinion,We re coming off a year of major league gains in the markets  and analysts are predicting a flatter year ahead  With the strong likelihood that share price returns will slow down  now is a logical time to start reassessing your portfolio  It s time to decide which stocks to shed  and which to snap up Income is the deciding factor  Investing is all about making money  making your investments grow  So  if markets follow the predictions  and growth slows  that leaves dividends as the sensible route to go  Dividends provide a steady income stream  whether markets go up or down  But not all dividend stocks are created equal  With that in mind  we delved into the market data from TipRanks com to get the lowdown on 3 high yield dividend stocks  two of which analysts think are set to shine in 2020  and one whose prospects aren t quite as bright  Let s dive in Viper Energy Partners  VNOM We ll start with the cash rich energy industry  Specifically  with Viper Energy  an oil company operating in the Midland formation of the Texas Permian Basin  This basin holds the largest proven oil reserves in North America  and operations in the Permian have made the US the world s largest producer of crude oil  Viper has exploration rights in more than 14 000 acres in the Midland  which are exploited by third parties and subsidiaries who then pay the royalties that make up Viper s income  Viper Energy s land holdings contain an estimated 10 billion barrels of recoverable oil and oil equivalents Despite low oil prices  Viper s position as a land holder rather than direct operator allowed it to continue recording profits in 2H19  At the same time  lower forward guidance pushed the stock price down  The top  and bottom line numbers in Q3   the last reported   disappointed  revenues missed the forecast by 6  and came in at  71 8 million  while EPS  at 13 cents  missed the estimate by only a penny  At the same time  EPS was up 160  year over year  and oil production showed a 9  sequential gain Better for investors  Viper has held fast to its dividend commitment  The company is consistent about making the payments  and has a history of adjusting the payment to make sure that it is sustainable  Currently  VNOM shares pay out a quarterly dividend of 46 cents  or  1 84 annually  giving a yield of 8 21   This is more than four times the average yield found among S P 500 stocks Viper s production has been strong in recent months  and Wall Street analysts are taking notice  Pearce Hammond  of Piper Sandler  writes   Positive news for VNOM as the company announced Q4 19 total production of 26 1 Mboe d which bested our estimate by 2   Taking into account increased equity unit count  VNOM increased production per million partnership units outstanding by  5  q q despite the headwinds of a broad activity slowdown on non operated properties in Q4   Hammond puts a Buy rating on the stock  along with a price target of  33  indicating an upside potential of 47    To watch Hammond s track record  click here Also bullish is Welles Fitzpatrick from SunTrust Robinson  Fitzpatrick notes the strategic implications of Viper s more recent land acquisitions   While the company has been extremely active on the acquisition front  as of the last update interest had gone down somewhat  Instead we expect the company to refrain from adding acreage that it cannot reasonably predict activity plans for  a move that we think will be rewarded by the currently more conservative energy investor base   Fitzpatrick backs his Buy rating with a  32 price target  showing confidence in an upside of 42    To watch Fitzpatrick s track record  click here Overall  Wall Street likes VNOM shares  In fact  the analyst consensus on this stock is a unanimous Strong Buy  with 9 positive reviews  Shares are selling for  22 04  and the average price target of  33 67 suggests an impressive 50  upside potential   See Viper stock analysis at TipRanks Hercules Capital  HTGC Venture capital is the lifeblood of innovation  Start ups couldn t start without money  and all new research and

the life sciences  technology  and financial SaaS sectors Venture capitalists are necessary for innovators to succeed  but they don t operate as a charity  They want to see a return on their money  Hercules has been fortunate  and its investments have provided strong returns  In Q3  the most recent report on record  the company showed a record in net investment income of  38 9 million  which

reported  HTGC has beating the earnings forecasts The company has also grown its dividend  After holding the payment steady at 31 cents from 2013 to 2018  HTGC began increasing the payout  raising it three times in 2019  The current payment  35 cents  annualizes to  1 40  for a yield of 8 9   It s a clear boon for investors Writing for Jefferies  5 star analyst John Hecht points out the generally strong position of HTGC stock   We observe positive trends and developments at HTGC  and we believe this reflects inherent competitive advantages and strong execution  Additionally  we point to an ongoing strong VC market backdrop and further enhanced balance sheet  Hecht maintains a Buy rating here  and puts a  16 price target on HTGC  His target suggests room for 11  upside growth in this stock   To watch Hecht s track record  click here HTGC is another company with a unanimous analyst consensus of Strong Buy  this one based on 4 Buy ratings  Shares sell for  14 30  and the average price target of  15 33 implies a modest upside of 6 6   The key point here is the high dividend   See Hercules Capital s stock analysis at TipRanks Macy s  Inc   M Macy s is a storied name in American retail  a long time mainstay of the department store segment  Before the decline of indoor shopping malls  there was a time when Macy s stores were frequently seen as anchors for the country s retail shopping outlets  But times have been hard for American retail  Since 2015  Macy s has closed more than 150 under performing locations In the most recent quarterly report  for third quarter 2019  M showed the first same store sales decline in two years  The drop was 3 5   and came in hand with a fall off in revenue of 4 25   to  5 17 billion  EPS did beat expectations  however  coming in at 7 cents versus the breakeven forecast  On the downside  that was a 65  drop year over year Falling earnings and a gloomy long term outlook for brick and mortar retail have this stock on the ropes for now   but Macy s is still paying out the dividend  At 37 75 cents per quarter  it annualizes to  1 51  and gives the highest yield on this list  of 9   It s a solid performance  but unless the EPS moves back up  it may not be sustainable Top analysts are not sanguine about the future for Macy s  From Credit Suisse  4 star analyst Michael Binetti writes    W e think negative  0 6  SSS and  3  YOY gross profit dollar declines in a booming economy offer little evidence so far of a change in the ultimate medium and long term challenges facing the company  Importantly  we still have little visibility on how EBIT margins can stabilize from here  We continue to believe it s going to be increasingly difficult for the stock to stabilize on valuation alone  Binetti puts a  12 target on M stock  implying a 28  downside for the shares  This is inline with his Sell rating  and his believe that the stock will underperform in coming months   To watch Binetti s track record  click here Kimberly Green  5 star analyst with Morgan Stanley  is also bearish here  She writes   Despite closing stores proactively  store only comps remain negative and we forecast them to remain so in the future  eroding ROIC  Expense cuts  real estate monetization  and secondary growth initiatives are encouraging  but we think the market needs to see core retail EBIT stabilization and a return to strong cash flow generation in order to become more constructive on the stock  Green s price target is slightly higher than Binetti s  at  13  but even that implies a downside of 22 5   Again  this is in line with her Sell rating   To watch Green s track record  click here The analysts clear on this stock  the consensus rating here is a Moderate Sell  based on 6 Sells  5 Holds  and just 1 Buy  Despite the high dividend  Wall Street does not see this as a strong market play  Shares are selling for  16 78  but the average price target is  15 40  suggesting the stock will slip 8  in the next

About 2 000 people will lose their jobs due to the changes  though some employees may move to other open positions  This is Macy s showing investors that it has a plan  and that plan is going to be painful    but that a stronger company could emerge from it ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pr2w7,2076129
203301,424817,M,Is Macy s  Inc   M  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Macy s  Inc    NYSE M   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Macy s has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 5 08  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 42  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Macy s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 8 81 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands significantly below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Moreover  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 09  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Macy s has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 6 55  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Macy s has a P S ratio of about 0 22  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 53 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Macy s currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Macy s a solid choice for value investors For example  the PEG ratio for Macy s is just 0 87  a level that is lower than the industry average of 0 92  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 2 44  which is better than the industry average of 3 24  Clearly  M is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Macy s might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and Momentum Score of A  This gives M a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen no upward revision in the past sixty days compared to four downward revisions  while the current year estimate has seen two upward revisions compared to four downward revisions in the same time period The current quarter consensus estimate declined 7 2  in the past two months  whereas the current year estimate fell by 3 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Macy s  Inc  Price and Consensus   Owing to such bearish estimate trends  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMacy s is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge

203306,424822,M,Why Any Gains From Macy s Holiday Sales Report Will Be Short Lived,news,"Macy s  NYSE M  earned itself a post holiday gift as its shares gained over 6  in the opening days of 2020  A solid chunk of that rally came after the company reported holiday sales that fell less than analysts expected  But this is not the beginning of a real turnaround for the stock  which lost 43  last year  as the report doesn t address the headwinds in the struggling department store s path 
Macy s  like its peers  still faces the major threats of online and off price competitors  as well as the fact that malls  the location of most department stores  are losing customers 

Macy s said that same store sales for November and December fell 0 7  in owned stores and 0 6  in owned plus licensed stores  Analysts had been expecting a decline of more than 1 7  for the fourth quarter  which includes the holiday period plus an additional month  The retailer s message was optimistic  with chairman and chief executive officer Jeff Gennette saying the period  reflected a strong trend improvement from the third quarter  and noting good performance in the digital business 
In the third quarter  Macy s reported same store sales declines of 3 9  for owned stores and 3 5  on an owned plus licensed basis  During the earnings call  management said that the growth of its digital business slowed but didn t offer specifics as it did in the previous quarter  when it said digital growth was in the double digits 
Announcing store closures
While the less than expected drop in holiday sales is encouraging  it s not necessarily indicative of a sustainable trend for the company  Macy s followed up on that news by announcing the closure of 29 stores as part of an annual review  The company currently has about 680 stores under the Macy s and Bloomingdale s banners and 190 specialty stores that include off price outlets  The store closures are meant to eventually improve earnings  but it doesn t send a positive message to investors regarding the company s outlook for the business  Now add to that the challenges that have been nipping at Macy s heels for some time  and the department store remains a risky bet for investors 
Though Macy s and its department store peers are now e commerce players themselves  they ve struggled to stand toe to toe with online giants like Amazon  This is a serious problem when considering the latest consumer trends    online sales grew more than 18  over the holiday season compared with the same period a year ago  according to Mastercard SpendingPulse  And while department stores got in on the action with online sales growth of 6 9   their overall sales dropped 1 8   the report showed 
Competing with off price rivals
Macy s has also made efforts to compete with off price rivals by creating its own off price presence  Macy s Backstage is located in select Macy s stores  and in some locations exists a a stand alone store  The retailer said Backstage sales beat its expectations in the third quarter  and it noted that in 2018  15  of customers shopped both Backstage and the main store  The positive here is that this offers Macy s a way to compete across a broader swathe of the market  The bad news is that Backstage likely won t be enough to lift sales at Macy s main stores in a meaningful way  A report by the International Council of Shopping Centers showed that 73  of consumers who shop at off price retailers prefer them to other stores  This indicates that some shoppers may go to Backstage specifically  because it is an off price brand  but they won t necessarily shop at the main store 
The location of department stores  including Macy s  is another problem that isn t going away  Though Macy s is probably most associated with a stand alone store    the flagship Macy s Herald Square in Manhattan    many locations are tied to shopping malls  which have seen declines in foot traffic over the years  In a 2017 report  Credit Suisse analysts wrote that they expect 20  to 25  of malls to close by 2022 
Recommendation of hold is wise
Though Macy s forward price to earnings ratio of just seven seems like a deal compared to its valuation of more than 20 only three years ago  all of the factors weighing on earnings prospects should keep investors away  at least until the retailer proves it can overcome these challenges long term  Macy s plans to talk about its three year strategy during its Feb  5 investor day  and if investors like what they hear  this could give the company and stock a fresh new direction ",2020-01-12,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ph38t,2057619

203323,424839,M,Macy s Is Closing More Than 2 Dozen Stores in 2020,news,"In August 2016  Macy s  NYSE M  announced that it would close approximately 100 stores across the U S  in an accelerated fashion    with most of the closures occurring the following year  Sure enough  Macy s shuttered 63 stores in early 2017 
Since then  Macy s has closed approximately 30 additional stores as leases expired or properties were sold  That lined up almost exactly with what the company had said it would do in order to complete the right sizing of its store portfolio 
Unfortunately  following a rebound in sales and earnings trends that began in late 2017  Macy s has come under renewed pressure over the past year  As a result  the pace of store closures is set to accelerate again in 2020  In fact  Macy s has already confirmed plans to close more than two dozen stores this year  which will bring its cumulative total since mid 2016 to well beyond the original target of 100 
Macy s needs to keep slimming down
Macy s returned to sales growth in the final quarter of 2017  following 11 consecutive quarterly declines  Its momentum continued in the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 as comparable store sales rose 2 7  year over year  That allowed the company to post strong earnings growth 
However  comp sales growth slowed to just 0 7  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  This trend continued in the first half of fiscal 2019  That    along with poor merchandise planning decisions    led to a sharp drop in Macy s profitability  In the third quarter  Macy s tried to pull back on discounting to protect its margins  but that contributed to a 3 5  comp sales decline 

On Macy s Q3 earnings call  management acknowledged that rapidly deteriorating sales trends at lower tier malls contributed to the weak result  Macy s has tried to keep many of these stores open despite falling sales and profitability to serve as convenient hubs for online order pickup and returns  Yet in most cases  it has been fighting a losing battle  as consumers have migrated to other physical and digital shopping venues  In short  another big round of store closures has become necessary 
Closing overlapping stores
First  Macy s will continue to shrink its store count in markets where it has multiple locations  In today s retail world  it makes more sense for the chain to focus its efforts on the best malls in each region 
Within this category  Macy s plans to close stores in the Akron  Ohio  Atlanta  Chicago  Cincinnati  Harrisburg  Pennsylvania  Kansas City  Miami  Nashville  Orlando  Seattle  Piedmont Triad  and central Connecticut regions  Three store closures had been announced previously  a pair of furniture galleries in the Chicago suburbs that were sold for  26 million    the furniture sections will be moved into massive nearby Macy s stores    and the retailer s downtown Seattle store  which will be sold 
Most of the other 11 stores in this group sit on real estate owned by the company  Macy s will likely try to sell the real estate quickly  provided it can get decent prices   generating cash that it can use to continue paying down debt and funding investments in the business 
Exiting small markets
An even more striking aspect of Macy s 2020 store closure program is that it is set to pull back dramatically in small markets  Stores in Vero Beach  Florida  Macon  Georgia  Lewiston  Idaho  Carbondale  Illinois  Muncie  Indiana  Owensboro  Kentucky  Leominster  Massachusetts  Salisbury  Maryland  Helena  Montana  St  Clairsville  Ohio  State College  Pennsylvania  Burlington  Washington  and Walla Walla  Washington are all set to close 
For the most part  these are small cities with fewer than 150 000 residents in the metro area  In the era before e commerce  even these small cities could sometimes support department stores  as there was minimal retail competition  However  residents of these cities now have abundant  online  shopping options  As a result  in store sales are falling at many of these small city Macy s locations 
These stores don t generate enough sales or profit to justify major investments that might turn the tide  Their steady downward trend in performance means it s no longer economically viable to keep these stores open just to serve Macy s e commerce business 
Expect more store closures ahead
None of the Macy s store closures revealed this week are especially surprising  The stores that are closing aren t located in high performing malls  haven t received major investments recently  and don t serve a vital purpose for Macy s 
While closing two dozen stores is a good start  there s a lot more work to do for this iconic department store chain  There are more than 600 Macy s stores in the U S  today  including home and furniture stores   and there aren t nearly that many high quality malls  Macy s is likely to continue trimming its store count in the years ahead  Management may have more to say about its specific plans at the company s upcoming investor day next month ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pff-6,2055000

203360,424876,M,Should Value Investors Buy Macy s  M  Stock ,opinion,"The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks  Nevertheless  we know that our readers all have their own perspectives  so we are always looking at the latest trends in value  growth  and momentum to find strong picks 
Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today 
One company value investors might notice is Macy s  NYSE M   M is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and an A for Value  The stock has a Forward P E ratio of 5 76  This compares to its industry s average Forward P E of 10 12  M s Forward P E has been as high as 10 41 and as low as 5 30  with a median of 7 51  all within the past year 
M is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0 77  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  M s PEG compares to its industry s average PEG of 1 21  M s PEG has been as high as 1 22 and as low as 0 71  with a median of 0 92  all within the past year 
Investors should also recognize that M has a P B ratio of 0 76  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks solid versus its industry s average P B of 1 30  Over the past year  M s P B has been as high as 2 06 and as low as 0 70  with a median of 1 13 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  M has a P S ratio of 0 19  This compares to its industry s average P S of 0 23 
Finally  our model also underscores that M has a P CF ratio of 2 43  This metric focuses on a firm s operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 4 24  Over the past year  M s P CF has been as high as 4 47 and as low as 2 25  with a median of 3 38 
These are just a handful of the figures considered in Macy s s great Value grade  Still  they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment  Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook  and we can clearly see that M is an impressive value stock right now ",2019-10-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-buy-macys-m-stock-200481519,200481519
203371,424887,M,5 Low P CF Stocks To Add Maximum Value To Your Investment,opinion,Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks  There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  ratio as one of the key metrics This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better  One of the important factors that make P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  However  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company s liquid assets  It gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and also consider price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential   Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening Signet Jewelers Limited   NYSE SIG   is engaged in the retail sale of diamond jewelry  watches  and other products

203385,424901,M,5 Amazing ETF Strategies For The Fourth Quarter,opinion,After three solid quarters of 2019  Wall Street saw the worst start to the fourth quarter in about a decade with two consecutive days of decline  This is primarily thanks to the latest barrage of downbeat economic reports that point to deeper domestic troubles Most notably  the Institute for Supply Management s purchasing managers index for the manufacturing sector dropped to 47 8 in September  representing the lowest level in more than a decade  Per the employment report from Automatic Data Processing  the United States added a modest 135 000 jobs in September  Average monthly job growth fell to 145 000 over the past three months from 214 000 in the year ago quarter The combination of weak data came amid a persistent Sino American dispute that has raised recessionary fears and the prospect of further tightening by the Fed  The central bank has slashed interest rates by 25 basis points  bps  each for two times in the third quarter since the financial crisis to sustain a decade long economic expansion  Additional rate cuts might be in cards if the same trend persists and Powell pledges to  act as appropriate  to sustain the expansion  read    Additionally  lingering worries about Britain s exit from the European Union  President Donald Trump s impeachment inquiry and geopolitical tension continued to unnerve investors  Further  this earnings season is expected to be weak with S P 500 earnings likely to be down  from the same period last year on 4 3  higher revenues  This would follow 0 4  growth in Q2 and a flat showing in Q1 Against such a backdrop  it is difficult to plan investments that could fetch sure shot returns  In this case  we have highlighted some investing ideas that could prove to be extremely beneficial for investors in the fourth quarter in the current market environment Prepare for VolatilityInvestors should prepare themselves for volatility in the fourth quarter  While there are many ways to survive the market turmoil  investing in lower volatility ETFs could reduce losses in declining markets  while generate decent returns when the markets rise  ETFs like iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF   Invesco S P 500 Low Volatility ETF   SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility  NYSE LGLV  Focus ETF  and SPDR SSGA US Large Cap Low Volatility Index ETF  could be compelling choices  Most of these have a Zacks ETF Rank  2  Buy  or 3  Hold   read    Focus on QualityQuality stocks are rich in value characteristics with healthy balance sheets  high return on capital  low volatility  elevated margins  and a track of stable or rising sales and earnings growth  These stocks thus reduce volatility when compared to plain vanilla funds and hold up rather well during market swings  Some of the funds in this category  MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF   PowerShares S P 500 High Quality ETF  and Barrons 400 ETF  are worth a look Add Value to Your PortfolioValue ETFs have proven to be outperformers over the long term and are less susceptible to trending markets  This is because value stocks have strong fundamentals   earnings  dividends  book value and cash flow   that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued  As such  value ETFs have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with their growth and blend counterparts  Among these  Vanguard Value ETF   HN VTV    iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF   Vanguard Mega Cap Value ETF   NYSE M   and Vanguard Russell 1000 Value ETF  have a Zacks ETF Rank  1  Strong Buy   read    Bet on Rate Sensitive SectorsRate sensitive sectors such as utilities and real estate will get a big boost from the Fed rate cuts  given their higher sensitivity to interest rates  Additionally  global headwinds will continue to raise the appeal of the stocks in these sectors  This is because these often act as a safe haven in times of market turbulence and offer higher returns due to their outsized yields  The most popular funds   Vanguard Real Estate ETF   Schwab US REIT ETF   Utilities Select Sector SPDR   and Vanguard Utilities ETF    seem to be excellent choices  All these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank  3  Hold   read    Focus on DividendsThe central banks across the globe are moving to easy monetary policies with interest rate cuts or launching fresh stimulus

Wall Street finished solidly higher on Tuesday  after paring back early strong gains  as concerns over the escalating trade war between the U S  and China briefly subsided 
U S  President Donald Trump denied that talks between the two sides had broken down   We have a dialogue going  It will always continue   said Trump  who has already announced plans to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at a G20 summit late next month 
Speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates to offset any weakness in the economy took a knock on Tuesday after New York Fed head John Williams  NYSE WMB  and Kansas City Fed President Esther George both pointed downplayed the suggestion  Williams in particular noting that the tariff increases levied by the U S  would tend to increase inflation

203400,424916,M,Stocks Are Sliding  Is The Global Economy Plunging Into A Recession  ,opinion,"Trade war worries have been hammering the financial markets since last Wednesday after data coming from China and Germany indicated trouble for the economies that heavily rely on manufacturing this happening just after the renewal of American recession fears by the bond market 
Stock commodities have been tumbling in the U S  and Europe even as risk averse economists fled to the safety of bonds from the government  pushing the prices of bonds even higher  a move that is entirely in the opposite direction and possibly leading to lowest levels ever seen 

Looking at Wall Street  the S P 500 reduced by 2 9    after a leading drop in the energy sector  Retail shares also experienced a notably sharp fall  after Macy s Inc  NYSE M  posted much less quarterly results  Shares from big technological firms  especially those that have a more sensitive outlook for trade wars  also fell  There was also a drop in Europe s Stock benchmarks 
According to Investo Trend  investors have been responding through the dumping of stocks  even more than had erased gains from a campaign  a day before  Dow Jones Industrial Average had experienced a drop of more than 700 points by the afternoon trade  Technology stock and banks also fell  resulting in retailers coming under extra heavy pressure to sell immediately after Macy s produced dismal earnings report that cut its forecast for a full year 

Traders have a habit of plowing money in the ultra safe government bonds when they are afraid of a possible economic recession  resulting in lower yields  After the long term yields have fallen enough  some market watchers will take this as a prediction showing an upcoming recession within one year or two  The current return within the 10 year Treasury has decreased from 2 02  on the 31st of July this year to less than 1 60   On Wednesday  the 30 year Treasury yield hit the lowest record too

These losses all came a day after the rallying of stocks after Trump administration delayed  160 billion tariffs on Chinese imports that were meant to be effective starting Sept  1st this year 
Even as the market was crumbling down on Wednesday  President Trump took the war to Twitter again accusing the Federal Reserve of hampering the United States economy through raising rates too fast last year  without reversing its policy as aggressively as it should have been   just last month  the Federal Reserve had cut its primary rate point by a quarter  Trump also took this opportunity to defend his current trade policy  even after the investors  worry about the existing trade war going on between the two largest economies in the world  They are also concerned that this war might drag on through to the 2020 United States elections  resulting in more damage to the economy 

Signs of weakness in the economy have also affected the commodities markets  The price of copper  which is mostly determined by the outlook on the growth of the Chinese economy  fell by more than 1  in the New York trade  Future prices for American crude oil also fell by more than 3   Warnings of possible recession pile up for global economy",2019-09-10,Dawn richard,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-are-sliding-is-the-global-economy-plunging-into-a-recession-200463395,200463395

203430,424946,M,Lab grown diamond prices slide as De Beers fights back,news,"By Eric Onstad and Barbara Lewis LONDON  Reuters    Since De Beers abandoned its decades old policy of refusing to sell lab grown diamonds as jewelery  the price gap between man made stones and natural gems has widened   and the difference is set to get even bigger  When De Beers shocked the industry with its U turn in May  a 1 carat synthetic diamond cost about  4 200 while an equivalent mined gem sold for  6 000  But since September  De Beers  has been selling gem quality man made stones for just  800 a carat  De Beers says it wants to create a clear distinction between lab grown diamonds and natural gems  The hope is this will reinforce the mystique of stones formed in the earth s crust so consumers keep buying them for major events such as engagements  By contrast  its synthetic diamonds grown in Britain at its Element Six labs and sold through jewelery subsidiary Lightbox are marketed as sparkly  pink  blue or white fashion accessories that are neither as rare nor precious as real gems  The risk for the 130 year old De Beers  which coined the marketing tag  A Diamond is Forever  in 1947  is that its branding of lab grown gems could undermine natural diamonds  But so far  De Beers  strategy has been working  According to analyst Paul Zimnisky  the average discount of a 1 carat generic lab grown diamond to a natural diamond had widened to 42 percent by mid November from 29 percent in January  At the same time  production costs to make high tech diamonds in a laboratory have plummeted to as little as  300 a carat from about  4 000 over the past decade  according to consultants Bain   Company and two former De Beers  employees  That means De Beers has plenty of scope to cut prices further  to reinforce the cachet of natural gems and to undermine synthetic diamond rivals that have been earning substantial margins in recent years  analysts say   The cost of these synthetic diamonds will go down to production costs plus a competitive profit margin  There is no shortage   said Martin Rapaport  who publishes a list of natural diamond prices regarded by many in the industry as a benchmark   SUBSTITUTION SCENARIO  De Beers is also investing  94 million over four years to build a U S  factory that will churn out 500 000 carats of lab grown gems a year and Chinese producers are stepping up their output of cheap manufactured diamonds    I think De Beers will keep the pressure up and may even cut prices further from the  800 level once they get their new factory up and running   a diamond industry executive who used to work for De Beers said on condition of anonymity  Until about five years ago  diamonds produced from carbon using complex technology had largely been shunned by jewelers as a fringe product  even though they have been used in industry for decades  But man made gem quality diamonds have enjoyed growing sales from millennials attracted by the prospect of cheaper stones that are guaranteed to be conflict free  The industry has attracted investors from Silicon Valley and Hollywood  including  Blood Diamond  star Leonardo DiCaprio  who helps promote man made diamonds as ethical and low carbon   claims that are disputed by the natural diamond sector  While the nascent lab grown sector can still be profitable with a wider discount to natural gems  the eye watering margins at a string of start ups could be threatened if prices continue to fall  especially for larger gems  analysts and insiders said  Public data is not available for the privately held lab grown diamond firms  but Zimnisky calculates many have core profit margins of about 50 percent  Retailers selling both natural and lab grown diamonds are also less likely to apply the same sales pressure to lab grown diamonds once the incentive of huge margins has been eroded    The idea of De Beers is clearly to set a price point where it may deter large volumes of capital to come into the lab grown diamond market   said  Morgan Stanley   N MS  analyst Menno Sanderse   They are trying to minimize the tail risk of the substitution scenario     HIGH RISK GAMBLE  While operating costs of man made diamonds are falling  initial investments can be steep  handing De Beers an advantage given it is backed by mining company  Anglo American   L AAL    De Beers declined to comment on its costs  It said it was selling lab grown diamonds at a profit  refuting suggestions from rivals that it is dumping the man made gems on the market  De Beers says it simply saw a demand for lab grown diamonds and now technology is sophisticated enough to produce gem quality as well as industrial stones  it decided to fill it  So far  lab grown diamonds only account for about 2 percent of the overall diamond jewelery market  California s Diamond Foundry  backed by DiCaprio and Silicon Valley investors  is among dozens of lab grown gem producers to emerge over the last decade as technology has evolved since the first synthetic industrial quality diamond was created in 1954  Firms have been attracted by high prices and the ability to extract profits from several areas of the value chain  While the natural diamond industry includes miners  traders  polishers  jewelery makers and retailers  all adding their own margins  the man made sector controls many if not all of those functions in single firms  German born Diamond Foundry Chief Executive Martin Roscheisen  who has founded several Silicon Valley start ups  said his firm has not had to cut prices due to Lightbox    It s a very high risk gamble that De Beers is taking that so far we don t see working out  because they have primarily legitimized the man made category   Roscheisen said  Another big initiative held its nerve in the United States  the country which accounts for most lab grown diamond sales  Major department stores J C  Penney  N JCP  and Macy s  N M  announced in October the roll out of a bridal collection of lab grown diamond jewelery in time for the peak Christmas season   and stuck to their guns on pricing

1  Retail Inflation Due Up
Inflation data leads tomorrow s economic calendar as the latest numbers on retail prices arrive 
The Labor Department will release the October consumer price index  CPI  at 8 30 AM ET  13 30 GMT  
On average  economists expect that the CPI rose 0 3  last month  The core CPI  which excludes food and energy prices  is forecast to have risen 0 2  
Following a hotter than expected producer price index for October  investors will be looking for further evidence that the Federal Reserve can maintain its plan of more rate hikes 
Core prices are viewed by the Fed as a better gauge of longer term inflationary pressure precisely because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories 
The central bank usually tries to aim for 2  core inflation or less 
Recent solid U S  economic reports and an upbeat assessment of the economy from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell have triggered expectations for a faster than expected pace of rate hikes from the Fed

203466,424982,M,Will Macy s  M  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Macy s  NYSE M   which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Regional Department Stores industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this department store operator has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 22 48   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Macy s was expected to post earnings of  0 31 per share  but it reported  0 44 per share instead  representing a surprise of 41 94   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 65 per share  while it actually produced  2 73 per share  a surprise of 3 02  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Macy s  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Macy s currently has an Earnings ESP of  3 97   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

203489,425005,M,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch ,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1  Housing  Industrial Production  Fed Speakers on Tap
Following renewed expectations for a faster pace of inflation and U S  economic growth in the wake of a duo of economic reports on retail sales and manufacturing  investors are expected to closely monitor economic data and comments from Fed speakers slated for Wednesday 
The Commerce Department at 08 30 ET is expected to report building permits fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 350 million units  while housing starts are forecast to fall 1 1  to 1 310 million units 
A speech by Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic at 8 30AM ET is also likely to warrant attention as investors seek an insight into Fed s thinking on monetary policy 
Economists forecast industrial production due Wednesday at 9 15AM ET rose 0 5  in April 
Fed official James Bullard rounds off the day with a speech at 6 30PM ET 
The dollar hit a fresh 2018 high on Tuesday against a major basket of currencies after the United States 10 Year surged to a nearly seven year high 
2  Weekly US Crude Supplies Data  EIA Monthly Report Eyed
Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration  EIA  on Wednesday is expected to show a second straight weekly draw in U S  crude stockpiles 
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 0 763 million barrels in the week ended May 11 
Weekly U S  production figures are also expected to garner added investor attention after the EIA said Monday it expected U S  crude oil production from seven major U S  shale plays to grow by 144 000 barrels a day in June to 7 178 million barrels a day 
The International Energy Agency  IEA  releases its monthly report at 4 00AM ET  outlining key developments impacting oil market trends 
Crude oil prices settled higher on Tuesday as the prospect of lower global crude supplies following U S  sanctions on Iran continued to support sentiment 
Crude oil futures settled 35 cents higher at  71 31 a barrel 
3  Macy s Quarterly Report in Focus
Macy s is expected to report first quarter earnings of 40 cents per share on  5 42 billion before U S  markets open Wednesday 
Shares of Macy s have rallied more than 20  over the past year  supported by tax reform and signs of progress that the retailer s turnaround efforts are working after fourth quarter results beat estimates 
During the fourth quarter  Macy s posted a 1 4  increase in comparable store sales   a key measure used by analysts to the gauge the performance of retailers   breaking a streak of 11 quarterly declines in a row 
In the run up to Macy s quarterly report  some analysts have tempered expectations  claiming that adverse weather likely weighed on sales during the quarter  While others questioned whether the retailer s real estate gains would continue to offset the deterioration of its core retail business

203490,425006,M,Macy s Q1 Earnings Must Show Rebound In Sales To Push Stock Higher ,opinion,"  Reports Q1 2019 earnings Wednesday  May 15 before the bell  Consensus EPS   0 33  Revenue Expectation   5 52B
Macy s Inc  NYSE M  will have to do something spectacular to reverse the damage its slowing sales have inflicted on its share price  But there s little chance the department store chain will show the turnaround it needs when it reports its first quarter earnings tomorrow before the market opens 
The retailer shocked investors early this year by cutting its full year earnings expectations  citing weakening sales in categories such as women s sportswear  fashion jewelry and cosmetics  That disappointment came in the middle of one of the best growth periods for other retailers as they benefited from the strength of the U S  economy and robust consumer spending 
If Macy s couldn t benefit in this generally enabling operating environment for retailers  there s little hope that it can make things work when the economy is losing its steam  As well  the escalating trade war with China is likely to intensify cost pressures and hurt consumer sentiment 
These concerns have kept investors on the sidelines  hurting Macy s shares badly this year  The stock  which closed down 3 9  at  21 58 on Monday  has dropped in 10 of the past 12 trading sessions  It s plunged 28  this year   losing about half of its value from the peak it reached last summer 

For the quarter that ended in March  analysts are expecting profit per share to decline to  0 33 from  0 48 a year ago  Sales are likely to remain almost flat  5 52 billion  according to analysts  average estimate 
Two Metrics Key to Macy s Rebound
Macy s CEO Jeffrey Gennette has attempted a variety of new formats at its retail stories to try to win back customers and survive amid the e commerce onslaught that has threatened the traditional brick and mortar retail model 
Macy s has been spending heavily to lift its digital presence  adding more local merchandise and refreshing in store fixtures  That strategy has helped boost online sales The retailer expects to exceed  1 billion in online sales this year  Macy s customers are finding its online platform   which lets customers check prices on its app  track order histories  do visual product searches and also chat with customer representatives   very useful 
Along with its online success  Macy s is also cutting costs and it s expected that the store operator will release a savings goal for the next three to five years later this year  Still  in the longer term  Macy s needs to show that its cost cutting  new spending and store remodeling are breathing new life into actual sales 
Traffic at stores and growth in sales are the crucial measures at this juncture  and will be the numbers that investors monitor most closely when the company releases its earnings report 
Bottom Line
We don t see Macy s stock recovering its ground in 2019  even after the massive sell off during the past six months  Due to the company s uneven path to recovery  it doesn t make sense to bet on this retail stock this year  In our view  investors would be better off staying on the sidelines and waiting to see how the current turnaround efforts pan out ",2019-05-14,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/macys-q1-earnings-must-show-rebound-in-sales-to-push-stock-higher-200421039,200421039

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 41 94   A quarter ago  it was expected that this department store operator would post earnings of  2 65 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 73  delivering a surprise of 3 02  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Macy s  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Regional Department Stores industry  posted revenues of  5 50 billion for the quarter ended April 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 46   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 54 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Macy s shares have lost about 26 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 13 1  
What s Next for Macy s 
While Macy s has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Macy s was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 52 on  5 57 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 10 on  24 97 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

203500,425016,M,Analysts Estimate Macy s  M  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Macy s  NYSE M  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 15  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This department store operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 36 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25  
Revenues are expected to be  5 53 billion  down 0 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Macy s 
For Macy s  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 23  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Macy s will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Macy s would post earnings of  2 65 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 73  delivering a surprise of  3 02  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

203526,425042,M,Macy s 2019 Outlook Is Crucial For Its Stock s Comeback,opinion,"  Reports Q4 2018 earnings Tuesday  Feb  26 before the bell  Consensus EPS   2 53  Revenue Expectation   8 44B
Investors are finding it hard to bet on the turnaround of Macy s Inc  NYSE M  in 2019  especially after the retail giant shocked the markets by cutting its full year earnings expectations last month  citing weakening sales in categories such as women s sportswear  fashion jewelry and cosmetics  According to the company s revised forecast  comparable sales will grow about 2   down from a previous outlook of at least 2 3   while earnings are now seen at  3 95    4 a share  down from the previous forecast of  4 10    4 30 
This unexpected setback caused investors to flee  deserting Macy s already vulnerable shares  and erasing almost all of their 2018 gains  The shares closed down 1 6  Friday  at  24 06  The stock has fallen more than 10  in the past year 

What lies ahead for the top brick and mortar retailer is very much dependent on its future guidance and how quickly it is able to win investor confidence  In our view  that goal is becoming increasingly difficult for the retail chain to achieve 
We ve become pessimistic about the sustainability of Macy s turnaround and the retail environment in general  many of the tailwinds that were supporting retailers last year are weakening in 2019 and we see the risks to the downside growing  Tax cuts in 2018  for example  helped consumers to spend more  which in turn helped these retailers to boost their sales  We don t expect that wealth effect to be there in 2019 
On the macro front  the economy is entering uncharted territory where wage inflation  global trade risks and political uncertainty are coming together to weaken consumer sentiment 
Is Macy s Stock Worth Betting On 
Once these macro risks are factored in  it s hard to make a case for taking the risk on Macy s stock  especially when its shares remain so volatile after briefly recovering from their long slump  That said  we don t want to downplay the company s serious efforts to revive sales and get it ready to compete with online competition 
Macy s has been spending to lift its digital presence  adding more local merchandise and refreshing in store fixtures  That strategy has helped boost online sales and proven to be a great success at building in store traffic 
The retailer expects to exceed  1 billion in online sales this year  Macy s customers are finding its online platform   which lets customers check prices on its app  track order histories  do visual product searches and also chat with customer representatives   very useful 
Despite the recent sharp sell off  we still view Macy s as a good turnaround bet for investors who have the stomach to wait for the company s turnaround efforts to produce results 
The company is on the right track and making many bold decisions  including remodeling its stores  reducing its real estate  expanding its popular Backstage off price concept  and growing its Bluemercury cosmetics chain 
Bottom Line
Down almost 43  from its 52 week high  we don t see too much further downside from here for this stock  But investors should wait and see what Macy s management are forecasting for 2019 before taking action  The mega retailer s future outlook will determine whether its stock has reached a bottom in the current bearish cycle ",2019-02-25,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/macys-2019-outlook-is-crucial-for-its-stock-comeback-200391977,200391977

Hong Kong s Hang Seng  conversely  only ticked 0 5  higher  developing a high wave doji  as institutional investors remained cautious ahead of earnings releases  in a sign that smart money in the region isn t easily convinced that global dynamics are really shifting  This posture begs the question  what will happen to Chinese shares and indeed global stocks if there is no substantial trade agreement

203542,425058,M,5 Discretionary ETFs In Focus On Low Consumer Confidence,opinion,"In January  consumer confidence fell to its lowest reading since July 2017 as financial market volatility and the 35 day long government shutdown affected sentiments  The Conference Board s Consumer Confidence Index dropped to 120 2 in January  down from 126 6 in December  The index has  in the past three months   the highest since 2011 
Per   the decline in January has more to do with a temporary shock  rather than a precursor to significant slowdown in the coming months    It seems to be true as the financial markets are showing signs of stabilizing buoyed by improved global market sentiment and resumption of government operations  Economists are expecting a rebound in the months ahead 
Partial Government Shutdown
On Jan 28  following a more than one month long closure  the U S  federal government began operations  Per a new government report  the shutdown is expected to cost about  3 billion to the economy    A deadlock in passing a spending bill  wherein Trump demanded  5 6 billion funding for a border wall that was being opposed by the Democrats  was mainly the reason for the shutdown  read    
Job Market View
Consumers had mixed opinions on the job market  Those believing jobs are  plentiful  increased from 45 5  to 46 6   while those claiming jobs are  hard to get  also increased  from 12 2  to 12 9   The labor market differential  derived from data about respondents  who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful rose to 33 7 for the month from 33 3 in December 
The outlook for the labor market was less cheerful   The proportion expecting more jobs in the months ahead decreased from 16 6  to 14 7   while those anticipating fewer jobs  increased from 14 6  to 16 5  
Mixed views were observed with regard to the income prospects  While the percentage of consumers expecting an improvement declined from 22 4  to 18 2   the share expecting otherwise also declined from 7 6  to 7 1  
Assessment of Business Conditions
While consumers  evaluation of current business conditions was little changed from December  optimism surrounding the short term outlook was more pessimistic  The percentage of consumers expecting that business conditions will improve over the next six months decreased from 18 1  to 16 0   while those expecting that business conditions will worsen increased from 10 6  to 14 8  
Going Ahead
TheU S  economy still looks upbeat buoyed by steady industrial production  a dovish Fed and a robust labor market  At 3 9   the unemployment level is near its lowest level in five decades  read    
However  easing global economic growth and uncertainty looming over trade relations with China remains an overhang on the economy  Moreover  events like the recent shutdown are known to temporarily affect the economy  Per industry experts  a long term solution to the current issue seems to be in jeopardy  raising concerns of further shutdown possibilities

There have been  in business to consumer e Commerce sales in the emerging markets of Asia  Latin America  the Middle East and Africa  So  to tap this momentum  Amplify  issuer of the successful Online Retail ETF   took a step forward and launched a fund targeting purely international online retailing  The new fund is Amplify International Online Retail ETF  

Inside XBUY
The fund looks to focus on foreign companies that generate 90  or more of their revenues from online sales  The underlying index s selection universe considers all non U S  securities listed on exchanges 
The fund is heavy on China  26 5   followed by Japan  23 3    United Kingdom  15 7   and Germany  9 6    The fund holds 45 stocks in total  No stock accounts for more than 3 04  of the portfolio  Traditional Retail makes up about 52  of the fund  followed by Marketplace  33     It charges 69 bps in fees 
How Does It Fit In a Portfolio 
The ETF could be intriguing for investors seeking to benefit from the uptick in international online retailing   outside the United States  per the issuer  Notably  country with the  as of second quarter 2017 was China 
It is expected that  will have Internet access in 2019  per amplifyetfs  Per Statista  e commerce share of global retail sales will likely go up to  in 2021 from 10 2  in 2017  read    
Over the past decade  worldwide e commerce has been growing at an average rate of  a year  according to Economist  Still    about 10  of global retail sales are now made online  Even in South Korea  one of the countries with maximum retail sales online on the global level  share of ecommerce to total is still   per statista com  So  there is huge room for growth globally  read    
Will It See Success 
The fund should see uninterrupted success like IBUY  Though there aren t many online retail ETFs focused solely on international online retail companies  XBUY may face competition from the likes of Global X E commerce ETF   ProShares Long Online Short Stores ETF   ProShares Online Retail ETF  as well as IBUY  Emerging Markets Internet   Ecommerce ETF  can also pose threats to the fund 
Notably  half of EBIZ is exposed to international markets with China taking 25  of the fund  ONLN and CLIX each has 25  exposure to emerging markets  mainly China   per xtf com  IBUY has about 22  exposure to international markets where China  United Kingdom  Germany and Japan are leading 
EBIZ and CLIX charge 68 bps and 65 bps in fees  respectively  while ONLN and EMQQ charge 58 bps and 86 bps  CLIX has accumulated  46 5 million in AUM since its debut in November 2017  while ONLN has amassed about  32 8 million since making an entry last July  Amplify s own fund IBUY has gathered about  287 1 million in assets in less than three years  EMQQ generated about  361 1 million in assets in about five years 
So  it is clear that almost all online retail ETFs are being noticed by investors  The new fund should also make a killing  This is especially true as the fund has been presented to investors with a tweak  i e   pure international online retailing  This uniqueness should make it see more success  The expense ratio of the new fund is also not too high

203634,425150,M,Macy s Posts Decent Results  ValuEngine Still Rates Stock A SELL,opinion,"Macy s Inc  NYSE M  is one of the nation s premier retailers  operating about 885 stores in 45 states  the District of Columbia  Guam and Puerto Rico  under the names of Macy s  Bloomingdale s  Bloomingdale s Outlet and Bluemercury  as well as the macys com  bloomingdales com and bluemercury com websites  Prior to June 1  2007  Macy s was known as Federated Department Stores 
Want to learn more about ValuEngine  Our methods  Our history   
Earnings season continues and we again focus on retail with a look at the latest earnings from one of the sole survivors in the department store realm  Macy s 
The company posted Q3 2018 results today  and their numbers were decent  Adjusted earnings for Q3 came in at  0 27 share a 17  increase from the same period last year  That beat analyst estimates  which were set at  0 14 share  Revenues declined to  5 4 billion  but that was no surprise and met forecast estimates 
Macy s CEO Jeff Gennette had the following to say about the results
We are pleased with Macy s  Inc  performance in the third quarter  marking our fourth consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth  Macy s  Bloomingdale s and Bluemercury all performed well  Our strategic initiatives are gaining momentum and delivering results  Another double digit quarter from our digital business and a strong stores performance combined to help us exceed expectations  We continue to see an improved trend in brick and mortar across the fleet with particularly strong results from our Growth50 stores  The holiday season is when Macy s truly shines  We have the right merchandise  the right marketing and the right customer experiences in place to deliver a strong fourth quarter 
How did Macy s do it  They have been closing non performing locations  improving good locations which they call  magnet stores   and they have improved their e commerce options  They seem to be doing a better job where so many other retailers cannot  using both brick and mortar locations AND online sales to bolster their bottom line and retain customers 
Macy s updated its guidance for the year  and said it now forecasts full year sales to rise between 0 3  and 0 7   In addition  they increased EPS estimates for the year by 15 cents and now predict a year end figure of  4 15  4 30  share 
However  as you can see from our recommendation below  our models remain unimpressed with Macy s  We have a SELL on the company due to its poor one year forecast target price  We will see if that changes mobing forward due to the latest results 
VALUENGINE RECOMMENDATION  ValuEngine continues its SELL recommendation on MACYS INC for 2018 11 13  Based on the information we have gathered and our resulting research  we feel that MACYS INC has the probability to UNDERPERFORM average market performance for the next year  The company exhibits UNATTRACTIVE Book Market Ratio and Earnings Growth Rate

203654,425170,M,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Macy s  M ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Macy s  NYSE M   which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Regional Department Stores industry 
This department store operator has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 26 87  
For the last reported quarter  Macy s came out with earnings of  0 59 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 49 per share  representing a surprise of 20 41   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 36 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 48 per share  delivering a surprise of 33 33  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Macy s  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Macy s currently has an Earnings ESP of  20 00   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on November 14  2018 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-11-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-macys-m-200358249,200358249

M s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  4 01 per share and revenue of  25 31 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  6 37  and  1 91   respectively 
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for M  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model

203668,425184,M,Earnings Preview  Macy s  M  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Macy s  NYSE M  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 14  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This department store operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 13 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  43 5  
Revenues are expected to be  5 44 billion  up 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Macy s 
For Macy s  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Macy s will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Macy s would post earnings of  0 49 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 59  delivering a surprise of  20 41  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Macy s doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-macys-m-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200356271,200356271

203683,425199,M,Bearish Options Premium Spike Ahead Of Macy s Earnings,opinion,"Retail earnings season is heating up  and Cincinnati based department store chain Macy s Inc  NYSE M  is preparing to unveil its second quarter results before the stock market opens tomorrow  Aug  15  Ahead of the event  M stock is trading up 2 6  at  41 11  but options traders have been bracing for a quick post earnings retreat 
In fact  short term speculators are much more put heavy than usual toward the retailer  Schaeffer s put call open interest ratio  SOIR  for Macy s stock is docked at a top heavy 1 75  and ranks in the 75th annual percentile    pointing to a heavy put skew in the front three months  series of options 
Drilling down  peak open interest in the front month series    which expires at the close this Friday  Aug  17    is found at the August 36 put  where 21 138 contracts currently reside  Data from Trade Alert suggests significant buy to open activity here in late May when Macy s was trading near  34  indicating options traders were expecting a lackluster summer for the retail stock 
However  data also confirms some sell to open activity here  While it s possible some speculators are using these short puts to set a floor for M shares  it s more likely they re hoping to capitalize on a post earnings volatility crush    which would theoretically make it cheaper to buy back the options 
It s certainly a prime time to sell premium on M puts  Not surprisingly  the stock s 30 day at the money implied volatility  IV  is elevated ahead of tomorrow s event    last seen at 50 3   which registers in the 81st annual percentile  Plus  the stock s 30 day IV skew of 8 6  ranks in the 83rd percentile of its annual range  indicating short term Macy s puts are pricing in higher than usual volatility premium relative to calls 
Historically speaking  Macy s is coming off three straight positive earnings reactions    averaging a next day gain of 8 4   On average  the shares have swung 10  in the session subsequent to the retailer s report over the last eight quarters  regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in a bigger 14  swing for tomorrow s trading 
Another move to the upside could have more shorts jumping ship  Although short interest plunged 10  in the most recent reporting period  there are still 42 32 million M shares sold short  This represents almost 14  of the security s available float  or 6 4 times the average daily pace of trading 
It s possible this latest round of short covering helped fuel a big bounce off the stock s 50 day moving average  too  Not only has this trendline helped Macy s shares more than double on a year over year basis  but the equity is up 15 8  since ricocheting off here in mid July ",2018-08-15,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bearish-options-premium-spike-ahead-of-macys-earnings-200338705,200338705

203697,425213,M,Is Macy s  M  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Macy s  Inc    NYSE M   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Macy s has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 4x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Macy s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 31 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Macy s has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Macy s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Macy s has a P S ratio of about 0 5  This is a bit lower than the industry average  which comes in at 0 5x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  M is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Macy s currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Macy s a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Macy s might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F  This gives M a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen five up in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 5 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Macy s  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMacy s is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 7  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below However  with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana      Ignited by new

203703,425219,M,Weather dampens U S  job growth  unemployment rate drops to 4 5 percent,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  job growth slowed sharply in March amid continued layoffs in the embattled retail sector  but a drop in the unemployment rate to a near 10 year low of 4 5 percent suggested labor market strength remained intact 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98 000 jobs last month  the fewest since last May  the Labor Department said on Friday 
Job gains  which had exceeded 200 000 in January and February  were also held back by a slowdown in hiring at construction sites  factories and leisure and hospitality businesses  which had been boosted by unseasonably warm temperatures earlier in the year 
In March  temperatures dropped and a storm lashed the Northeast and Midwest  Economists said bad weather accounted for the stepdown in hiring  The two tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 4 7 percent in February took it to its lowest level since May 2007 
 The disappointing gain in nonfarm payrolls in March is a bit of a head fake that doesn t reflect the underlying strength and momentum in the labor market   said Scott Anderson  chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco 
While the bigger establishment survey showed fewer jobs created last month  the smaller and more volatile survey of households showed employment increased 472 000 
The economy needs to create 75 000 to 100 000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working age population and some Federal Reserve officials view the labor market as being at full employment  Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 180 000 last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4 7 percent 
The dollar rose a three week high against a basket of currencies while prices for U S  Treasuries fell  Stocks on Wall Street rose 
LABOR MARKET SLACK SHRINKING
Job growth averaged 178 000 per month in the first quarter  underscoring the labor market s strength  despite last month s stumble 
The solid employment gains suggest that an apparent slowdown in gross domestic product growth to around a 1 0 percent annualized pace in the first quarter is probably temporary  The economy grew at a 2 1 percent rate in the fourth quarter 
Average hourly earnings increased 5 cents or 0 2 percent in March after rising 0 3 percent in February  That lowered the year on year gain in wages to 2 7 percent 
But with inflation rising and the unemployment rate below the most recent Fed median forecast for full employment  economists expect another interest rate increase in June 
The U S  central bank lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more increases this year  Minutes from the Fed s mid March meeting showed most policymakers expected to start reducing the Fed s  4 5 trillion bond portfolio later this year 
New York Fed President William Dudley said on Friday that would prompt only a  little pause  in the central bank s rate hike plans 
 If today s decline in the unemployment rate doesn t reverse itself they may be compelled not only to hike but also to signal a faster pace of future tightening   said Michael Feroli  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York 
Other measures also showed labor market slack shrinking  The labor force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  held at an 11 month high of 63 percent in March 
A broad measure of unemployment  which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment  fell three tenths of a percentage point to 8 9 percent  the lowest level since December 2007 
The employment to population ratio increased one tenth of a percentage point to a fresh eight year high of 60 1 percent 
Last month  construction jobs rose 6 000  the weakest gain since August  after robust increases in January and February  Manufacturing employment advanced by 11 000 jobs  slowing from the 26 000 positions created in February 
Retail payrolls fell 29 700  declining for a second straight month  Employment at clothing retailers decreased by 5 800 jobs last month and general merchandise stores shed 34 700 positions  Retailers including J C  Penney Co Inc and Macy s Inc  NYSE M  have announced thousands of layoffs as they shift toward online sales and scale back on brick and mortar operations 

Leisure and hospitality payrolls increased 9 000  a third of February s job gains  as employment at amusement parks fell 6 900  Government payrolls increased 9 000 as state and local government hiring offset a 1 000 drop in federal jobs ",2017-04-07,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-job-growth-slows-sharply,-unemployment-rate-falls-to-4.5-percent-472488",472488

203745,425261,M,The Limited owner almost doubles investment  but closing all stores,news,"By Jessica DiNapoli
 Reuters    Sun Capital Partners Inc  the private equity owner of Limited Stores LLC  disclosed on Friday it has almost doubled its investment in the troubled U S  women s apparel retailer  even as it announced that it will shut all approximately 250 The Limited stores amid losses 
Sun Capital Partners told investors in a letter that it has made 1 8 times its  50 million investment in Limited Stores  thanks to prior distributions and dividends  according to an email to investors seen by Reuters 
Sun Capital also said in the letter that it is writing down the remaining equity value of Limited Stores to zero 
The disclosure illustrates how private equity firms can boast a profit from companies whose equity value has been wiped out  having previously recouped their original investment by taking dividends from these companies  often by having them borrow more money to fund the dividends 
 We have worked very hard and made significant investments over nine years to improve operations and create a sustainable business at The Limited   Sun Capital told Reuters in an emailed statement 
Limited Stores said on Friday that it would close all its brick and mortar retail locations effective Sunday 
 In an increasingly challenging environment for mall based retail and women s apparel  we are very disappointed that the company has had to make the difficult decision to close its retail locations   Sun Capital also said 
Limited Stores declined to comment 
Sun Capital acquired a majority stake in Limited Stores in 2007 and bought the rest of the company in 2010 
Erik Gordon  a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business  called Sun Capital s return on its investment  an unusually happy ending for the private equity firm   though he added that the nine year period during which Sun Capital was an investor in Limited Stores was a  little on the long end

203758,425274,M,Stay Safe In An Unstable Market   5 Top Ranked Value Picks,opinion,The U S  stock markets have been witnessing volatility since February 2018  In fact  two major stock indexes   Dow 30 and S P 500   are lingering in negative territory so far this year  Notably  a series of political issues have taken a toll on the stock markets overshadowing the solid growth outlook The recent stock market volatility may be transitory in nature  given the strong economic fundamentals of the United States  Further  markets are expected to continue their long term uptrend However  investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently should rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability  At this stage  it would be a prudent decision to pick up great value stocks to cushion the portfolio Geopolitical Tension  A Cause of ConcernOn Apr 14  the United States  the UK and France jointly launched missiles strikes targeting strategic sites in Syria in response to a suspected poison gas attack by the reigning Bashar Assad government  Notably  Syria is a close ally of Russia and the missile strike immediately resulted in a political conflict between the United States and Russia Any escalation of war will no doubt impede the global economic growth  Meanwhile  news has surfaced that Russia s lower house of parliament is considering a draft legislation allowing Kremlin to ban a list of U S  products  This is in retaliation to recent U S  sanctions on a group of Russian tycoon and officials Russian president Vladimir Putin has warned the western world that any further attack on Syria will result in a worldwide chaos  The White House is likely to reciprocate with fresh economic sanctions on Russia Trade War Fear Looms LargeMarkets were gripped by fears of an ensuing trade war between the United States and China after President Trump imposed tariffs of as much as  50 billion of Chinese imports  Consequently  China too announced plans for reciprocal tariffs on about 130 U S  goods worth of  50 billion of imports from the United States According to the Wall Street Journal  President Trump is likely to release a list detailing further tariffs on China  likely to be worth  100 billion  Trump has also threatened to block Chinese technology investment in the United States  High Earnings Expectations May BackfireInvestors have pinned high hopes on first quarter 2018 earnings  These massive expectations may result into short term market volatility  On Apr 13  the market witnessed three major banks reporting better than expected results Yet  all those stocks lost significantly on the same day dragging down the overall market  simply because those strong results failed to encourage investors  High investors  expectation may result in lofty valuations of the U S  stock market  which  if they fail to deliver may backfire Our Top Picks The U S  remains volatile so far in 2018  Recent geopolitical and trade related concerns  lower than expected earnings results and return of inflationary pressure will certainly generate more fluctuations at least in the short term  This in turn will force investors to put their money in safe assets In anticipation  it will be a prudent decision to buy value stocks on the dip that could prove to be valuable finds once the rally resumes  Our selection is also backed

203768,425284,M,U S  jobless rate falls to nine year low  payrolls rise,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  unemployment rate fell to a nine year low of 4 6 percent in November  as employers added another 178 000 jobs  making it almost certain that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this month 
The unemployment rate hit its lowest level since August 2007 because more people found work but also because the labor force shrank as more people retired  lowering the number of working age people in the labor force to 62 7 percent 
U S  nonfarm payrolls increased by 178 000 jobs last month after increasing by 142 000 in October  the Labor Department said on Friday 
Economists had forecast payrolls rising by 175 000 last month and the unemployment rate remaining unchanged at 4 9 percent 
 The decline in the unemployment rate and the unambiguous decrease in labor market slack are likely to place further upward pressure on inflation  This report easily clears the bar for a December rate hike   said Michael Gapen  chief economist at  Barclays   LON BARC  in New York 
Wages slipped for the first time in nearly a year though after two straight months of increases  Economists partially blamed the drop in average hourly earnings on a calendar quirk  which they expect Fed officials will overlook at their Dec  13 14 policy meeting 
Average hourly earnings fell three cents  or 0 1 percent  after rising 0 4 percent in October and gaining 0 3 percent in September  Average hourly earnings fell for workers in mining  manufacturing and utilities in November 
Last month s drop in wages lowered the year on year gain to 2 5 percent in November from October s 2 8 percent increase  which was the largest rise in nearly 7 1 2 years 
 This is likely to be a temporary setback  as further tightening in labor market conditions should increase competition for skilled labor and support stronger wage growth   said Jim Baird  chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo  Michigan 
A broad measure of unemployment  that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment  fell two tenths of a percentage point to 9 3 percent  the lowest level since April 2008 
After a rally of about 6 0 percent in the past three weeks  U S  stocks ended little changed in the wake of the jobs data on Friday 
U S  Treasury bond yields on Friday eased from multi month highs after the worst sell off in debt markets in nearly eight years following the election of Donald Trump as U S  president in early November 
Trump s plan to increase infrastructure spending and cut taxes could encourage companies to boost hiring and spur an even faster pace of economic growth over the coming years  analysts said 
BROAD GAINS
Job gains have slowed from an average of 229 000 per month in 2015 to an average of 180 000 this year as the labor market nears full employment  Still  the monthly increases are more than enough to absorb new entrants into the labor market 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100 000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the working age population 
 It is not that firms aren t trying to hire  they just cannot find qualified workers at the wages they want to pay   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania  
The jobs report added to data on consumer spending  the housing market and manufacturing in suggesting the economy continued to gain momentum in the fourth quarter after output rose at its fastest pace in two years in the third quarter 
About 226 000 people dropped out of the labor force last month  As a result  the labor participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  fell 0 1 percentage point to 62 7 percent 
The participation rate is near multi decade lows  partly reflecting demographic change  Economists believe that the low participation rate is hindering faster wage growth 
Job gains last month were broad  though manufacturing shed another 4 000 jobs  Manufacturing payrolls have now dropped for four straight months  Construction employment increased by 19 000 jobs last month after rising by 14 000 in October 
The retail sector shed 8 300 jobs in November  which could reflect a shift toward online shopping that has forced department stores such as Macy s Inc  N M  to close several stores  Retail jobs have declined for two straight months 
Professional and business services payrolls increased by 63 000 last month  Healthcare and social assistance employment increased by 34 700  Temporary help jobs  a harbinger for future hiring  rose by 14 300 

Government employment gained 22 000 jobs  There was a surge in local government hiring  which could have been driven by the Nov  8 U S  election ",2016-12-02,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-jobless-rate-falls-to-nine-year-low,-payrolls-rise-445119",445119

It s not as easy as simply picking out the ETFs or the stocks with the highest yields  Those ETFs and stocks might not be the  best  ones to buy  for a whole host of reasons 
Tracey and Neena discuss the pitfalls of buying simply for yields 
Where DO you look for yield in a market that has been all about growth 
ETFs with Attractive Dividend Payouts

1        Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF  has a yield of about 2 7  and an expense ratio of just 0 07   22  of the portfolio is tech  however  so it may be more volatile than you would think 
2        iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF  has a yield of 2  and its expense ratio is also low at just 0 08   This ETF has more banks in its portfolio than the Schwab fund 
3        Wisdom Tree Emerging Markets High Dividend ETF   AX DEM   is a way to get emerging market exposure while also getting a juicy dividend  It s yielding about 3 4   26  of the portfolio is from Taiwan with 13  Russian  Expenses are higher as it s a niche ETF  at 0 6  
4        iShares International Select Dividend ETF  IDV  has the juiciest yield of these four names  It s currently yielding about 4 5  with an expense ratio of 0 5   It invests in high dividend companies in the non US developed market which means a lot of companies in France  the UK and Australia 
Stocks with Big Dividend Yields
Tracey took a look at some stocks that had big dividend yields but also solid fundamentals

203796,425312,M,3 Undervalued Zacks Rank  1 Stocks ,opinion,"Many investors completely freaked out during the correction  but those who are familiar with the Zacks Rank were licking their chops  What was the biggest frustration when the market was soaring  It was that the  easy money  had been made and stocks couldn t go much higher 
Well  the correction took care of that  The market volatility can also be a help if you know how to play it 
The bottom line is that there are countless quality stocks that were too expensive a month ago   but not now  And once the market finds it s balance in this strong economy  those stocks will have a long trip to get back to those highs  That long trip can be very profitable for investors 
The Zacks Rank is a great tool to find these stocks before the next leg higher  The  screen will give you a chance to act on these names before the rest of the crowd does  Take a look below at three of the bigger names on the list 
U S  Steel   
President Trump shocked the market last week when he outlined plans to impose tariffs of 25  on steel and 10  on aluminum imports  He s taking a lot of heat for this announcement on both Wall Street and Main Street over fears that it could raise prices and start a trade war  But the steel industry just loves the idea 
One of the beneficiaries would be U S  Steel  X   Shares are up more than 25  so far this year and it has put together three straight quarters of positive earnings surprises  In its fourth quarter release from January  X reported earnings per share of 76 cents  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents by 11 8   Revenue popped 18 2  year over year to  3 13 billion  compared to the Zacks Consensus of about  3 07 billion 
For the full year  adjusted earnings per share of  1 94 marked a dramatic turnaround from last year s loss of  1 60  Plus  net sales jumped more than 19  to  12 25 billion 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is now at  3 73 per share  which has improved by nearly 42  over the past 60 days and about 13 7  in just the past 30  Expectations for next year are even more impressive  At the moment  we expect earnings for 2019 to climb 13 7  year over year to  4 24  The result improved by 93  in the past 60 days  including a rise of 13  in just the past month United States Steel Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    
Macy s   
Earnings estimates for Macy s  M  really took off after the department store giant reported encouraging fiscal fourth quarter results last week  In just the past seven trading days  analysts have boosted this fiscal year s expectation by nearly 25   while next fiscal year has soared more than 70  in that time 
M now expects earnings per share between  3 55 and  3 75 for fiscal 2018  ending January 2019   The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time was only around  2 90  so there was a lot of room for higher revisions after the report  In addition to robust consumer sentiment  the company made several moves to get itself in a good position to find success in the ever changing retail space 
The company has now topped our estimates for three straight quarters  Most recently  it reported earnings per share of  2 82 in its fiscal fourth quarter  The result was more than 4 8  better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Total revenues of  8 67 billion improved 1 8  from last year  Same  store sales were up 1 3   M has now put together 34 straight quarters of double digit growth in its digital business 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year is  3 63 per share  Earnings estimates had been rising even before the recent report  In fact  that outlook jumped 45 2  in 3 months  Analysts are only expecting  3 17 for next fiscal year  but that doesn t end until January 2020  There s a lot of time for improvement if M s optimism eventually pays off  Plus  the outlook improved by an astounding 120  in the past 3 months 
So far  M has gained nearly 21  year to date  and is part of a space in the top 1  of the Zacks Industry Rank Macy s Inc  NYSE M  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    
US Foods Holding Corp     
US Foods Holding Corp   USFD  is one of the country s largest foodservice distributors  partnering with about 250 000 restaurants and foodservice operators  However  it has only been a publicly traded company for less than two years 
Since its IPO  US Foods beat 6 times and matched once  it has never missed  It reported fourth quarter earnings of 44 cents per share in mid February  which was 2 3  better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate at 43 cents  Net sales advanced 5 6  year over year to  6 billion  Total case volume increased 1 9  while independent restaurant case volume was up 7 1  
US Foods sees adjusted diluted earnings per share of between  2 and  2 10 for the full year with net sales growth of 3  to 4   It expects total case volume growth of 1  to 2  
The full year saw net sales of  24 1 billion  or 5 4  better than last year  Total case volume increased 2 9  in 2017  while independent restaurant case volume was up 5 2   These increases were credited to strong growth with independent restaurant  healthcare and hospitality customers 
Earnings estimates for this year and next have jumped since USFD s quarterly report  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is now at  2 05 per share  which has gained nearly 21  in the past two months and 13 3  in the past 30 days  Analysts currently expect earnings to then climb 14 1  further to  2 34 per share in 2019  The guidance has improved nearly 24  in two months and 14 7  in 30 days US Foods Holding Corp  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

203797,425313,M,Should Value Investors Consider Macy s  M  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Macy s  Inc    NYSE M   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Macy s has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 1  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Macy s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having fallen slightly over the past few months  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 30 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should point out that Macy s has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 8 4  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Macy s has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  M is toward the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Macy s currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Macy s a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Macy s is 1 0  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 6  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 4  which is better than the industry average of 5 5  Clearly  M is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Macy s might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of C  This gives M a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending higher  The current fiscal quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen seven upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has increased 65 2  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has risen by 33   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Macy s Inc Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMacy s is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  among the Top 1   and top Zacks Rank  Macy s looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past one year  its industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast

203805,425321,M,Macy s pays  8 700 fine to settle employment discrimination charges,news,"Investing com    Macy s Inc  NYSE M  and the U S  Department of Justice reached an agreement on Wednesday to settle allegations that the department chain store discriminated against work authorized  non U S  citizens at a Los Angeles area location 
As part of the settlement  Macy s agreed to pay a civil penalty of  8 700 and provide additional employee training  The allegations stem from charges filed by a legal permanent resident whose employment at a Macy s store last October in Glendale  California was delayed even as she provided sufficient work permits  At the time  her hiring was delayed after a company human resources employee incorrectly assumed that such residents were required to provide unexpired permanent resident cards  A subsequent investigation from the Department of Justice determined that four other lawful permanent residents faced similar requirements from members of Macy s human resources department 
Under the Immigration and Nationality Act  INA   lawful permanent residents are not required to show their permanent resident cards when they begin working  the Department of Justice said in a statement  Alternatively  workers are allowed to present other forms of identifications such as a driver s license and social security card 
 Macy s did the right thing by immediately resolving the charging party s delayed hiring and by giving her full back pay   said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta  head of the Justice Department s Civil Rights Division    All employers should take care not to impose unlawful burdens on employees because of their citizenship or immigration status and address issues promptly when they make mistakes  
In June  2013  Macy s paid the government  175 000 in civil penalties to resolve charges that the company acted unfairly with its documentation practices in the hiring of work authorized immigrant employees  Macy s was also required to spend  100 000 to create a back fund to compensate individuals who suffered lost wages or a loss in seniority due to the company s actions

203809,425325,M,Should You Buy Macy s  M  Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Macy s Inc    NYSE M   gained more than 1 2  in morning trading Monday  less than one day before the retail giant is scheduled to post its latest quarterly earnings report  Macy s serves as an important bellwether for mall based retailers and department store brands  so investors will want to pay close attention when the company reports on Tuesday morning 
Macy s is one of the nation s top retailers  operating about 860 stores throughout the country  The company owns stores under the names of Macy s  Bloomingdale s  Bloomingdale s Outlet and Bluemercury  as well as the macys com  bloomingdales com and bluemercury com websites 
Shares of Macy s have gained more than 27  over the past three months  meaning that the pressure will be on the company to deliver solid results  But what does Macy s have in store  Let s take a closer look 
Latest Outlook
Based on our latest consensus estimates  we expect Macy s to report adjusted quarterly earnings of  2 69 per share and revenues of  8 71 billion  These results would represent growth of 33 2  and 2 3   respectively 
Full year earnings are projected to come in at  3 63 per share  up from about 16 2  from the previous year  Macy s said that it expects sales on an owned basis to decline between 2 2   and 3 3   with comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis to decline between 2 0  and 3 0  
Earnings ESP
Investors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Macy s surprises investors with better than anticipated earnings results  For this  we turn to our Earnings ESP figure 
Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Just one day before its report  M is sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   but its Earnings ESP sits at  0 6   This is because the company s Most Accurate Estimate for earnings sits at  2 67 per share  meaning that the most recent analyst estimates have been lower than the consensus 
Despite the stock s strong Zacks Rank  our model does not conclusively indicate that we are in store for a beat 
Price Performance and Surprise History
Another important thing to consider ahead of M s report is the company s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices Macy s Inc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Macy s has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two consecutive quarters  but the retailer does not have the most rock solid earnings surprise history  We have witnessed periods of positive momentum in the wake of the company s recent beats  and earnings misses have been met with periods of sluggishness over the past few years 
One final thing to consider is that Macy s is currently trading about 21  lower than its 52 week high  so the stock probably has a good amount of room to run higher if its report impresses  However  the stock s climb in recent weeks also presents downside potential

203828,425344,M,4 Best Stocks To Counter First Government Shutdown Since  13,opinion,Republicans and Democrats are in no mood to settle their divide over immigration policy and come to an agreement to fund the government  Thus  the government closure will go into a third day and such a shutdown is expected to damage growth All these have boosted the risk of greater fluctuations in the equity market that have largely scaled higher in recent years  With the markets apprehending a pullback after a strong run  investing in sound stocks that are unperturbed by market gyrations seems judicious Government Shutdown to Go Into Third DayStock futures are tumbling after the government remained shut down  The Bill that could have kept the government funded through Feb 16 was voted down in the Senate  This shutdown is expected to continue into Monday  as the ruling party and the opposition failed to strike a deal before the work week began in Washington  A million federal workers are not expected to go to work if the shutdown lingers The Republican led Senate was quick to blame the Democrats post the shutdown  The Democrats have almost opposed all the GOP proposals needed to keep the government running  They have withheld their support until issues related to immigration  healthcare  disaster relief and military spending are sorted  The Democrats  especially  want an assurance from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to put a bipartisan immigration bill up for vote  regardless of President Trump s preference Meanwhile  Trump  has expressed his displeasure toward the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  DACA   an Obama era immigration policy  He has repeatedly blamed the Democrats for such an executive order  The President argued that such a policy isn t adequate and demanded a merit based system of immigration as well as funding for a border wall with neighboring state Mexico Nevertheless  McConnell assured that the government is intended to look into issues related to the DACA  He also intends to take up issues related to defense spending and disaster relief as they are crucial However  it is to be seen how such intentions will be sufficient for the Democrats to support the stopgap spending bill on Jan 22  After all  the Republicans desperately need a 10 or more Democratic vote in the Senate to pass such a spending legislation  with currently 50 members present  Lest we forget  Sen  John McCain is receiving cancer treatment and is away from Washington A Longer Shutdown to Hurt EconomyGovernment shutdowns are primarily the cause of dispute over government spending  But  this time  it was caused by ideological differences on immigration  This is potentially disruptive as both the parties are fighting over an issue that has deep significance to their core supporters  Thus  the risk that the partial government shutdown could be actually a long one has increased  In turn  this may hurt the broader economy  bringing the recent growth spurt to an abrupt end   Shutdowns generally reduce the economy s productive work hours and revenues from daily fees at museums and parks  Issuing federal checks  permits and licenses slows down  which hampers the rest of the economy  affecting export and import permits  It also affects mortgages and small business loans Private sector companies that deal with the government have their works temporarily unsettled  while travel outlays are reduced  affecting local economies  Overall  government funding crisis hampers business optimism and consumer confidence How to Play the Shutdown  4 Solid PicksThis government shutdown can wreck havoc in the market  Historically  the Cboe Volatility index  VIX  averages a return of 9 7  one week after a government shutdown  while the S P 500 declines 0 3  Investors  thus  should build a strategy on low risk assets  The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low beta stocks  which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in  In this case  a low beta ranges from 0 to 1 These stocks are also undervalued  which makes them cheap  Further  these stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Sally Beauty

203933,425449,M,Facebook video draws Thanksgiving ads from Macy s  others,news,"By Jennifer Saba NEW YORK  Reuters    Macy s Inc  which traditionally kicks off the U S  holiday shopping season with a nationally televised parade in Manhattan  also will join a handful of other companies this year parading their ads on Facebook s fledgling video feeds 
As the social media platform slowly rolls out its premium video offerings to advertisers  Macy s will launch its online video ads Thursday evening 
 As we were anticipating Black Friday  we wanted to take a look at how the product evolved and try to figure out how to distribute our video in a balanced way   said Jennifer Kasper  Macy s group vice president for digital media and multicultural marketing 
Kasper characterized Thanksgiving as the retailer s Super Bowl Sunday  The Thanksgiving Day parade featuring giant balloons  floats and marching bands  draws millions of television viewers and brings thousands of onlookers to midtown Manhattan 
The video ads will feature cartoon character and parade balloon SpongeBob SquarePants  They will target women age 21 and over  Macy s also broadcasts television commercials that began airing on Sunday 
Kasper would not reveal how much Macy s would spend on the Facebook advertising  but said it was  incremental  to the Black Friday budget 
 We do believe we are going to reach an incremental audience who are no longer tuning in to traditional TV   she said   For people who have seen it on TV  it keeps us top of mind  
Other advertisers using Facebook during the holiday crunch include Kate Spade New York  which on Nov  13 launched its video ad on Facebook and has reached over 6 7 million people so far 
David Fischer  Facebook s vice president for business and marketing partnerships  said the social network has seen an explosion in video consumption  He said that as of June  more than 100 million videos per month have been uploaded 
 People are discovering video more quickly on Facebook than anywhere else   he said 
Other digital platforms chasing advertising money dedicated to video include Google s YouTube  Facebook is rolling out video ads carefully and will  remain deliberate and slow in our approach  Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said during an October earnings call 
Nate Elliott  vice president and principal analyst  at Forrester Research  said  Facebook has a lot of work left to do to make its ad as effective as what marketers can find elsewhere   he said 

 They are inching forward and heading in the right direction

According to the agreement signed by the Ohio based retailer with New York s attorney general  the company will adopt new policies to ensure its employees are better trained and install security cameras to more closely monitor detention practices at its stores  The attorney general s Civil Rights Bureau had started its investigation in February 2013

  Producer prices drop  biggest 12 month fall since 1950
  Data shows recession hasn t hit bottom  economists say
  Inventories slump again in February
  Adds details  closing market prices 
 By Lucia Mutikani
 WASHINGTON  April 14  Reuters    Sales at U S  retailers
unexpectedly fell 1 1 percent in March after rising for two
straight months  government data showed on Tuesday  dimming
hopes the 16 month old recession was close to hitting bottom 
 A separate report showed prices received by  U S  producers
fell a surprising 1 2 percent last month  underscoring the
economy s weakness and lack of pricing power 
 Despite the weak March sales data  economists said consumer
spending likely rebounded in the first quarter  which could
mean gross domestic product fell less steeply than the 6 3
percent annual rate recorded in the last three months of 2008 
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke  meanwhile  said
figures released in the last few weeks on housing and consumer
spending suggest signs of improvement 
  Recently we have seen tentative signs that the sharp
decline in economic activity may be slowing  A leveling out of
economic activity is the first step toward recovery   Bernanke
said on Tuesday   ID nN14413989 
 The Commerce Department said March retail sales were
weighed down by declining purchases for big ticket items like
motor vehicles and electronic goods 
 It said February retail sales were revised upward to show a
0 3 percent gain  from a previously reported fall of 0 1
percent  while January s figures were adjusted to show a hefty
1 9 percent rise 
  I don t think the recession is close to a bottom  but I do
believe the rate of decline is slowing and it will slow very
sharply   said Nigel Gault  chief U S  economist at IHS Global
Insight in Lexington  Massachusetts   Before we write off the
consumer  we need to see what happens with the April numbers

store chain Macys  dropping over 7 percent  The Dow Jones
industrial average ended down 137 63 points at 7 920 18  U S

 ID Nn14428395 
 Economists argued that March data  which showed broad
declines  had been negatively affected by Easter falling in
April and did not weaken the argument consumer spending was
stabilizing after huge drops in the second half of 2008 
 Weekly retail sales reports suggest consumers were shopping
again in early April  U S  chain stores sales rose 0 8 percent
last week  building on the previous period s 0 6 percent gain 
according to the International Council of Shopping Centers 
 Separately  the Johnson Redbook retail sales index climbed
0 9 percent in the first week of April after rising 0 4 percent
the previous week 
  It still represents a net positive for first quarter GDP 
Stronger than expected January and February sales point to a
small gain of close to 1 0 percent annually in real personal
consumption expenditures for the first quarter   said Stuart
Hoffman  chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh 
 Consumer spending accounts for over two thirds of U S 
economic activity  The housing led recession  characterized by
steep job losses  plunging asset values and tight credit
conditions  is forcing households to scale back consumption 
 Excluding motor vehicles and parts  sales fell 0 9 percent
in March  compared to a 1 percent gain the prior month  The
data highlighted the continuing problems in the U S  auto
industry  with vehicle and parts sales dropping 2 3 percent
after a 3 percent decline in February 
 Gasoline sales fell 1 6 percent in March after increasing
by 3 1 percent the previous month  Sales of electronic goods
and appliances tumbled 5 9 percent  reversing a 0 7 percent
gain in February  while building materials eased 0 6 percent
after slipping 0 5 percent 
 In another report  the Commerce Department said U S 
business inventories fell 1 3 percent in February following a
decline of a similar margin the prior month  Motor vehicle and
parts inventories dropped l 3 percent in February 
  This should begin to reduce the rate of decline in output 
although no meaningful increase in output is likely until
inventories are brought down significantly more   said Tony
Crescenzi  chief bond market strategist at Miller Tabak   C0 
in New York 
 Separately  the Labor Department said U S  producer prices
fell 1 2 percent in March and compared with the same period a
year ago slumped 3 5 percent  the largest decline since 1950 
 Core producer prices  which exclude food and energy costs 
were unchanged in March  The core producer price index stood
3 8 percent higher from the same month last year

moment is still deflation  rather than inflation   said IHS

203984,425500,M,Why You Should Be Bullish On Macy s Earnings,opinion,"This past week we have seen good retail reports from Michael Kors Holdings Limited  NYSE KORS  and horrible reports from Fossil Group Inc  NASDAQ FOSL   This is the first quarter in recent history where there has been a mix  both good and bad earnings  Over the last few quarters  it has just been bad for every retailer 
So what makes me bullish on Macy s Inc  NYSE M   who reports Thursday morning before the market opens  The answer can be found in the stock chart  While still near its multi year lows  the stock has inched over the daily 20 and 50 moving averages 
In addition  the stock has been consolidating for the last week  making a bullish flag pattern  This pattern increases the odds of a surge on earnings  Being a stock chart trader and investor  I am using that to my advantage 
I am strongly bullish on Macy s Inc into earnings on Thursday  The company is expected to report earnings of  0 45 on  5 49 billion in revenue  The real key will be margins and guidance going forward ",2017-08-10,Gareth Soloway,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-i-am-bullish-on-m-earnings-tomorrow-200206392,200206392

204029,425545,M,Bad ROIC Drives Bad Valuation,opinion,"Return on invested capital    is not only the most intuitive measure of corporate performance  but it is also the best  It measures the amount of profit generated for every dollar invested by a company  and has clear links to valuation  No wonder the  increasingly want companies to  
Unfortunately  many investors still rely on flawed calculations of ROIC  Most investors use third party sites for ROIC data  and these sites  necessary to reverse accounting distortions  Only by digging through the footnotes and management discussion and analysis  MD A  can investors get a true picture of the after tax operating profit    and  of a company 
What Happens When You Get ROIC Wrong
To quantify the importance of footnotes diligence  we developed a metric we call     GAAP Based ROIC only uses GAAP  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  data found in the income statement and balance sheet  so it represents a useful proxy for the various methodologies utilized by other data providers 
Figures 1 and 2 reveal that GAAP Based ROIC has a significantly weaker link to valuation than our ROIC calculation  which uses our  to make adjustments from rigorous analysis of footnotes and the MD A  Our ROIC explains 58  of the variation in Enterprise Value Invested Capital  a cleaner version of price book  for the S P 500 
Figure 1  New Constructs ROIC Vs  Enterprise Value Invested Capital For The S P 500

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
The GAAP Based ROIC only explains 40  of the variation 
Figure 2  GAAP Based ROIC Vs  Enterprise Value Invested Capital

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Investors who use a GAAP Based ROIC as a tool for evaluating the fundamental quality and valuation of a company are getting a very misleading picture 
Don t Trust The Company Line
A significant number of companies calculate and report ROIC numbers themselves  Some of these companies do a good job at   Many do not 
Macy s  NYSE M   M   22 share  stands out as the most egregious example of a company offering a misleading ROIC calculation to investors  The department store has  as a sign of the strength of the business 
If this number were accurate  Macy s would have the best ROIC of any department store we cover  and it would be in the top 20  of the roughly 3 000 stocks under our coverage  Unfortunately for the company and its shareholders  Macy s ROIC calculation  seen   contains a number of misleading adjustments 
Macy s reports a pre tax value for operating income  while ROIC is commonly calculated using after tax operating profit 
The company removes  from operating profit but does not add back accumulated impairments to invested capital  This adjustment allows management to have their cake and eat it too  they can erase their bad investments without having to accept any decreases to operating profit 
It also removes the entirety of its  340 million in rent expense  when really it should only be removing the  130 million of  
Macy s nearly  4 billion in  doesn t appear anywhere in its calculation  so management is not accountable for money spent on overpriced acquisitions 
Finally  Macy s chooses to exclude depreciation and amortization expense from operating income while adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization to invested capital  Unlike the company s treatment of impairments  this adjustment is at least fair to the numerator and denominator  However  it is not the normal practice in this sector  e g  makes more sense for the    and this decision inflates Macy s reported ROIC by roughly one percentage point 
These  adjustments  help make Macy s reported operating profit nearly three times higher than our NOPAT  while its invested capital is 30  lower  Its true ROIC of 4  puts it in the bottom 20  of all companies we cover and about average for department stores 
The fact that Macy s links executive compensation in part to this flawed ROIC number helps to explain how its CEO has earned  over the past five years  roughly 1  of the company s market cap  This compensation was nearly 60  higher than that earned by the CEO of the similarly sized and much more profitable  ROIC is 7     KSS  
The market clearly does not believe in Macy s self reported ROIC  as the stock has fallen 67  over the past two years  Focusing on ROIC only works if you use a rigorous and accurate calculation

204040,425556,M,Is Macy s Inc  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Macy s Inc    NYSE M   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Macy s Inc  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Macy s Inc s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having fallen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Retail   Regional Department Stores industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 38 2  This indicates that the stock is highly undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Macy s Inc has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 6 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Macy s Inc stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Macy s Inc has a P S ratio of about 2 57  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 2 84 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  M is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  M currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Macy s Inc a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Macy s Inc is just 0 8  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 4  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  M is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Macy s Inc might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives M a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower  while the full year estimate has seen none up and two down in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 10  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has also decreased by 5 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Macy s Inc Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock has a long term expected earnings growth of 8 5  and sports a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   These mixed expectations indicate that while the stock s growth story might be good over the long term  analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future  Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMacy s Inc is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a better industry rank  top 43  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Retail   Regional Department Stores industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Stocks to Ride a 588  Revenue Explosion At Zacks  we re mostly focused on short term profit cycles  but the hottest of all technology mega trends is starting to take hold

This would be one of the first initiatives by the latter to reorganize its eCommerce  direct to consumer and international divisions under the direction of Global Brands  Through this deal  the leading female fashion retailer  Bebe Stores   will be able to meet the expectations of its targeted consumers 
Amidst the expanding global eCommerce business  it was quite a natural move by Global Brands to take over Bebe Stores  eCommerce segment  The partnership will be directed towards expanding the company s consumer base and creating a well knit omni channel network from an international perspective 
This venture is expected to create growth opportunities for both Bebe Stores  and Global Brands  Bebe Stores  had been planning to widen its online business to adapt with the changing retail scenario  Backed by the renowned expertise of Global Brands  the company is now quite confident with its eCommerce platform transformation related plans 
On the other hand  Global Brands will gain from Bebe Stores  rich brand image in the world of women s fashion  The former can make use of the wide reach of Bebe Stores  products  from clothes to accessories and beyond  In order to make this venture a success  Nathan Jenden has been named the Creative Director 
The management of Bebe Stores  seems to be quite excited to have Mr  Jenden on board  given his remarkable designing expertise and proven talent in the fashion industry  Further  Bluestar Alliance LLC that had acquired Bebe Stores  in 2016 would  however  continue to manage the brand  keeping the terms of the new partnership intact 
Bebe Stores  has been struggling with its brick and mortar business for quite some time now  due to changed consumer habits as well as rising competition  An increasing number of consumers are shifting to online shopping  hurting the performance of brick and mortar stores  Such a scenario led many retailers such as American Eagle Outfitters Inc    NYSE AEO    J  C  Penney Company  Inc    NYSE JCP   and Macy s  Inc    NYSE M   to indulge in store closures  To follow suit  store closure plans are also being considered by Bebe Stores 

The tough retail landscape led Bebe Stores  to underperform the broader Zacks categorized  sector in the past three months  In the said time frame  the company s shares fell 22 2  compared with the industry s growth of 9   The partnership with Global Brands is expected to elevate Bebe Stores  performance and emerge as a successful eCommerce retailer  in addition to transforming the brands international business segments

204063,425579,M,Why Betting On REITs Could Be Risky Now,opinion,"The possibility of several rate hikes over the next two years have already hit headlines and curtailed REIT investors  gains  What has added to the woes is the weakness in the fundamentals of certain asset categories  Particularly  changes in consumer preferences and supply issues in a number of asset classes have affected the market fundamentals and are likely to continue thwarting growth of corresponding REITs in the coming months  Therefore  unless close attention is paid to all the weaknesses before investing in REIT stocks  one might end up incurring huge losses 
Fundamental Weakness
Particularly  there has been a rapid shift in customers  shopping preferences and patterns  with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds  Amid this  mall traffic continues to suffer  This has forced retailers to reconsider their strategy and shift investments from traditional retailing to online channels and optimize their brick and mortar presence 
While it is quite normal for retailers to do so  these optimization efforts and the consequent decision to close stores by a number of reputable retailers like Macy s Inc   M   Sears Holdings Corp   SHLD  and JC Penney  JCP  in recent months  have raised concerns over cash flows of mall landlords  Also  retailers that are not able to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies  This is resulting in higher vacancies in existing malls 
However  retail REITs are fighting back and giving their malls a facelift in a desperate attempt to lure customers  They are also adapting the latest technologies to offer attractive services to their tenants and mall visitors as well as transforming their traditional retail hubs into swanky entertainment destinations  However  the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and  hence  is likely to limit growth in the profit margins of retail REITs in the near term 
On the other hand  growth in supply in a number of property types is hurting the fundamentals  Specifically  after achieving phenomenal growth over the past few years  residential REITs are thumped with new apartment deliveries in several markets  This has upset market fundamentals and curtailed landlords  ability to demand higher rents and increase the occupancy level  Particularly  class A apartments have been the worst affected 
In fact  per the  from AXIOMetrics  national rent growth rate of 2 2  in April 2017 marked a 181 bps decline from the 4 0  of April 2016  Also  national occupancy rate of 94 8  in April was 33 bps lower than the 95 2  recorded in April 2016  The rate has however been steady since December 2016  Also  with increased occupancies  apartment operators are forced to offer rent discounts to lure tenants 
Furthermore  there seems to be no respite from the situation anytime soon and the moderation is anticipated to continue this year with a lot of new construction slated to be delivered 
In the self storage industry  rising supply in some of the markets is affecting revenue growth  On the other hand  though the U S  industrial real estate market is enjoying a considerable boost in demand because of the exponential growth of the e commerce business  supply has started to gain substantial momentum to put an end to the lengthiest stretch of demand supply imbalance in the market that started way back in 2010  Also  a whole lot of new buildings are slated to be completed and made available this year and in the next  leading to higher supply and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth 
For hotel REITs  though supply growth was tepid in the past  it has gathered momentum in recent times  In fact  lodging fundamentals are anticipated to take a beating in 2017  with supply growth expected to accelerate in 2017  particularly in key markets  Also  business travel has yet to reach optimum levels  Moreover  European travel continues to be weak as a result of a strong U S  dollar and residual effects from the impact of Brexit 
Rising Rates Pose a Major Threat 
Rising rates will no doubt be a burden on the debt dependent REITs  Particularly  the pace and magnitude of rate hikes  and the capacity of REITs to absorb those increases are expected to substantially shape the industry s outlook  Therefore  things like lease durations and pricing power in the market would command much attention 
Specifically  health care REITs are generally at risk with rates moving north  This is because these REITs usually have significant exposure to long term leased assets which carry fixed rental rates that are subject to annual bumps  Therefore  as the rate goes up  the cost of borrowing will increase but their revenue flows will not get adjusted quickly for their fixed rate nature  leading to an adverse impact on profitability 
Further  volatility in rates can cast a pall on mortgage REITs or mREITs  which offer real estate financing through the purchase or origination of mortgages and mortgage backed securities  These REITs fund their investments with equity and debt capital and earn profits from the spread between interest income on mortgage assets and their funding costs  Though these types of REITs have started adjusting their strategies and business models  they bear long term risk as interest rates will eventually rise 
Apart from these  the dividend payout itself might turn out less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts in the event of a rate hike 
Bottom LineBefore calling the shots  investors should satisfy themselves by dispassionately absorbing both sides of the argument Check out our latest  for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective 
REITs to AvoidSpecific REITs that we don t like include Spirit Realty Capital  Inc   SRC   CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust  Inc   CORR   New Senior Investment Group Inc   SNR  and FelCor Lodging Trust Incorporated  FCH  
Spirit Realty Capital is a REIT which acquires single tenant  operationally essential real estate where the tenants conduct retail  service or distribution activities  It has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Its full year 2017 estimates have experienced southward revision over the past 30 days 
CorEnergy Infrastructure is a REIT  which is engaged in ownership of essential energy assets  like pipelines  storage terminals  and transmission and distribution assets  Presently  it has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Its estimates for 2017 have experienced downward revision over the past 30 days  reflecting the bearish sentiment of analysts on this stock  You can see  
New Senior Investment Group Inc  is a REIT focused on investing in senior housing properties across the United States  Presently  it has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   The company came up with a lower than expected performance in the prior quarter  Also  its estimates for 2017 have experienced downward revisions over the past three months 
FelCor Lodging Trust is REIT with a geographically diverse portfolio of high quality hotels in key urban and resort markets  It has a Zacks Rank  4  The company does not have a decent surprise history  In fact  over the trailing four quarters  the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two periods  with an average miss of 4 39

204096,425612,M,Opening Bell  Dollar Discounts Comey  Oil Holds On To Gains,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
What started with market sound and fury FBI director James Comey s firing by U S  President Donald Trump fizzled into much ado about nothing but noise 

Yesterday  after the Dollar Index opened with a dramatic falling gap  erasing half of the previous session s gains  it scaled right back up to its full measure  where it had been before the news broke 
At the same time  while S P 500 futures slipped after the announcement  the S P 500 achieved a higher close than the previous session  eyeing its last record close  The VIX remains near Monday s low  at 10 2  its lowest point in 24 years 
Asian markets advanced  some to new records  while European and US markets have slipped  South Korea s KOSPI reached a new record  getting over what some may have considered disappointment at the election of liberal Moon Jae in as President  During the campaign he signaled he wants to improve relations with North Korea rather than work more closely with the US 
Japan s Nikkei 225 neared the 20 000 level  Even Chinese equities joined the party and erased earlier losses  Like Asian markets but contrary to the direction of western markets gold advanced  This was the first time in seven days the yellow metal saw an upmove  Oil continued to climb 

As of this morning  oil has been able to hold on to its biggest gains of the year  after US crude inventories declined by 5 25 million barrels  double what had been forecast  It was its biggest drop in stockpiles for the year and a fifth weekly decline from record high inventory levels 
Today  oil futures added 0 5 percent to yesterday s whopping 3 2 percent gain  the most in five months  This furious bounce comes after the commodity plunged last week  dropping to its lowest levels since OPEC and NOPEC producers  including Russia  agreed to and actually honored unprecedented production cuts  back in November 
The only downside for oil bulls is rising US production  which climbed to its highest level since 2015  The US s Energy Information Administration estimates production will hit a new record in 2018  In an effort to blunt rising supply  and more significantly  keep prices from falling  OPEC and friends indicated they are prepared to keep the November deal in place into 2018 
The  4 6 trillion question   the current value of daily oil production   is whether non US oil producers are willing and able to continue cutting  even as US companies profit at their expense

204116,425632,M,Retail Apocalypse Gains Momentum As David Stockman Issues Warning ,opinion,"JC Penney  NYSE JCP  and Family Christian Stores are the latest retail giants to announce widespread store closings  As you will see below  J C  Penney plans to close between 130 and 140 stores  and Family Christian is closing all of their 240 stores  In recent months the stock market   and so most people have simply assumed that the  real economy  must be doing well  But that is not the case at all  In fact  the  that I have been documenting for quite some time appears to be gaining momentum 
J C  Penney is not in as rough shape as Sears  NASDAQ SHLD  is just yet  but it is definitely on a similar trajectory  In the end  they are both headed for bankruptcy  That is why it wasn t too much of a surprise when J C  Penney announced that they are  

J C  Penney  JCP  plans to close 130 to 140 stores and offer buyouts to 6 000 workers as the department store industry sags in competition with online sellers and nimble niche retailers 
The company said Friday that it would shutter 13  to 14  of its locations and introduce new goods and services aimed at the shifting preferences of its customer base 

Meanwhile  many observers were quite surprised when Family Christian Stores decided to fold up shop for good  They were known as the largest Christian retailer on the entire planet  but now after 85 years they are going out of business forever 

Family Christian  which bills itself as the  world s largest retailer of Christian themed merchandise   announced Thursday it is closing after 85 years 
The non profit company  employing more than 3 000 people in 240 stores in 36 states  said in a brief statement that the retailer had been facing declining sales since filing for bankruptcy protection in 2015 and had no choice but to shut down 

These two announcements are part of larger trend that we have been witnessing all over the country  As I have documented previously  Macy s  NYSE M  announced that it would be closing 100 stores earlier this year  and about the same time Sears said that it would be closing another 150 stores 
Back in 2010  Sears had a staggering 3 555 stores 
Before their recent announcement  Sears was down to 1 503 stores  and now this latest round of cuts will leave them with somewhere around 1 350 
Of course it won t be too long before Sears has zero stores  and my regular readers know that I have been talking about the demise of Sears for a very long time 
The cold  hard truth of the matter is that the  real economy  is a total mess  and that is one of the primary reasons why these ridiculous stock market valuations that we are seeing right now are not sustainable 
One expert that agrees with my assessment is former Reagan Administration White House Budget Director David Stockman  In a recent interview  he explained why he believes that  everything will grind to a halt  after March 15th 

Stockman  who wrote a book titled  Trumped  predicting a Trump victory in 2016  says   I don t think there is a snowball s chance in the hot place that s going to happen  This is delusional  This is the greatest suckers  rally of all time  It is based on pure hopium and not any analysis at all as what it will take to push through a big tax cut  Donald Trump is in a trap  Today the debt is  20 trillion  It s 106  of GDP       Trump is inheriting a built in deficit of  10 trillion over the next decade under current policies that are built in  Yet  he wants more defense spending  not less  He wants drastic sweeping tax cuts for corporations and individuals  He wants to spend more money on border security and law enforcement  He s going to do more for the veterans  He wants this big trillion dollar infrastructure program  You put all that together and it s madness   It doesn t even begin to add up  and it won t happen when you are struggling with the  10 trillion of debt that s coming down the pike and the  20 trillion that s already on the books 

Then  Stockman drops this bomb and says 

I think what people are missing is this date  March 15th 2017  That s the day that this debt ceiling holiday that Obama and Boehner put together right before the last election in October of 2015  That holiday expires  The debt ceiling will freeze in at  20 trillion  It will then be law  It will be a hard stop  The Treasury will have roughly  200 billion in cash  We are burning cash at a  75 billion a month rate  By summer  they will be out of cash  Then we will be in the mother of all debt ceiling crises  Everything will grind to a halt  I think we will have a government shutdown  There will not be Obama Care repeal and replace  There will be no tax cut  There will be no infrastructure stimulus  There will be just one giant fiscal bloodbath over a debt ceiling that has to be increased and no one wants to vote for 

In that same interview  Stockman also predicted that  markets will easily correct by 20  and probably a lot more   and he noted the glaring disconnect between current stock prices and how the U S  economy is actually performing 

The S P 500 has been trading at 26 times earnings while earnings have been dropping for the past six or seven quarters  There is no booming recovery coming  There is going to be a recession and there will be no stimulus baton to bail it out  That is the new fact that neither Trump nor the Wall Street gamblers remotely understand 

It is very difficult to argue with Stockman on this 
There are some people out there that seem to think that Donald Trump can miraculously turn the U S  economy around just because he is Donald Trump 
It doesn t work that way 
We are 20 trillion dollars in debt  and we are currently adding about a trillion dollars a year to that total  There is no possible way that Trump can cut taxes  increase military spending  build a border wall  spend much more on veterans and spend an extra trillion dollars on rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure 
We are flat broke as a nation and there simply is not money available to do everything that Donald Trump wants to do 
So we shall see what happens after March 15th  Unfortunately  I happen to agree with Stockman that economic reality is about to come knocking and Trump and his supporters are about to get a very rude wake up call ",2017-02-27,Michael T.

204117,425633,M,A Third Of All U S  Shopping Malls Are Projected To Close ,opinion,"If you didn t know better  you might be tempted to think that  Space Available  was the hottest new retail chain in the entire country  As you will see below  it is being projected that about a third of all shopping malls in the United States will soon close  and we just recently learned that the number of  distressed retailers  is the highest that it has been   Honestly  I don t know how anyone can possibly believe that the U S  economy is in  good shape  after looking at the retail industry 
In my recent article about the ongoing  retail apocalypse   I discussed the fact that Sears  NASDAQ SHLD   J C  Penney  NYSE JCP  and Macy s Inc  NYSE M  have all announced that they are closing dozens of stores in 2017  and you can find a pretty comprehensive list of 19 U S  retailers that are  on the brink of bankruptcy    Needless to say  quite a bloodbath is going on out there right now 
But I didn t realize how truly horrific things were for the retail industry until I came across an article about mall closings on Time Magazine s website 

About one third of malls in the U S  will shut their doors in the coming years  retail analyst Jan Kniffen told CNBC Thursday  His prediction comes in the wake of Macy s reporting its worst consecutive same store sales decline since the financial crisis 
Macy s and its fellow retailers in American malls are challenged by an oversupply of retail space as customers migrate toward online shopping  as well as fast fashion retailers like H M and off price stores such as T J  Maxx  As a result  about 400 of the country s 1 100 enclosed malls will fail in the upcoming years  Of those that remain  he predicts that about 250 will thrive and the rest will continue to struggle 

Can you imagine what this country is going to look like if that actually happens 
Shopping malls all over the United States are literally becoming  ghost towns   and many that have already closed have stayed empty for years and years 
The process usually starts when a shopping mall starts losing anchor stores  That is why it is so alarming that Sears  J C  Penney and Macy s are planning to shut down so many locations in 2017  According to one recent report  310 shopping malls in America are in imminent danger of losing an anchor store 

Dozens of malls have closed in the last 10 years  and many more are at risk of shutting down as retailers like Macy s  JCPenney  and Sears   also known as anchor stores   shutter hundreds of stores to staunch the bleeding from falling sales 
The commercial real estate firm CoStar estimates that nearly a quarter of malls in the US  or roughly 310 of the nation s 1 300 shopping malls  are at high risk of losing an anchor store 

Once the anchor stores start going  traffic falls off dramatically for the other stores and they start leaving too 
Four years ago in  The Beginning Of The End  I warned that empty storefronts would soon litter the national landscape  and now that is precisely what is happening 
Now that the Christmas season is over  some retailers that have been around for decades have suddenly decided that it is time to file for bankruptcy  Sadly  one of those retailers is HHGregg  OTC HGGG  

HHGregg Inc   the 61 year old seller of appliances and electronics  is moving closer to Chapter 11 after announcing a store closing plan  according to people with knowledge of the matter 
The filing may come as soon as next week  said the people  who asked not to be identified because the matter isn t public  Bloomberg previously reported that HHGregg might file for bankruptcy in March if it couldn t reach an out of court solution 

Another retailer that was once riding high but is now dealing with bankruptcy is BCBG 

BCBG  the California based fashion retailer that had acquired fashion design firm Herve Leger in 1998  and that once had more than 570 boutiques globally  including 175 in the U S   and whose cocktail dresses and handbags were shown off by celebrities  filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday 
It is buckling under  459 million of debt  It has 4 800 employees  Layoffs have already started  More layoffs and other cost cuts are planned  according to court documents  cited by Bloomberg  It started closing 120 of its stores in January  It wants to sell itself at a court supervised auction  If that fails  it wants to negotiate a debt for equity swap with junior lenders owed  289 million 

If the U S  economy was actually doing as well as the stock market says that it should be doing  all of these retail chains would not be closing stores and going bankrupt 
But of course the truth is that the stock market has become completely disconnected from economic reality 
We live at a time when middle class consumers are tapped out  According to one recent survey  57 percent of all Americans do not even have enough money in the bank to write a  500 check for an unexpected expense 
And people are falling out of the middle class at a staggering pace  The number of homeless people in New York City recently set a brand new record high  and city authorities plan to construct 90 new homeless shelters within the next five years 
On the west coast we are also seeing a dramatic rise in homelessness  The following comes from an article by Dan Lyman 

Citizen journalists have captured stunning images and video of homeless encampments that are spiraling out of control in the shadows of Disneyland and Anaheim Stadium in California 
The tent city has recently sprung up along the Santa Ana riverbed  near a busy convergence of three major California highways known as the  Orange Crush   at the border of Anaheim and Santa Ana  the latter a  sanctuary city  
Homeless activists estimate that as many as 1 000 people are camped in the region 

Incredibly  the Federal Reserve is almost certainly going to raise interest rates at their next meeting even though the U S  economy is faltering so badly  That only makes sense if they are trying to make Donald Trump look as bad as possible 
Even though this giant bubble of false economic stability that we are currently enjoying has lasted far longer than it should have  the truth is that nothing has changed about the long term economic outlook at all 
America is still heading for  economic Armageddon   and the retail industry is a huge red flag that is warning us that our day of reckoning is approaching more rapidly than many had anticipated ",2017-03-07,Michael T.

204151,425667,M,Retail Continues To Break Down,opinion,Macy s  NYSE M ,2017-01-05,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/retail-continues-to-break-down-200171596,200171596
204152,425668,M,Gold Starts The New Year Stuck In First Gear,opinion," Course  a year ago  gold perfectly timed its clutch bite in getting off the line to swiftly shift up through the gearbox toward posting a net gain of 4 5  through the first four trading days of 2016  but now through the same four day stint of 2017  gold s net gain is just 1 8   Whilst any four days over a year s trading circuit might at best be considered  noise   these initial sessions oft set the tone as to how the balance may unfold  gold s engine may seem screaming at high revs  but in first gear  we re not impressed 
At least off the starting line for this year  gold is adhering to its first goal   tis not tanking  albeit  past performance  suggests  as we ll below show  that we ve not already seen the entire year s low  which indeed was the case by this time a year ago 
As for gold s second goal in 2017 toward making another attempt at the 1400s  the battle to so do shall again ensue upon trying to clear the terribly stubborn 1240 1280 resistance zone  thus neither do we believe the year s high is even close to being in place 
But as for the referenced  past performance   recall in 2016 that gold s low for the entire year came on Day One  and so far  such is the same case these mere four days into 2017  Yet in the 42 year span from 1975 through 2016  gold s low for the year has come on the first trading day just three times  and never in two consecutive years  Good old fashioned probability therefore suggests  vis   vis a year ago  gold unlikely has not already seen this year s low  1147 on Day One  
So given the likelihood that neither of this year s extremes are as yet in place  does that mean we all ought rush off to the commodities broker and open two discrete accounts  one long with gold futures and the other short with same  The broker would certainly croon  Love me two times baby      The Doors   67   No  Best to think higher gold in 2017  but with prudent cash management throughout 
Still  by gold s weekly bars  the picture is appearing more promising  price having made  higher lows  for three consecutive weeks  along with  higher highs  in the last two  With price having settled yesterday  Friday  at 1173  gold is now  only  47 points below the declining red parabolic short dots  we say  only  as that is the nearest weekly closing distance of price to dot during this 14 week down run  gold s  expected weekly trading range  is presently 39 points  thus barring  The Tank   the parabolic trend appears poised to flip long before month s end 


But by broader perspective  gold needs to attack its 300 day moving average  which as we next see is up there at 1225  and imperceptibly falling   Given gold s fabulous run through mid year 2016   twas most discouraging to see price then negatively penetrate the average which throughout this millennium has been a both a key technical supporter of price  but also a barrier to higher levels as we here see in charting gold daily closes from its highest ever to date 

As for reacting to the economy  gold did not fold on the Federal Open Market Committee s minutes from their 13 14 December meeting  as released this past Wednesday   which were supportive of the growth we ve been seeing in the Economic Barometer  that said  the FOMC is not being overly economic optimistic  and indeed  the Baro has since stalled to sit were  twas a month ago  This past week we learned that December s Payroll creation slowed and that layoffs were up some 42  over those of December a year ago   add to which Macy s  NYSE M  is to let go some 10 000 folks   whilst November s Factory Orders fell 2 4  and the trade deficit widened  Here s the chart 


Neither has gold been on hold even as another record high for stocks doth unfold  Now on the cusp of Q4 Earnings Season  we ve the  live  Price Earnings ratio for the S P 500 at 34 7x   In fact  MarketWatch ran a  similar  calculation to ours and came up with 25 9x  excluding 2017 s rally  We get essentially the same number if we cheat by including negative P Es for losing companies    i e  dumbing the average down    rather than properly assigning the price of those losing companies as their P Es  Scary  that   In any case  by their percentage tracks over the past 21 trading days  gold has been closing its gap to the S P 


In fact as we turn to trend  the following two panel piece displays the daily bars over the last three months to date for both gold on the left and silver on the right  In both cases  the baby blue dots depicting the day by day consistency of the respective 21 day linear regression trends are back into ascending mode  Fade not the directional clues from the  Baby Blues  



Specific to near term pricing  these next two panels are the 10 day Market Profiles for gold  left  and silver  right   The horizontal bars reflect the amount of contract volume traded per price point  the labeled apices therefore guides to support and resistance  the white bar in each panel is yesterday s settle 



So compared to a year ago  we ve a somewhat modest  albeit positive  start in first gear for gold in the new year  By way of which we segue to these few notes in closing our first missive for 2017 

  Better to be off the line in first gear rather to have missed the shift gate and clanked it into reverse  banging backward in to the burgeoning Bitcoin  Yes  the Bitster is back  its fueling being credited by that which normally ought be turbo boosting gold  i e   global currency turmoil   Indeed with the dollar mute out of the new year s chute  China s renminbi just sported it largest ever two day gain  the yuan s noose being tightened whilst service sector data strengthens  But has one bit off more than one can chew 

  The euro yo yo is spritely spinning up its string  the Zone closing out 2016 with its best rate of economic growth since 2011  coupled with inflation s best pace since 2013  But from the  It Ain t Broke But Let s Fix It Anyway Dept    EuroZone political uncertainty abounds  not to mention that surrounding what the European Central Bank may do  Our beloved France   having just legalized going off line from work when the day is done   takes its turn in perhaps also surprising the world with its next President come 07 May   barring a majority winner on 23 April   Might we see Frexit  Then on the heels of Italy s Renzi having resigned  might we see Italexit  Some expect it  And way up there in Finland  2 000 unemployed folks shall now be raking in  560 mo  sans questions  At least the steely eyed Finns have their gold repatriation notion 

  Meanwhile over in  neutral  Basel  the  Committee  has put off its vote toward on  Basel III  for banks  capital requirements  one ought think this brings a massive sigh of relief for the likes of Cr dit Agricole  Deutsche Bank  and dare we say Monte dei Paschi  To be sure  the less capital required  the more reason to own gold 

  Finally  as we re quite sure our British friends are aware  you ve until 16 October to cash in your old  1  round pound  coins for the new dodecagonic version  We rue the day we were caught StateSide with scads of now valueless French Franc coins   having later at least made to the Banque de France in Nice to unload paper notes   But perhaps upon a Frexit  the coins can again be used    Mais non  monsieur    At least coins of gold never will be valueless ",2017-01-08,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-starts-the-new-year-stuck-in-first-gear-200171803,200171803

204199,425715,M,3 Ways To Trade Macy s,opinion,"Macy s  NYSE M  on 34 St  in New York is the world s largest department store  It made a movie there in 1947  70 years ago and it included their rival Gimbels  Macy s eventually bought out Gimbels and went on expanding  Recently that physical store presence has been sighted as a high cost overhead when competing against online retailers  for Macy s and every other Department store 
From July 2015 to May 2016 their stock price took a hit as a result  In the end it lost nearly 60  of its value  But since that May low it has been steadily moving higher  A series of higher lows rising nearly perfectly against trend support  and higher highs to boot  Since the start of September though it has found resistance to the upside at 37 25 
Friday broke a small consolidation to the upside and hit that resistance again  A push over the top now would give a short term target to 40  The Bollinger Bands  are squeezed in and starting to release the price to the upside while the RSI is moving up in the bullish zone and the MACD is crossed up and rising 
The weekly options chain this week shows the bulk of the open interest focused at 36 50 below  Next week sees lighter open interest and the October monthly chain is biased to the Call side with big open interest at 36 and 37  There is some size above at 38 as well and then smaller on the Put side at 36 and 35  The November options  the first after the next earnings report with any sizable open interest  have very large Call side interest above from 38 to 41 
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 37 25  with a November 37 33 Put Spread   1 40  and selling a November 41 Covered Call  67 cents   This gives protection to 33 through earnings and upside to 41 for added cost of less than 80 cents  Cheaper than a 5  stop  right 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the October November 38 Call Calendar   1 05   Big open interest lower in October may hold the stock or draw it back near expiry before a move higher into November 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the November 33 38 41 Call Spread Risk Reversal  33 cents  also known as a Seagull   This gives high leverage for a longer dated move 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday  which heading into Q4  sees the equity markets looking strong with the QQQ leading the way 
Elsewhere  look for gold to pullback short term while crude oil continues to the upside  The US Dollar Index looks to remain asleep moving sideways while US Treasuries are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue the drift lower around 3000 while Emerging Markets consolidate 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY    NYSE IWM  and QQQ  Their charts show strength in the QQQ leading higher  with the SPY just behind and the IWM taking a breather  the weakest of the bunch  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well ",2016-10-03,Gregory W.

204216,425732,M,Beat The Market With These High Dividend ETFs   Stocks ,opinion,"The Federal Reserve once again duly turned investors  attention to the high income investing corner of the equity world  Though the Fed expressed its confidence in the economic growth that will be enough to support one rate hike by the end of the year  it kept interest rates unchanged for now in its latest meeting  suggesting cheap money flows for a few more months Additionally  the central bank hinted at more gradual rate hikes over the next few years with just two lift offs in 2017 and three each in 2018 and 2019  This implies federal funds rate of 2 625  at the end of 2019  It also reduced the long term rate forecast to 2 9  from the previous forecast of 3   Further  the central bank lowered 2016 economic growth outlook for the third time to 1 8  from 2 0   and inflation outlook to 1 3  from 1 4   read       The lowered projections and no rate hike decision have boosted the demand for high dividend paying stocks and ETFs  making them the biggest potential movers in the weeks ahead  In fact  as per    the differential between dividend yields and 10 year Treasury yields is going to be significant enough that it will attract investors    Further  uneven global economic growth and the November presidential election have made investors nervous about their investment decisions  Amid this backdrop  dividend paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors as these generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by

Despite the current slump for apparel and accessories retailers  the beauty space remains hot  and tends to be recession proof  Macy s Inc  NYSE M  which bought special beauty brand BlueMercury in 2015  and JC Penney Company Inc Holding  NYSE JCP  which has ramped up their in store Sephora counters  both reported their respective beauty businesses as some of best performing of all segments in Q1  Ulta should benefit from the same trends that favor skincare and cosmetic offerings 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  1 34 on  1 04 billion in revenue  5 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  10 million on the top  Compared to a year earlier this represents a 28  increase in profitability and 20  in sales  Given Ulta has posted double digit gains in 8 consecutive quarters  it s not surprising that the stock is a positive mover during earnings season  This should be a nice boost for investors who have already seen shares increase 40  in the past 12 months
Ulta is coming off its 9th consecutive quarter of beating on both the top and bottom line  The recent string of strong performances can be attributed to robust online traffic and sales  Overall in Q4 2015  online sales grew 44 2  sustained by effective use of targeted emails and promotions  Last quarter  the beauty products retailer posted a 12 5  increase in comparable sales  stores that have been open at least 14 months and ecommerce  in which retail SSS were up 10 4   Strength has been driven by an increase in transactions and average ticket price  Salon sales for the company s in store hair salons also saw robust growth of 16 7  last quarter  and are expected to be a bright spot again in Q1 
Women s fragrances were a source of concern in 2015  with the category turning sharply negative  However  Ulta s market position  strategic outlook  and burgeoning cosmetics and beauty care products should be enough to mask the uncertainty in its sluggish fragrances segment

204367,425883,M,There Is No Spending,opinion,"The fiscal year for retailers ended in January with nothing like what it was supposed to be  Still  as always  the suggestions remained that a rebound in consumerism would be before too long  If it wasn t to be evident right away in February  the start of the 2016 fiscal year was at least supposed to be back in the plus column  Last week  Thomson Reuters noted the starting weakness and all the hoped for  

The American retail shopper still isn t in a free spending mood  The Thomson Reuters Same Store Sales  SSS  Index forecast for February 2016 indicates a small gain of 0 5   Excluding the drug store sector  the SSS growth rate is expected to fall to an estimate 0 3  

A year ago  the final February SSS index registered a much healthier gain of 1 2  and the ex drug indicator was up 0 6   However  a 3 0  increase is considered a sign of a robust retail economy 
At least the SSS index is expected to be in positive territory  compared to January s negative results  partly thanks to an improvement in winter weather   emphasis added 
Among the many prominent victims of the  unexpected  weakness was Macy s  NYSE M   Not only have same store comps declined four straight quarters  it has left the company with enormous inventory stocks    

Although the retailer beat its earnings estimate  the most worrisome metric from this iconic company is inventory days  During the fourth quarter ended Jan  31  this key figure went from 172 to 192 days  its highest level since we started tracking this metric in 1991  It s also much higher than the industry average median of 114 1  which means that a lot of Macy s merchandise is sitting on the shelves  The retailer also reported a Q4 same store sales  SSS  result of  4 3    the fourth straight quarter of negative SSS 

In other words  retailers are stuck at almost a contradiction  They want robust sales growth  and analysts are expecting that to come in relatively short order  but in order for the retail sector to get there it will need to clear inventory likely at significant  further  discounts in order to rebalance  And they need consumers to cooperate by being especially interested in all this discounted merchandise 
Consumers were already absent  

January is usually clearance month for retailers seeking to attract shoppers again after the busy holiday season  This year  it looks like weakness in the December scene carried over into the New Year  The Thomson Reuters Same Store Sales Index forecast for January 2016 is for 0 2  growth overall and for 0 0  growth excluding the drug store sector  Both figures are significantly lower than the January 2015 actual retail growth rate of 1 5  overall and 0 6  ex drug 
We are seeing that slow holiday sales added more clearance merchandise to January s inventory  In addition  when cold weather finally arrived in the northeastern U S   along with a huge blizzard   it kept shoppers at home and hurt mall traffic in January  particularly at brick and mortar retailers 

January same store sales did not grow at all  instead declining rather sharply by 1 1  
Instead of  0 5  same store growth in February  which would have been  again  atrocious  the nearly final tally for retailers shows flat in February  In other words  after seriously shrinking sales in January there was no rebound at all in February discounts or not  Retailers are in trouble  and it seems as if the difficulties are only lingering and increasing  NOTE  the chart below was from March 1 and includes the  0 5  SSSI estimate for February rather than the current update of 0 00   

Since 2005  44  of retailers  on average  beat their same store estimates each month  In February  only 14 3  did  Instead  71 4  missed compared to the historical average of 54 5   The weather may have improved  at least so far as an absence of big storms and snow blown excuses  but shopping did not  That means that the retail environment  as far as sales are concerned  is worse than first believed and showed no improvement at all December to January to February 
In short  as with the Census Bureau s version of overall retail sales  there is a clear consumer problem with implications spread across not just the US economy but overseas  China  perhaps more so  Despite all that  however  the BLS somehow suggests US retailers are hiring at maybe an historic pace and even accelerated hiring greatly in February  The discrepancy is so large as to be mutually exclusive  It is all the more so given that robust hiring in general always leads to more spending  so if there is no spending growth then that already suggests something else about hiring  There is no spending growth ",2016-03-08,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/there-is-no-spending-200120750,200120750

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Department Store Stock Reporting Q1 Earnings

The Q1 earnings season is in its final phase with 87 2  of the S P 500 companies having already reported their results as of May 6  2016  per the latest    Notably  most of these companies delivered better than expected results  This is probably because estimates for this quarter had fallen to real low levels  owing to the global macroeconomic concerns 

Among the 16 Zacks sectors that have the most significant impact on the S P 500 index  eight sectors including Basic Materials  Industrial Products  Energy and Conglomerates are expected to witness an earnings decline in Q1  On the other hand  earnings of the Retail Wholesale sector are expected to dip 0 1   whereas revenues are projected to increase 4 9  

Per the latest report  out of 48 8  of the S P 500 Retail stocks that have reported results so far  81  beat earnings and 57 1  surpassed revenue estimates  Also  6 2  of these companies saw their earnings improve year over year  while 10 9  witnessed revenue growth 

Let s see what might be in store for these department store stocks when they release earnings results this week 

Macy s Inc        one of the leading department store chains  is slated to report fiscal Q1 results on May 11  In the preceding two quarters  Macy s outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 

Macy s operates in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector  Moreover  aggressive pricing to fend off competition may weigh on margins in the quarter to be reported  Also  the dwindling top line and bottom line results of Macy s remain the primary concern for investors 

A look at the company s performance in fiscal 2015 unveils that net sales and earnings declined in all four quarters  A mature domestic market  lower tourist spending and cautious consumer spending continue to pose concerns 

Macy s carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and has an of  13 89   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 36 cents   Read more     

Kohl s Corporation    is set to report Q1 results before the opening bell on May 12  Last quarter  this specialty retailer posted a positive surprise of 1 94   For Q1  the company expects a significant drop in gross margins as it plans to aggressively clear excessive merchandise that resulted from lower than expected fourth quarter 2015 sales  SG A expenses in Q1 are also expected to rise 3 4   mainly due to higher advertising expenses 

Kohl s remains cautious about its fiscal 2016 results and plans to close 18 stores after reporting weak fourth quarter 2015 results  due to retail uncertainty as well as cautious spending by the U S  consumers  The company is witnessing lower spending on apparel and accessories  A general slowdown in consumer spending is also hurting sales at department stores 

Kohl s carries a Zacks Rank  3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 37 cents   Read more    

Dillard s Inc       is expected to report fiscal Q1 results on May 12  In the last quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 11 8   Also  this departmental store chain missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  with an average negative earnings surprise of 6 1  

Dillard s repeated its dismal performance in fourth quarter fiscal 2015 as both the top line and the bottom line of the company declined year over year  Also  earnings lagged expectations due to a fall in merchandise sales as well as gross margin contraction owing to higher markdowns  Management notes that sales weakness in energy producing regions and higher markdowns to revive sales persist as fiscal 2016 proceeds 

Though these factors keep us on the sidelines  we are impressed with the company s focus on increasing productivity at existing stores  developing a leading omni channel platform and enhancing its domestic operations to support results in the future 

Dillard s carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at  2 62   Read more

204417,425933,M,Macy s  Why This Retailer Is Under Extreme Pressure,opinion,"Macy s Inc  NYSE M  is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter earnings on Wednesday  Aug  12 before the stock market opens  Estimize analysts are predicting EPS of  0 77  two cents above the Wall Street consensus  Last quarter  Macy s had EPS of  0 56  down 7  YoY  Estimize is also predicting higher revenues than Wall Street at  6 261B vs   6 255B  Last quarter  revenue was  6 232B  down 1  YoY  After last quarter s earnings  Macy s Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Lundgren claimed the company fell short due to severe weather and the slowdown in West Coast ports  However  he was optimistic about the future  predicting that certain categories such as dresses and  active categories  as well as the new Plenti loyalty program would show positive results in the future  Moreover  the acquisition of luxury beauty and spa retail chain  BlueMercury  is also expected to boost earnings this quarter  Lastly  Macy s has a lot of valuable real estate under their belt  owning several properties across the country  Macy s will look to monetize these properties in an appropriate manner to increase assets 

Although Lundgren ended the first quarter conference call on an upbeat note  stating the future would be more positive due to several new initiatives  there are other issues that could negatively impact the upcoming earnings results  Some of these factors include a decrease in tourism sales  lower handbag sales  which the firm calls the  Kors effect  referring to the Michael Kors   NYSE KORS  handbags  and changing customer trends  Moreover  Macy s aggressive pricing to fend off competition could too weigh on margins in the upcoming quarter 
So will Lundgren s optimism be verified tomorrow morning  or will the several negative influences be too strong to overcome  It is hard to say  Macy s is kicking off the second quarter earnings season for department stores  and the results will not only be telling for the future of the company  but for the retail industry as a whole ",2015-08-12,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-this-retailer-is-under-extreme-pressure-261340,261340

204440,425956,M,What s Up With Retail ,opinion,"Some incremental retail data has been trickling in this week  and it s been pretty mediocre   On a headline basis  the Census Bureau s report of aggregate retail sales for July showed no growth over June   This is the fourth straight month of sluggish growth 
As far as Census  data is concerned though  year over year growth is still not awful  Total Retail Sales are up 3 7  over this time last year in large part because March was such a good month this year that it generated enough growth to carry the next several months   In fact  March is probably the reason that ensuing months have shown low growth   Growth was pulled forward  and now has evened out 
Still  the commentary from some early reporting retail and apparel companies continues to be pretty gloomy   It appears that the environment remains extremely promotional and the consumer remains tight fisted   Here s what Fossil  NASDAQ FOSL  had to say on Tuesday s earnings call 

 Our biggest challenge remains our U S  business  where the retail environment is still challenging and where retailers continue to use promotions as a way to drive traffic 

Here s what Macy s  NYSE M  said in its press release yesterday 

 We are approaching the second half of 2014 with confident optimism tempered with the reality that many customers still are not feeling comfortable about spending more in an uncertain economic environment 

I wrote an article a couple of weeks ago hypothesizing that a lot of this could be seasonal   If that s the case then hopefully things get better from here   Either way though  it s clear that all is not right in retail land  and it s important to remember that retail companies are typically among the first to lag before a recession starts

204449,425965,M,What About Macy s ,opinion,"Macy s   NYSE M   has long been a favorite retail stock among traders and investors and comes with a decent dividend of over 2   But is also is a stock that can be used to visualize the dichotomy of views on the market between bullish and ready to move higher  and gone to far and in need of a pullback  The first chart below paints the bullish case  After a run higher from February the stock pulled back through April and into May before moving back higher  The price action has traced out a Cup and Handle pattern and with today s candle may be ready to break higher  This would trigger a target of 65 66  Nearly a 10  move higher from the current level 

But the second chart shows that the Cup above  can also be viewed as a near perfect bearish Gartley harmonic  A move lower here  that could be interpreted as a continuation of the Handle on the Cup and Handle pattern  would actually trigger the reversal on the Gartley and target a move lower to at least 58 80 and 57 28 should it go beyond  Only a 5  pullback but a pullback none the less  Which way do you see it

204481,425997,M,Gold As A Weapon  Q A With Chris Mancini,opinion,There is a war raging behind the scenes among the world s currencies  Chris Mancini  an analyst with the  400 million Gabelli Gold Fund  believes that gold will emerge the victor  In this interview with The Gold Report  Mancini makes his case for why gold is a currency and not just a relic  and why his fund doesn t own bullion  He also shares names of companies operating around the world that offer great upside potential  The Gold Report  You recently wrote  Gold mining companies are no different from any other company in that company managements must determine the most effective way to return capital to shareholders In an environment where there haven t been corresponding increases in equity prices to the price of gold  how does a management group effectively grow per share value for shareholders  Chris Mancini  If you re too big and don t think that you can grow on a per share basis  the answer is to return some of the cash to shareholders through a dividend  If a company doesn t have high quality  high return on capital  low risk projects to deploy that cash flow into  then a portion should be returned to shareholders as a dividend  TGR  We haven t seen a whole lot of that  CM  Take Barrick Gold Corp   ABX  as an example  It had a goal of eventually mining 9 million ounces  Moz  gold and should produce around 7 5 Moz in 2013  which is a difficult thing to do  Barrick has been focused on growing for growth s sake  It undertook two very capital intensive projects  Pueblo Viejo in the Dominican Republic  which is complete and should be producing commercially sometime next year  and Pascua Lama  which is an enormous  capital intensive project in the Chilean Argentinean Andes  which the company is doing a poor job of building  That being said  it will be very cash flow generative once it s built  The question becomes at that point  once Pascua Lama is built  what does it do with its cash flow  We re getting a sense that it wants to be a leaner  meaner company and that it s not going to focus on growing its very big production base  That s a good sign that it might start distributing more of its cash in a dividend  TGR  A lot of senior producers  and even midtiers  are focusing on grade  Irrespective of all things  the higher the grade  the better the economic return  CM  That s the key  A higher grade deposit means processing fewer tons to get out the same number of ounces without the capital intensity of a big  bulk tonnage  low grade operation  The cost per ounce is also lower given that not as many tons need to be processed to recover the same amount of metal  TGR  You don t hear many pundits predicting a falling gold price in 2013  yet we continue to see volatility in the space  What s your forecast for the gold price in 2013  CM  We re very constructive on the gold price in all currencies  All over the world  money is being printed  and gold is the one currency that can t be reprinted or replicated  The money that s being printed will ultimately lose its purchasing power  and gold should retain its purchasing power  Gold should continue to go up relative to currencies that will be losing their value  More debt leads to more money printing  and more money printing leads to continued devaluation of currency  It s a positive macroeconomic environment for gold  TGR  Some investors don t view gold as a currency  They view it as a metal  a relic  CM  Historically  gold has been the ultimate currency and  at some point in the future  will again be the ultimate currency  It s not legal tender  but that still doesn t mean it s not something that will hold its value over time relative to paper  TGR  Utah and a couple of other states have actually passed legislation that gold is considered a currency  CM  In some states  you can bring in gold or silver and get goods for that gold or silver  The problem with that is federal tax  If you buy gold and it appreciates in value and there s a gain on that gold  when you sell or transfer that gold  then there is a federal tax on that transaction  Until that goes away  it will be hard to use gold as a real currency in the U S  TGR  Even in a world that hasn t descended to a serious level of crisis  gold can still be appreciating as a currency  CM  It is a currency war  Currencies are devalued against one another  Recently  the Japanese elected the Liberal Democratic Party leader Shinzo Abe  One of his talking points during the election was that the Japanese economy is uncompetitive because the yen is too strong  Abe s theme is more monetary and fiscal stimulus  and a weaker yen  He and the Japanese people think that the country needs a much weaker currency in order to be competitive in the world economy  That s also why the Swiss agreed to their money printing exercise    in order to stop their currency from appreciating more and more  TGR  It does feel like a race down the hill when you talk about it like that  CM  If the Japanese  Swiss  and other Europeans print more and more money to make their currencies less valuable  ultimately the U S  is going to be uncompetitive from a manufacturing perspective  It gives the U S  impetus to also print more money  TGR  We re talking about trillions of dollars of deficit  It s almost beyond comprehension  Because you value gold as currency  why don t you hold any bullion in the fund  CM  Gold miners are undervalued relative to bullion  and investors can get bullion cheaper themselves  They shouldn t be paying us to own bullion  Bullion is a savings instrument  Gold equities are investments  TGR  The fund s No  1 holding  at about 12   is Randgold Resources Ltd   GOLD   which is heavily involved in Africa  I ve traveled to Africa and was very impressed with the mineral wealth there  Yet some investors are not comfortable with that location  Why are you  CM  When a company comes into a community  builds a mine and employs people  it liberates those people from poverty  They re building skill sets that they have for the rest of their lives  A well respected institutional mining company like Randgold comes into a region  employs people  educates people  liberates people    those people want that company to be there  It greatly reduces jurisdictional risk when you have that much local support  TGR  Yet  there are places in Africa without that support  There are roving bands of thugs that are creating problems in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mali  Do you see these as temporary blips in an otherwise bullish and opportunistic area  or do you see this as a long term thorn in the side of companies working in those areas  CM  They re not necessarily blips  but they re not meaningful to the operations of Randgold  A place like Mali or the Congo is vast  As long as there are no specific problems near Randgold s mines  it s a non event  TGR  There are hundreds of kilometers of distance between the places where the problems are occurring and Randgold s operations  and no connecting infrastructure  CM  It s extremely remote relative to political circumstances that may be transpiring around the country  TGR  Your second largest holding is Fresnillo Plc  FRES   the number one silver producer in the world  In a report you wrote that one of the things you like about Fresnillo is that it acts like an owner  Unlike many other large precious metals companies  Fresnillo is an owner operator company that s 80  controlled by a family owned Mexican conglomerate CM  You have to ask yourself  as an investor  what s the management s incentive  For a large institutional type precious metal mining company  their incentives may not be directly with the shareholders  whereas the owner of a company focuses on maximizing returns and cash flow  TGR  Do you routinely look for companies with a lot of management ownership  CM  That s something that s important to us  We look for skin in the game in the form of shares  not options  because we do want to see companies paying bigger dividends  If managers own shares  then they ll benefit when dividends are paid out  too  TGR  Is there another example of a company with vested management that you are particularly excited about going into 2013  CM  Guido Staltari  the chief executive officer of Australia based Saracen Mineral Holdings Ltd   SAR   is the founder of the company  has an ownership stake in the company and is very invested in the company  Saracen should produce around 115 thousand ounces  115 Koz  gold at a cash cost of around  950 ounce  oz  this year  It s in the process of expanding its operations  With an incremental spend of around  40 million  M   it should be able to increase its production by around 75 Koz year and it should also be able to bring its cash costs down to around AU 850 oz  TGR  That s a name I ve never heard of before  CM  Saracen is producing now  It s relatively low risk growth and relatively high return on capital  The company has built a mill that needs some modifications  It has leases on its mining equipment  so it can upgrade the size and benefit from economies of scale that will come with using the new equipment without having to make a large capital outlay  It also has some very prospective land that is relatively high grade where it is exploring  We hope that it will be able to increase its reserves  One of its deposits  Red October  is a higher grade than what it is currently mining  If it can grow the Red October deposit through exploration  then its average grade should increase  its costs should decline and its production should increase even more  TGR  Are there any North America listed names that are piquing your interest  CM  One that has been hurt this year but has the potential within the next 18 months or so to do well is Kirkland Lake Gold Inc   KGI   Kirkland Lake operates a mine in its namesake Kirkland Lake  Ontario  which is along the Abitibi gold belt  It s an old mine in transition  As it increases its production  it should benefit from economies of scale  Kirkland is also exploring a new  high grade portion of the deposit called the South Mine Complex  It won t be without its fits and starts  and it s not without risk because it s a very difficult expansion that it s undertaking  If Kirkland does succeed  its production should grow from around 100 Koz this year to around 250 Koz at full capacity  Its cash costs should decline from around  900 oz to closer to  600 700 oz  TGR  Assuming operating costs stay the same  CM  Kirkland Lake s operational costs are going to go up  but not to the same extent that its production should go up  Right now  it is mining from 800 1 000 tons per day  0 8 1 Ktpd   The goal is to produce up to 22 Ktpd  It has around 900 workers underground now and wants to grow to 1 200 workers  It can more than double its production by just increasing its workforce by about 30   TGR  It s trading near  6 share now  after trading as high as  18 share  This stock has been smacked  CM  Kirkland Lake s management has miscommunicated its production goals to the market  It has consistently changed its production guidance  First  it was going to be 2012  then 2013  and then 2014  The market doesn t trust anything that it is saying  Yet  that s why  over the next 18 months  it could do well  because the mine will be at a point where we will be able to see whether the company has been able to execute on its plan  The market wants to see consistent growth quarter over quarter and consistent decline in costs quarter over quarter  But given the nature of its operations  it s going to be lumpy for a while until it gets to a steady state  The operations are at this point essentially paying for exploration and or serving as a training ground for new underground miners at the operation  TGR  Have you been there  CM  Yes  I recently spent a day underground with Chief Operating Officer Mark Tessier getting a sense for the operations and the expansion project  It s striking how many people go underground every day  It s only going to ramp from there  A lot of the miners come to the operation without any mining experience  It takes a while for them to get up to speed and to productive capacity  Once they do  the company has the potential to be a midtier producing company in one of the best jurisdictions in the world  producing at reasonable unit cash costs  TGR  With explorational blue sky  CM  If the exploration does work out from the South Mine Complex  then its costs should be below average  at about  550 600 oz  TGR  It did a  69M private placement in November  CM  Yes  and it did another one in the summer for about  57M  Right now  it has around  120M of debt  That makes it more risky  The balance sheet is more levered  I still like it  but it s not for the faint of heart  TGR  What s another company in a great jurisdiction you can tell us about  CM  Another North America listed gold name is Aurizon Mines Ltd   AZK   TGR  That s another one that s had great success  but a few bumps in the road  CM  Aurizon doesn t necessarily have the growth prospects that Kirkland Lake does  However  it does have downside protection  It has a rock solid balance sheet with  200M in cash  It has had some operational issues recently  but the market is not latching on to the essence of the story  It is mining an old area and it is going to start mining in a new area  Zone 123 at its flagship Casa Berardi mine  Once it starts mining the new area  it should get steady production and generate a good amount of cash flow  In 2014  the company should be producing 135 150 Koz year gold at cash costs of  700 800 oz  generating a good margin  in a great jurisdiction in Northern Quebec  TGR  Aurizon is not flashy or sexy  but it sure gets it done  It s been impressive to watch that company  CM  It has  The fact that it hasn t done an acquisition yet with its  200M cash hoard speaks volumes  TGR  One of the things that is compelling about a lot of midtier producers is that they are nimble  They can pare back a little bit  They re small enough to decide to stick to where they re having explorational success with their own assets  We re seeing that with several of these midtier companies  As an investor  it makes them more attractive in some ways than the seniors  CM  Yes  I agree  They don t have the overhead of the seniors  The seniors almost have to buy something in Nevada  for example  because they currently have all of the overhead in Nevada and they have to sustain it  That s not the case with these small  single asset companies  TGR  Let s go to silver  Could you talk about a couple of silver names that you find compelling  CM  The one that makes sense to talk about  given that we spoke about Fresnillo  is MAG Silver Corp   MVG   MAG Silver has 44  of the Juanicipio project  a property that is near Fresnillo s namesake mine  Fresnillo has the rest of the project  Fresnillo is the highest grade silver mine in the world  Juanicipio has a similar geological structure to the Fresnillo deposits  These are epithermal vein systems  At Juanicipio  the company has delineated a deposit that is around 230 Moz silver at very high grades  It s a silver equivalent grade of 700 grams per ton  this is an extremely high grade deposit in one of the best jurisdictions in the world  Zacatecas state  Fresnillo is the best miner and developer of high grade underground silver deposits in the world  TGR  What needs to happen with Fresnillo and MAG Silver to unlock the value of MAG Silver for shareholders  CM  Obviously  for Fresnillo to buy out MAG Silver s 44  stake of the Juanicipio project  That s the best case scenario for both companies and for shareholders of both companies  They just have to sit down in a room  hash it out and come up with something that s reasonable  If they can t agree to a price  MAG Silver could spin out the Juanicipio asset to shareholders  who would then get one piece of paper that s 44  Juanicipio and another piece of paper that is all of MAG s other exploration assets  some of which are very prospective  For that 44  in Juanicipio  ultimately the shareholders would get a cash call  They would have the option to either participate in the cash call to fund a portion of the capital expenditures for the project or get diluted down  Once Juanicipio gets built by Fresnillo  shareholders would still have the 44  stake in the cash flow from this operation that would be returned in the form of a dividend  TGR  That s an interesting idea  CM  Yes  I think that it would be valued very highly in that it would be like a royalty company  It would be 44  of the profit from one of the best silver mines in the world  operated by one of the best silver miners in the world  TGR  It might be easier from both companies  perspectives if everything is separated that way  CM  That s true  too  The first step is separating the assets out  But value can be surfaced for a MAG shareholder even if Fresnillo doesn t buy it  TGR  Is this something that s already on the table  CM  I ve spoken about it with management  Director Peter Megaw is a relatively large holder of MAG Silver  He is motivated to do what s in shareholders  interests  If it does spin this out  it makes what s remaining a smaller company  It has to start over again  which is fine because Megaw is one of the best exploration geologists in the world at finding epithermal vein and carbonate replacement deposits  TGR  It s not really starting over because what it has outlined in its exploration assets is actually pretty compelling  CM  That s true  It s not starting from nothing  It has delineated some exciting prospects at its Cinco de Mayo project in Chihuahua  TGR  Do you have some final thoughts for us on the mining space  CM  It s been a difficult year  Yet  while this is an extremely volatile sector  it can be volatile on the upside  as well as the downside  Our hope is that in the coming year  it moves fast and furiously on the upside and the environment is more constructive for gold and for gold miners  TGR  Excellent  Thanks for taking the time to speak with us today  Chris Mancini is a research analyst at Gabelli specializing in precious metals mining

shareholder value  He also shares why he sees junior miners as higher reward and lower risk than gold itself  The Gold Report  Michael  can you tell us why you believe we are at the psychological and valuation bottom of the trough in the junior mining sector  Michael Ballanger  Using the TSX Venture Exchange  TSX V  as a proxy for the junior mining sector  the TSX V between 2003 and 2007 traded in a range of approximately 1 5 to 3 3 times the price of gold  In the 2008 crash  it went down to 0 8 times the price of gold  Going back 15  20  30  40 years  the TSX V had traded on a 1 1 correlation with either the oil price or the gold price  Since the 2008 crash  there has been an immense aversion to risk in the junior mining space  At the end of 2012  trading was around 0 71 times the gold price  We have never seen valuations like this in the junior mining sector  At the bottom of any bear market  sellers become exhausted so only survivors are left  If you accept that premise  it becomes important to see who has survived or who has the management capabilities  the financing and high caliber projects to advance  Those are companies that will benefit from what I think will be a normalization of the Venture Exchange s ratio to the actual gold price  I think a realistic level would be 1 5 2 0 times the gold price  Unlike most experts  I am far more bullish on the senior producers and on the junior and intermediate developer producers and explorers than I am on the physical gold price  I think there is a lower risk  higher reward potential in the shares than in the metal right now  TGR  Given the market performance in the junior precious metals sector and in the junior mining sector as a whole over the last couple of years  do you feel like the characters in the film  Groundhog Day   reliving the same events over and over  MB  What is peculiar about this cycle is that we have not experienced the  mania phase  that typically happens at the end of a bull market  At the bottom in 2009  again in 2011 and all through 2012  despite near record gold prices and very high energy prices  it felt as if we were in the post Bre X Minerals Ltd  period  You need to remember that the symbol for crisis in the Chinese language is made up of two symbols  the first one is danger and the second is opportunity  I see tremendous opportunity  but not without challenges  In my work  I have to be very good at identifying management teams and projects that will survive and will excel in most environments  With market valuations so low  I feel like a little child in a candy store with  10 in my pocket  There is so much to choose from  Due diligence takes longer  yes  but when I find something  I can hand my clients an awfully big rate of return if they are prepared to take the risks associated with the sector  TGR  We hear a lot about management teams at junior mining companies  You have said that you prefer management teams that incubate companies to preserve shareholder value  Can you expand on that concept  MB  The perfect way to incubate a junior mining company requires  first  a private company with a very small group of shareholders who are looking three to five years down the line  The caliber of the shareholder base is paramount  The ideal shareholder is one who has been successful in his or her own business and knows how long it takes to start up  develop and eventually reap the rewards of owning a start up  Having shareholders with a three to five year timeframe eliminates frequent turnover in the shares  which makes it a lot easier for the management to raise capital for development at progressively higher prices  The second most important thing relates to raising money  If a company needs  3 million  M  for a project  it should not try to raise  10M  If a company raises only what it needs  it avoids diluting shareholders  equity  Do you remember the old expression  Friend or foe  take the dough   In the last few years  junior mining companies have taken the dough  which is always associated with larger percentage fees charged by the investment industry  and companies have been trashed by the market  They have diluted shareholder equity  A well incubated company keeps its financing strategic  on a needs basis and at progressively higher levels  This minimizes dilution and enhances shareholder value  These companies can go to their shareholders first for financing  If they wrote a check at  0 10 share  they will write another check at  0 35 and another at  0 75 because they understand the business model  TGR  How does an average retail investor find out who the shareholders are in a junior mining company  MB  I wish I had a good answer to that  You might start by searching the company s press releases on its website or through SEDAR  You can cross reference what the company financed at and measure that against how much it is spending on a month to month basis  If the company has executed its business plan and hit its benchmarks of estimated ounces  was that done on time and on budget  That information will infer the caliber of the shareholder base and the kind of guidance the company is getting from its fiscal adviser  It will tell you how committed management is to preserving and enhancing shareholder value  TGR  Can you give us a couple of examples of companies that have succeeded with that incubation strategy  MB  Tinka Resources Ltd   TK TSX V  TLD FSE  TKRFF OTCPK  is the best example  Its Colquipucro property in Peru is a great asset  I have been recommending Tinka to Gold Report readers since 2009  In 2010  we raised a little over  1M and asked management to get the permits in place to develop the silver resource  Just before the meltdown in mid 2011  after the shares had hit a high of  0 75  there was a correction  We were set to do a  0 50 share financing to raise  5M  We scaled that back to  0 35 share to raise  2 25M  This minimized the dilution during a difficult period in the market  In December 2012  Tinka moved its Zone 1 silver resource from 20 3 million ounces  Moz  to 32 7 Moz  under budget and in a very acceptable timeframe  The share price responded  the market went to  0 75  0 80 share  The  2 25M raised was within the budget  If the company moves forward over the next 6 12 months to a level representative of fair value relative to its proven resource  it can do a much bigger financing at fair value  This gives the early shareholders a significant lift and  most important  a reason to hold the shares  Another company that did not get hit in the downturn due to the caliber of its shareholder base is Kaminak Gold Corp   KAM TSX V  in the Yukon  led by Rob Carpenter  It started off in 2009 at around  0 15 share  In 2011  when everybody thought the Yukon would become the next Northwest Territories diamond rush  it moved above  4 50 share  When the European meltdown hit  Kaminak executed beautifully  It minimized dilution and did not issue overly aggressive amounts of paper  The company still has less than 100M shares outstanding and 1 9 Moz or more  Kaminak s shareholder base is primarily institutional  The people who run these portfolios are very capable and very sharp  but their hands are tied  If the retail public decides to redeem the fund  the portfolio manager has no choice but to liquidate to meet the redemptions  When they sold Kaminak  it was not because they wanted to  but because they were forced to  In the case of Tinka  no one was forced to sell through redemptions  Both companies have executed beautifully  Both represent great shareholder value at current levels and have lots of blue sky potential  Tinka closed at an all time  52 week high in 2012  while Kaminak closed at about 35  of its all time high  TGR  Tinka s share price has been trending higher since August  What is its next step  When can we expect a maiden resource estimate  MB  Tinka has an Inferred  NI 43 101 compliant resource of 32 7 Moz  It has a permit and recently announced a villager agreement  Tinka s management team in Lima has a done a superb job  The team has 30 odd years of experience in the mining industry in Peru  They negotiated both the government permits to drill the Zone 1 silver project and the Ayawilca base metal massive sulphide discovery  They also navigated relations with the local communities and what is called the  social contract  in Peru  It took six months longer than expected to negotiate the villager agreement with the Pillao village  which is associated with the silver resource  It took longer than expected in Yanacocha  where Ayawilca is  as well  But if your shareholder base understands how politics and business co mingle in Peru  they have the patience to let management do it right  Tinka s community relations staff used education and fairness to turn the villagers into advocates who are now running around wearing Tinka T shirts and baseball caps  TGR  What can you tell us about Tinka s two projects  MB  Tinka s safety valve is its silver resource  Zone 1  which is being expanded rapidly  I expect the infill drilling has the potential to substantially move up that resource s 32 7 Moz  a resource of about 35 40 Moz is necessary to get on the radar screen and I am confident it will achieve that level in 2013  The second thing that sets this resource apart is that it is all on the surface  it is in an oxide zone  amenable to leaching  and you get 97  recovery rates after 72 hours using bottle roll technology  The feasibility of putting something like this into production with a very low capital expenditure is extremely high  This offers a level of security for Tinka s shareholders you can get that valuation metric with very little risk  Ayawilca is a new  massive zinc sulphide discovery made in late 2011  It is my passion  I am a base metal person and massive sulphides are the Holy Grail for me  When Tinka started hitting intercepts of massive sulphides containing economic grade zinc  the hair on the back of my neck started turning up  this thing has structure  The geophysics say that Ayawilca has elephant capabilities  It is 70km down the road from Cerro de Pasco  one of the biggest zinc mines in Peru  owned by Volcan Compa ia Minera SAA  LIN PE VOLCAAC1   The number one marker mineral at Cerro de Pasco is rhodochrosite  and Tinka s discovery holes contain a lot of rhodochrosite  I am really excited about Tinka and its current share price objective has not factored in Ayawilca  TGR  Kaminak put out a resource estimate in December of roughly 3 2 Moz Inferred at its Coffee project in the Yukon  What did you think of those numbers  MB  Rob Carpenter has delivered more than people ever expected  I am bullish on the Yukon  I expect it will be the next major Canadian gold mining camp  not unlike Timmins or Kirkland Lake  And I think Kaminak has above average potential for people willing to take the risk and have the patience to understand that these businesses take time to develop  TGR  A lot of investors in this sector are employing strategies that worked in previous cycles in the junior mining sector  but seem ill suited to today s market  Why is that  MB  It dovetails with what we discussed about how you do your due diligence  In 2000  coming off the Bre X Minerals Ltd  disaster  junior mining companies could not raise money for any project regardless of its potential  It was easy to make money in the early part of that cycle because valuations were so depressed  From February 2011 to the end of 2012  we were in what I call a  valuation compression cycle   Normally  you expect increased gold or silver prices to attract new investors when a company announces a discovery  and that demand will take a share price higher  In a compression period that does not happen  In a compression cycle  you have to make sure that your entry point is at a level that has already wrung out all the early or mid range investors who bought it at the wrong price  If you or your adviser has been investing only since 1991  1998 or 2001  you may think that a company that has been in the range of  0 50 to  2 share  and that if you buy it at  1 share  the worst it can do is go back to  0 50 share  That is not the case  it can go back to zero  There is an expression in this business   there s no fever like gold fever   No one younger than 35 or 40 has any idea what a  mania phase  is like  And I maintain that we are heading into a mania phase for the junior mining sector  I am not sitting here with a starter pistol  ready to tell you exactly when the mania will start  but there has never been a time when the gold price has advanced as it has over the last 12 years where the entire mining sector junior  intermediate and senior did not move to bubble valuations  We may see gold at  10 000 ounce  oz  or  5 000 oz  but the lower risk entry point now is into the abject  stark psychological depression that is the mining shares  That is the lower risk transaction right now  TGR  What are some other names you are high on now  MB  In the Yukon I like Comstock Metals Ltd   CSL TSX V   I have spoken to CEO Rasool Mohammad a number of times  I like his passion and commitment  Kinross Gold Corp  s  K TSX  KGC NYSE  Golden Saddle project is across the Yukon River from Comstock  and Kinross needs to find more resource ounces to rationalize its infrastructure  If Comstock puts any ounces together in its 2013 campaign  it could be absorbed like a minnow in front of a shark because Kinross needs those ounces  Bitterroot Resources Ltd   BTT TSX V  has a nickel copper  platinum group metals prospect in northern Michigan tied to Rio Tinto Plc  RIO NYSE  RIO ASX  RIO LSE  RTPPF OTCP   Bitterroot trades at  0 11 0 12 share  I am just in the due diligence process right now  but it certainly has my attention  TGR  You follow the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index  VIX  and you track volatility  Should retail investors get used to more volatility as 2013 unfolds  MB  They certainly should  Howard Marks wrote an  commenting on the high level of complacency in the market  People are buying into the equity markets because they see the Federal Reserve or the Treasury defending equity levels through interest rate policy or open market operations  That is why the VIX has come down so far  I like seeing the VIX trade at a reasonable level 20 or 22 because it says to me that there is some fear in the market  A VIX under 15 tells me there is too much complacency  I would use VIX to hedge portfolio positions looking six to nine months out  particularly now that it is trading at a multiyear historical low  under 14  TGR  What wisdom can you share with our readers from your 35 years in the business  MB  A phrase I learned at the Wharton School has always served me well   Never underestimate the replacement power of equities within an inflationary spiral   All the central banks on the planet are doing their best to re inflate their way out of their debt problems  When they all are doing their best to debase their currency  it is no different than a company trading on an exchange excessively diluting its shareholder capital  In the equity market  that is a negative for price  In the fiat currency world  currency dilution is punitive to the purchasing power  to the value of that currency  This makes currency the great short sale for 2013  I recommend that people short sell or sell cash  The inverse of that is to buy assets  The integrity of the purchasing power of cash and cash equivalents is the greatest danger right now  People sitting on a pile of cash for retirement could wake up to a situation like Weimar Germany in 1921 22  instead of paying  1 20 for a loaf of bread  it suddenly costs  5 or  6  Inflation is like toothpaste  once it is out of the tube  it is impossible to get it back in  Investors should be buying things  investing  taking their savings and making sure that they are selling or shorting cash  That includes owning companies that produce gold  silver  resources  farmland  anything that kicks out a rate of return on commodities and goods that people require  In nominal terms  that means you could see a much higher equity market 12 18 months down the line without feeling it in the economy  because it is the currency that will have gone down  not the inherent value in the businesses or the shares  TGR  Michael  thank you for your time and your insights  Originally trained

204498,426014,M,Zombie Stocks  Bob Moriarty s Stock Tales From The Crypt,opinion,It is a global ghoul fest when Bob Moriarty talks about his favorite zombie stocks companies whose share prices have flirted with death but still offer devilishly good potential  Moriarty is happy to  buy  1 bills for  0 50  and tells readers where to do the same in this exclusive Gold Report interview  The Gold Report  Appropriately for this time of year Halloween and the Day of the Dead gold s hold above  1 700 ounce  oz  seems to be reviving some junior mining stock prices that had been left for dead  What are some names with a heartbeat  Bob Moriarty  NOVAGOLD  NG TSX  NG NYSE MKT  has come back from the dead a couple of times  In 2001 or 2002  NOVAGOLD was the number one gaining stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange  It reached  20 share at one point  In 2008  it hit a low of  0 46 share  18 months later it had bounced back to  17 share  TGR  And today it trades at  5 share  BM  The lesson here is to buy when stocks are cheap and sell when they get expensive  Too many investors in the junior mining space marry the damn stocks  They fail to sell and take their profit when they have the chance  If investors aren t willing to sell at a profit  the only alternative is that they sell at a loss  When I write about a stock  I think I can predict what it will do over the next few months to a year  but it is really hard to predict what the fools running these companies will do two or three years out  You have to take a profit when you can  TGR  Well  NOVAGOLD has revitalized itself and is moving Donlin Creek in Alaska forward  Can you tell us another zombie story  BM  Canaco Resources Inc   CAN TSX V  has a big property in northern Tanzania  I visited about six years ago and looked at some of the gold through a loupe  From that look  I could tell the gold had been formed right there  But the other geologists on the tour begged to differ and the company drilled another project to the south  That was a total bust and the stock fell through the floor  As a last gasp effort  Canaco sold half of the company to the Chinese at  0 05 a share in early 2009  The company returned to northern Tanzania  where it drilled and promoted the project like crazy  The stock ran from  0 06 share in 2008 to  6 40 share in 2011  The company got to a market cap of  700 800 million  M   Then  with the market expecting a resource of 5 million ounces  Moz  or so  Canaco announced just 1 Moz  The market killed the stock  TGR  On May 15  2012  it was trading at  0 87 share and two days later it was down to  0 36 share  BM  This is a perfect example of a stock being smacked by the market because management over promoted the project and it blew up in its face  The company now has  0 54 share in cash and is selling for  0 41 share  That is crazy  TGR  You believe Canaco is an interesting investment  then  BM  Anytime you can buy  1 bills for  0 80  it is a good deal  Canaco has 1 Moz of mineable gold  Its mistake was over promotion  I hope management had a  come to Jesus meeting  and is figuring out how to use that  100M to turn the project into a mine  If you cannot make a mine with 1 Moz in Tanzania  you cannot do it anywhere  TGR  Looking for another zombie stock  how about CBM Asia Development Corp   TCF TSX V  CBMDF OTCBB   BM  I would like to grab management by their necks and shake them until their brains fall out  The company has raised  40 50M over the last four years and has a  25M market cap  Its coal bed methane project in Indonesia has more potential than any I have ever seen or heard of  I have a lot of shares in this bugger  I was in placements at  0 40 in 2008 and am now buying stock at  0 14 share  This is a situation where 100  of the investors have lost money  that has to be a management problem  TGR  What does management need to do to move forward  BM  Management needs to put money in something so investors can see the benefit  Management spends  1M here or  5M there to pick up a new project with 10 trillion cubic feet  Tcf  potential  but until you drill it out  you cannot put a hard number on it  It s worth a lot but investors don t see it  Management has to do something visible  The company did put out a probable resource last year  Its share was 1 Tcf of gas and the market price in Indonesia is  10 12 thousand cubic feet  CBM Asia has an asset that should be worth  200 300M and its stock is selling for a tenth of that amount  Management needs to drill to come up with a resource  It needs to sell something and show investors that the company can make money  TGR  It looks as if CBM Asia has had a couple of resurrections  Initially  it had a nice run up in share price  got decimated and had another nice run up  With a  0 14 share price and a  25M market cap  it seems to be on life support  BM  But it is not on life support  and that is the terrible thing  The company has  9M in the bank  a  25M market cap and 169M shares total  Its 1 Tcf resource should be worth  200 300M  Its enterprise value is  15M  when it should be  300M  I have gotten a lot of grief from people who bought shares on my recommendation  But I am still buying  I have an open order  I do not think I am an idiot  I think management has done a poor job  I think CBM Asia has the goods and will resurrect when it shows the shareholders some value  TGR  OK  we have gone from Alaska to Africa to Indonesia  What location and company provide your next zombie stock  Bob Moriarty  This one  Philippine Metals Inc   PHI TSX V  PHIXF OTCQX  is a very funny stock  TGR  A Goldman Sachs analyst out of Sydney recently told me the Philippines is a mining district on the cusp of breaking out  What makes Philippine Metals a zombie  BM  I met Philippine Metals  management several years ago in Vancouver  The company had three major projects in the Philippines and I saw some of the rock it was some of the highest grade copper I had ever seen  I invested when the shares were  0 45 share  It dropped to  0 25 share in mid 2010 when some drill results did not work out  The Philippines has some of the richest gold and copper deposits in the world  It also has one of the most corrupt governments in the world  You can have two companies working there  one can be very successful  the other a total failure  It all has to do with their understanding of the local politics  Philippine Metals now has  0 04 share in cash  I bought shares this week at  0 02 share  You cannot go wrong buying  1 bills for  0 50  TGR  Is the company moving forward at all  BM  I m told yes  But if it disappears into Junior Stock Heaven  I lose  0 02  if lightning strikes and it hits something  maybe I make some money  TGR  Would you consider Comstock Mining Inc   LODE NYSE MKT  a zombie stock  It was beaten down and now seems to be coming back  BM  When the Comstock Lode was active in the 19th century  it produced 8 Moz gold and 299 Moz silver  Because of the ratio of silver to gold  it was considered a silver district originally  Based on today s ratio of silver to gold it would be considered a gold district  This stock has had some pretty high ranges  In 2010 it was  2 20 share  went up to  4 40 share and by May 2012 had drifted down to  1 60 share  The company has seven miles of the Comstock Lode a lot of gold and silver  Its success will depend on how good management is and how fast it can increase production  I was there for its first gold silver pour not long ago  The company estimates production of 20 000 oz gold this year  which is not a lot  but Comstock will be producing a lot more in the future  There is some local opposition to the mine  which seems crazy to me  The only decent paying jobs in Nevada are mining  Comstock will be increasing production  99  of its drill holes are hitting ore grade material and someday the fools in Nevada will start realizing that riches don t come from a government unemployment check  TGR  What about Tembo Gold Corp   TEM TSX V  TBGPF OTCQX  or Argentex Mining Corporation  ATX TSX V  AGXMF OTCBB   BM  Tembo and Argentex are both really good examples of zombie stocks  When I visited Argentex in Argentina three months ago  its stock has been beaten down to  0 25 share  I wrote about the company and its share price rose to  0 40 share  A delayed NI 43 101 report hurt the stock price for a while  If you like silver  you have to like Argentex  The company has some great silver projects  When I was there  it was developing ounces for  0 06 oz  The stock is cheap now  but not for long  Tembo has excellent management  The company raised a lot of money and put it into the ground  It was getting great intercepts on its projects in Tanzania  Then  what happened to Canaco dragged Tembo down  Tembo should be a  3 4 share stock right now  but it is  0 47 share  This has nothing to do with management or the market  It is suffering from what happened to Canaco  TGR  It seems that when something happens anywhere in Africa  all of the African stocks get smacked  That makes no more sense than smacking down a stock in Ontario when something happens in Mexico  BM  That is absolutely true  Some of the most profitable African mines are in Tanzania  If you cannot make a mine out of a great resource there  management should be run out of town on a rail after being tarred and feathered  TGR  I think it s time to leave the zombies to their unholy slumber and talk about some other companies that pass your litmus test  BM  The companies I like the best are those that take care of their shareholders  companies where 100  of the shareholders make money  I like Novo Resources Corp   NVO CNSX  NSRPF OTCQX   which is run by Quinton Hennigh  I visited Australia with Quinton and saw the best deposit I have ever seen  It has taken the company three years to assemble the project  but it has come together  Shares were  0 40 three months ago  now the share price is  0 88  TGR  I thought Quinton Hennigh was working with Brent Cook  Is Novo his side gig  BM  Quinton has half a dozen gigs  He is the brains behind Evolving Gold Corp   EVG TSX  EVOGF OTCQX  EV7 FSE  and Gold Canyon Resources Inc   GCU TSX V   He helped out Prosperity Goldfields Corp   PPG TSX V   He has done a lot for EurOmax Resources Ltd   EOX TSX V  in Serbia and Bulgaria  But Novo Resources is his baby  He wanted to keep it quiet until it was done  He did the deal with Mark Creasy in August  I wrote about it and shares more than doubled  Virtually all of the shareholders have made money  Quinton is proving up 3 oz gold per square meter  Now  1 square kilometer is 1M square meters  that would be 3 Moz  This is an extraordinary deposit with unlimited potential  Plus  the stock is very cheap and nobody knows about it  The project is in the Pilbara region of northwestern Australia  a region known for its iron deposits  Those iron deposits precipitated out of salt water 3 billion years ago when oxygen started being formed by algae  The funny thing is that same sort of precipitation is the source for gold deposits worldwide  yet it s not understood  Gold did not all come from deep in the earth  it came from salt water and fresh water that was a lot more acidic than it is now  Way back then  water contained thousands of times more gold than it does today  As the chemistry of the water changed  its ability to contain gold changed and the gold precipitated out  According to this precipitation theory  there probably is a lot more gold around than we think  However  you need to approach it the way you would a coal bed methane  potash or coal deposit  You need to think about a sedimentary basin with gold being in conglomerates  That is what Quinton has come up with  multigram gold in 10   20  and 30 meter intercepts  He is adding lots of ounces in a hurry  TGR  We are close to the end of a year during which the gold price has held steady  What do you see for the rest of the year  BM  The prices of gold and silver have held up very well  We have come out of a minor correction with real nice prices for the juniors  I think this is the buying

204507,426023,M,Greg McCoach  Mining Stocks Are About Location  Location  Location,opinion,The looming financial meltdown will affect the global economy and the U S  will not escape  says Greg McCoach  Whatever happens  the precious metals are bound to fly  as investors scramble for tangible cover  Mining stocks will be major beneficiaries of the soaring metals prices  but where mines are situated will be an important factor as governments try to get a bigger piece of the action  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  McCoach names some favorite companies that he expects to do well in the coming turbulent times  The Gold Report  When we last spoke in February  you were predicting a new round of quantitative easing  QE   which we ve been seeing the last few weeks  Where do you think this is all going to end up  Greg McCoach  The latest QE3 is open ended  allowing the Federal Reserve to create money every month  indefinitely  QE3 was announced just a few weeks ago and already there is talk about QE4  So  in my opinion  this is the death spiral of the U S  dollar  The same thing is going on in Europe and Japan  It s very troubling and  in my opinion  totally unsustainable  But  trying to predict a timeline for the ultimate demise is almost impossible  This stuff could last another couple of years  Adding in the derivative problems on top of all this debt  it s just sheer insanity  So  where is gold going  It s going way higher because this is the ultimate dynamic that will guide the investment world for the coming years  TGR  Is there any realistic solution  or are they just getting us deeper into the hole  and ultimately everything is just going to cave in on top of us  GM  The days of being able to fix this are long past  I had a chance conversation with a U S  senator and  when I asked him about the debts and deficit spending  he admitted that everybody in Washington and New York knows that there s no possible way to pay this back  So  essentially all the politicians are hoping it doesn t blow up on their watch  I m a student of history  which shows that no government that has taken on a fiat currency has gotten past the 41 year mark before it ended in inflationary panic and disaster  The U S  dollar is now going into its 42nd year as a fiat currency and breaking the record  We re right on the cusp of what history says is totally unsustainable and will eventually collapse  Then there is the derivative problem on top of the debt  There s no historical record of derivatives because they were created in the 1980s for large financial institutions to manage big risks  Unfortunately  the greed in the system overtook them  with everyone trying to make incredibly large returns  Now we have the derivative liability tracking through the world system  TGR  Hardly anyone is even talking or worrying about derivatives at this time  GM  Derivatives are the gigantic pink elephant in the room that no one wants to admit is there  As an example  the sovereign debt of Europe is  70 trillion  The derivative liability  that means the unsecured liability that s associated with that debt  exceeds  700 trillion  It s a ridiculous number  When we re talking about trillion dollar deficits and derivative problems in the hundreds of trillions  it just shows that there s no possible way this can be fixed  TGR  Another thing that is looming is the fiscal cliff that we ll face in a few months  What do you think will happen there  GM  I think the pressure on Congress to do something is critical    a very bright economist who writes a newsletter  recently spoke at a conference I attended  He stated that if the U S  Congress doesn t deal with the deficit problem in the first six months of next year  it s over  He said he would go from being an optimist about America to becoming a pessimist and that we ll go into this death spiral  as he refers to it  of not being able to pay our debt or interest on it  But  he believes that Congress is going to do something  I m very pessimistic about that  though I m more of a pragmatic optimist  I don t see how Republicans and Democrats  who are so deeply divided  can handle the amount of deficit spending that would have to be cut out of the budget and how badly taxes would need to be raised just to try to have a chance of warding off what s coming  The chances of that happening  in my opinion  are zero  So  the fiscal cliff is coming  He and I believe that if we re going to do the right thing  we have to go far beyond what the fiscal cliff is talking about  The way it s set up right now  only about 5  will be cut from spending next year  That s nothing  We have to do far more than that  Everybody s going to have to pay more taxes and government spending will have to be drastically reduced  or we go into the death spiral  That ll be very good for precious metals  prices  but it s a very sad commentary on where we ll be in this world  TGR  Do you think the recent prediction by Merrill Lynch for  2 400 ounce  oz  gold by 2014 indicates that the investment establishment is starting to see the light and realizes the dire situation  and that gold is going to have to go higher  GM  The mainstream media  which has always been slanted against gold  is starting to acknowledge this  For them to make a positive comment about gold is really just a fraction of what s probably coming  At some point I know gold and silver prices are going to go way higher than where they are now  When I tell people that they should be buying precious metals  they say   Isn t the price too high   No  it s dirt cheap compared to where it s going  After the elections  I think we ll see gold and silver prices press for a new high  As currencies eventually collapse  it s going to affect the whole world  and metals prices are going to go parabolic  People are always trying to guess how high that could be  The only justifiable rationale that I can give is to take how many ounces exist in the world aboveground today compared to how much fiat currency exists worldwide  and how many ounces of gold would be required to cover all that paper money  Well  my calculation comes out to about  19 750 oz  and that s probably conservative  I think gold could hit at least that number when it goes parabolic  based on all the emotional craziness that would be going on at that point  The rush into precious metals would be one for the record books  You would have oceans of fiat money that were suddenly trying to find some form of safety  Gold  which has always been the safe haven asset  is a tiny little market and couldn t receive it  That s why it will drive these prices into the stratosphere  I can t tell you when all this is going to happen and I could be wrong  but the precious metals bull market could continue for quite some time before we get to those parabolic moves  We might be at the end of that cycle right now and precious metals prices could start to go parabolic within the next few months or year  TGR  So  when do you think the mining stocks are going to start benefiting from the higher metals prices and where should they be going  GM  There s been a real disconnect  The high gold and silver prices have enabled producing mining companies to make money hand over fist  but their lack of market performance relative to metal prices has been troublesome  In the nearly 14 years I ve been doing this  I can t remember a more difficult period for the junior mining stocks than the last few years  In August and September  the volume on the Toronto Stock Exchange started doubling and things were looking really good  I was expecting a favorable recovery this fall with higher metals prices  but our mining stocks are still really fragile  maybe because of the election  TGR  There have been some setbacks recently with geopolitical issues affecting mining companies in certain areas  How is this influencing your investment recommendations and where should investors be focusing or avoiding at this time  GM  It s becoming more and more complicated  Some governments around the world are acting like extortionists  They see a profitable mining company in their country and say   We own your asset now  goodbye and good luck   This is a nightmare for investors  More and more countries are getting greedy and not wanting to allow mining in their countries unless they get an unfair portion of the profit  or they re just outright nationalizing these mines  That trend is definitely on the rise  What that means for junior mining stock investors is that we have to focus on the best areas of the best jurisdictions that have existing and rational mining laws  That was the topic of my talk at the Toronto Cambridge House Investment Conference  I think it s so important that I wanted to highlight this issue and show people just how critical it is to invest in the right areas of the best jurisdictions  I m not just talking about the best countries  but the best areas within those countries or jurisdictions  TGR  Do you want to talk about some of the companies that you like  GM  I divide my recommendations into exploration  development  production and permitting situations  In the first eight years  we had great success with exploration stories and a few development stories  Now I m more oriented toward a combination in the portfolio  but looking more at companies that have cash flow  Because of the volatile nature of our markets  I m looking at companies that can still deliver a big upside  yet have cash flow so they don t have to be constantly going back to the market to do financings  which dilutes current shareholders  I like a company called SilverCrest Mines Inc   SVL TSX V  SVLC NYSE MKT   located in one of the best areas of Mexico  There are certain areas of Mexico I don t like  but this is in a good area  The company is currently working through all the startup bugs  but it s banking money hand over fist  with over  35 million  M  cash and growing every month  It s using that cash flow to find more ounces around its mine site  SilverCrest also made a new discovery in another location in Mexico that s looking very promising  The stock price was around  1 65 share over the summer and it s at  2 39 share now  That shows it s in a quality mining spot and is a company to watch  I think the stock will break out to a new all time high along with silver prices  That should take SilverCrest to a  6 8 share buyout by a midtier company  I m very bullish on SilverCrest right now  TGR  How about other ones in Mexico or South America  GM  Orko Silver Corp   OK TSX V  is still looking very good  It has decent share structure with an NI 43 101 compliant resource in a very good part of Mexico and a new super pit design with quite a silver asset that s economic  I think Orko will be taken out as well  In South America  on the exploration side  I like a company called Tinka Resources Ltd   TK TSX V  TLD FSE  TKRFF OTCPK   which is currently drilling some very large  very high grade base metal anomalies  silver  lead and zinc  Originally  the company had 20 million ounces  Moz  silver in an NI 43 101 compliant resource that it has built further  In addition  it has found some other very high grade lead and zinc resources  We re hoping that this drilling really breaks open the understanding of these areas  This is on a major trend in central Peru going down into Chile that is known to host large volcanic massive sulfide  VMS  deposits  which are known to be very high grade and highly profitable  I ve been following the story for quite some time and I like what I m seeing there  Drilling is currently underway and it should get some assays that could really move this story forward  Tinka is one to watch right now  TGR  OK  Any other ones there  GM  I m going to be taking a trip to South America this winter to look around at some new projects  There are so many areas that I need to check out  If I really like something on paper  I try to visit the site before I make a recommendation  Once you get on site  there are always a lot of new questions that you didn t realize you needed to ask when you saw everything on paper  So  it s very important to do these site visits  I really like Chile as a country that s moving toward liberty and freedom  Mining law is well established in Chile  I think that s a good area for investors to look at  Chile has some very big deposits of copper and gold  I like central and southern Peru because the local people know mining and the mining law in those areas is very well established  That compares to northern Peru  where nationalization is going on  Just because I like a country doesn t mean I like all areas of that country  I like the Yukon where there are going to be a lot of big gold  silver and base metal discoveries  Right now we re focused on the White Gold camp and what ATAC Resources Ltd   ATC TSX V  is doing  The White Gold camp is going to have a lot of big new gold discoveries in the coming years  It will take time and there are infrastructure issues  Investors need to be patient  It s going to take a lot of money because the lack of infrastructure makes for very expensive exploration  There is no problem getting permits and building mines  but you can t get to them very easily and that gets very costly  For a junior mining company with no cash flow  that means you have to keep going back to the trough to raise money  If you don t hit early on  it can get painful for the investor  TGR  So  what other companies do you like in Canada  GM  I like Ethos Gold Corp   ECC TSX V  ETHOF OTCQX   It hit high grade narrow vein gold drilling this summer  but it was not the bulk tonnage targets it would like  It only drilled 60 holes  Kaminak Gold Corp   KAM TSX V   which I also like  has had great success up there and drilled over 400 holes this summer  I also like a new discovery up there called Comstock Metals Ltd   CSL TSX V   still in very early days  I think there are a lot of things that could happen in the Yukon  but it s going to take time  TGR  Any thoughts on Explor Resources Inc   EXS TSX V  EXSFF OTCQX   GM  Explor Resources is a company that s in a great area  All the infrastructure is right there  It got a lot of attention over the last three years from investors and mining companies  Expectations were high to find a big high grade gold deposit  So far  it s hit on a lot of very expensive deep drill holes  For a junior mining company without a deep pocket partner  this has gotten very expensive  Lately the company has had some of its best drill results  It hit 35 meters of 8 grams ton gold  which is very good  Had it hit that years ago  when it only had 65 or 85M shares outstanding  it would ve been a multi dollar stock  Now  in this tough market  we have these great drill results but there are 160M shares out and it needs more money again  Timing is everything in these deals  I do think Explor will do well because it will be coming out in late November or early December with around a 1 5 Moz NI 43 101 resource calculation  which should be a bankable asset  The rest of the assays on further drilling will be coming out later this fall and will be calculated in another NI 43 101 resource sometime in April May 2013  I think that will be around 2 2 Moz  That s a significant resource and the majors have to pay attention because it s located just 10 15 minutes outside of Timmins  in an area with infrastructure  that doesn t cost a lot to build a mine and has no permitting issues  I do think that  ultimately  Explor will perform well  The stock is around  0 15 share today  after hitting a low of  0 12 share during the summer  As these NI 43 101 numbers come out  this stock will get back to a more respectable level and eventually will be joint ventured or possibly taken out by a bigger entity  TGR  Definitely one to keep an eye on  So  are there any other ones you want to mention  GM  Up in the Northwest Territories  Canadian Zinc Corporation  CZN TSX  CZICF OTCQB  has a mine that was built by the Hunt brothers in the late 1980s  with very high grades but not a lot of infrastructure  It looks like it s getting a permit right now  If that comes through  I think the stock revalues from  0 39 share currently  to more like  2 3 share  Then it s a development story with about a year and a half to two years to production  Sprott Asset Management is one of the biggest shareholders  If you believe that silver prices are going higher  here s an operational mine that could be in production with very high grade ore by 2014 or 2015  So  I like that one as well  TGR  What should people be doing now to protect themselves and profit from what you expect is ahead  GM  If you want to make money and not lose money  number one  you have to get out of U S  dollars  If you hold U S  dollars in a U S  bank account  work for U S  dollars at your job  or you re hoping to retire in U S  dollars  you re going to be in trouble  This is what s coming  This deficit issue is beyond sustainable  At some point it means collapse and devaluation of our currency  TGR  We ve never had it in this country  so that would be a real shock to people  GM  A big shock  The only way to protect yourself  that I see  is to own physical gold and silver as the ultimate form of money  and take possession of precious metals  whether it s American Eagles or Silver Eagles for Americans or Canadian Maple Leaf coins for Canadians  Don t let other people store them for you or get involved with certificates  pooled accounts or ETFs  because they only have to keep a small percentage of the actual money they receive in the metal that they say they re buying for you  When these metal prices go parabolic  how can they deliver to you if they don t own the actual metals  That s going to be a big surprise to people  On top of that you ve got to own the precious metal mining stocks  with their big upside leverage potential  Aside from that  my subscribers know that I m very oriented toward preparedness  Get some food storage together  Our system works on a just in time three day inventory system  If  for whatever reason  there s a disturbance to that three day delivery system  the shelves are empty  Get some canned goods and freeze dried foods that last for a long time  It s just a smart way to look at life  regardless of how you feel  On a positive note  once we learn our lesson and the people keep the politicians accountable and don t let them abuse a fiat currency as we have the last 40 years  I do believe that good things can happen again with a new age of prosperity that has never been seen in this world  So  that s my positive note  after talking about the difficult times we ll have to get through first  TGR  We appreciate your thoughts today  Greg  and the next time we talk  we ll know a lot more about how all this has turned out  GM  Glad to be with you   is an entrepreneur who has successfully started and run several businesses in the past 23 years  For the last nine years  he has been

204508,426024,M,The Ineffectiveness Of Quantitative Easing,opinion,We have spent a great deal of time analyzing the impact of quantitative easing  QE  during the last two years  Although the strategy employed by the Federal Reserve has been successful in inflating risk assets such as stocks  there has been no meaningful impact on structural economic growth  In their latest   economists Van Hoisington and Lacy Hunt outline the ineffectiveness of the current QE strategy in detail Growth Recession Entering the final quarter of the year  domestic and global economic conditions are extremely fragile  Across the globe  countries are in outright recession  and in some instances where aggregate growth is holding above the zero line  manufacturing sectors are contracting  The only issue left to determine is the degree of the downturn underway  International trade is declining  so weaknesses in different parts of the world are reinforcing domestic deteriorations in economies continents away  With this global slump at hand  a highly relevant question is whether the U S  can escape a severe recession in light of the following the U S  manufacturing sector that paced domestic economic growth over the past three years has lapsed into recession real income and the personal saving rate have been slumping in the face of an interim upturn in inflation  andaggregate over indebtedness  which is the dominant negative force in the economy  has continued to move upward in concert with flagging economic activity New government initiatives have been announced  particularly by central banks  in an attempt to counteract deteriorating economic conditions  These latest programs in the U S  and Europe are similar to previous efforts  While prices for risk assets have improved  governments have not been able to address underlying debt imbalances  Thus  nothing suggests that these latest actions do anything to change the extreme over indebtedness of major global economies  To avoid recession in the U S   the Federal Reserve embarked on open ended quantitative easing  QE3   Importantly  the enactment of QE3 is a tacit admission by the Fed that earlier efforts failed  but this action will also fail to bring about stronger economic growth  Commodity Market Reactions Commodity markets have risen in reaction to the Federal Reserve s liquidity injections into the banking sector  Table 1   From the time the press reported that the Fed was moving toward QE1   QE2 commodity prices surged  During QE1   QE2 wholesale gasoline prices jumped 30  and 37   respectively  and the Goldman Sachs Commodity Food Index  GSCI Food  rose 7  and 22   respectively  From the time the press reported that the Fed was moving toward QE3  both gasoline and the GSCI Food index jumped by 19   through the end of the third quarter  Two theoretical considerations account for the rise in commodity prices during QE3  The first is the expectations effect  When the Fed says they want higher inflation  the initial reaction of the markets is to  go with   rather than fight the Fed  The second linkage  which is the expanded availability of funds used for collateral  margin   was identified and subsequently confirmed by Newedge economist  Dr  Rod McKnew  who stated In a world of advanced derivatives  high cash balances are not required to take speculative positions  All that is required is that margin requirements be satisfied  Thus  when the Fed massively expanded reserve balances in QE1 and QE2  margin risk was minimized for those market participants who wished to take positions consistent with the Fed s goal of higher inflation  and who had either direct or indirect access to the Fed s hugely inflated reserve balances  The April 22  2011 issue of Grant s Interest Rate Observer documented support for McKnew s insight  They asked Darrell Duffie  the Dean Witter Distinguished Professor of Finance at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University  whether excess reserves could serve as collateral for futures and derivatives transactions  Dr  Duffie s answer was  acceptable collateral is a matter of private contract  but reserve deposits are virtually always acceptable  Devastation For HouseholdsThe unintended consequence of these Federal Reserve actions  however  is to actually slow economic activity  The CPI rose significantly in QE1 and QE2  Chart 1   These price increases had a devastating effect on worker s incomes  Chart 2   Wages did not immediately respond to commodity price changes  therefore  there was an approximate 3  decline in real average hourly earnings in both instances  It is true that stock prices also rose along with commodity prices  S P plus 36  and 24   respectively  in QE1 and QE2   However  median households hold a small portion of equities  and thus received minimal wealth benefit  Wealth Effect Despite the miserable economic results in QE1 and QE2  we now have QE3  Fed Chair Ben Bernanke and other Fed advocates believe the  wealth effect  of QE3 will bring life to the economy  The economics profession has explored this issue in detail  Sydney Ludvigson and Charles Steindel in How Important is the Stock Market Effect on Consumption in the FRBNY Economic Policy Review  July 1999 write   We find  as expected  a positive connection between aggregate wealth changes and aggregate spending  Spending growth in recent years has surely been augmented by market gains  but the effect is found to be rather unstable and hard to pin down  The contemporaneous response of consumption growth to an unexpected change in wealth is uncertain  and the response appears very short lived   More recently  David Backus  economic professor at New York University found that the wealth effect is not observable  at least for changes in home or equity wealth  A 2011 study in Applied Economic Letters entitled  Financial Wealth Effect  Evidence from Threshold Estimation by Sherif Khalifa  Ousmane Seck and Elwin Tobing found  a threshold income level of almost  130 000  below which the financial wealth effect is insignificant  and above which the effect is 0 004   This means a  1 rise in wealth would  in time  boost consumption by less than one half penny  These three studies show that the impact of wealth on spending is miniscule    indeed   nearly not observable   How the Fed expects the U S  to gain any economic traction from higher stock prices when rising commodity prices are curtailing real income and spending is puzzling  This is particularly relevant when econometricians have estimated that for every dollar of gained real income  consumption will rise by about 70 cents  Conversely  the Fed actions are causing real incomes to decline  which has a 70 cent negative impact on spending for every dollar loss  Compare that with the 0 004 positive impact on spending for every one dollar increase in wealth  Former Fed Chairman  Paul Volcker  summarized the new Fed initiative as sufficiently and succinctly as anyone when he stated that another round of QE3  is understandable  but it will fail to fix the problem   An International Corollary The unintended consequences of QE3 could also serve to worsen and undermine global economic conditions already under considerable duress  When the Fed actions lead to higher food and fuel prices  the shock wave reverberates around the world  with many foreign economies being hit adversely  When prices of basic necessities rise  the greatest burden is on those with the lowest incomes since more of their budget is allocated to the basic necessities such as food and fuel  Thus  a jump in daily essentials has a more profound negative impact on living standards in economies with lower levels of real per capita income  Can The Fed Create Demand  Can all the trillions of dollars of reserves being added to the banking system move the economy forward enough to eventually create a higher level of aggregate spending  Our analysis of the aggregate demand curve and its determinants indicate they cannot  The question is whether monetary actions can shift this aggregate demand  AD  curve out to the right from AD0 to AD1  Chart 3   If this were possible  then indeed the economy would shift to a higher level of prices and real GDP   The AD curve is equal to planned expenditures for nominal GDP since every point on the curve is equal to the aggregate price level  measured on the vertical axis of the graph   multiplied by real GDP  measured on the horizontal axis of the graph   We know that GDP is equal to money times its turnover or velocity  which is called the equation of exchange as developed by Irving Fisher  Nominal GDP   M V   Deconstructing this formula  M  or M2  is comprised of the monetary base  currency plus reserves  times the money multiplier  m   The Federal Reserve has control over the monetary base since its balance sheet is the dominant component of the monetary base  However  the Fed does not directly control the money supply  The decisions of the depository institutions and the non bank public determine the money multiplier  m   M2 thus equals the monetary base multiplied by the money multiplier  The monetary base  also referred to as high powered money  has exploded from  800 billion in 2008  to  2 6 trillion currently  but the money multiplier has collapsed from 9 3 to 3 9  Chart 4   Therefore  the money supply has risen significantly less than the increase in the Fed s balance sheet  with the result that neither rapid gains in real GDP nor inflation were achieved  Indeed  with the exception of transitory episodes  inflation remains subdued and the gain in GDP in the three years of this expansion was the worst of any recovery period since World War II  The other element that is required for the Fed to shift the aggregate demand curve outward is the velocity or turnover of money over which they also have no control  During all of the Fed actions since 2008 the velocity of money has plummeted and now stands at a five decade low  Chart 5   The consequence of the Fed s lack of control over the money multiplier and velocity is apparent  The monetary base has surged 3 3 times in size since QE1  Nominal GDP  however  has grown only at an annual rate of 3   This suggests they have not been able to shift the aggregate demand curve outward  Nor  with these constraints  will they be any more successful in shifting that curve under the present open ended QE3  Increased aggregate demand and thus rising inflation is not on the horizon Treasury Bonds As commodity prices rose initially in all the QE programs  long term Treasury bond yields also increased  However  those higher yields eventually reversed and generally continued to ratchet downward  reaching near record lows  The current Fed actions may be politically necessary due to numerous demands for them to act to improve the clearly depressed state of economic conditions  However  these policies will prove to be unproductive  Economic fundamentals will not improve until the extreme over indebtedness of the U S  economy is addressed  and this is in the realm of fiscal  not monetary policy  It would be more beneficial for the Fed to sit on the sidelines and try to put pressure on the fiscal authorities to take badly needed actions rather than do additional harm  Until the excessive debt issues are addressed  the multiyear trend in inflation  and thus the long Treasury bond yields will remain downward  Appendix One of the most important concepts in macroeconomics is aggregate demand  AD  and aggregate supply  AS  analysis   a highly attractive approach that is neither Keynesian  monetarist  Austrian  nor any other individual school  but can be used to illustrate all of their main propositions  However  before detailing the broader macroeconomics associated with the movement of the AD and AS curves  it is important to understand microeconomic supply and demand curves  This can best be illustrated through the recent impact the Fed s decisions had on commodity prices  In the commodity market  like individual markets in general  the demand curve is downward sloping  the supply curve is upward sloping  and where they intersect determines the price of the commodity and the quantity supplied demanded  The micro demand curve slopes downward because as the price of an item rises  the quantity demanded falls due to income and substitution effects  buyers can shift to a substitute product   The micro supply curve slopes upward since producers will sell more at higher prices than lower ones  Both supply and demand schedules are influenced by expectation  fundamental  and liquidity considerations  When the Fed says that they want faster inflation and that they are going to take steps to achieve this objective  both economic theory and historical experiences indicate that commodity prices will rise  at least transitorily  as seen with the surge in commodity prices after the announcement of QE1  QE2 and QE3   Information and liquidity available to the buyers is also available to the suppliers  so by saying faster inflation is ahead  suppliers are encouraged to reduce or withhold current production or inventories  moving the supply curve inward  Thus  in the commodity market  the Fed action spurs an outward shift in the micro demand curve along with an inward shift of the micro supply curve  producing higher prices and lower quantities  These microeconomic developments transmit to the broader economy  which we will now trace through AD and AS curves  The AD curve slopes downward and indicates the amount of real GDP that would be purchased at each aggregate price level  Chart 6   Aggregate demand varies inversely with the price level  so if the price level moves upward from P0 to P1  real GDP declines from Y0 to Y1  When the price level rises  real wages  real money balances and net exports worsen  thereby reducing real GDP  The rationale for the downward sloping AD curve is thus quite different from the sloping of the micro demand curve since substitution effects are not possible when dealing with aggregate prices  In order to improve real GDP with a rising price level  the AD curve would need to be shifted outward and to the right  from AD0 to AD1   And as detailed in the letter  the Fed is not capable of shifting the entire AD curve  The AS curve slopes upward and indicates the quantity of GDP supplied at various price levels  The positive correlation between price and output in micro and macroeconomics is the same since the AS curve is the sum of all supply curves across all individual markets  When Fed policy announcements shock commodity markets  the AS curve shifts inward and to the left  from AS0 to AS1   This immediately causes a reduction in real GDP  the difference between Y0 and Y1  as the price increases by the difference between P0 and P1  also Chart 6   Furthermore  as discussed in the letter  lower GDP as a result of higher prices reduces the demand for labor and widens the output gap  setting in motion a negative spiral  For Fed policy to improve real GDP  actions must be taken that either  1  shift the entire demand curve outward  to the right   or  2  do not cause an inward shift of the AS curve that induces an adverse movement along the AD curve  Accordingly  the Fed is without options to improve the pace of economic activity  Although the data clearly indicate that QE is failing to meaningful address the current impediments to structural economic growth  proponents of the Federal Reserve strategy continue to suggest that a rising stock market is evidence of its success  Unfortunately  equity gains fueled primarily by monetary stimulus are nearly always unsustainable and the forthcoming cyclical bear market will likely erase most of them  Until we address the excessive public and private debt that is currently restraining our economy  the next structural growth cycle cannot begin  Although the recent gains in risk assets fueled by QE feel good on the surface over the short term  these programs are creating massive imbalances that will almost certainly engender severe economic disruptions later this decade ,2012-10-19,Erik McCurdy,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-ineffectiveness-of-quantitative-easing-140468,140468
204517,426033,M,How Investors Can Protect Themselves In A Politicized Economy,opinion,Right on the heels of the Republican and Democratic National Conventions  the recent Casey Research Summit in Carlsbad  California cosponsored by SprottGlobal focused on a timely theme   Navigating the Politicized Economy   The somber revelations of the summit contrasted with the buzz of the party conventions  The Gold Report sat down with Louis James  Casey Research s chief metals and mining investment strategist  Rick Rule  founder of Global Resource Investments  and Marin Katusa  Casey Research s chief energy investment strategist  to discuss how investors can position themselves in a politically driven economy  The Gold Report  Before we get into some of the nitty gritty from the summit  could you give us a big picture of the troubled economic waters we ll have to navigate if we want to stay afloat  Louis James  When we said  Navigating the Politicized Economy   we weren t just talking about regulatory burdens but also about the overall response of governments around the world to the crisis that we ve been calling for many years  That s the context  It s about how the world is responding to crisis  The response is political and very feelings driven  It s not a rational or scientific way of optimizing outcomes  It s political  which means pandering to voters  which means doing whatever the larger number of usually less informed people want as opposed to whatever science or engineering may determine is an ideal way to approach the issue  That s scary  How you deal with that is more of a philosophical than an engineering question  how do you personally plan your life  given a world in which everything is more political every day  I think everybody should be asking that question  TGR  The Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs reports certainly always have political implications  and the news for August wasn t good  The 96 000 jobs added were well down from 141 000 in July and not nearly enough to keep pace with population growth  The unemployment rate fell somewhat  but only because more than half a million people quit looking for work and are no longer counted in the tally  Is the dismal jobs report what prompted the gold price to jump up to  1 740 ounce  oz   The daily headlines coming from Europe  Or do you suppose gold s found a new bottom  LJ  It s not just the jobs report and other economic indicators that affect the market and the prices of gold and silver  In today s market  it s the way they relate to the probability of more quantitative easing  QE   It s the mounting pressure for the Fed to do something  People watching this are saying it s likely the Fed will inject more liquidity  which would be bullish for commodities and particularly bullish for precious metals  But if the Fed doesn t do what s expected  those gains could reverse quickly  Ultimately  over the long term  we think inflation always wins  The government is between the rock and the hard place  Inflation is the easiest way out  People who think Republicans will embrace great fiscal discipline and put the economy back in a belt tightening mode and build savings for the future and real capital accumulation for investing they re dreaming  It s not going to happen  Long term  we remain extremely bullish for all commodities  particularly the precious metals but near term  things can vacillate and fluctuate quite a bit  If for whatever political reasons the Feds don t announce what people are speculating about  it could be bad  On the other hand  with a formal announcement about hundreds of billions of dollars of QE  the next uptick would dwarf the recent rise and could easily take us to new highs  It s important to think long term  But as speculators  we re aware that in the short term  we seem to be coming out of a correction  If I had to go out on a limb  I d say we probably have seen the bottom and we probably will see the QE  I don t know that I d push all my chips to the center of the table  but I certainly wouldn t want to be out of the market at this time   NOTE  The Fed did act as expected it s now a fait accompli       TGR  Do you agree  Rick  Rick Rule  Basically  I do  As we learned in Lacy Hunt s and Eric Sprott s fine presentations at the summit  the total unfunded liabilities on the U S  balance sheet are somewhere between  85 trillion  T  and  200T  and growing by about  1T year on an on balance sheet basis  and  8 billion  B  year on an off balance sheet basis  Gold and silver traditionally do well during periods of instability  turmoil and fear  I suspect that the political debate in the U S  for the last few weeks has provoked some measure of fear in others  as it has in me  The specter of Obama vs  Romney feels bleak  so I understand the response of gold in that respect  Often overlooked is the fact that the opportunity cost associated with holding gold is very low now  In its war on savers and driving down interest rates  the government has cut the costs for people to hold gold  assuming they hold it on a leveraged basis  It also used to be a disincentive to holding gold because it didn t pay any interest  Well  nothing else pays interest now  either  So if you think about holding gold in the context of the opportunity cost  that cost has disappeared  I also think the recent spike in the gold price reflects the fact that some of the market has figured out that the government is trying to solve a solvency issue with liquidity  When one is deep in the hole  it s wise to stop digging  Also affecting the gold market is the realization that as weak as the U S  dollar is the joke is it s the worst currency in the world except all of the others it has no obvious competitor in terms of the world s reserve currency  Historically  of course  gold has been a store of value as well as a transfer mechanism  It s the only common payment mechanism in the world that isn t a promise to pay but rather constitutes payment itself  Marin Katusa  I don t know if I agree 100  with what Louis stated about having seen the bottom  I personally don t think we ve seen the lows yet  Many funds that carried the last leg of the bull market in juniors have blown up  Yes  the stocks gained recently  but volumes and dollar amounts are nowhere near where they were in mid 2010 to mid 2011  I believe we re in a  pick right  sit tight market   but not in the beginning of the next leg of a sector wide bull market  Tax gain selling season is looming  I don t think we ve seen the end of the deflation in resource equities  LJ  I m thinking about the gold juniors in particular  We have what appears to be this macroeconomic thing  the impending liquidity  which I think is very bullish  We ve also had some spectacular discoveries and  at last  some merger and acquisition  M A  activity that has generated real excitement  which has been absent from our sector for most of the year  That makes it feel bottom ish to me  Obviously  nobody knows  but I m willing to go out on a limb and say this looks to be a good time to buy  I understand the technicalities of what Marin is saying  but markets are rarely really about logic  They re very emotional  Momentum shouldn t play a role  but it does  To be clear  I m not saying the bottom is in for sure  but my gut sense is that July might have been it  There are bargains out there now and I would not want to miss them  So at the end of the day  I m agreeing with Marin  pick right  sit tight  Absolutely  But there s money out there that wants to be deployed  Some strong reactions we re seeing to good news from some companies show that there s money on the sidelines that s ready to come back into this sector  TGR  But are they pricing in the higher resource prices  LJ  I m not sure they are  because the companies also have higher operating expenses  In addition  the capital to build big  new projects is really difficult to come by these days  So there s good reason for anybody who s paying attention to look at and balance the good and the bad  RR  We represent the money on the sidelines  Sprott is sitting on about  700 million  M  in cash in permanent vehicles  looking to enter the market  In terms of the question of higher commodity prices  we need to remember the functional disconnect between the commodity prices and most juniors  Most juniors don t have gold  they re looking for it  If the price of something you don t have goes up  it shouldn t make any difference in your share price  although as Louis says  from a psychological point of view  it may affect perceptions  It s important to note  too  that the sector is undergoing a money shift  Institutional demand has driven the type of stock that was popular in the market  Fund managers were looking for leverage to gold  which led them to high up front capital costs  low margin gold deposits  The industry managed to lose a fortune on those deposits in the last 10 years  Having lost billions of dollars for their investors  many institutions now don t have much left to invest  The drivers that existed in the market for the last decade are gone  The people who have the money now are the industry itself  either raising money by way of equity or  in some cases  as a consequence of retained earnings or at least cash flow  Going forward  I expect financially accretive transactions rather than leverage to gold to drive the markets  In a great speech at the Melbourne Mining Club  Nick Holland  the CEO of Gold Fields Ltd   GFI NYSE   talked about the total cost of production in the industry  Including acquisition  the cost is much closer to  1 200 ounce  oz  than  600 oz  The industry usually talks about cash costs  which is totally illusory  It omits the general and administrative  G A  expense that goes into the mine  the upfront capital costs  the acquisition costs and  importantly  the  5B that the industry wrote off in the 1980s and 1990s  So  extrapolating from the true total cost of production  the number of junior properties worth acquiring acquisitions that would be accretive financially is very low  So while the M A activity that Louis talked about will surprise us in terms of premiums paid  it won t be as broadly spread as people might think  Maybe 30 or 35 properties are actually worth acquiring  and they will go at pretty prices  That s going to be very interesting  and stock selection absolutely will be the key  I anticipate a near term move in junior share prices as a consequence of the excitement we re seeing in the market  but I also expect the issuance of equity coming out of the junior sector to swamp any amount of demand possible  Given the current structure of the industry  the only limit to share issuances is the standing inventory of timber between Vancouver Island and Newfoundland These juniors are truly stunning in their ability to make paper  Some 4 000 companies in Canada are lurching toward extinction because they couldn t raise any money for the last two years  They re like a bunch of small governments  they ve spent and spent and spent money  but they didn t raise any  But in terms of linking any major movement in the junior market to a higher gold price  No chance  Paper covers rock  Remember that game  TGR  So no real upside  RR  Yes  there is  I see three pieces  We re already starting to see M A  with fancy prices paid  Secondly  Louis alluded to the discovery cycle we re in  The market rewards discoveries  In a terrible market  GoldQuest Mining Corp   GQC  goes from  0 06 to  1 60 share  Reservoir Minerals Inc   RMC  goes from  0 35 to  3 07 share  and Africa Oil Corp   AOI  goes from  0 80 to  10 share  We re 10 years and billions of dollars into this exploration cycle  There are some good discoveries  They ll make more discoveries  and the markets will reward them  We haven t talked about it much  but we re starting to see signs of a third thing  Sellers are exhausted  That the recent increases in share prices have been on stupidly low volumes suggests that the sellers are exhausted  In the names where there s really a reason for the market to go up  it will go up  The difficulty is that those reasons are scarce  Most of the speculators and I use that term guardedly have fallen  They have not and will not deliver a reason for higher share prices  They won t get rewarded  but the ones who do will truly surprise us  TGR  You said earlier you expect a lot of equities to be issued  But with the explorer market still at a low with no signs of a rebound despite the enthusiasm about gold  what causes you to foresee all this new paper coming out  LJ  When share prices are falling  the issuers say   Last week it was higher  I m not going to raise money now   To use one of Doug Casey s favorite terms  it s perverse psychology  People make their decisions based on what happened last week  not on what s going to happen  So  perversely  when the prices are falling  when they should be taking money while they can  the financings fall off  As Marin likes to say   Friend or foe  take the dough   MK  When the prices turn up again  if we re seeing a lot more positive psychology  everybody is going to try to finance  thinking   Oh  it s better than it was  We have to get money now while we can   RR  Managements get rational when their salaries are at risk  We re getting to the point now where finances are being stretched thinly enough that they see true fundamentals coming into play private school tuition going unpaid  the leased car getting towed  the country club dues delinquent  They wouldn t have sold at  0 25 share when it meant they had to lay off the receptionist  but they ll finance at a nickel if their wife s Jaguar is going to get towed from the Safeway parking lot  That s just the way it works  and we re getting close to that  If they have the opportunity to do it  if there suddenly is some measure of hope in the market  if it s possible to finance their nickel  and if doing so saves their salaries for a year  they ll do it  TGR  But if the institutions are out  as Marin has said  MK  I never said that they were out  What I m saying is we need a lot of new money to come into the junior sector to replace the invested dollars that have gone to money heaven  and new funds to replace the funds that have blown up  Some  like the fund I manage with Rick  have done very well  but at least with our cash  we re waiting  RR  Most of the traditional institutional investors in the gold sector are out of money  They need fresh new flows of investor capital  A move in the gold price to  1 800 oz might help with that  But certainly more direct in terms of the nickel and the dime issuances  Fidelity or BlackRock or Front Street weren t going to do those anyway  It would be the rank and file punters and speculative brokers  TGR  With another round of QE3 appearing imminent  with what s going on in Europe  with the recent jobs report  many people are speculating that the general market will climb at least until the elections  Would that bring money back in  Will punters come out with the rising tide  LJ  If more significant discovery news comes out and generates excitement at the same time  Metals and mining is a drop in the bucket in comparison to the oil business  It s a very small market  and the gold subsector of that is of course even smaller  As Rick likes to say  a little bit of hope goes a long way  and it does touch everybody  In the same way that a Bre X scandal can KO the entire industry  a Pretium Resources Inc   PVG  actually can uplift the industry again  because it s such a small industry  And yes  that can enable everybody to raise money  At times  all you need to raise money in our sector is a pulse  and sometimes not even that  At other times  nobody can raise money on any terms  TGR  Getting back to the navigating in a politicized world theme  is there an investment opportunity today  Is this the time  MK  It s always the time if you find the right companies  This is why I urge people to be very careful  patient and do their homework  The sector wide bull is not there  It s company specific  LJ  One more point  The speculative component goes away if the global economy visibly tanks or the wheels come off  So the near term certainly presents plenty of opportunity for lower prices  and this should be seen as a buying opportunity for the very best picks  TGR  Last time we talked  you said risk mitigation is the key to success  but in a risky market like this  how do you do that  MK  Many factors come into play  Louis and I have had the advantage of working very closely with and being mentored by both Doug Casey and Rick Rule  so I think the key thing is to first look at areas that interest you  At that point  determine your risk appetite as an individual investor and start doing your homework  It always starts with the people  That s the most important  P  of Casey Research s eight Ps of Resource Stock Evaluation  You also have to look at what type of investments a company is doing  its stage of development  financial metrics and so forth  Risk mitigation is complicated  but those are some quick and easy places to start  RR  Another thing that many people can do to mitigate risk is hire help  For instance  if you can have 40 people in the Casey organization working for you six or seven days a week  and you get that help for the price of a  1 000 subscription that you can leverage against a  1M portfolio  it s pretty stupid not to do it  Marin s point about people is key  These businesses are made by people  The deposit is important  but it isn t initially about the deposit  it s initially about the people  Another important factor in terms of specific company risk mitigation is balance sheets  When access to capital is uncertain  having capital is critical  In a capital intensive business  if you don t have any capital  you don t have any business  Then you get around to traditional securities analysis  You don t even necessarily have to get them right just closer to right than your competitors do  Risk mitigation requires only knowing more than the people you re bidding against in the market  TGR  But in any market you want to look at those sorts of things  Do you change how you invest in a volatile  risky market  RR  I do  Volatile markets are very good for me  I like to buy stuff when nobody else wants to buy it  In the 1990s  those swings sometimes took years  and now they sometimes take weeks  The idea that I get more frequent sales  in other words  there are more frequent panics  is not anathema to me  It s nice for me  If the market gives me the opportunity to buy something at a 50  discount to what I think it s worth  I m going to do it  As you get older  if you re successful  you learn that sometimes stuff is cheap enough  You don t wait for the absolute bottom  The fact that you get these opportunities more frequently is good  TGR  How about the sell side  RR  I ve also had to be a more frequent seller  It used to be that for successful positions my average holding was something like 70 months  In the last two or three years  I ve had situations in which every level of greed was fulfilled in three or four months  I guess that s wonderful  but certainly the volatility you talk about has changed my parameters  TGR  Do you invest differently when it s a volatile market  LJ  I d say that when the risk appetite in the market changes  it changes what kind of investments we recommend  Volatility is our friend for the reasons Rick outlined  If you want to shoot for the 50 baggers or 100 baggers  you re not going to get them on multibillion dollar companies  That means taking chances on a large number of earlier stage companies  But higher volatility generally means more risk aversion  Under those circumstances  we look for less risky plays  so a development story rather than a grassroots story because the trend is well established  The share price trend in development stage companies is well estabished  share prices spike on the discovery  decline during the  boring  engineering phase and then come up as the company ramps up to production  It s what Marin calls the pregnancy period  the nine months up until first pour  For whatever reason  it seems to work out that way so it s a very reliable trend  If you can find a company with no discovery risk  with all the technical risk addressed  with the right people and a real project that will become a mine  the chances are very high that its stock will go up when the mine goes into production  So we ll look for much lower risk investments of that nature when people are more risk averse  which tends to be when the market is more volatile  Logically  the math says  stick with the plan  if you broaden your buying out  you can capture spectacular wins  It doesn t take many 100 baggers to pay for all the ones that didn t work out  This is basically what Doug Casey does  but few people have that discipline to do that  so we tend to alter our recommendations when people are more risk averse  MK  A volatile market doesn t change the way we evaluate companies  It changes the way we execute on the information  TGR  Eric Sprott claims silver s the investment of the decade  To what extent have you rebalanced your recommendations toward silver  LJ  It s accidental  but if you look at our portfolio  you might think we agree 100  with Eric  we sure have a lot of silver plays  and almost all our producers are silver producers  There was a time  post 2008 crash  where I absolutely agreed with Eric s outlook on silver  Because silver has its industrial component as we all know it s a precious metal but it s also an industrial commodity that gets used up  unlike gold silver sold off much harder in 2008 than gold  The industrial component brought the metal down  which I saw as a great buying opportunity  But I consider that to have been event specific  Must the gold silver ratio go back to the historic 17 1  or whatever  No  I don t see any magic in these ratios  They don t have predictive power  Silver is not only an industrial metal as well as a precious metal  it s also a byproduct  Large copper mines produce significantly more silver than silver mines  and most silver mines are actually lead zinc mines with big silver credits  Thus  we ll have silver production whether or not there s silver demand  It s very different from the gold sector  with a very different risk reward proposition  TGR  What about cash  As investors  what percent do you recommend keeping in cash right now  LJ  Our general guidance is still one third gold  one third stocks that will do well in a crisis  and one third cash  We re keeping a lot of cash because we can t discount the possibility of another 2008 style crash  Doug thinks it will happen  It may not be as acute as 2008  but I think it will probably be longer and deeper  If we get stupid prices on great companies  we want to have cash for that  And until inflation really kicks in  cash is not a bad thing to have  RR  Functionally for me in the money I manage  10  cash is float  About my lowest allocation to cash is 10   And I m about 35   I would like to be more heavily invested now  I see more opportunity in the market  where I can be a private placement investor because I believe if one is a speculator  one has to get warrants  That s the way one operates in the market  I have been singularly unsuccessful at negotiating placements on acceptable prices and terms  As a consequence  my cash position has grown organically as opposed to strategically  I would like to be much more fully invested now than I am  I think market prices are reasonable  TGR  What do you think  Marin  MK  We ve closed out a lot of the big gains and now have fewer than 10 positions in the newsletter  I m looking to deploy the money and like Rick  I ve been unsuccessful on the terms  That s also why I think we re also going to go lower  Between March 2009 and March 2010  I did more than 75 private placements  They were on good terms with full three year warrants  but nowadays  because I can t get those attractive terms with companies that meet my criteria  I m just sitting on the sidelines  RR  These cash holdings aren t strategic for either one of us  We re not following any methodology that says you should be one third in cash  It s opportunistic  We don t have the opportunity in this market to deploy the cash despite the fact that the market has taken these companies  share prices down  So far  the management teams haven t been willing to accept placements on terms that we  as check writers  find realistic  MK  A strategic advantage of funds doing private placements is because most funds would move markets if they wanted to fill their desired position in a junior in the open market  So there is a lot of strategy plus the kicker of the full warrant  TGR  You ve often said  Marin  you have a program that does cash on hand versus market cap  MK  We call it the Casey Cash Box  TGR  Only a handful of companies had the cash on hand a couple years ago  Is the fact that there are substantially more of them now part of why you re unable to renegotiate  MK  No  It s a different sector in that half of the junior mining companies have less than  1M in the bank  It s a very different market today  but at the low of 2009  in March  we had about one third of all the companies on both the Toronto and Venture trading less than cash  which was close to 700 companies  Today we have just under 45  TGR  Does it depend on when the CEO s wife s Jag is being repossessed

204518,426034,M,Scotiabank Analyst Uncovers Mining Opportunities In Unusual Places,opinion,When Leily Omoumi  a gold analyst with Scotiabank in Toronto  turns her engineer s eye on a mining company  she can translate insight into profits for investors  The Gold Report caught up with Omoumi at the Denver Gold Forum for this exclusive interview  in which she discusses misunderstandings about Eastern European and West African mining companies and identifies opportunities in Canada and Armenia  The Gold Report  Leily  you are with Scotiabank in Toronto  but you re not originally from that area  Tell us about yourself  Leily Omoumi  I ve been living in Toronto for many years  I earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Toronto and worked as an engineer for Hatch Ltd  for about four years  Following that  I earned a master s degree in business administration at Rotman School of Management  I started working at Scotia immediately after  I have been covering gold stocks for a few years now  I cover gold stocks and one palladium name  North American Palladium Ltd   PDL TSX  PAL NYSE   TGR  There has been resurgence in the price of gold  which is now at more than  1 700 ounce  oz   While the price of gold has held up during the past several months  gold equities have languished through the summer  But equity prices have been rebounding in the last several weeks  What are your thoughts on that climb  LO  You are quite right  Even though the price of gold has held up  a lot of equities suffered earlier in the year  Capital blowup  cost escalation and inflation have hit several stocks  Many companies suffered as investors lost confidence in where costs were trending and development projects progressing  There has been a nice push to the gold price in the past couple of weeks  Some of the losses have been made up and the market is getting to levels similar to last year s  before stocks really went down  TGR  We are at the Denver Gold Forum  a great venue for a gathering of institutions  analysts and public companies  It feels like there is a little bit of optimism in the crowd  What do you think  LO  I agree  Investors have been sitting on the sidelines for quite a while and they re starting to step back in  In April  at the European Gold Forum in Zurich  the mood was very different more negative  People were watching from the sidelines and waiting to make a move  Investors have more optimism now  They are ready to step into names  primarily those that have free cash flow and are in production or are close to production  But many pre producers continue to be punished because of financing risk  Although the markets are doing better  confidence is not fully back  Even companies that have released decent feasibility or prefeasibility studies have not seen moves in their stock prices because of the financing risk  Companies frequently have initial capital requirements that are larger than the market cap of the company  It can take a long time for a company to finance a project in a scenario like that  Unfortunately in some cases  dilution becomes a significant factor  Pre producers have to wait for the right opportunity to raise money  They must do it in tranches  which can be a long process  They have a long road ahead  TGR  Unfortunately  a lot of those companies already have somewhat blown out stock structures  which further discourage them from doing equity financings because they don t want to dilute shareholders any further  They have to look at royalties and large debt financings  We are seeing a lot of creative financings  but we are also seeing some preproduction and development stories that are spectacular values for large caps  Do you agree  LO  Yes  Large cap companies are moving ahead very cautiously  however  They are being scrutinized by investors  too  so they are very careful about the investments they make  I agree that there is great value  The market just needs confidence  A couple of good merger and acquisition deals could potentially bring confidence back and encourage others to step in  There are a lot of good names out there  Two development stories that I like are Lydian International Ltd   LYD TSX  and Rainy River Resources Ltd   RR TSX V   I like Lydian because of the low initial capital intensity of its Amulsar project  It s a simple heap leach project with an initial capital cost of below  300 million  M   Operating costs are below  500 oz  It s a project that can be financed  TGR  Lydian isn t on a lot of people s radars because of its jurisdiction Armenia  It certainly is not Nevada or Ontario  Tell us about your comfort level with this company in terms of its location  LO  I have been to Armenia  Armenia  as you said  is not Nevada  A lot of people are unfamiliar with it  but it appears to be a pretty decent place for mining companies  For example  Dundee Precious Metals Inc   DPM TSX  has an operating mine there and other European and private mines operate there currently as well  The country has a modern mining concession law and is open for business  Lydian has not had too much difficulty advancing its permits  it s in the advanced permitting stage now  TGR  Lydian has drilled  and has an NI 43 101 compliant resource  What are the next steps  LO  Lydian released a full feasibility study the first week of September  Some of the numbers I mentioned are based on that prefeasibility study  The initial capital came in at around  270M and life of mine cash costs are about  470 oz  The project is expected to go into production in early to mid 2015  Aside from final permitting  the next big step for the Lydian team is financing  The company has to start placing orders for long lead time equipment early next year  TGR  Tell us about Rainy River in Ontario  LO  Rainy River is in a mining friendly jurisdiction that is familiar to investors  What I like about the Rainy River deposit is that it contains approximately 8 million ounces  Moz  of Measured  Indicated and Inferred resources  It has a lot of optionality  the company proved that with its updated PEA  which came out in late August  It initially expected to have a much larger operation  with about 32 000 tons per day  Kt day   Rainy River has since reduced the scale of the operation because of capital constraints  It is starting with a smaller operation  at 20 Kt day  The company has been able to push a lot of the higher grade ore ahead for the earlier years of production  That helps with the internal rate of return on the project  It now expects to process an average grade of 1 38 grams ton  g t  in the first five years  compared to previous numbers of about 1 g t  Over the first 10 years of operation grades are expected to average 1 45 g t this includes underground  TGR  Does Rainy River have a lot of exploration potential  Is there still a lot of blue sky  LO  Absolutely  It has district potential and there are a lot of targets that the company is still looking at  The underground potential is underexplored in my opinion  and the company is still drilling  Although there is an underground portion in the updated PEA  there is a lot more work to be done  Aside from that  the company is looking at regional targets  There is potential for other metals as well  For example  it is looking at some nickel bearing targets to the south of the current deposit  However  that s down the road and is not something the company is counting on right now  But blue sky is certainly there  TGR  This seems like a potential acquisition candidate based on its jurisdiction and improved grade  LO  Given its jurisdiction  the scale of the project  with life of mine production at more than 200 Koz  it could definitely move the needle for midsize to larger companies  If a major were to look at Rainy River  it would probably build the project differently  It might start with a larger scale right off the bat and increase production levels  A midtier company would potentially look at the project as outlined in the updated PEA  which is a smaller scale  Nonetheless  it s the type of project that can move the needle  It is in Ontario  It s not expected to have permitting issues  There is exploration potential  It s a good project all around  Additionally  I believe Lydian  which we spoke about earlier  could be a potential takeover target  Amulsar is a simple and manageable project and could fit nicely with midtier producers that have familiarity with the region  TGR  Let s move on to a producer that may not be on the radar of some investors  Dundee Precious Metals  Tell us about Dundee and why you like the story  LO  I like Dundee Precious Metals because it has production growth  it s a low cost producer and it has a pipeline of projects  Its largest operation is the Chelopech underground mine in Bulgaria  The company is currently expanding underground operations and we should see a step change in production next year  I expect production company wide to increase by about 20  in 2013 to over 170 Koz  I expect cash costs to be below  450 oz this year and next  What makes this story a little different is that the company also owns a smelter in Namibia  where the gold copper concentrate from Chelopech is processed  TGR  How does Dundee get the material from Bulgaria to Namibia  LO  The concentrate is transported to Bourgas  Bulgaria s largest port on the Black Sea  for sea shipment to Namibia  It is then transported by rail to the smelter from the Atlantic port of Walvis Bay  Tsumeb is one of only a few smelters in the world capable of treating arsenic bearing concentrates such as the one produced at Chelopech  It is a long way to go but when it comes down to it  Dundee is a company that is making money  Its development project in Bulgaria  Krumovgrad  is going through the permitting stages right now  We expect that to be in production in 2016  TGR  We have talked about the cautious optimism among institutions that might jump into mining equities or add them to their portfolios  Do you have any thoughts about what you see happening as we go into the fourth quarter of 2012  LO  I think optimism is starting to come back  but it is going to take a while  Third quarter  Q3 12  financial results should be decent  However  I cover some West African names  and Q3 12 could be relatively weak for some of those companies because of heavy rains that the region has been experiencing  Going forward  a lot of the midtier and large cap producers are expected to have a good Q4 12  Many have had heavy backend loaded years  The combination of optimism in the market  the stronger gold price and better results toward the end of the year is going to have an overall positive impact on the market and the inflow of funds to the sector  TGR  Some North American investors don t understand the potential in West Africa  Do you feel like West Africa C te d Ivoire  Burkina Faso  Ghana represents an opportunity in terms of mineral wealth and share price appreciation for juniors that are developing projects or producing there  Is it a misunderstood jurisdiction  LO  There is significant mineral potential in that part of the world  However  in certain countries  there are higher than average cash costs due to limitations with infrastructure and power costs  Political risk in some regions is the other issue to consider  There have been a number of blowups in West Africa politically  including in Mali and C te d Ivoire  That has drained some confidence and I don t see that changing quickly going forward  Companies with a lower risk profile in North America and parts of South America  and companies with access to good infrastructure and lower power costs  will trade at a higher premium  in my opinion  TGR  Are the political risks in West Africa higher than the risks in  for instance  regions surrounding Armenia or Bulgaria  LO  It is hard to generalize  because you have to look country by country  I think the perceived risk in West Africa is a little overblown  Companies even in Bulgaria have had permitting issues in the past  However  Bulgaria is pretty stable politically and has excellent infrastructure  I wouldn t necessarily compare Bulgaria to countries in West Africa  Ghana is an exception  It is a very stable country with a very established mining industry  TGR  Do you think West African countries get too much of a discount sometimes  LO  I don t necessarily disagree with that statement  Some investors are not familiar with countries in West Africa  They tend to put all of them in one basket  If something happens in Mali  shares of a company with an asset in Burkina Faso also fall when there is really no relation or connection  In general  European investors are probably a little bit more in tune with what is going on in Africa  TGR  Thank you  Leily  LO  Thank you    a gold analyst with Scotiabank in

204530,426046,M, 2 000 Gold Will Soon Kickstart Mining Shares  Michael Fowler,opinion,The lack of excitement haunting the precious metals and mining shares markets over the past year is expected to change in the next few months  according to Michael Fowler  senior mining analyst with Loewen  Ondaatje  McCutcheon Ltd  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  he explains why he expects gold to finally break through the  2 000 ounce barrier in 2013 and how this should affect the mining stocks that he covers  While share prices are generally low across the board now  Fowler tells us about a few of the ones that he expects to shine bright when the market turns The Gold Report  It seems that not much has happened in either the metals or mining shares markets since you last spoke with The Gold Report in March  What s it going to take to get people excited again  Michael Fowler  Talking about gold  the price has been churning sideways  In my opinion  what s really going to get people excited is that the gold price should actually go up quite strongly into 2013  The other point is a moderation of some of the current cost pressures in the mining business  On the metals side  we ve seen a lot of softness in worldwide demand but I think that coming into 2013  we re going to get a better metals market as China continues easing its monetary policy  So I see a pickup in demand coming into 2013  TGR  We ve experienced all sorts of conditions  events and expectations over the past couple of years that probably could or should have taken gold past  2 000 ounce  oz   What do you see on the horizon that will finally get some major money flowing into precious metals or have the rules changed due to some other factors that are not obvious  MF  Gold essentially reacts to monetary liquidity and to the concept of depreciating currencies around the world  Looking at gold in terms of euros or some of the other currencies  it s done quite well  It just hasn t performed in terms of U S  dollars  The thing that I see on the horizon is potentially a weakness in the U S  dollar  This could come about from the U S  having to raise its debt ceiling  or it could have something to do with the Federal Reserve coming up with Quantitative Easing 3  which could happen in the short term and probably within the next six months  So  a de facto weakness in the U S  dollar is going to be an important factor for gold to go past  2 000 oz  I m looking for that to happen in 2013  TGR  It seems that no matter what happens  the dollar ends up being the refuge of last resort  People talk it down and complain about all of the debt problems and everything else  Yet  when they have a choice  they seem to flee into the dollar  which defeats the price of gold going up MF  That is the case now  There seems to be a lot of confidence in U S  Treasuries or the U S  currency but  in a sense  that s probably a mistake  The debt situation is going to get some attention when the debt ceiling is hit again  It is certainly going to get some attention during or after the election in the U S  I think people are going to start focusing on the U S  situation more and more  For instance  the city of San Bernardino in California recently announced it was going bankrupt  These problems are all over the place in the U S  I just think it s a matter of time before people are going to focus on it  and then some confidence is going to be taken out of U S  assets and U S  treasuries  TGR  Turning to the mining industry  there have been some real surprises with the rising costs and changing economics with projects being put on hold and that sort of thing  Besides energy prices  what s causing these increases and is this temporary or a new built in factor of concern  MF  It s amazing that  although costs have been going up for the past 12 years  suddenly everybody is getting really excited about it  What s behind the rise  first and foremost  are labor costs  because there is a lack of qualified people in the industry  When the Internet bubble was hot  people were going into the high tech sector rather than mining and other sectors  There s been a big exodus of baby boomers out of the business  such as mining engineers  explorers  etc   and a lack of qualified people to replace them So it s a question of supply and demand  Apart from labor  there is power  Power costs have gone up along with reagents  steels  materials and lots of other input costs  Some of these things will abate but the labor issue is big and not just temporary  TGR  These things eventually sort of self compensate  but they do cause temporary problems in the short term  MF  Companies are trying to find solutions here  such as putting into production higher grade ore bodies  which will lower costs on a per ounce basis  Also  the mining business probably has to rethink itself like the auto industry where car manufacturers source or even produce modules of cars in countries with a lower cost base  An example would be buying SAG mills and equipment in China or other countries  Companies are going to have to start moderating increasing costs  which are a main reason why gold stocks have done quite poorly compared to the gold price  The gold price really has to start outpacing cost inflation for us to get really excited about the sector again  TGR  You spoke in the past about companies perhaps over financing themselves at the wrong time  With most stock prices down  raising money for non producing explorers and developers must be difficult in this environment  What s your perspective on that  MF  There s a two tier situation out there right now for explorers  Some companies  in my opinion  have raised much more money than they need for their programs over the next two years  I think that s a very bad situation with blame to go all around  Even the investment funds are over financing some of these juniors On the other hand  you have some juniors that don t have any money and are having a hard time financing their programs or even their overheads  It may take at least six months before they can go back into a market where they can actually finance themselves  TGR  Would you consider the companies that have over financed successful or maybe not so smart  I guess it depends on what prices they raised funding  MF  At the time that they finance  they probably feel very smart and are probably very smug about it  In the past  we would raise money for these juniors for a year or two of exploration work  and then they would come back to the market and get judged on their performance  Now  some have enough money for many years of exploration  TGR  We re in the summer doldrums now  When things do pick up  where do you think we ll get the best action among the different mining groups that you follow  MF  In the gold sector  I would put the majority of my money in the junior to midtier producers  I d also put money into some of the interesting turnaround and recovery situations  Our company focuses on the junior producers and explorers and I d be putting roughly 15  of my money into that group  It s going to take some time for those companies to turn around  except for specific situations  TGR  You don t think that the major producers are going to have the first shot at a little bigger movement  MF  I think they will have better movement but  unfortunately  I don t think too much of some of the bigger cap names  With what you see in their earnings and news coming out recently  they haven t been good at all  I d avoid them  The majority of my money would be in the junior midtier producers  emerging producers and some more or less turnaround producing situations  That would be the bulk of it  Then about 15  would be for explorers and developers  TGR  Tell us about some of the ones you like  MF  Among the ones we follow  Aurizon Mines Ltd   TSX ARZ  NYSE A AZK  recently came out with earnings  which were OK  but a bit lower than expectations  The big story for Aurizon is its two large development projects  One is the Hosco Heva deposit on the Joanna property in Quebec  The other is the Marban deposit  Should these developments pan out  it could mean almost a doubling of production at Aurizon  That could be a very interesting story  Clifton Star Resources Inc   TSX V CFO  FSE C3T  is an exploration company in the Val d Or Rouyn Noranda area with just over 3 million ounces  Moz  gold in its deposit  The company is in the process of undertaking a preliminary assessment or scoping study  It s extremely cheap right now in terms of its valuation  So we like that  TGR  That one really hasn t recovered from that long trading halt that the exchange put on it after it questioned its classification of resources  MF  That s a good point  It was halted for a long period  There are a lot of things that have changed in that company since that halt  First  the question about resources or the NI 43 101 has been totally resolved  It s not a question of whether or not the gold is there  In fact  it is in greater quantities than in the NI 43 101 that was questioned by the British Columbia Securities Commission  Second  the management of Clifton Star has totally changed  There is a new CEO in the company and some new people in management  I think it s like a different coat of paint on the company  The assets are good and I wouldn t be surprised if we saw Clifton Star being involved in another joint venture with a major mining company  Wesdome Gold Mines Ltd   TSX WDO  is a producing recovery story  It produces about 60 000 oz year gold  which doesn t sound like an awful lot  but it is trading at a market cap of  88 million  M  right now  The company has had production for the past 17  years  That kind of valuation for a producing company is almost amazing  The reason the valuation is down there is because it had some problems last year with mining dilution  I have a feeling that this year the company is going to turn around  and we re going to see improved costs and  therefore  an improved share price  Moneta Porcupine Mines Inc   TSX V ME  is another one of my picks with a property in the Destor Porcupine area on the Ontario side of the border  This company has a potential of about 4 Moz gold in an open pit deposit  It s close to infrastructure  next door to Brigus Gold Corp   TSX BRD  NYSE A BRD  and St Andrews Goldfields Ltd   TSX SAS   This is a potential consolidation situation where Moneta Porcupine could be consolidated into a number of other companies there  It s cheap on a per ounce basis as well  TGR  So you re thinking it could end up being a takeover target rather than an acquirer  MF  It could be a takeover target or it could be involved in a tie up of any number of companies there  This is a resource in a great location and I wouldn t be surprised if it ended up in another company  TGR  Certainly 4 Moz that s open pittable in an area of underground mines is certainly an incredible resource for a smaller company  You mentioned Brigus and St  Andrews  Do you have any further thoughts on them  MF  Both are essentially recovery stories  Production has certainly improved in both St  Andrews and Brigus  Costs are improving as well  I think it s a bit too early to get overexcited on those two names  but I m definitely watching them  They also have good exploration projects in that Destor Porcupine corridor and there s exploration upside in both companies  TGR  There s been a real revival in eastern Canada among all these old underground mines that have been around for 50 100 years  The higher gold prices certainly changed the economics MF  Yes  they have  but costs have gone up as well  There is some potential for open pit situations in that area and a lot of the companies are actually focused more on that than they were previously because  as you mentioned  they were mostly underground mines  TGR  What other companies do you like now  MF  I like Fortune Minerals Ltd   TSX FT   It has a large metallurgical coal deposit  Mt  Klappan  in British Columbia  The other property  NICO  is a cobalt gold bismuth deposit in the Northwest Territories  It has a mixture of commodities  There is also some copper in there  Both projects need quite a lot of money to get going  The company has been aggressively looking for a strategic investor mining company in Asia  It already has an Asian partner  POSCO  NYSE PKX  for the Mount Klappan coal deposit and is looking for another Asian partner for the NICO deposit Despite money being very scarce now  there is a lot of money in Asia  I think Fortune is doing a very good job of trying to find Asian investors for its projects  It s trading for a song right now  around  0 60  with about a  70M market cap  These two projects have four feasibility studies  and the total net present values of those studies translate into over  5 share  So it s trading at a big valuation discount  TGR  What is your target on that one  MF  Our official target is  2 65  TGR  How about the targets on some of the other ones you mentioned  MF  Our target on Aurizon Mines is  8 40  Wesdome Gold Mines   3 50  Fortune Minerals   2 65  Clifton Star   6  Moneta Porcupine   0 95  TGR  And all of them are trading for a relative fraction of those prices at this point  MF  Exactly  TGR  So all we need is a little more optimism and a catalyst to get people excited  MF  That s exactly right  TGR  Maybe you can summarize what you re expecting in the precious metals markets  how that s going to benefit the mining shares over the balance of the year and what people should be looking at so they can get the biggest bang for their buck  MF  As I mentioned in March  the industry is on sale  There is an even bigger sale going on right now  The valuations are cheap and it s a great time to invest in some good names  The catalyst  to my mind  is going to be a macroeconomic situation  which is ultimately going to weaken the U S  dollar  We may be seeing that coming up into the fall  with a focus on the debt situation in the U S  I believe that the cost concerns in the industry will abate a bit here because energy prices have come down  but inflation is going to be a built in factor going forward  I m looking for the gold price to outstrip the cost inflation  So coming into 2013  I m looking for a  2 000 oz gold price  which should provide some impetus for people to look at gold shares again  I think investors have to look for growth situations  The ones that I ve mentioned do show growth  and there is a likelihood that some will be taken over  I wouldn t be despairing too much at the moment  Despair usually means opportunity  and I think the opportunity is right at hand  TGR  Thanks for joining us today  Michael  We ll all be eagerly awaiting that  2 000 oz gold price to see where it takes us  MF  Thank you  Zig    senior mining analyst with Loewen

204531,426047,M,Lawrence Roulston Spots Gold Juniors With Bright Futures,opinion,In the topsy turvy gold equities market  it can be difficult to spot junior mining firms capable of delivering substantial pay offs  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  top market analyst and Resource Opportunities newsletter editor Lawrence Roulston identifies undervalued firms from Africa to British Columbia that have high quality assets  access to development cash  solid management teams and bright futures  The Gold Report  You recently observed that there s  9 trillion of gold stashed away worldwide  Does this mean that short term gold traders are setting the market price for gold  Lawrence Roulston  Most of the gold in the world is held for the long term  Only a small portion of total gold holdings is actively traded  Short term price fluctuations are largely the result of traders reacting to news  A long term chart of the gold price tells the real story  Gold is trending higher and there are short term fluctuations  but the long term direction is obvious  The important message is that the long term outlook for gold remains extremely bullish  The gold producers have an ongoing need to replace reserves  and they want to grow their businesses  That s the basis for viewing the exploration and development companies  You re going to beat yourself up trying to figure out what the next short term move is going to be in the gold price  but if you take this long term uptrend seriously and look at the companies developing deposits that are likely to be taken over by the larger companies  that s a much better way to play the gold market  TGR  In February  you told The Gold Report that for gold shares   the worst is over   Do you still feel that way  Are there signs that a bottom for equities has been reached  LR  That call was premature  There was a brief rally  It turned around when the gold price dropped  The U S  dollar replaced gold as a safe haven as people fled from the uncertainty in Europe  At that time  I differentiated between the resource markets overall and the higher quality junior companies  The message still applies  Better quality companies with good assets  cash on hand and strong management are building strong bases in their share prices at this time  Some of these companies have come down to the bottom and are trading at cash value  There is not a lot of downside once they re trading at cash value  We are in the midst of the summer doldrums  People aren t really paying attention to the junior markets  That s going to change in September when people come back from holidays  Investors are going to recognize that companies with good assets are trading for cash value or near that level  and that there is more upside potential than there is downside risk  The big factor that is really going to drive the markets is takeovers  We re seeing it now  For instance  Avion Gold Corp   AVR TSX  AVGCF OTCQX  just received a takeover offer that was a 70  premium to its 20 day trading price  There are going to be a lot more offers like that  and that s going to make savvy investors pay attention  TGR  In terms of companies trading at or near their current cash value  are there any firms that you think are a good deal for investors right now  LR  Keegan Resources Inc   TSX KGN  NYSE A KGN  has  200 million  M  in the bank  and its market value is not a lot more than that  It has a 5 million ounce  Moz  good quality gold deposit in Ghana  That s an example of how irrational the valuations are in this market now  TGR  Speaking of rationality  what specific political and economic trends are affecting the price of bullion and the price of gold equities  LR  Short term prices are impacted by news headlines  but headlines are not all that accurate  We hear constantly about the slowdown in China  In reality  China is the largest consumer of metal and its economy is growing at better than 7  a year  That s less than the 8 9  growth of recent periods  but it s still a phenomenal pace of growth for the second largest economy in the world  TGR  What about the so called euro dilemma  LR  The situation in Europe is the most significant element impacting investor sentiment  Markets have pretty much discounted a complete collapse of the euro  Personally  I don t think we re going to see a complete collapse of the euro  I think a more practical outlook is that the powers in Europe are moving ever closer toward a wide open monetary easing in the same way that the Americans used monetary policy to overcome the 2008 global financial crisis  And it worked very effectively in the U S  The American economy is not booming yet  but it has certainly rebounded from a recession to a period of slow growth  TGR  What would be the effect of quantitative easing in Europe on gold investors  LR  Over time  it will be very positive for hard assets in general  and especially for gold  but also positive for the whole range of commodities  Monetary easing depresses the value of currencies  It s inflationary  Hard assets like gold and other metals are going to effectively hold their value in real terms as the value of currencies decline  In the long term  the easing could be very bullish for commodities in general  TGR  Given that now is a good time to bargain hunt for junior mining stocks  what standards should investors use when evaluating whether a particular junior has a solid chance at making it through the next year or so and emerging as a contender  LR  The biggest payoff for a junior exploration company comes with a new discovery  We saw that recently with GoldQuest Mining Corp   TSX V GQC   In a period of three months  its stock price went from  0 05 share to  1 50 share  But  unfortunately  discoveries like that are not very common  Investors must balance risk and potential reward by buying companies that have a solid asset combined with a realistic prospect of a takeover  The value of a quality asset increases as the owner expands and upgrades the resource by conducting engineering studies and moving toward production  Companies with solid mining assets and good management teams that are advancing toward production provide the best balance  It s hard for companies to raise money  Financings can be dilutive to the point where a company may never recover  But enterprises with cash in hand are in strong positions  And companies with good assets and strong management can still raise money  Pretium Resources Inc   TSX PVG  NYSE PVG   for instance  is presently raising  18M in a flow through financing that s priced at a 25  premium to market To be a winner  a project has to have size and it has to have grade  It has to be well located with regard to infrastructure and jurisdiction  Now  having said that  the number of good jurisdictions is shrinking  The most recent downgrade came as Bolivia announced the takeover of a project from South American Silver Corp   TSX SAC  OTCBB SOHAF   It s getting harder and harder to find good quality assets in favorable jurisdcitions  TGR  Is that good or bad for the junior investor  LR  Long term  it s good  The value of the good quality assets will appreciate  In decades gone by  there was a surplus of good quality metal deposits available for development  When metal prices rose  a lot of new deposits came onstream and knocked back the metal prices  We saw that cycle repeated several times over the last few decades  But the situation has dramatically changed  there is no longer a surplus of good quality assets  Finding large  high grade deposits is getting harder  That means that when a company makes a discovery  the discovery is more likely to yield a high value for shareholders  TGR  Looking at the relative share prices of junior companies over a two year window  we see some that are still holding value  despite some downturn in share price  For example  Newstrike Capital Inc   TSX V NES  was  0 40 share in August 2010 and now it s  1 80 share despite having risen as high as  3 40 share in the interim  There are other firms with similar stories  Do you consider this type of comparison to be an indicator of company strength for the long term  LR  Yes  those price ranges are good indicators of value in this market  There are several ways to explain undervaluation of high quality firms  Some individual investors are terrified and are selling across the board  they want out of all equities  Another huge component in the selling is investment funds  hedge funds and other institutional type investors who came into the resource sector not really knowing what they were doing  Now they are looking to get whatever they can get for their positions  Consequently  sophisticated investors are picking up great bargains  That companies like Newstrike are still holding value indicates that they have tangible assets and solid management  TGR  Are there other companies that you are looking at that are holding value comparable to Newstrike  LR  GoldQuest is up from  0 05 share to  1 80 share in a period of months after a discovery  Where it will go from here  who knows  It will depend on the next drill results  Pretium is up 2 5 times over the last couple of years  Extorre Gold Mines Ltd   TSX XG  NYSE A XG  FSE E1R  has doubled from two years ago  Sandstorm Gold Ltd   TSX V SSL  has tripled  These are all companies that have good management and solid assets  which are getting recognition from  in the case of Extorre  another mining company  and for the others  from investors who understand the sector  TGR  Are some of these juniors with relatively low stock prices benefiting from joint ventures with seniors  LR  Absolutely  I ve always been a fan of the joint venture approach to exploration  It s a very high risk business  and it s better to use other people s money for the early stage exploration  For example  Millrock Resources Inc   TSX V MRO  has held up better than some other companies because it benefits from senior companies that are funding the work on its projects  Another example of that synergy is Riverside Resources Inc   TSX RRI   which has held up well in a really tough market  TGR  Can you be a little more specific about Riverside and what s going on there  LR  Riverside is a prospect generator type company that has initiated many exploration projects  A number of juniors and seniors are funding work on its projects  It s focused on North America  so it s in good political jurisdictions  It has two deals where it has entered into strategic alliances to conduct regional exploration programs  one in Mexico and another in British Columbia  That kind of business model is very effective  especially for a company like Riverside that is able to attract the big companies that can afford aggressive exploration programs  TGR  You mentioned Millrock  Can you tell us a little bit about what s going on with that firm  LR  Millrock has quite a number of exploration projects in Alaska and also in Arizona  It has joint ventures with senior companies  Quite a lot of work is going on at the moment  Any of those projects could turn into a major discovery  TGR  Tell us more about Newstrike  What makes it attractive  LR  Newstrike is working on a project in Mexico in a very prolific gold belt  It has a big property position and has made a discovery  It is systematically drilling off the discovery and has potential for additional discoveries on its property  TGR  I wonder about Africa  which has a host of political and infrastructure obstacles  Are there any undervalued juniors operating in eastern Africa that have drawn your attention  LR  I like Sunridge Gold Corp   TSX V SGC  a lot  It has a very good project at the feasibility stage  It is gold and base metals  In this kind of a market  investors don t want anything to do with a country like Eritrea  but Nevsun Resources Ltd   NSU TSX  NSU NYSE A  has been very successful in that country  has developed an operating mine and was able to raise debt financing in the international markets  Sunridge is on the same path to mine development  At its current share price  it s way undervalued  When you look at countries within Africa that have various levels of political risk  it comes down to a tradeoff between risk and potential reward  There are some places in Africa that I wouldn t touch under any circumstances  but there are other places that are quite attractive in terms of their level of geopolitical risk  are extremely prospective geologically and  therefore  provide an excellent balance of risk and potential reward  Sunridge is one example  TGR  What other regions would fit those criteria  LR  West Africa in general is very positive  Ghana is a good place to be  Ghana and many other countries over the past couple of years have bumped up its rates of taxation and royalties on the mining industry in response to high metal prices  That s turned off a lot of investors  not so much about the level that the royalties and taxes are at this time  but the political situation creates uncertainty as to what it is going to do next  We saw the same thing in Mongolia  which bumped up taxes  said it was satisfied with that  then came back a year or two later and said   no  we want more   That s really the biggest problem right now  the uncertainty of what s coming next  TGR  For the retail investor  what are some of the major metrics that an investor could look at to tell the difference between a good quality company and one that s maybe not so good in today s market  LR  You have to realize that most of the junior exploration companies have the best intentions in the world of making a discovery next week or next month  They re good geologists  they re well intentioned  but if they re not successful at making a new discovery  they re not going to deliver a lot of value to shareholders  Some of them will make discoveries  and they will provide enormous payoffs for shareholders  as we saw recently in the case of GoldQuest  But  unless they make a discovery  there may not be a lot of value in the vast majority of the companies in this sector  I like to focus on firms that have a tangible asset in hand  They have made a discovery or they ve reinvigorated a discovery that was made at some point in the past  So they have something tangible  and they re adding value to it  It s important to realize that the mining industry has changed dramatically over the past couple of decades There were discoveries made in the 1980s  1990s and even the early part of the 2000s that didn t make economic sense at that time  The grade was too low or it was too remote  And of course the metal prices at that time were very much lower than they are today  With higher metal prices and with changing metrics in a number of areas  discoveries from way back are now extremely valuable and  in fact  are some of the best deposits available to the mining industry  TGR  Before we conclude  are there any juniors that you would like to recommend to our readers  LR  Companies that are working toward adding value on existing deposits include Kaminak Gold Corp   TSX V KAM   which is drilling a deposit in the Yukon  It will be putting together its first resource estimate later this year  People are going to be very pleased when they see the size of it  Paget Minerals Corp   TSX V PGS  and its joint partner are working on a very substantial situation in British Columbia  It is a discovery from decades ago that was put aside  Paget reactivated it  Pretium has outlined 17 Moz high grade gold ounces on its Brucejack property in British Columbia  The world had seen Brucejack as being a large but low grade deposit  and the company was able to go in and identify a very substantial  high grade portion in that deposit  New Gold Inc   TSX NGD  NYSE A NGD  is conducting probably the biggest exploration program in the world at the moment on its Blackwater project in British Columbia  That opens up a whole region where there are a number of juniors looking at other deposits or other prospects that might look like Blackwater  TGR  That sounds promising  LR  British Columbia is really coming back into the forefront  Not a lot of investors have appreciated the significance of what s happening in British Columbia  TGR  Well  it has infrastructure  It is politically stable  There are a fair amount of new discoveries going on  LR  It s one of the most highly prospective geologic areas  It has had a lot of work done in the past  and there are many companies that are now building on that historic work  In fact  I m working now on a special issue of a newsletter devoted to British Columbia  TGR  In terms of new extraction techniques  LR  In terms of companies that are building on work that was conducted in the province in the past  such as Paget  which is drilling on a deposit that was discovered initially in the 1960s  Until recently  it was perceived as having no value  but this might end up being one of the most significant porphyry copper gold prospects anywhere  There are a lot of situations like this in British Columbia The province was explored pretty thoroughly in the 1970s and 1980s but at that time  the grades that the enterprises were coming up with weren t high enough to be economic in the context of metal prices  But now the gold price in the last decade is six times higher and the copper price is six times higher  Situations that had little value a decade ago are now highly prospective  TGR  Do you have any parting words  LR  A lot of people recognize the long term fundamentals in gold and the mining industry in general  but they are terrified about the situation in Europe and they re standing back  They re waiting for a signal that the markets are at the bottom  Nobody is going to ring a bell to announce that the market is at the bottom  We saw in the early part of 2009 how quickly the markets could rebound  Within a couple of weeks  the Toronto Stock Exchange Venture Index was up 50  and went on to triple over the next two years  TGR  We could be in a similar situation  LR  I believe we are  The really important point is that the high quality companies are already seeing strong bases building in their share prices and many of them  in fact  are beginning to trend upward  If people wait until there s a signal that the markets are on the way up  it s going to be too late to get a position in the good quality companies  TGR  Thank you very much for your time  It s been a pleasure talking to you    editor of Resource Opportunities  is a geologist with engineering and business

204532,426048,M,Eric Sprott Cautions Investors To Fear The Financial System,opinion,The dire economic situation that persists globally despite the best efforts of central planners to make things seem normal leads Sprott Inc  s legendary Chairman Eric Sprott to broadcast a loud message of caution   Fear the financial system   In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Sprott says it s time for people to take matters into their own hands and that means pushing further and further into precious metals equities as well as physical gold and silver  With 80  of his own portfolio in that arena  he certainly puts his money where his mouth is  The Gold Report  You ve stated before that the price of gold should be above  3 200 ounce  oz  and the price of silver above  200 oz but market manipulation keeps both metals artificially low  Who is manipulating it  Eric Sprott  I suspect the G6 central banks have a hand in subverting the gold price because as the canary in the coal mine  high gold prices might tip everyone off to the severity of the ongoing financial crisis  I don t think anyone can doubt that we re in the middle of a financial crisis  primarily in the banking system  when month after month one program after another is rolled out to save somebody  whether it s Long Term Refinancing Operations  LTROs   quantitative easings  QEs   bank bailouts in Spain or rollovers of debt in Greece  TGR  Are you saying that the gold price manipulation is a new phenomenon  ES  In the 1960s  the London Gold Pool was trying to suppress the price of gold but lost that battle  and the price rocketed up  My own analysis of the physical supply and demand for gold suggests a dramatic increase in demand over the last 12 years a 2 500 ton net change at a minimum  This is in the 4 000 ton year gold market  which hasn t increased in the past 12 years  The supply has basically been static  Yet we have exchange traded funds and central banks buying  You have to ask yourself where all the gold s coming from with all these new sources of demand  because mine supply over that period is negligible  I can only conclude that acting in concert  the G6 central banks are supplying that gold from their reserves by leasing the central bank gold into the gold market  Of course  they pretend they still own it  because the item on their balance sheet is now called  gold and gold receivables   The receivable is what they ve loaned to a bullion bank  but it s actually been sold into the market and consumed and won t be coming back again  To buy it back physically would drive the price absolutely crazy  That s why I think the price of gold should be considerably higher than it is  and why I believe  much as anyone in the Gold Anti Trust Action  GATA  organization  that there s been continual pressure from the central banks in cooperation with bullion banks to keep the price down  TGR  Does the fact that the silver market is so much smaller than the gold market make it easier to manipulate  ES  I think it s more easily manipulated  it doesn t take as many dollars in the paper silver market because it doesn t trade as many dollars as the gold market would  For example  when silver hit  49 50 oz in the Q2 11  on some days silver traded a billion ounces of paper a day where the mine supply on a yearly basis is 900 million ounces  Moz  and probably the amount available for investment is about 200 Moz  TGR  Those numbers don t add up  ES  No  they don t  How can we trade a billion ounces of paper silver on a single day with 200 Moz available for investment for a whole year  I always ask people to think about what the seller was thinking  I m going to sell a billion ounces of silver today and one fifth of that is available for investment on a yearly basis  As a result  the paper was determining the price of the physical commodity  TGR  You recently raised another  200 million  M  for the Sprott Physical Silver Trust with the goal of buying 7 Moz of silver  ES  We ve had a number of issues in that trust  We raised  250M in July  including over allotment  and  350M back in Q1 12  TGR  Could that affect supply and demand and therefore manipulate the market  ES  The silver we buy theoretically stays off the market  so it does have some impact but had we not bought it someone might have tried to move the price a little lower  Actually  I think the silver price exhibited more stability than it would have otherwise experienced  TGR  You also operate Sprott Money  a service for buying physical gold and silver  Is that because you view precious metals as a store of value and therefore a hedge against inflation  ES  I ve been a believer in gold and silver for the last 12 years and I guess a disbeliever in paper assets  I m quite surprised that things such as currency debasements by central banks getting involved in supporting their bond markets and banking systems have evolved to make the case for owning gold and silver since 2000 way stronger than anything I might have imagined  I basically got into gold because I anticipated a physical shortage  but I didn t expect the headwinds of the level of financial irresponsibility shown at either the fiscal level of governments with all their deficits or at the involvement of the financial markets by way of QEs  LTROs  operation twists and unlimited swap lines  In my mind  all of this ultimately will further debase the currencies  which gives us an even more powerful reason to own gold and silver  TGR  How does Sprott Money work  ES  It s basically a mechanism for people to own what I think will be the thing that saves them  which is hard assets  Over the last 12 years  I ve been a strong proponent that people should have a sizeable piece of their investments in gold and silver  Sprott Money  operating now for over three years  was set up to make that easier  TGR  How sizeable should a portion of a portfolio be in physical metals  ES  That s a great question  and the answer I always give is what I do with my own portfolio  Between the stocks and bullion  I have about 80  of my money in precious metals  I think that s the only sound investment there is  Around the world  on average people have less than 1  of their portfolios in precious metals  and there s a long distance between 1  and 80   Nevertheless  I certainly believe it should be well north of 1   That being said  no way can everyone have 10  of his or her portfolios in gold and silver because there isn t enough gold and silver in the world to do that  There s already a physical shortage of gold and undoubtedly a very tight situation in the silver market  If people and institutions put even 5  of their money into gold and silver  there s no way to accomplish that without driving the prices up dramatically  TGR  When you suggest investing in the commodities  are you talking about taking delivery of physical bars  bullion and coins  What s the best way  ES  The best thing is either to take physical delivery and store it somewhere safe or to buy a fund where you know the metal is there  Just looking at the short position in the SPDR Gold Trust  GLD  and the iShares Silver Trust  SLV   I can tell you there can t possibly be one ounce of gold for every ounce of certificates that people own because some of the paper was sold short  I have reservations about SPDR Gold Trust and iShares Silver Trust for that reason  But with other funds  I know the gold and silver are there  so they can give you way more assurance that your precious metal is in safe hands rather than buying something on the commodity exchange  for example  A piece of paper may say you might get it  but what if a force majeure results in too many people claiming what turns out to be not enough physical gold and silver  You have to pick your spots  TGR  Such as  ES  Central Fund of Canada is one  as well as Sprott s own physical gold trust or physical silver trust  and funds in other countries that have the physical products  such as GoldMoney  which is actually a competitor of Sprott Money  TGR  Going back to the manipulation issue  you re cosponsoring the conference   Navigating the Politicized Economy  with Casey Research  Is currency manipulation really worse than it was 10  20 or 30 years ago  ES  As things get more desperate in the economy  the moves politicians make become more desperate  It s because the economy is in such dire shape that the people in charge turn to more and more unconventional methods to make it look as if everything s normal  In reality  everything is quite abnormal  TGR  You ve said that we don t need more regulation to protect us from this manipulation  What can individual investors do to protect themselves from market manipulation  ES  We have more regulations than you can imagine  but most of them are either not enforced or the problems escape the sight of the regulators  whether it s MF Global or Bernie Madoff  These things went on for years and years  when it would seem that the regulators could identify it  Even when they re tipped off  they can t seem to reconcile it  Based on experience  a blanket case that more regulation will solve a problem is naive  People have to take matters into their own hands  whether they think they re being ripped off in the stock market because of high frequency trading or that they re being hurt by rule changes on the commodity exchange  They have to assess their own situations and ask   What kind of risk am I prepared to take   The system has failed a lot of people  That s why I pointblank say gold and silver are the only things you should own  They re the safest things I can possibly recommend  If you own gold and silver and you re 100  certain that it s where you think it is  you should be okay  That s the way I approach it  TGR  Turning to the equities  in a previous interview you said that when gold prices go up  equities move three times faster  That didn t happen when gold went to  1 900 oz  Was that a fluke  or is the ratio you told us about still relevant  ES  I think it is  For instance  in 2000 the NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index  HUI  went as low as 35  Today it s 420  so it s gone up by 1 100   2 1 times the increase in the price of gold  At the margin  the increase in the price of gold is all profit  so another sustained rally would dramatically change the profit picture for all these companies  Assume the average miner makes  800 oz  At that rate  a  400 oz increase in the price of gold would push the stock up by 50   Looking at that another way  a  400 oz move in the price of gold is today a 25  gain  whereas the miner s profits go up by twice that an automatic 2 1 in the equities outperforming gold  And because further increases in the gold price would be all profit and because the equity prices have been so incredibly depressed  it s not illogical to assume that the precious metal stocks would outperform gold by a 3 1 ratio  TGR  What will it take to move this market higher  ES  I see huge macro changes that in the physical sense alone should cause the price to go up  The biggest thing now is the buying out of China  which has grown by about 600  over the last 12 months  China is buying almost 50 tons of gold a month 600 tons a year of brand new buying and no increase in supply in a 4 000 ton market  Then bring into the picture central bank buying  which has changed dramatically  particularly from 2010 to 2011  It increased by about 800 tons  again with no increase in supply  You have to wonder where all this gold is coming from  The central bank buying includes obvious moves by some non G6 countries  not only China but also Turkey  Mexico  Kazakhstan and Russia  Even South Korea has been a recent buyer  These non G6 central banks see what s going on in the G6 and have decided to step up their allocations to gold  I think ultimately this will have a dramatic impact on the price of physical gold  Gold equities will go up when the price of gold goes up  And  as I ve said  the G6 central banks are already surreptitiously supplying a considerable shortfall in the physical gold market  I can assure you that based on Frank Veneroso s work  which got me interested in gold back in 1998  there was already a shortage of gold then  The central banks had been selling it for 15 or so years  Combining that with what s been happening in the last 12 years  not much gold can be left in those vaults  Sooner or later  the rubber will meet the road in terms of the physical market for gold  TGR  And that will increase demand  which will in turn increase equity prices  ES  We don t even need to increase demand  We need the central banks to stop selling gold surreptitiously  but that s not going to happen  TGR   recently told us that the coming bottom of the market will offer a great opportunity to buy some great companies at a discount  Do you agree  If so  how do you determine what is a great company hit unfairly by the market and what s a company that just may not survive to see the upside  ES  I totally agree  because all precious metal equities have been mauled  I can make a very strong case for companies that are trading at incredibly low cash flow multiples in what is almost a negative interest rate environment  The fundamentals have improved dramatically for a lot of these companies because their stocks have gone down  That would argue that the upside is quite stunning  particularly if you factor in increases in the prices of precious metals along the way  TGR  How can you tell which companies will be able to make it to the upside  It s been a tough market for raising capital and staying in business  ES  Producers shouldn t have a problem because most of them are making money selling gold  They shouldn t have a problem surviving as long as they don t overexpand and stretch capital needs if the market won t supply  The very difficult time in capital markets isn t just in precious metals  but in all capital markets  The IPO market has been badly hurt  and the average investor is taking money out of the stock market  so it s not as though mutual funds have more money to throw into new equities  In this environment  the well funded company that has ongoing operations should do just perfectly  And  of course  some of these smaller to middle size companies are trading at probably lower multiples relative to the gold price than ever  I see company after company saying that they ll be trading at four times cash flow next year or two years from now  Where else will investors get that in a zero interest rate world  It s almost impossible  The problem is the price of gold hasn t rallied   Editor s Note  this interview was conducted before the gold rally of the past week to 1672   We need that to give people some comfort that we re not going to  1 200 oz but to  2 000 oz  TGR  You ve been in the eye of a mergers and acquisitions flurry as nine recent takeover bids have involved stocks in your portfolio  including a controversial one with U S  Silver Corp   CYLQF PK   Are the premiums as good as they would ve been if these companies had other options  such as access to capital  Or are these fire sales  ES  I d call them all fire sales  Companies are up against the wall  and maybe their production hasn t come on as well as it should have  Typically  it s someone being opportune  Obviously  the price of precious metals hasn t helped  because everyone is worried  I think the average analyst is suggesting the price of gold will be  1 275 oz in a few years  I don t believe that for one second  but that s what the analysts conventionally believe  so people think it will get worse before it gets better  I happen to be of the opposite view  that it will get better going forward than it has been in the last little while  Gold was up every year for the last 11 years  It s up again this year and the year s not over  As we get toward the end of the year  I think if we can push back toward the old highs  the valuations given to all of the precious metal producers will be dramatically different  TGR  Finally  What is the best piece of investing advice you have ever received  ES  I think the best piece of advice I have received was always try to buy a company with a low price to earnings multiple or a low price to cash flow multiple  particularly one that s a little out of favor because ultimately if it s sustainable  it will attain the valuation that s appropriate in the market  That s why we typically look at small to midsize companies that are under followed where we can see opportunities that maybe others haven t  I think that s the place where people should focus  TGR  And any last bits of advice you would like to share with our readers  ES  The biggest thing is they should fear the financial system  It s very  very volatile  We see what s happening on a day to day basis  It s staggering the things the central planners have to do to hold it together  I think people have to push further and further into the precious metals area  It s the one thing that will survive the financial fiasco that we re in  The safest thing is to own gold and silver  and don t buy some paper saying you own it unless you know the people behind it are trustworthy  TGR  Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us today  With 40 plus years of experience in the

204533,426049,M,It s Game On For Rare Earths In Greenland  Rick Mills,opinion,Far from icebound  Greenland is wealthy in rare earth elements  precious metals and oil  Already  says Aheadoftheherd com owner Rick Mills  companies are beginning to outline major discoveries at just pennies a share  And that s just the tip of the iceberg  Read more in this exclusive interview with The Critical Metals Report  The Critical Metals Report  Let s start by talking about growth in developing nations  where populations are starting to demand the good things in life that we in the developed world have long enjoyed  That means continued growth in the commodity markets  specifically in mining  What are the implications of that  Rick Mills  Easy and cheap access to basic materials like food  fiber  energy and minerals has driven recent growth in global prosperity  Throughout history  supply shortages in these materials have led to prices high enough to support further increases in production  We have always counted on supply eventually exceeding demand and forcing prices to drop  Now  we are seeing a paradigm shift  Scarcity  jurisdictional risk and energy costs may result in declining production  Remember  margins  not price  motivate investment  As the cost of production increases  margins might not be sustainable  TCMR  Is this specific to metals or other materials  RM  I am talking about everything  food  fiber  energy and minerals  As far as metals are concerned  we have already picked most of the low hanging fruit  now we have to go to more remote locations  We have to go to countries that are a little bit sketchy  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Zambia or South Africa  which seems to be imploding  For 10 years now  supply has struggled to keep pace with demand  The supply of metals is finite and subject to compounding demand from developing nations  Discovery and development are increasingly challenging and expensive  Average ore grades for most minerals are in decline  yet their production has increased dramatically  The most important metals  copper for example  are suffering from declining ore quality and rising extraction costs  Eventually  the quantity of resources used in the extraction process will be 100  of what is produced  At existing mines  costs are increasing while production rates are stagnant or in decline  And the rate of discovery is not keeping pace with the rate of depletion  we are not replacing the reserves we are using  TCMR  That would seem to increase the value of some of the near term production stories that have defined ounces  Do you see a general increase in mergers and acquisitions  M A  activity in the metals industry  RM  I think that will have to happen  When was the last time you heard of a major making a discovery  The majors  business is to produce  whereas the juniors  place on the food chain is to explore  find and develop to a given point  As reserves get more difficult to replace  juniors with deposits will become more valuable  The only way for a major mining company to replace its reserves and grow its resources is M A  And  because there are very few mid tier companies left  the majors will have to dip into the junior pool  TCMR  You pay close attention to areas of the world now being explored  Do you have any ideas for investors  particularly in terms of lesser known jurisdictions  RM  Greenland is one place that will be increasingly on investors  radar screens  It is vastly underexplored and yet  it has some of the best potential for mineral discoveries that I have ever seen  Greenland is the largest island in the world  it has 5 800 square kilometers  sq km  of coastline  And yes  about 84  of Greenland is icecap up to 3 km thick But the ice free area surrounding the icecap is up to 300 km wide  roughly 400 010 sq km  Compare that to the size of Germany  which is slightly less at 357 000 sq km  That is where the prospective mineral discovery areas are  Most companies are working on the southwest coast  Travel by sea is possible throughout the year from Nanortalik  in the south  to Sisimiut in the northwest  where the ports have a year round shipping season  The Earth s  cryosphere  its frozen places are melting  And there s no place on Earth that s changing faster than Greenland  The World Meteorological Organization reported that December 2011 was much warmer than usual  with rainfall instead of snow recorded for the first time in Kuujjuaq  NASA recently reported that ice all across the vast glacial interior of the world s largest island was melting  Greenland is no more rugged than Canada s north  When you consider that the southwest coast is ice free year round  shipping by sea would be cheaper than roads or exporting out of Canada s north  TCMR  Why is it so prospective from a mineral exploration standpoint  RM  Because Greenland is geologically part of North America  its geology is continuous with that of Canada and Northern Europe  It has cratons  which gives you the potential for diamonds  gold and rare earths  There s a Paleoproterozoic mobile belt  which gives you the potential for base metals  platinum group metals  PGMs   gold and tantalum The Skaergaard intrusion  a lower territory intrusive complex  is tremendously important in terms of gold and PGM potential  Greenland also has lower Paleozoic sediments  which have the potential for other base metals  Carboniferous cretaceous settlements have the potential for coal  Its offshore geology is highly prospective for petroleum  In 2007  the U S  Geological Survey estimated that the East Greenland Rift Basins Province could hold more than 31 billion barrels oil  gas and natural gas liquids  It also estimated that the waters off Greenland s west coast could contain the equivalent of 42  of Saudi Arabia s oil reserves  TCMR  What about permitting and ease of development  Do the Greenlanders welcome this type of activity  RM  Greenland has had self rule since June 2009  including control over its minerals and petroleum  It is a politically stable democracy  open to foreign investments and mining  Right now  fishing and grants from Denmark are its major sources of revenue  Greenland wants to cement its financial independence from Denmark and sees mineral mining and oil and gas production as good sectors to achieve this  The permitting process takes a very commonsense approach  Greenlanders want to get mines going  to have people working and to get the revenue generated by operating mines  Greenland s Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum  BMP  is the nation s authoritative body for all administration related to mineral resources  It is a one stop shop for anyone who wants a license  The BMP has the regulatory authority to review  evaluate and approve all licenses and to facilitate the public hearing process  TCMR  So there are no hoops to jump through for local  provincial or national governments  RM  That s right  and the BMP is aggressive when it comes to marketing Greenland s geologic potential  For example  the BMP designed and executed its own resource awareness marketing strategy focused on Australia and Canada  the two biggest mining countries in the world  TCMR  What companies are operating there  RM  Hudson Resources Inc   HUD TSX V  controls 100  of the Sarfartoq carbonatite complex in west Greenland  This is one of the world s largest carbonatite complexes  approximately 13 by 8 km  The minerals of economic interest include pyrochlore  a niobium and tantalum oxide  In the core of the complex there are high uranium levels corresponding with exceptionally high concentrations of niobium and tantalum  The Sarfartoq project has produced some of the highest known niobium intercepts  Uranium is directly associated with the niobium in the pyrochlore and is an effective prospecting tool used to identify other pyrochlore occurrences on the project  Greenland currently has a moratorium on uranium mining  Hudson is sitting back and letting Greenlanders decide whether they want uranium mining or not  Instead  it is concentrating on the rare earth elements  REEs   There seem to be an awful lot of them with extremely high grades  TCMR  Right now  it seems that the heavy rare earth elements  HREEs  are the most sought after  Does Hudson have a deposit with any of the HREEs  RM  It has a deposit of what is arguably the most important REE  neodymium  Neodymium is the key to making REE magnets  those superior  high strength permanent magnets used for energy related applications  For example  wind turbines require 1 000 kilograms of neodymium for each megawatt of electricity they generate  The shift away from electromagnetic systems toward a permanent magnetic based  direct drive system in hybrid cars is increasing demand for neodymium  It always seems to be in short supply in the global marketplace  so prices have held up fairly well  Hudson collected a five ton  bulk metallurgical sample from its main zone  the ST1  It graded 2 5  total rare earth oxides  REOs   The neodymium oxide averaged 20  of total REO  That is a phenomenal number  and it bodes well for the extraction of neodymium  TCMR  Neodymium is on the U S  Department of Energy s  DOE  list of most critical rare earth metals  RM  Five REEs dysprosium  neodymium  terbium  europium and ytterbium are considered to be the most critical of the elements in the DOE s Critical Metals Strategy report issued in December 2011  In a REE deposit  the distribution of the individual REOs as a percentage of the total REOs is very important  You want to be sure that you can pull the metal that is the most in demand and extract it at the most advantageous cost  The high grade rare earth oxides on the Sarfartoq project are associated with low levels of thorium  As a result  the thorium radiometric signature is an effective prospecting tool for identifying additional REE occurrences  Hudson is still defining the deposit  doing infill drilling and working on the metallurgy side  but also continues exploring in and around the project area  TCMR  Does it have a preliminary economic assessment  PEA   RM  Its PEA shows a net present value of  616 million  M  and an internal rate of return of 31 2  with a 2 7 year payback period  The study was based solely on the company s NI 43 101  Inferred resource of 14 1 million tons  Mt  at 1 5  total rare earth oxides  TREOs   It put another 8 000 meters  m  of drilling into it so far this year  It is going to enter 2013 with  7M in the treasury  There is a lot of news coming from Hudson  It has potential not just in its neodymium project  but all of its claims in the whole project area are highly prospective  There is blue sky discovery potential with Hudson  TCMR  Since Greenland shares some of its geology with northern Canada  what other minerals does it host  RM  North American Nickel Inc   NAN TSX V  is working on what could be a whole nickel camp up in Greenland  Its Maniitsoq property is a district scale project 4 800 sq km in size  Its mineral exploration license covers numerous high grade nickel copper sulphide occurrences associated with norite and other mafic ultramafic intrusions  It is part of a belt more than 70km long near Greenland s southwest coast  We know there is nickel there because we have historical results  However  I look at it as a new discovery  one that could actually put Greenland on the map  If investors buy North American Nickel at  0 20  they are getting what is a shot at a district size play  owned 100  by North American Nickel  For sheer size  plays like this do not come along often  I see this as a pure discovery story  It does not matter whether it is nickel or another metal  A discovery of this size and potential richness  in a politically stable  mining friendly country  will be rewarded enormously  Discovery plays get rewarded  no matter what the market is  TCMR  Any final thoughts  Rick  RM  Sally  all of the juniors we have talked about in this and previous interviews have a deposit and are working their way down the development path  Sooner or later  one of the majors will have to look at these juniors as opportunities to replace their reserves and grow their resources  That will happen not because the majors want to  but because they need

204534,426050,M,Arie Papernick s Formula To Profit From Canada s Booming Gold Exploratio,opinion,Bonanza grade discoveries in precious and base metals are energizing exploration across Canada  Arie Papernick of Secutor Capital Management Corp  believes that unflappable investors stand to be rewarded for buying at the bottom of the market  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Papernick points to promising developments for issuers prospecting in Canadian gold fields  including the mineral rich black tar sands and the Labrador Trough  He also suggests techniques for preserving capital so to survive the coming black swans  The Gold Report  With the shares of many functional junior gold mining firms experiencing a slump in market price  what will it take to bring them back to life  Arie Papernick  Institutional and retail investors invest in gold mining when they believe they will make a return  This belief is driven by an increase in discoveries  merger and acquisition  M A  activity and larger bought deal financings closing  M A deals generate confidence in the longevity of the junior gold mining sector and establish valuation reference points for stocks to trade up to  Mergers and acquisitions have been quiet on the junior side since IAMGOLD Corp  s  IMG TSX  IAG NYSE  takeout of Trelawney Resources Inc  and Yamana Gold Inc  s  YRI TSX  AUY NYSE  YAU LSE  takeout of Extorre Gold Mines Ltd   XG TSX  XG NYSE A  E1R FSE   TGR  How are discoveries a catalyst for building investor confidence  AP  Bonanza grade discoveries remind investors that meteoric returns are possible  and that brings people back into the sector  We ve recently seen a few such dramatic moves  Balmoral Resources Ltd   BAR TSX V  BAMLF OTCQX  saw its stock rise dramatically from its discovery on the Martiniere property east of Detour Lake  And JV partner GTA Resources and Mining Inc   GTA TSX V  saw its shares rise on the Hemlo Schreiber greenstone belt  Other names enjoying really good stock pops are Gold Reach Resources Ltd   GRV TSX V  and Gold Canyon Resources Inc   GCU TSX V   And the jolt that everybody is talking about now is the GoldQuest Mining Corp   GQC TSX V  copper gold result from the Dominican Republic  Its stock shot from  0 10 to  2 share  TGR  Where is the capital coming from for these types of investments  AP  Financings are crucial for the exploration industry  Companies need money to do the drilling to create the news to motivate the investment  and we ve seen a pick up in that  Quite recently  Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX V  announced a  130 million  M  bought deal  More moves like that will likely build confidence among institutional investors in the sector  TGR  Where are the most exciting new discoveries for precious and base metals in Canada  AP  Manitoba is exciting  Mega Precious Metals Inc  s  MGP TSX V  most advanced project there is called Monument Bay  The company is well funded  It has an open and an underground project  It has close to a 3 million ounce  Moz  compliant resource  Mega Precious is currently drilling 20 000 meters with a plan to update the resource in 2013  It has a very large land package with several targets and also has good relations with the First Nations  It kick started its environmental and socioeconomic studies early on in the program  There are new iron ore discoveries in the Schefferville area in Quebec  The Plan Nord and the province s commitment to expanding infrastructure in the north is encouraging to junior explorers  This is in addition to having favorable tax structures for both mining companies and investors  Beaufield Resources Inc   BFD TSX V  has a large land package in a great location in that area  It s surrounded by New Millennium Iron Corp   NML TSX   Tata Steel Minerals Canada Ltd   NML TSX   Labrador Iron Mines Holdings Ltd   LIM TSX   Century Iron Ore Holdings Inc   FER TSX V  and Champion Minerals Inc   CHM TSX   It s undeveloped  but Beaufield just completed a small drill program of 2 000 meters  and the results are encouraging  We ve been following another junior in that area  Fancamp Exploration Ltd   FNC TSX V   It monetized its interest in Champion Minerals and now owns 12 5  of it  It also owns 100  of Lac Lam l e  which is north of ArcelorMittal S A  s  MT NYSE  producing Fire Lake mine  Fancamp has produced some great intercepts  It is doing a drill program right now  with the expectation of delivering an NI 43 101 by the end of the year  Plus  the company just released some great news on a nearby property belonging to privately held Magpie Mines Inc   of which Fancamp owns 46   The project recently made its billion ton historic resource compliant  It also has an agreement with a Chinese company  Sichuan Nonferrous Material Technology Co  Ltd   to perform metallurgical analysis  Positive feedback from the metallurgy study would be great  as Fancamp plans to spin the venture off as a public company  TGR  What potential aquisitions are poised to take advantage of initiatives in Canada by the juniors  AP  Large firms with positive cash flows and companies looking to diversify their assets among resource classes and jurisdictions are in the buy market  TGR  Looking at the Alberta region  is there a synergy between metal mining and the oil tar sands operations that are already in place  AP  Not yet  but there s a company called DNI Metals Inc   DNI TSX V  DG7 FSE  that is attempting to change that  Its large Alberta property has expansive black shale hosting low metal concentrations  Its initial resource estimate for Buckton  which covers a fraction of its total land package  contains about 250 million tons with low parts per million grades of a host of different minerals like molybdenum  nickel  uranium  vanadium  zinc  copper  cobalt and even rare earths  It s a new type of deposit in Canada  but there are companies developing similar types elsewhere in the world  Talvivaara Mining Company Plc  TALV LSE  in Finland is probably the first of that sort to go into production  DNI is taking advantage of infrastructure that s already in place for the mining of oil sands and applying that to bulk metal mining  instead of building everything from scratch  TGR  DNI proposes to bioleach the black shales  How does that work  AP  Bioleaching operates with very low concentrations of various metals that cannot be efficiently smelted because there is no leading metal in these shales  In bioleaching  bacteria is cultured from a host shale  which is a living organism  and then used to extract the metals out of the ore  It s similar to  but much cleaner than  the traditional heap leaching technique  which uses cyanide  It s a low cost method and it s well known  but it takes a long time to process the ore and separate the metals out  Difficulties arise because of the different chemical behaviors of the metal mixes embedded in the shale  Metals respond differently to different chemical environments  DNI has been working on perfecting this technique with the CanmetENERGY technology center in Ottawa  TGR  There are advantages to exploring for metals in the areas in which the oil and gas companies are making a lot of headway  To what degree will the majors allow the juniors to keep absorbing the exploratory risk before investing in new projects  AP  What makes acquisitions attractive to a major is a quick  derisked addition to reserves  Juniors traditionally have absorbed the risk inherent in exploration work  and a major company generally won t pay an acquisition premium for a project that hasn t been derisked  Especially in the current climate  majors are looking for no loose ends  projects with everything ready to go so they can put in their capital and get into production  Of course  there are always exceptions  such as when the exploration potential is really  really strong  and a major will take over the exploration work before it gets to development  TGR  Are the seniors willing to compete against each other over these prospects in the junior space  AP  I think so  Right now  deposits with high grade  multimillion ounce potential are becoming rarer  especially in low risk countries  such as those in North America  which is why you re seeing more and more acquisitions in foreign  high risk countries  It s not by choice that the firms end up dealing with nationalization risk  high royalties and other political risks  We ve also seen some movement away from the high risk countries  Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  is selling its stake in African Barrick Gold Plc  ABG LSE  due to security risk and blackouts in the region  Properties with all the right features will definitely see competing offers from the majors  TGR  Alongside the opportunities in base and precious metals that you ve mentioned  are there any junior energy firms that you like in the same regions  AP  One of the companies that we follow in the energy space is Aroway Energy Inc   ARW TSX V  ARWJF OTCQX   located in Alberta s Peace River Arch  It s a well managed  fast growing company  It has a joint venture with a private company with significant infrastructure  which has lowered Aroway s operating costs  Aroway has expanded its land package significantly over the past year with positions near five majors  Current production is 650 barrels oil equivalent per day  boe d   and 90  of that is oil  Management plans to double that production by the end of the year to 1 200 boe d  They have a great track record and are exceeding their production targets  it s refreshing to see a team setting goals and meeting them  TGR  Are there any exciting developments in Ontario  AP  The IAMGOLD acquisition of Trelawney that was announced in early spring has major implications for Ontario miners  IAMGOLD has stated that it expects its gold production in North America to increase to 36  from 3  when C t  Lake goes into production  What s interesting here is that IAMGOLD inherited a joint venture partner called Sanatana Resources Inc   STA TSX V  when Trelawney acquired Augen Gold Corp  Sanatana will complete its earn in very shortly to be a 50  joint venture partner  The joint venture lands surround the C t  Lake deposit and may be needed for mine waste and tailing storage  Recent drilling indicates that the C t  Lake Trend could continue through some of those joint venture claims  Another name we like in Ontario is Northern Gold Mining Inc   NGM TSX V   which just announced that Greg Gibson  former CEO of Trelawney  is its new CEO  The property package is along the Destor Porcupine Fault zone  with unexplored ground along strike  So far  the company has announced over 1 Moz in the Measured and Indicated category with grades seeming to increase at depth  Northern Gold has just raised  13M  so it s well funded and will aggressively drill the property to convert resources to reserves and produce a prefeasibility study  Greg Gibson has many fans after the completion of the sale of Trelawney  so future work on Northern Gold will get noticed  Another name that we ve covered with Ontario properties is a producer  St Andrews Goldfields Ltd   SAS TSX   The company has three producing mines in the Timmins Camp  Operating costs have been coming down  It just announced strong Q2 12 and Q1 12 earnings  and production has been ramping up at its Holt mine  Management has been meeting guidance  It is forecasting 90 100 Koz production for this year and seems to be in a good position to meet that  Once the Taylor mine is put into production the company hopes by 2014 production will increase to 120 130 Koz  Meanwhile  it continues to do exploration around the surrounding areas to increase reserve life and mine life  TGR  Your investment firm  Secutor Capital Management Corp   specializes in  defensive capital management   Can you explain how that investment strategy applies to looking for solid investments in the junior metals mining space  AP  My practice at Secutor is restricted mainly to sophisticated  institutional portfolio managers who specialize in junior mining  as well as high net worth investors who meet the accredited investor criteria  I provide my clients with fundamental research and strategies to provide pricing advantages  which help create a defense to price swings in a volatile market  One way that I find pricing advantages is through initiating flow through private placements  which provide investors with a reduced after tax cost base  Also  many of the private placements that we organize and participate in include warrants  These provide extra leverage and an option of keeping exposure after a position has been sold to conserve capital  I also organize off market transactions priced at discounts to the market for those who need to trade restricted shares  This process can only be done with accredited investors  Most of the institutional investors that I deal with have the capacity to buy large baskets of stocks in the sector  and I think this kind of diversification is just as  or even more important than  fundamentals in the sector  It s increasingly difficult to pick out the next major discovery  in advance  with only limited exposure  TGR  How can retail investors best manage a portfolio of investments divided between junior and senior sectors  AP  A basket approach is mandatory when investing in the junior gold market space  It s really the only way to increase the chance to get exposure to the so called home run events before those results hit the market  The best way for individuals to do this is through a fund  Pinetree Capital Ltd   PNP TSX   which trades on the exchange  can be bought and sold like a stock  It basically represents a basket of juniors  It s managed by Sheldon Inwentash  who is a seasoned professional  It is clearly focused on the junior side of the market  You won t get much exposure to producers in this stock  If you re looking for producers  people like the well respected Kevin MacLean  at Sentry Select Capital Corp   are more focused on cash flowing names  TGR  What would reasonable ratios be for a retail investor looking to invest in both juniors and majors  AP  I can t really pinpoint a blanket ratio because it really depends on an individual s risk tolerance and net worth  Investing in the mining space  regardless of the size of the company  is risky  and it s clearly not for everyone  TGR  For the firms that you recommended  do you have any target prices that you re suggesting  AP  On our company reports  we do not include target prices  We do comparison tables so the clients can see relative value  Our clients are generally experienced investors and will pick their exit points as required when they re managing their portfolios  I think retail tends to put too much importance on actual target prices  whereas institutional investors want to be shown good ideas  and they figure out their own entry and exit points  TGR  Are there any tips  either for institutional or retail investors  on how to pick an exit point and stick to it  AP  The more important exit point is on the downside  needed for preservation of capital  I think to be a successful investor long term in any sector  you need to pick and stick to your downside exposure threshold  It s always harder to sell at a loss  but that s the more important discipline  It gets much easier as the stock is moving into a profit territory  Frankly  my feeling is that where you get out on the upside isn t as important as where you get out on the downside  TGR  Is this fundamentally part of a hedging strategy  AP  Hedging is a synonym for the preservation of capital  The only way to stay in the sector long enough to make sure that you have exposure to the next home run is to be in the game long term  The only reliable way is to focus your strategy on preserving your capital  That s just common sense  TGR  Thank you for your time   runs the Equity Capital Market s team at Secutor Capital Management Corp  in Toronto  His team specializes in raising private placement financings

204536,426052,M,Gold Vs  Bond  Which Is The Better Hedge ,opinion,When capital markets expand  the action is in the equity markets  When capital markets contract  bond markets are where the action is  because when credit and debt based markets reach their limit  debt  not credit  has the upper hand    Today s economists  trapped between the flawed theories of John Maynard Keynes and Milton Friedman  assiduously avoid the observations of Carl Menger and the Austrian School of Economics  But try as they might  the misguided and devoted followers of Friedman and Keynes can t escape the results of their misguided assumptions today  economies everywhere are drowning in debt  The inevitable collapse of over indebted economies is obvious to all except to those too fearful to confront their demise  Credit s excessive gifts have now been spent and exist today only as constantly compounding debts so large they are incapable of ever being repaid  The belief that an expanding GDP can save capitalism is no different than believing more worshipers of Baal could have saved Chaldea  SPECULATORS IN THE BULL RING In their illusory world of fantasy and finance  central bankers imagine themselves to be the matadors of the bond markets  expertly controlling the flow of bonds by fixing the rate of interest  but  in reality  central bankers are as much victims as the bulls the matadors stalk  and  like the bulls  their demise is certain  The real matadors are not the central bankers  The real matadors are the bond speculators  and  today  the bond speculators  too  are in danger  for today s bond markets are more dangerous than they have ever been  Pushed to their limits and of a size heretofore inconceivable  today s bond markets pose a danger not only to the speculators and central bankers in the ring but to the spectators in the stands as well  In my article  Will the US Devalue the Dollar   written just as the European sovereign debt crisis was beginning in 2010  I discussed the quandary of Bill Gross  founder and co chief investment officer of PIMCO  the world s largest bond fund  and a bond matador of justifiable repute    As Managing Director of PIMCO  the world s largest bond fund  Mr  Gross is in the business of buying debt and betting on the outcome  an avocation that increasingly resembles Russian roulette  Spreads on sovereign debt are rising and credit default swaps reflect the higher premiums being charged to protect against default  Investors such as Mr  Gross compare risk to reward in regards to debt and when the reward is believed to compensate for the risk  the bond is bought and the bet is placed    As we enter the end game  the odds  as in Russian roulette  exponentially increase making previous yield curves irrelevant  The trigger event may be Greece  Spain  the UK  the US  Latvia  Japan or some other nation  But  one thing is certain  when someone takes a bullet  all bets will be off  No one can cover what can t be covered   In March 2010  Bill Gross asked the question  What if   to put it simply   you couldn t get out of a debt crisis by creating more debt  The answer to that question will be supplied by the markets and soon  THE BONFIRE IN THE BOND MARKETS  The bond matadors  30 year run of luck is running out  Interest rates have fallen for 30 years making previously issued bonds more valuable  But  today  with US Treasury debt close to 0   interest rates can t go lower and bond valuations can t continue to rise   In the end game  the bond market will be capitalism s final resting place as issues of debt become paramount  In the end game  credit can no longer induce sufficient growth to cope with accelerating levels of debt  and when capitalism can t expand  it collapses  Capitalism is like a bicycle  It doesn t do well at slow speeds  We are moving into the end game  the grand denouement of credit and debt based markets  the grand finale of the debt super cycle  the crack up boom  the blow off Ludwig von Mises predicted would happen as a result of constantly expanding credit  THE END GAME AND THE COMING PANIC IN THE BOND MARKETSDavid Stockman  author of The Emperor is Naked and Reagan s former budget director  is an outstanding observer of America s problems in the end game  Recently  Stockman was asked by the editors of The Gold Report  what catalyst could bring the end game to a final resolution  The Gold Report  If we are in the final innings of a debt super cycle  what is the catalyst that will end the game   David Stockman  I think the likely catalyst is a breakdown of the U S  government bond market  It is the heart of the fixed income market and  therefore  the world s financial market   Because of Fed management and interest rate pegging  the market is artificially medicated  All of the rates and spreads are unreal  The yield curve is not market driven  Supply and demand for savings and investment  future inflation risk discounts by investors none of these free market forces matter  The price of money is dictated by the Fed  and Wall Street merely attempts to front run its next move   As long as the hedge fund traders and fast money boys believe the Fed can keep everything pegged  we may limp along  The minute they lose confidence  they will unwind their trades   On the margin  nobody owns the Treasury bond  you rent it  Trillions of Treasury paper is funded on repo  You buy  100 million  M  in Treasurys and immediately put them up as collateral for overnight borrowings of  98M  Traders can capture the spread as long as the price of the bond is stable or rising  as it has been for the last year or two  If the bond drops 2   the spread has been wiped out   If that happens  the massive repo structures that is  debt owned by still more debt will start to unwind and create a panic in the Treasury market  People will realize the emperor is naked   When bond markets crash  investors will rush the exits  those not already out the door will be trapped BILL GROSS NOW RECOMMENDS GOLD OVER STOCKS AND BONDS On September 5  2012  legendary bond trader  Bill Gross  said the age of credit expansion is over  Pension funds and individuals and investors that expect 10  consistent returns to pay those bills are going to be disappointed the price of gold will be higher than it is today and certainly a better investment than a bond or stock  which will probably return only 3  to 4  over the next 5 to 10 years  That  perhaps  the best and  certainly  the most well known of the world s bond traders  Bill Gross  is now recommending gold over stocks and bonds is extraordinary news  It is news  however  that will be ignored by most investors  i e  today s ostriches  who have made a living arbitraging the opportunities afforded by the bankers  paper markets for this is the time of the vulture    the vulture feeds neither upon the pastures of the bull nor the stored up wealth of the bear  The vulture feeds instead upon the blind ignorance and denial of the ostrich  The time of the vulture is at hand  p  5  Time of the Vulture  How to Survive the Crisis and Prosper in the Process  Darryl Robert Schoon  3rd ed   2012 Bill Gross knows the endgame is not the same game in which he made his reputation and considerable fortune  and  unlike his equities counterpart  Warren Buffet  who still believes paper markets will pay off in the future as they have in the past  Bill Gross is preparing for a future most investors cannot see and do not expect  Dancing in the endgame is going to be a bloody affair GOLD IN THE END GAME In the end game  gold is the ultimate hedge as gold is a hedge against both deflation and inflation  Deflation  characterized by a collapse in demand  is now in motion  and inflation and perhaps accompanied by its virulent stepsister  hyperinflation is coming  Buy gold  buy silver  have faith ,2012-09-11,Darryl Robert

204537,426053,M,Bonanza Discoveries That Will Drive Gold Stocks  Eric Coffin,opinion,New deposits and economic triggers will drive gold stocks  says Eric Coffin  the editor of HRA Journal  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Coffin identifies the management characteristics of gold juniors that make money for investors  A successful gold explorer in his own right  Coffin names his picks from the Yukon to the Caribbean  The Gold Report  Eric  why is there a bear market for metal mining companies in a season of bulls  Eric Coffin  Post recession  there was a good bounce for commodity stocks  Two problems have slowed things down during the last year  One was fear of the fiscal cliff as the politicians in Washington argued about raising the debt ceiling  Banks were blowing up in Europe  Most important  weakening numbers out of China scared off a lot of investors  particularly from the base metals  There are simply a lot of people concerned about the economy in general  and  specifically  the growth economies where metals are keys to industrial development  On the gold and silver side  the real issue is that gold is over  1 700 ounce  oz  and silver is now over  30 oz  It sounds as if I m being ironic  but I m not  At the start of this major cycle  gold prices were  300 oz  It was not the price earnings  P E  ratio that was determining the value of a lot of mining companies  it was the P E ratio plus a very large amount added for in the ground resources  Goldbugs at the start of this cycle expected gold and silver prices to go up 500   They were as interested  if not more interested  in the leverage  the  ounces in the ground per share  that gold stocks represented  I m not going to assume that gold is going to  10 000 oz  I d be really happy if it does  but I m not expecting it  What we are seeing now is that the P Es for the gold firms are returning to the market average  In the past  gold companies could trade at 80 90 P E  The earnings part didn t matter very much  It was all about the amount of gold resources on hand  Now investors are taking a harder look at how much money these firms are actually making  We can t just assume that gold is going up another 400 500   So the P Es have normalized  Another concern is profit margins  Costs have gone up very rapidly in the mining business  For a long time that was because there was a skills shortage  Part of the reason why we expected this to be a long secular bull market was because we knew how short the industry was on all kinds of skills  material and equipment  The mining sector was not going to turn around and suddenly start producing twice as much copper  zinc or whatever at the same cost  As the price of metals rises  so does the price of a geologist  the price of an engineer  the price of a ball mill  The situation will improve over time as more professionals are trained and the production capacity of industry suppliers is increased  but this takes time  The final piece of the cost equation for many metals is grade  As the  low hanging fruit  is picked and the industry moves to tougher terrain with less infrastructure and deposits with lower average grade  the cost of production rises  While I m not a big believer in things like  peak copper   at least not any time soon   supply is very much a function of price  If the world wants ever increasing amounts of metals it will have to pay up and pay the mining industry to supply them  The days of cheap metals  in most cases  are over  TGR  You observed recently in HRA Journal that the currently depressed junior gold explorer market is showing signs of life  Can you explain that  EC  One reason is that the market is running out of sellers  People who wanted out of gold equities are largely gone  there is a huge amount of money on the sideline  That puts in a bottom but doesn t cause a turnaround  I think the spark that gets the juniors moving again  as it has in many past cycles  is new discoveries  We haven t seen many discoveries that grabbed the market s attention in the last couple of years  Exciting discovery stories are critical to the junior mining sector  People need to be reminded of why they buy these high risk stocks  Investors do not buy a  0 10 share junior as a widow or an orphan stock  they buy it because they are swinging for the fences  It s hard for investors to talk themselves into swinging for the fences unless they are seeing others hitting one out of the park  A couple of recent home runs have generated a bit more liquidity in the market  but not as much as I d like to see  The summer is always slow  The real test is going to come in the next month or two  However  we are starting to see financings close again  And companies that have done well off of drill discoveries are getting big increases in stocks prices and  critically  we are seeing more of these companies maintaining higher prices  that generates money that gets redeployed  TGR  Let s talk about the discoveries  EC  GoldQuest Mining Corp   GQC TSX V  is a big win for me  David and I had specifically advised people to buy GoldQuest for its drill program and then it made an amazing blind discovery in the Dominican Republic  The best drill hole at this new zone  Romero  is on the order of 235 meters  m  of almost 8 grams ton  g t  gold and 1 5  copper  It has reported seven holes in a small area  but doesn t understand the geometry yet  It started out with small stepouts in an area measuring about 100x100m and is now starting larger stepouts  Not only are the grades strong  but also the zone is thick  GoldQuest is looking at 200 250m  intercepts  and all of the holes have bottomed in the zone  The small area drilled should contain over a million ounces and it s still wide open  That is a pretty impressive discovery  and GoldQuest stock reacted accordingly  It was  0 07 share when it announced the first drill hole  It s about  1 60 share now  It has raised  20 million in the last month and a half  most of that at  1 25 share  GoldQuest will drill the heck out of this  It has two drill rigs going  There s a third one in customs  which should be onsite in a week  and a fourth rig on the way  And  the success of this target increases the value of its other targets  For instance  it has 40 kilometers  km  of contiguous holdings covering a rock formation called the Tireo Volcanics  With cash from the new discovery in hand  GoldQuest can and will up its exploration budget on that set of properties that have several other early stage discoveries in addition to Romero  TGR  Are you following any particular gold miners in North America  EC  In the Yukon  ATAC Resources Ltd   ATC TSX V  is putting out really good holes  Kaminak Gold Corp   KAM TSX V  is also putting out good holes  although it is not putting them out as often as I would like  It has obviously gone to the whole batching idea  I also really like the look of Comstock Metals Ltd   CSL TSX V   It is operating on the other side of the Yukon River from the Golden Saddle discovery  Golden Saddle was discovered by Underworld Resources Inc   UW TSX  four years ago  which kicked off the whole Yukon area play  It was subsequently taken out by Kinross Gold Corp   K TSX  KGC NYSE   Kinross hasn t published a new formal gold resource number  but the jungle telegraph says it s between 2 25 2 5 Moz  Comstock has the same rocks and very similar mineralization on the other side of the Yukon River  the north side  It is about 15 km away  It put out a very strong 75m trench about a month and a half ago  averaging 3 75 g t  Last week  Comstock put out another set of trench results  extending the zone to almost 400m of strike length on surface  The average thickness is probably 70 80m  It compares quite favorably to Underworld s discovery  That was followed a few days later by the announcement of a drill start  This is in the far North  Just how much drilling gets completed this fall is weather dependent but based on those trenches  it s a strong looking target  TGR  Are there other explorers in northern Canada that have your eye  EC  On the opposite corner of the Yukon  there are really high grade numbers up to hundreds of grams per tonne gold coming from Northern Tiger Resources Inc  s  NTR TSX V  3Ace project this year  The company drilled several short holes in this new one but hasn t released results yet  The main question is how big is this thing  The deposit will have to be thick to get the market excited  but the grades are high enough that the tonnage could be small and yet still prove to be profitable  TGR  What about in the U S   Any names there  EC  I have liked Premier Gold Mines Ltd   PG TSX  for several years  It has developed nice land positions in Nevada and in Ontario  It s a good story at many levels  and it has one of the best management groups in the junior sector  Premier has several very good advanced projects in Ontario and Nevada where it s growing resources with ongoing exploration  It s a very solid stock with a wide following  Evolving Gold Corp   EVG TSX  EVOGF OTCQX  EV7 FSE  is drilling a project in the same area of Nevada as Premier  It has put out some good holes and some not so good holes  It needs to drill a range of deep holes to figure out the geometry  But it definitely has a Carlin zone  And in the Carlin mineralization  the gold tends to be very fine grained  It requires a lab assay  But there s no real shortcut for getting the wedge holes done in order to figure out which direction to chase the zone and determine if the one is large enough to justify larger drill programs  TGR  How does a smart investor in gold juniors separate the wheat from the chaff  EC  It s wise to focus on a geographic area that s already generated a lot of good news  If a company is looking for a bulk tonnage open pit type deposit  I look at the target size to be sure there is enough scale potential  I don t have a problem with the high grade ore  Good high grade deposits can be very profitable even though the market tends to focus on the big low grade systems  But to get the market s attention for an underground operation  there needs to be a minimum of 6 8 g t and  ideally  more than 10 g t in intercepts  In many areas you can make money on lower grades than that if there is good thickness but the market tends to ignore grades below 10 grams unless they are at least several meters thick  With bulk tonnage  you can get away with 1 g t or 1 5 g t  but for drilling at those grades  you want to see 60  80  100m drill intercepts  The property has to look strong from the outset  because the company has to keep raising money  That being the case  one looks for a management group with a strong brand and a track record of success both in market terms and in technical terms  Things can get difficult even when a discovery has been made if management isn t able to get the market to take notice  Having access to capital is huge for a junior  It s even more critical when the market is weak as it has been the past 18 months  When the market s great  everybody s happy  people will say  yes  to anything and it s much easier to raise money  But when the market is weak  management must be able to convince people to write a check  Of the 1 500 or so junior companies  there may be 100 that can do that in this type of market on non dilutive terms and no more  TGR  How s it going with Precipitate Gold Corp   PRG TSX V   which is in both the Dominican Republic and the Yukon  EC  I m pretty happy with it  By way of disclosure  as you know  Precipitate was founded by my late brother  David  and me and our friend Scott Gibson  We were very fortunate to be joined from the start by such a strong board and management team  Adrian Fleming is the chairman  he ran Underworld before it was taken out and has huge business credibility  The board includes Quinton Hennigh  a good friend and one of the smartest geologists I ve ever met  Both Adrian and Quinton know how to talk to the market  Our friend Gary Freeman is also on the board  Gary is a great financier  David and I had been involved with him in the early development of Pediment Gold Corp   PEZ TSX  PEZGF OTCBB P5E FSE   which was taken out by Argonaut Gold Inc   AR TSX   Darryl Cardey  who was the chairman of Underworld  is also on the Precipitate board of directors  Darcy Krohman  another longtime friend who has the unusual combination of dual professional standings both as a P  Geo geologist and a CA  is the president  Due to its very credible management team  Precipitate was able to do a  0 40 share initial public offering on early stage  Yukon properties in May with no warrants  Believe me  that wasn t a piece of cake  People bought the stock as a bet on management  Though we like the Yukon projects  it was no secret everyone involved with the company was  and still is  on constant lookout for projects that would be accretive and add value to the company  As it happens  just before Precipitate listed  GoldQuest made its discovery in the Dominican Republic  I m very good friends with Bill Fisher and Julio Espaillat  who run it  I ve always liked that belt of rocks  And it is not an exaggeration to say that GoldQuest and Gold Fields Ltd   GFI NYSE  invented the Tireo as an exploration destination  They did the regional work that focused on those rocks and the belt has generated several discoveries in its short 10 year exploration history  If Precipitate had said six months ago   Hey  we have a property next to GoldQuest   most people would have said   Who the hell is GoldQuest   Now  it s a different story  As soon as its first drill hole was announced  I was trying to find projects in the right rocks for Precipitate  That is not easy to do because the belt was largely tied up even before the Romero discovery  but we were lucky to get a large concession that has the right geology along its eastern side bordering Goldquest  This is early stage exploration but it s a great address and Romero is already looking as if it could be a world class discovery after only seven drill holes  TGR  Let s pull out and look at the macroeconomic level for a minute  What kinds of economic triggers are likely to affect gold equities positively or otherwise in the foreseeable future  EC  For the next three months  it s central banks  central banks and central banks  Everybody is expecting Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to kick in Qualitative Easing 3  QE3   I m slightly less convinced  but I m not going to complain if he turns on the printing press  The latest monthly employment report in the U S  was quite weak so that may be the trigger for a QE announcement  What Bernanke said at Jackson Hole brought the gold price back up through  1 700 oz  We are seeing similar indications out of the European Central Bank  ECB   Mario Draghi is telling the European countries that are anti stimulus   I m going to do it with you  or without you   And Germany s Chancellor Angela Merkel  who hasn t exactly been a proponent of bond buying  is now saying they have to stimulate  It looks like we could have stereo printing presses humming along on both sides of the Atlantic before long  Perversely  weak employment numbers and weak purchasing manager index numbers help precious metals  Weak economic indicators convince traders that Bernanke and the ECB are going to have to pull the trigger  On the base metals side  the easing could have the opposite impact  with one exception  If we continue to see weak numbers out of Beijing  the traders will think that Beijing is going to stimulate  too  But not with bond buying  The Chinese can simply loosen reserve requirements for the banks  They hold trillions of dollars in foreign reserves  Unlike Washington and most of the debtor countries in Europe  China can simply start writing checks  It  too  has been putting out weaker numbers and making more noise about stimulating  China does have slightly higher inflation  which makes things trickier  but I expect it to step up stimulus toward year end as the next generation of Communist Party leadership is sworn in  TGR  What effect would QE3 have on mining interests  generally  EC  It will help  QE3 will weaken the U S  dollar  It will cause traders to buy treasuries all the way up and down the yield curve  thereby lowering the yields  In the last couple of weeks  the U S  dollar index has dropped a couple of points  which is a fairly big move  As it moves lower  gold and silver prices in U S  dollars will strengthen  Then we will see better numbers in the U S  as businesses gain confidence and start hiring  Those hiring decisions are being held back right now because managers aren t comfortable with the slow growth rate  Virtually all traded commodities are priced in U S  dollars  so it should help them all  though precious metals will get the biggest  quickest boost  TGR  How will monetary easing affect mining in Mexico  EC  In Mexico  the peso is relatively weak by historic standards  which helps with mining costs  It has good mining infrastructure and good mining legislation  It doesn t have any real royalties to speak of  You don t get a lot of surprises there  However  areas of the country are bloody dangerous  that s the one thing that has held Mexico back recently  The drug cartels have scared people out of some areas  Nobody really knows who is calling the shots  You certainly don t get the impression that it is the Federales  the drug cartels do whatever they want  But people more or less know where the growing is and where the drug routes are  so they stay out of those areas  I d like to think that crime is not going to be a long term problem  There are still plenty of areas in Mexico that work out fine for miners  You must have agreements with the local ejitos  however  Although the ejitos don t own the mineral rights  they do have surface rights and they have local political power  So you need to sit down  talk to the locals and make sure that everybody is happy  because an angry ejito can really make your life miserable  There are some ejitos who just don t want development  And when the locals don t want you  there s just no point in bothering  All that said  it s a good country with lots of good geology and plenty of recent discoveries  If the government can get the crime issue under control  I don t doubt the high level of mining investment would continue and probably grow again  TGR  Are there any other companies that you think are hot  EC  I d keep an eye on Reservoir Minerals Inc   RMC TSX V   Its joint venture with Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc   FCX NYSE  is pulling some amazing drill holes in Serbia  It just put out the second one today the copper equivalent was almost 10  through 160m  That s a heck of a drill intersection  Freeport is not fooling around  It is doing big stepouts  It wants to know right away if it s the real thing and already has four drill rigs at work  At a more advanced level  I like EurOmax Resources Ltd   EOX TSX V   It is in several countries in Eastern Europe  including Serbia  It has a new management group that came directly out of European Goldfields Ltd   EGU TSX  EGU AIM   which was taken out about a year ago for about  1 5 billion  These guys have huge credibility  especially with European institutions  Euromax is drilling to expand Ilovitza  a copper gold porphyry in Macedonia  It has a couple of nice projects that have gold resources on them  but there is room for some more gain simply by the current management group going around and telling the story  Management views the asset set as very comparable to that of European Goldfields Ltd   EGU TSX  EGU LSE  but with one tenth the current market value  Speaking of Mexico  if you re interested in a production level story we like SilverCrest Mines Inc   SVL TSX V  SVLC NYSE MKT   We have followed the company since inception  I have a very high regard for the management team  which has been delivering on time and on budget for years  SilverCrest is generating nice profits from its Santa Elena gold silver mine in Sonora and plans are in the works to add a mill to this heap leach operation and start mining deeper parts of the system and double the production rate by 2014  SilverCrest is also drilling its La Joya bulk tonnage silver base metal project in Durango  There should be an updated resource estimate by the end of the year and it looks like it s going to be big  probably close to 200 Moz silver equivalent  SilverCrest has gotten a lot of traction as gold and silver prices jumped recently but if they keep going up  the company should too  TGR  Thanks  Eric  EC  You re welcome   is the editor of the HRA  Hard Rock Analyst  family of publications  He has a degree in corporate and investment finance and

204552,426068,M,Junior Miners Still Give The Street Something To Talk About  Philip Ker,opinion,Which junior miners are giving the Street something to talk about  Some shining examples of promising companies with good balance sheets do exist despite what seems like a market dominated by bad news  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Philip Ker  an analyst with Vancouver based Union Securities  shares the good news his latest site visits have revealed about projects in Nevada and Mexico  The Gold Report  Kitco reports that gold specific exchange traded products  ETPs  attracted  570 million  M  in net new funds  and holdings of gold ETPs hit an all time high of around 77 million ounces  Moz  during the second quarter  There were also inflows into silver ETPs of  269M  Will this impact mining equities  Philip Ker  We re in a period of extremely tight liquidity within capital markets  Any capital that s not being deployed into equities and transformed into ETPs will definitely impact equity valuations going forward  Keep in mind that exchange traded funds do offer variable perks  such as diversification and lower management fees versus other managed investment options  which is why a lot of investors are beginning to favor them  TGR  On a macro level  the problems of the euro continue to plague the U S  dollar denominated gold price  The International Monetary Fund recently said that there was  a sizeable risk  of deflation in the Eurozone  What is Union Securities  view of what s happening in Europe and the possible effect on the gold price  PK  We believe that this is just a temporary shift out of the Eurozone  which is ultimately strengthening the U S  dollar while consequently weakening the gold price  In the longer term  we see the gold price going much  much higher  The substantial leverage created by the U S   escalating debt will cause investors to shift away from these temporary investment vehicles and back into the safety of gold  TGR  When we talked to you in February you were predicting an average 2012 gold price of  1 725 ounce  oz  and  34 50 oz for silver  Have those numbers been revised since  PK  We re maintaining those targets until some macroeconomic things evolve and answers begin to be known  particularly concerning the skepticism within the market about the Eurozone and U S  debt issues  There are also several significant elections globally  including the U S  presidential election in November  TGR  You must think that gold s going to have a strong finish this year then  PK  That s correct  We are pretty optimistic for a strong run later this year and view the current lull in precious metals and relative equities as only a temporary phase of market sentiment  TGR  Small cap resource equities are down an average of roughly 40  since September 2011  Why should investors continue to hold these companies  PK  The overall perspective of the investment community is that we are in a fairly bearish cycle  Fortunately for investors  markets are never static and there s always an upside  I prefer the view to buy and accumulate when no one else believes there is money to be made  Buying at opportune times such as now positions one ahead of the herd and can churn much more profitable investments  If investors are well positioned and ready to take advantage of the market  they can be very prosperous in the long run  TGR  You like sizeable and growing mining friendly jurisdictions  What are some of the companies you re following that fit those terms  PK  Geologix Explorations Inc   TSX GIX  OTCQX GIXEF  has a great gold copper resource base in Mexico  In addition to its huge 187 million ton resource containing 4 5 Moz of gold equivalent  the company recently identified additional targets about 1 5 kilometers north of its resource boundary  Several of these anomalies are looking quite interesting from their geophysical signatures and preliminary sample results  The exploration team is currently taking additional prospecting and chip samples on the targets and will continue sampling and delineating them through an upcoming 5 000 meter  m  program  TGR  When should we know how much this new mineralized zone could add to its Tepal project s resource  PK  The company is aiming to start its shallow drill hole program later in August  I expect to see assay results in late September or October and that will give us a good indication of grades and potential  A secondary program would follow up on successful results  TGR  Geologix has a prefeasibility study due in the third quarter  What does that study need to show in order to move the needle at the company  PK  The study should confirm that the economics of Tepal are robust  The project has a strong net present value  a long mine life and good production numbers at low operating costs  Unfortunately  Geologix has a lower market cap of about  30M at this time and capital expenditure  capex  requirements pushing  400M  It could be a severe challenge to get project financing  However  it should be able to use the prefeasibility study to its advantage in negotiating its financing options  TGR  Do you believe that it will have to fully delineate that new mineralized zone before this project gets green lighted  PK  I don t think so  but it definitely adds upside  What s been indicated in the chip samples thus far is that grades are 2 3 times higher than what is in the current resource  It only gets better from here if there are additional grades and economic tonnage to be added  TGR  What are some other companies you re following  PK  Northern Graphite Corporation  TSX V NGC  OTCQX NGPHF  recently put out a bankable feasibility study and the market had mixed reactions  This was due to slightly higher than anticipated capex requirements and any potential dilution that may come into play as it raises capital to start the groundwork at Bissett Creek in Northern Ontario  TGR  Northern Graphite is looking at possibly selling battery grade graphite at a substantial premium to concentrate  The economics of that idea were not included in the recent feasibility study  Have you developed any models on how that could change the economics of Bissett Creek  PK  My target actually includes the production of battery grade graphite  I changed my model and increased my target substantially when Northern Graphite confirmed that spherical high purity graphite could be made from its large flake deposit  Currently  the company is investigating what parameters and infrastructure would be needed for upgrading a recovered flake concentrate to high purity battery grade material  Management is indicating that it would need approximately  10M in addition to the current capex requirements for the required processing facilities  An engineering study into the upgrading scenario is under way and we can expect the results of that later this year  Adding this circuit provides a substantial premium for spherical graphite of approximately  5 000 ton  TGR  Right now  the company has about 60M shares outstanding  Considering those new capex requirements  how high do you think that float could go  PK  It all comes down to an offtake agreement  I know management is keen on having some skin in the game from an offtake suitor  I believe the company will be working diligently on this over the next few months to solidify its financing options  TGR  You regularly conduct site visits  Tell us about some of your recent trips  PK  A few months back I toured Rye Patch Gold Corp   TSX RPM  OTCQX RPMGF  in Nevada  The company is in an interesting scenario because of its current litigation with Coeur d Alene Mines Corp   NYSE CDE  TSX CDM  over some lapsed property claims that Rye Patch picked up  If Coeur d Alene is continuing to mine the Rochester pit and is damaging Rye Patch s claims  under current mining laws in Nevada  damages done to another s claims requires three times the gross metal value taken out of the ground to be paid to the injured party  I believe Rye Patch is in a situation where it will either be taken out or awarded a substantial settlement  TGR  You think the companies are likely to settle out of court for cash  PK  To avoid the court battle and have the litigation result in favor of Rye Patch  I believe it s in Coeur d Alene s best interest to settle out of court through a lump sum or just purchase the company outright  If the latter occurs  Coeur would add over 2 5 Moz gold and 32 Moz silver to its asset base plus upside from its exploration prospects in the Cortez Trend  TGR  Rye Patch has the Wilco deposit in Nevada that it s proving up  After seeing some of the core first hand  what were your thoughts  PK  The site visit was a great learning tool to see the size potential of not only Wilco  but the entire Oreana Trend  It s definitely in a good jurisdiction to be in for developing gold and silver projects  Wilco is a small past producing pit  but there still remains a lot of upside and recent drilling targeted mineralized zones down dip along structurally controlled contacts  The recently updated resource proved the beauty of the beast and although low grade  an abundance of these deposits in Nevada get mined because of the simple fundamentals  infrastructure and quality personnel located in Nevada  I can see this is going to a mine someday with continued work on the property  TGR  You recently launched coverage of Atna Resources Ltd   TSX ATN   which increased its gold production by 30  in 2011 and almost doubled its total Measured and Indicated gold resources  which are spread over several projects in the western U S  What catalysts lie ahead for Atna  PK  This is a great story and my current top pick  Last year  Atna picked up 100  ownership of the previously producing Pinson Mine just 30 miles north of Winnemucca  Nevada  The company is currently working underground with plans of commencing full production in Q4 12  Management plans on going from a small miner s permit  which allows only 36 500 tons per year  to a full production permit of 400 000 tons per year in 2013  It should more than double its production in 2013 and beyond based on the addition of Pinson production alone  The company is also poised for internal growth by using internal cash flows from its Briggs and Pinson mines to fund development at the Reward Mine  The Reward mine is also in Nevada  has easy access to infrastructure and will provide low operating costs under a heap leach mining method  I believe Atna will have this project pouring gold in 2014 and would be the third producing mine under Atna s asset portfolio  TGR  Atna is developing quite the following  Joe Mazumdar  an analyst at Haywood Securities  follows the company  as does Rahul Paul at Canaccord  Pinetree Capital CEO Sheldon Inwentash and his holding company own almost 10  of Atna  Why does this junior have such a strong institutional following  PK  Atna has a great pipeline of projects and an experienced management team to bring them into production  Acquiring the Pinson Mine at such a near term production phase definitely gives the Street something to consider  The scale and ramp up of its production from Briggs  and with the addition of Pinson  and shortly thereafter Reward  Atna has created a substantial growth trajectory for the company and for investors to look forward to  TGR  Are there other companies under coverage that you d like to tell us about today  PK  I toured Kootenay Silver Inc  s  TSX V KTN  Promontorio deposit in Sonora  Mexico  earlier this year  I came away quite impressed with the core and the layout of the land there  Management is extremely knowledgeable in hydrothermal type deposits  I am currently anticipating a resource estimate to come out sometime in August and am targeting approximately 100 Moz silver equivalent  which is five times its historical resource  Management now thinks a substantial gold credit may be worked into the resource and would add additional value to the project valuation  The stock has performed quite well during this market turmoil  I believe a lot of investors are keeping a close eye on it and it will be a good growth story moving forward  TGR  You had a  2 50 target price on Kootenay around Christmas 2011  What s your target now  PK  It s  1 75  It was cut based on lower comparable in situ valuations for other silver explorers and developers  TGR  The Promontorio deposit is quite promising and reasonably high grade  What about its mineability  Is the geological structure set in a way that s going to make this easy to mine  PK  The deposit is a hydrothermal breccia and the structure could be easily mined with a combination of open pit and underground mining to target the various zonations and concentrations of higher grade mineralization  The deposit has only undergone one good round of drilling and management is planning additional exploration within the center of the zone in order to further prove continuity between the northeast and the southwest zones where the historic pit is located  TGR  Then we don t really know yet if there s no pit wall drilling  Can you tell us about some recent results that keep you optimistic about Kootenay  PK  It s definitely had some bonanza grade intercepts  especially up in the northeast zone  It s had exceptional numbers of about 18m of 873 grams ton  g t  silver equivalent within an intercept of 71m of 297 g t silver equivalent  The strong metal credits from lead and zinc  and now possibly gold  lead to a good indication of metal credits should the project become a mine one day  TGR  Of the companies you cover  which one is best positioned for a takeover  PK  I d say Timmins Gold Corp   TSX V TMM  NYSE A TGD  is positioning itself nicely for M A activity  Its San Francisco mine is located in a mining friendly jurisdiction of Sonora  Mexico  and it has the infrastructure in place with considerable mine life remaining  Last year the company added over 1 Moz to the deposit through drilling and is currently expanding its throughput at the mine in order to achieve 32 000 tonnes per day  which will help the company exceed 130 000 ounces of production annually  A complete takeover or a merger of equals could be a likely outcome in the future  TGR  When adding positions to a portfolio would you suggest dollar cost averaging or looking for value in this market  PK  At this time I would first look at companies with strong balance sheets and growth profiles  You know these companies won t have to go to the market and end up with any equity dilution  especially at depressed prices  Then  if investors already hold those equities  I d definitely take a look at the dollar cost average if their portfolios are down  It could make the timing of the break even point come faster and they could dissolve the position and look at other investment opportunities  TGR  Could you please provide our readers with a bit of a pep talk to raise their spirits before you go  PK  It s an ugly time in the market but it s a great time to be a value shopper for cheap mining stocks  I suggest taking advantage of this market to perform due diligence in order to pick the next winners  because there is always an upside to the market and there will always be more profits to be made  We ve seen several good spikes out there  with parabolic looking charts for some explorers  even in these tough markets  Investors should prepare and not be last on the train when the next upward ride in the market comes  TGR  Thanks  Phil  is a mining analyst for Union Securities Ltd   a company formed in 1963 that is now one of the largest independent brokerage firms in Canada  The

204553,426069,M,What Moves Gold Stocks   Jocelyn August,opinion,Gold and precious metals stocks are certainly affected by the price of the underlying commodity  but the most important catalysts that move prices revolve around resource assessments and production schedules  Sagient Research Senior Analyst Jocelyn August watches her companies like a hawk and records detailed data on how stocks move when certain events are made public  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  August shares her thoughts about a select group of stocks and what events might move these shares over the next quarter  The Gold Report  What kinds of catalysts move gold and other precious metals stocks the most  Jocelyn August  The announcements that move gold and precious metals stock are ones that indicate economic viability of a project  such as a feasibility study or the preliminary economic assessment  PEA   which obviously indicate the strength of the mineral or resource  Also  a resource estimate or even updated mineral resource estimates move these stocks because they can show whether or not a resource is getting larger  or if a company has been able to convert some of the mineral resource to a more economically strong asset  So  typically  we ll see a positive move as long as the catalyst indicates positive economic viability or an increase of the mineral resource  TGR  In the current environment  do catalysts matter  JA  They do matter  I know that last quarter was a negative quarter for a lot of stocks  But we did see a lot of stock movement in Q2 12 in the natural resources realm  We actually recorded 14 double digit stock price moves  including four in the gold sector  Some of these are positive and some of them are negative  TGR  Can you give me some examples of major one day movement  JA  In gold  the largest one day move was a 13 6  downward move for Seabridge Gold Inc   TSX SEA  NYSE A SA  after its announcement of the completion of its updated preliminary feasibility study at the Sulphurets deposit at its Kerr Sulphurets Mitchell  KSM  project  The company framed it  of course  as a positive announcement with improvement in net present value and internal rate of return  but  in fact  the company had to make some concessions for the project plans in order to better accommodate the aboriginal communities and to address some permitting concerns  So  there was some negative news that was actually hidden in the announcement itself  Also in gold  we had a one day positive move of 13  from Golden Minerals Company  TSX AUM  NYSE A AUMN  after it announced a resource estimate for its Velarde a project in Mexico  We saw some positives and some negatives  but overall the catalysts do matter in this environment because these kinds of announcements do tend to affect the stock price  up or down  in a larger way than just regular news  TGR  What companies would you like to talk about  JA  Vista Gold Corp   NYSE A VGZ  TSX VGZ  is one  we re expecting Q3 12 to be a pretty eventful quarter for Vista  It has a couple of major projects it is working on  including the Mt  Todd gold copper project in Australia and the Concordia gold project in Mexico  Both of those projects are still awaiting permits in order to begin construction  Both of the permitting processes have experienced some significant delays  so this is pushing back the start of production at both of these places  We anticipate several announcements on these projects this quarter  The company also has planned to release an updated resource estimate at Mt  Todd later this quarter  which it has hinted will be likely to show an increase in the Measured and Indicated resources at this project  TGR  Would you go ahead and talk more about Vista s upcoming catalysts  I know there s a PEA you expect to hear about by the end of Q3 12  JA  Vista Gold is still an exploration company and it could become a producer in 2013 or 2014 if the construction permit timelines are met for Mt  Todd or Concordia  It is also working on a couple of other prospects  including the Guadalupe de los Reyes project  which we re expecting a PEA on in Q3 12  The PEA is a necessary step for feasibility  it s an important step that will provide information regarding economic parameters and detailed cost estimates and will also allow Vista Gold to establish a pit design for the project  I think it s really great for it to be adding more projects to its portfolio and continuing to work on other projects  given that Concordia and Mt  Todd have experienced significant delays  TGR  Vista Gold s relative strength has been high  It s far from the worst in its peer group over the last three months  It s up 5  in that period when many companies are down double digits  Relatively speaking  the Street seems to like it  JA  It does  I think Vista Gold has some really good projects that it is working on  It seems to have diversified  It is not putting everything into one project  TGR  What other company did you want to talk about  JA  I also wanted to discuss Augusta Resource Corp   TSX AZC  NYSE A AZC  FSE A5R   Augusta has had a lot of announcements in the past couple of weeks since we released our Outlook report  It has been working on its Rosemont project for quite some time  and it has had to get a lot of permits for this project  It is expecting receipt of the final two permits needed to start construction  the air quality permit and the Clean Water Act permit  in Q3 12  Hopefully  it will be able to get those  The company announced earlier this month that the Arizona Superior Court for Pima County has ruled in its favor regarding an appeal it had of the Pima County Air Quality Hearing Board s denial of the air quality permit  So  hopefully Augusta will be able to receive this permit in Q3 12  TGR  That has to be the single biggest catalyst or event that could happen to the company  JA  Yes  Augusta needs to get that air quality permit first  After that  it needs to finalize the economic impact statement and finalize the record of decision  When our analyst team wrote the Outlook report  Augusta was also expecting Q3 12 for that  but recently it announced that it was probably going to be by the end of 2012  This is going to further delay start of construction and start of production  which until recently was expected in 2014  But earlier this month  it changed that to 2015  TGR  There are so many issues confronting Augusta  Is this speculative  or do you feel there s now a reasonable opportunity for production to begin in 2015  JA  As you said  there are so many issues that it has been confronting  I ve been following Augusta for five years now  and I think it originally started with 2010 as its estimate for production start  As you know  Rosemont is Augusta s major focus  It doesn t currently generate revenue from any other mine projects  It is putting all of its eggs in this one  hopefully large basket  I think that we need to see some more progress in terms of the permits and get construction started before we can give a really good estimate for a timeline for production  TGR  Do you still follow MAG Silver Corp   TSX MAG  NYSE MVG   JA  I do  It has some potentially large impact catalysts coming up in Q3 12 for several of its projects  We re expecting some drilling and permitting announcements for La Esperanza as well as for Mojina  It is also working on the Cinco de Mayo project where we re expecting a PEA at the Pozo Seco deposit and also a resource estimate at Jose Manto  Cinco de Mayo is actually its second in line project  TGR  Cinco de Mayo is 100  owned  JA  Yes  it is 100  owned  but if you look at company documents  they usually highlight the Juanicipio project more so than Cinco de Mayo  Juanicipio is 44  owned by MAG and 56  owned by Fresnillo Plc  OTCPK FNLPF   For that project  there was a recent catalyst that occurred  which was its PEA  and we actually saw an 8  move downward  TGR  Jocelyn  over the past four weeks  MAG Silver is down 1   Now  to me  that looks like a very strong stock compared to its peers  Even large cap silver miner Coeur d Alene Mines Corp   CDM TSX  CDE NYSE  is down 12  during that same period  Could this mean that this stock is prepared for some nice upward movement on good news  JA  I think it is prepared for some large upward movement if it has some good news  The company has some potentially large events coming up this quarter  We ve been waiting for a while for some permitting and test results for some of the smaller projects  I think MAG could have one of those very large press releases where it gives a lot of positive news  resulting in a very large day  TGR  So you re positive on this company  JA  Yes  TGR  Mergers and acquisitions are a catalyst  Extorre Gold Mines Ltd   TSX XG  NYSE A XG  FSE E1R  is being acquired by Yamana Gold Inc   TSX YRI  NYSE AUY  LSE YAU   JA  Extorre jumped 50  after that announcement  which is basically what Yamana plans to pay for it  It s going to be a great buy for Yamana because Extorre s Cerro Moro project looks as if it could be very lucrative  TGR  Could this be the beginning of a wave of new consolidation in gold and silver  JA  I ve been reading that as well  that this could be the beginning of a lot of mergers and acquisitions activity in gold  TGR  What about Great Basin Gold Ltd   TSX GBG  NYSE A GBG   Do you follow that  JA  We do  We have some upcoming catalysts for Great Basin  particularly at the Hollister property  which is a gold mine in Nevada  It is waiting on an environmental impact completion statement  as well as a record of decision  So these could be some large impact catalysts for it  That would enable it to begin to start commercially producing in this area  It does already have some production from Burnstone  but it doesn t look like too much  TGR  Another one  Do you follow Royal Gold Inc   NASDAQ RGLD  TSX RGL   JA  We do  Royal Gold is interesting because it is a royalty company  and it has small portions of a lot of projects  TGR  Because the revenue is royalty based  I m wondering what catalysts are pertinent  It s up 24  over the past three months  JA  In 2013  we re looking at  200 million  M  in revenue that we re expecting from new catalysts  like production starts  So it looks as if it has a lot happening next year  TGR  Companies that make royalty revenues have low cost of sales because royalties come in on the top line and go down unmolested to the bottom line  Is that a bullish point for Royal Gold  JA  A lot of companies  especially gold and mineral companies  are experiencing pretty high cash costs in a lot of their projects  If a royalty company is able to gain some revenue from these projects without having to worry as much about the high costs of producing the mineral  it s obviously a much better situation for it  TGR  Could you generalize that small cap stocks have been resistant to good news  JA  Not necessarily  At the end of June  we actually saw a huge move for Quaterra Resources Inc   TSX V QTA  NYSE A QMM   which is a very small market cap company  only about  61M  It had an updated resource estimate  and it had an 18  positive move after that  That was for the Nieves project  TGR  Are you positive on Quaterra  JA  It is still a small company and looks as if it is working on a lot of different projects  Again  probably this Nieves project would be the main project  but I think we have to wait and see  I m probably neutral on this one  I d have to wait and see what other results come from the PEA  which is actually a catalyst for Q3 12  TGR  You mentioned Aurizon Mines Ltd   TSX ARZ  NYSE A AZK  the last time we spoke  JA  It definitely has a lot of projects going on  We re still waiting on the catalyst that we had highlighted last time  which is a resource estimate from the Marban block in Quebec  It recently had some news for the Joanna gold project in development  also in Quebec  It is working on a couple of deposits there  On July 9 it announced some results for Heva and Hosco  TGR  Thank you very much for your insights  Jocelyn  JA

204554,426070,M,John Doody s Three Secret Factors For Beating The Indexes,opinion,John Doody doesn t run off chasing down Indiana Jones  lost gold mines in Peru  He focuses on producers or near producers whose reserves have been verified as economic to produce  A former professor and the author of the Gold Stock Analyst  Doody has been lying in wait for the market to reach bottom  at which point he ll be ready to deploy the one third of his portfolio he s been holding in cash into his top 10 stocks  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Doody shares the metrics he uses to nail down those companies  The Gold Report  After a couple of big pushes up last year to  1 900 ounce  oz   the gold price has been bouncing around  1 600 oz  You ve pointed to a lack of investor enthusiasm for the stall  Do you see that changing any time in the near future  John Doody  In this now 11 year bull market  gold actually ran up to several tops before the most recent one of  1 895 oz in August 2011  In 2006  it topped out at  725 oz and it was 27 months before it moved higher  Then in 2008  it topped out at  1 011 oz  and it took 26 months to go higher  Running up and settling back is typical of any market that gets overenthusiastic  We re in the same basic formation  What drives the gold price is still the major factor in this market  real interest rates  The U S  real rate of return  risk free Treasuries minus inflation  is negative  and ultimately  that number will come to the fore and drive the gold price higher  Unfortunately  it drives everybody crazy that the economics and the gold price aren t linked like Siamese twins  nor are the stock prices and gold price  That s why investors need guidance and help  If they were linked  people wouldn t need to buy a newsletter  TGR  Very true  How high could gold go  JD  Predicting gold s future price is a fool s errand because nobody really knows  You can say what the gold price would have to be for the gold at Fort Knox to fully back the U S  currency  which is around  9 000 oz  Maybe that s the high end of the range  When people talk that number though  I m always willing to agree with the caveat of   Well  in whose lifetime   I d be very comfortable seeing gold above  2 000 oz this year  but it s partly a function of the macroeconomic environment  what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke does to get us out of our economic funk and what the Europeans do to solve their currency crisis  I m pretty happy being on the side for higher gold  The smart money is there  All the people whose names we all recognize as intelligent money managers have their bets on a higher gold price  The last thing one wants to do is get tied into some time frame  though  because it is often easier to spot value than it is to pick the time frame at which that value will be recognized  That said  I should tell you what I ve been telling my subscribers since the middle of last year  We have been in what we call our one third portfolio position where we re one third cash  one third gold and one third the Gold Stock Analyst  GSA  Top 10  We know that gold is less volatile than the gold stocks  but we also know that the GSA Top 10 is by far and away the best performing stock portfolio in the gold universe  We know we re going to catch the bottom with our one third in the Top 10  We re down about 6  this year  which is a lot better than the indexes  We re down 6 3  for the GSA Top 10  The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Sector Index  XAU NASDAQ  is down 16 5   the AMEX Gold BUGS Index  HUI NYSE  is down 17 9  and the Market Vectors Junior Miners ETF  GDXJ NYSE A   which is the index of junior gold miners  is down 22 2   Our intent is to catch the bottom we re already in the right stocks and spend the one third cash that we are holding when we re fully convinced that the bottom is here  Even if we re 10  off  it s OK  We ll double down with that one third cash and go two thirds into the GSA Top 10  The last time we did this  the GSA Top 10 gained almost 300  in the two years beginning in January 2009  Gold was up 61  and the XAU was up 83   TGR  Let s talk about some of your success  You have stressed that good stock picking can beat the indices  What are some of the factors you use to create your Top 10 list  JD  Yes  it can  For years  we ve proven it  We focus on a unique sector of the stock market that doesn t lend itself to Indiana Jones  lost gold mines in Peru stories that other guys focus on  We focus on 60 gold mining stocks that have data  are either in production and have reserves and current production or a feasibility study that shows that a site is economic and is in the process of raising the money to build it or is in the middle of construction  This is a market segment in which the stocks are generally larger  In the Top 10  the smallest has a market cap of  200 million  M   with the largest at  11 billion  B   Unless you know how the whole industry is valued  you don t know what s undervalued and overvalued  We know how the market values the average ounce of production and the average ounce of reserves  Then we can take an individual stock and look at that versus the averages and say   Well  gee  this stock is really high versus the average so maybe we don t want to own it  or it s really low versus the average   How come  Maybe it s being overlooked  Maybe it doesn t have any sponsorship  Maybe it doesn t do any financing so the brokers aren t interested in it  The brokers are still all whores and there s no such thing as a Chinese wall  They cover companies that are going to do deals just as other newsletter guys cover companies that pay them  We re totally 100  subscriber supported  We do objective analysis  Then we take a look at how the market is capitalizing an ounce of a company s Proven and Probable reserves  and an ounce of their production  We incorporate the mine s profitability by looking at the operating cash flow from the mine and what the ratio of market cap to operating cash flow is  The average ounce of production among our 60 stocks  as of July 30  is valued at  5 332 by  Mr  Market   The average cash flow multiple is 5 2  in other words  the market capitalization divided by the profitability of the mines  The average ounce of Proven and Probable reserves is valued at  247  TGR  Which number would you say is the most important one  JD  All three  The operating cash flow multiple tells you how the company is doing now based upon its production and cash costs versus the market  The reserves represent how the market is valuing the future production  because companies typically have 10 times or more of current production in their reserves  Current production tells how a company is doing now versus its competition  All three of those are important metrics  TGR  Are those numbers lower than they were  say  three years ago  JD  The average operating cash flow ratio since October 2008  which was the market low  has been 8 7x  Now at 5 2x  Mr  Market is not rewarding the gold miners for the profits that they re earning  We re seeing this in the executive suites  Companies are doing pretty well in terms of profits  but the stock prices are doing very poorly  Aaron Regent  the head of Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE   got fired  The head of Kinross Gold Corp   K TSX  KGC NYSE   Ty Burt  just got fired  There is a lot of executive turnover because boards are unhappy with the stock prices  They re looking for people who can lead them to higher stock prices  TGR  Sounds as if there is a lot of room for upside there  JD  A tremendous amount  TGR  Are you buying and selling a lot in that third that you have invested in stocks  or are you holding  JD  We make changes in the Top 10  but we re not a trading letter  We look for situations that can double based upon the analyses that we do  This year we ve made two sells and one buy  We re currently holding 10  in cash in that Top 10 as well as one third cash in the overall portfolio  TGR  Because you re waiting for that bottom  JD  We re waiting for that opportunity  We ve been doing that for a year now  TGR  You recently launched a new Silver Stock Analyst newsletter  The silver price is down by about 40  for the year  Why are you doing this now  JD  Silver is gold on steroids  It s extremely volatile  much more volatile than gold  In the October 2008 crash  silver fell 54  from its July 15 high  and gold fell 28  from its July 15 high  On the other side  from January 2009  when the market finally got some footing back  until June 15  2012  silver gained 158  whereas gold gained 87   TGR  So  there s more downside and upside  JD  The macroeconomic stage is set for gold to go higher  and that should mean that silver should do even better  I ve told people to put 5 20  of their money into silver stocks  We re doing essentially the same fundamental analyses with silver that we do for gold stocks  We look for production and reserves  at who s cheap and who s not cheap  We don t look at exploration plays  We don t know anything about some stock in Peru that s drilling holes  Those juniors are basically just lottery tickets  We analyze 25 primary silver producers in the Silver Stock Analyst  From those  we pick what we call our  Fave 5   TGR  It s been a challenge for gold and silver juniors this last year to access capital  Do you see that changing  JD  Not until there s enough investor enthusiasm to attract new people into the market and it filters down to the juniors  TGR  With all the bargains out there right now  do you foresee a lot of mergers and acquisitions for the rest of this year  JD  We talk to companies  We know what they re looking at  We identified in advance for subscribers an acquisition that New Gold Inc   NGD TSX  NGD NYSE A  made two years ago  in which it bought Richfield Ventures Corp   RVC TSX V   We knew what New Gold was looking for and we told subscribers  We never covered Richfield as a Top 10  but we told them as sort of a bonus that we thought that New Gold would buy it  The stock was around  6 60  and New Gold took it out six weeks later at  10  New Gold is in the market for another company because it has flat production  The market hates flat production  It wants to see gold miners increase production every year  New Gold has a flat period of production coming up from 2014 to 2017 of about 500 000 ounces  500 Koz  year  After that  in 2018  the British Columbia based Blackwater deposit  which has about 10 million ounces  is going to kick in along with El Morro in Chile  It s going to buy something to fill that hole  We ve made some speculations about what that could be in our newsletter  If you re talking to the companies  you can see that they re all looking  Primero Mining Corp   PPP NYSE  P TSX  made a bid for Northgate Minerals Corp   NGX TSX  NGX NYSE A  and got trumped by AuRico Gold Inc   AUQ TSX  AUQ NYSE   It is in the market  and we have some ideas who it might buy  Yamana Gold Inc   YRI TSX  AUY NYSE  YAU LSE  made a pre emptive cash bid for Extorre Gold Mines Ltd   XG TSX  XG NYSE A  E1R FSE  in Argentina recently  That company was on other companies  radar screens  but Yamana had the synergies and we know it pre empted another company  We re going to see mostly cash bids  Companies have learned to be cautious about issuing shares  which is good for shareholders  If you can buy incremental production and not get dilution  that s very good for shareholders  TGR  And these acquisitions can help both the share price of the acquirer and of the acquiree  right  JD  Yes  particularly when it pays cash  Yamana paid maybe  400M in cash and it still had some  500M left over  It has a mine operating cash flow of more than  1B year  This was not a major deal  It was a 200 Koz year acquisition that will fit nicely into its portfolio of mines  A couple of the stocks we have in the Top 10 are acquisition targets  They re either building a mine or are fully permitted to build  They re turn key ready  and we expect they ll get acquired  TGR  Royalty companies make up a good portion of your Top 10  Do you expect there to be more of these  JD  Not so much more companies  but I do expect the existing ones to get bigger  The way that some of the explorers or want to become producers are getting financed is through the royalty companies  Banks will give you financing  but they want hedging  They want to be protected  but the royalty companies will take the risk  They have geologists on staff and they understand the nature of the deposit  They understand the nature of the processing  In a sense  when  Miner A  sells a royalty to Franco Nevada Corp   FNV TSX  or Royal Gold Inc   RGL TSX  RGLD NASDAQ   it is hedging it because it is giving up either some portion of its production for a fixed price that s called a stream or it is giving up some portion of revenues  like a sales tax on revenues  It s giving up some of the upside  But the market doesn t penalize them the same way that it perceives a hedge being put on by a lender  Companies that need financing are predisposed to want to do a royalty deal as opposed to a bank deal  TGR  Do you evaluate royalty companies the same way you do a miner  JD  It s a little bit different  They have much bigger portfolios  The royalty portfolios for Franco and Royal are 20 30 mines  We look much more at how the market  in general  values them on a growth royalty per share basis  and we focus more on their dividend paying abilities  We run a database of how the market has valued them in the past versus the gold price  The gold stock sector generally trades between a 10  overvalued and a 10  undervalued range  That s normal  Right now  the numbers show  on average  the gold stock industry is 35  undervalued to where it should be at  1 600 oz gold  That s a screaming buy  The last time it was that undervalued was October 2008  When the gold market gets lit  the Top 10 will take off  Last time  as I said earlier  we were up 285  in the two years following that market bottom  We beat gold and the XAU gold index by a factor of three or four times in that period of time  We can be cautious  but we re ready  We re primed  TGR  When the market comes screaming back as you predict  will the large caps or the small caps come back first  JD  The large caps because big money will be going in  The retail investors in small caps will have been killed unless they ve been subscribers and following what we ve told them to do  If they ve been invested in the junior explorers  such as the Market Vectors Junior Miners that is down 22  for the year  they don t have any money  It always starts with the big guys  As the big guys start getting fully valued and some enthusiasm comes back into the market  investors start getting greedy and start looking at the lottery ticket stocks  What can I buy for  1 share that might go to  5 share  That doesn t come first because the funds that are going to drive the gold stocks higher aren t interested in lottery tickets  They can t buy enough of them  TGR  Thank you  John  for taking the time to talk to us today  An economics professor for almost two decades   became interested in gold due to an innate distrust of politicians  Success with

204555,426071,M,Who Will Fill The 24 Million Pound Uranium Supply Gap   David Talbot,opinion,David Talbot of Dundee Securities sees the tides rising in uranium markets  but not every stock price will recover in step  Talbot s strategy is to focus on a good story  and he has identified uranium exploration  development and production companies with compelling growth profiles  In this exclusive interview with The Energy Report  Talbot explains why investors should build positions while the spot price is still sluggish  The Energy Report  In your last interview   The Uranium Industry Is Alive and Well   Germany and Japan looked determined to shift away from nuclear power  Now  it looks like Germany is having second thoughts on its plans to shut down all nuclear plants by 2022  and Japan has restarted one reactor  with more to come  What s your general industry view at this time  David Talbot  We are still bullish on the uranium sector because the nuclear power industry is moving forward and demand is behaving somewhat predictably  Supply will make all the difference in the world  The U S  Russia Megatons to Megawatts program will go off line in 2013  which will remove 24 million pounds  Mlb  of secondary supply from the equation  Meanwhile  there are five more reactors in the planning or construction phases globally than there were before the disaster at Fukushima occurred  There are 430 reactors currently in operation worldwide  and 160 reactors are being planned now  The trend is clear  There is still growth in nuclear power  On the supply side  the world uses 176 7 Mlb of uranium each year  according to the World Nuclear Association  The reactors under construction alone will account for a 13  increase in demand  approaching 200 Mlb of uranium required annually  This does not factor in any reactors in the planning stages  Mining companies are not matching that in the short to mid term they need higher uranium prices to make larger scale and typically low grade projects economic  and miners are optimistic that will happen  Uranium exploration expenses rose to about  2 billion worldwide last year  As for Germany  its demand accounts for only 9 Mlb a year  or about 3  of world demand by 2020  I believe its government did overreact  and it is apparently having second thoughts  based on economic realities  We don t think Germany s opinion on nuclear power has changed much  But the country is struggling with rising electricity prices and facing pressure from industry  Finally  China matters  Its 15 reactors now produce just 2  of its electricity  and there are 26 reactors under construction and 51 more planned  Last year  China produced only 10  of the electricity that the U S  reactors produce  It already uses 17 Mlb per year  and that figure is climbing quickly and should be in line with U S  figures in the next seven years  Chinese demand is a major force driving the industry  While we believe that renewables should be a growing part of the energy mix  they are intermittent generation sources and can t necessarily handle a large proportion of baseload demand  Many alternative energy sources are still in their infancy and expensive  TER  So  despite the negative thoughts about nuclear power  it really is the only viable alternative to coal at this point  other than natural gas  DT  I think so  We are seeing a lot more natural gas use these days  primarily in Japan  which is spending about  100 million  M  a day on energy imports  If Japan wants to maintain its way of life  it really must turn the reactors back on or risk losing jobs  A couple of reactors have started up and two more restarts are under discussion  I think this is going to help boost sentiment in the sector and ultimately increase uranium demand  which should improve spot prices from the current U S   49 50 lb level  TER  What are your expectations for short term uranium prices  Even major companies like BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP NYSE  BHPLF OTCPK  and Cameco Corp   CCO TSX  CCJ NYSE  are having trouble justifying their respective Olympic Dam and Kintyre projects  DT  The supply demand balance in the mid to near term may impact pricing  BHP announced a decision to delay expansion at Olympic Dam  by at least a couple of years  The initial expected expansions would have brought production up to about 20 Mlb from about 8 8 Mlb currently  Recently  Cameco warned that rising costs and mediocre uranium prices have made its Kintyre Project in Australia uneconomic  Cameco is still pushing ahead but needs around  67 lb to break even by the planned production start in 2015  That s another 6 Mlb of uranium supply up in the air  Cameco needs to make some acquisitions to reach its Double U strategy production goal of 40 Mlb by 2018  which would partially replace its lost Megatons to Megawatts supply  Earlier this year  Paladin Energy Ltd   PDN TSX  PDN ASX  postponed its stage four expansion of Langer Heinrich until prices rise  That expansion would nearly double mine production from 5 2 Mlb to about 10 Mlb annually  These three projects alone total about 23 Mlb  which is 64  more uranium than Cameco s Cigar Lake is scheduled to produce annually  Each of these reminds us that many projects simply are not economic at current uranium prices and something has to give  The current supply deficit should put upward pressure on prices  eventually making projects like Kintyre more feasible  We ll be lucky if annual uranium production reaches 180 Mlb by 2020  And that would require sustained spot prices of  70 80 lb  Our current forecasts for next year and 2014 are  70 lb and  67 lb  with a long term forecast is  65 lb  TER  How have the uranium stocks performed this year  DT  Equities in general have really dropped off since the beginning of the year  As a group  uranium stocks are down about 30  year to date and much of the downward action occurring within the last 3 months  These companies have been under the same pressure as the broader market  with low liquidity and European debt worries  In the long term  I think the producers will outperform developers  But over the past few weeks we ve seen some movement in the smaller stocks  with no clear winner between producers  developers or explorers  But however harsh the market is  you have to pick good stories  and right now we have a couple of suggestions for each of those categories  TER  Paladin Energy has been showing some pretty exciting production results  but the stock has continued to languish and now there are some takeover rumors floating around  What s the situation there  DT  Paladin is our top producer pick  We have a Buy rating on the stock with a  2 65 target price  Right now  we like what we see  We think the company has really turned the corner with good production numbers  a strong outlook  resource growth  advancement of the pipeline  asset sales and strategic alliances that are expected shortly  Those alliances could not only improve the balance sheet  but it could also add value to the projects that are still in the pipeline  A Bloomberg article last month suggested that Paladin is a takeover target at these levels  We think that potential acquirers could include Cameco  Rio Tinto Plc  RIO NYSE  RIO ASX  RIO LSE  RTPPF OTCPK   Uranium One Inc   UUU TSX  or other senior miners looking to get into the uranium space  We have a Buy rating on Uranium One and a  4 50 target price  But I think that Paladin is going to make the first move with strategic alliances before anything else happens  TER  What do you think is the most likely strategic alliance  DT  There is probably going to be a JV at Mount Isa in Queensland  Australia  That s a potentially large operation that could produce about 5 Mlb annually but it s going to have a big price tag  probably well over  500M  I could see Paladin selling a minority position in this project to raise upwards of  350M  bringing in a partner that s responsible for its share of capex  That would help decrease financing risks and the cash generated could really take a bite out of Paladin s debt  The other possibility here is a strategic alliance to tap some value at the mine level  Kayelekera and Langer Heinrich are two of the very few uranium mines built anywhere in the world over the last 20 years and are now running at or near capacity  I m sure there s an Asian utility somewhere that would jump at the opportunity to share ownership of one of these mines through an offtake agreement and have access to production over the next 25 30 years  TER  There s also been some M A action here in the U S  In April  Energy Fuels Inc   EFR TSX  made a deal to acquire all of Denison Mines Corp  s  DML TSX  DNN NYSE A  U S  mining uranium mining assets and operations  Where has that gone since then  DT  Energy Fuels has emerged from a couple of deals as the second largest uranium producer in the U S   with a resource base of 70 Mlb  We have a Buy rating on the stock and a  0 90 target price  They bought the White Mesa mill from Denison  which is the only operating conventional mill in the U S   plus several operating mines  This saved Energy Fuels about  150M by not having to construct its own mill  where it just received its NRC license in Colorado  Synergies with projects in Utah  Colorado and Arizona might fill that mill  keeping costs as low as possible  That s very important because these smaller mines in the Southwest U S  tend to have higher operating costs  We view Energy Fuels as a good opportunity with cash flow and significant leverage to rising uranium prices  It s preparing its pipeline of projects with two mines that are already permitted  Whirlwind and Energy Queen  Pinenut is also approaching production within the year  The management team has operating experience with the old Energy Fuels nuclear company  and its Sheep Mountain project up in Wyoming could bring this company to a whole new level  TER  There s also been some takeover drama with UEX Corp   UEX TSX  and Cameco  as Cameco failed in their bid for Hathor  What s the latest on that situation  DT  We have a Buy recommendation for UEX and a  1 85 target price  This is our favorite development story right now  Cameco did lose in its bid for Hathor and it needs to make an acquisition to meet its production goals of 40 Mlb by 2018  as we mentioned before  UEX has projects in the Athabasca Basin and Cameco is its largest shareholder  with 23  of the stock  Earlier this year  Cameco put up a fuss when UEX attempted to implement a shareholder rights plan because Cameco really believed this would have breached some of its preemptive rights when UEX was spun off in the mid 2000s  Cameco participated in a UEX equity issue earlier this year  and failed to replace its UEX board representative when he retired  So there are signs that Cameco is still interested in UEX  But we aren t sure when a potential takeover can happen  UEX s Hidden Bay has about 40 Mlb located about 4km away from Cameco s Rabbit Lake mill  An open pit operation on that property could ultimately act as a tailings management facility  which is something Cameco s Rabbit Lake mill will need in the next few years  UEX also has 49  interest in the world class 88 Mlb Shea Creek project to the west  which could easily be added to Cameco s pipeline  Cameco is probably the best company in the world to develop these high grade  particularly deep deposits  and could potentially partner with AREVA  AREVA EPA   UEX is one of our favorite developer stories  with high grade drill results continuing from Shea Creek  In the short term  Hidden Bay is moving into development stages with geotechnical  geochemical and metallurgical studies underway  TER  You initiated coverage in May on U3O8 Corp   UWE TSX V  OTCQX UWEFF   What do you like about that one  And why did you decide to start covering it now  DT  We have a Buy recommendation and a Speculative Risk rating on U308 Corp   but no target price right now because we are awaiting a little more economic information to derisk this company a bit more  This is a small company with many moving parts  It has three projects  any one of which could likely sustain a junior exploration company  We picked up coverage as we became more excited about the upside potential offered by its multi element flagship Berlin project in Colombia  The current resource only covers the southernmost three kilometers of a known 10 1 2 kilometer long sandstone trend  There s a misconception here that it s a black shale deposit  It s really a carbonaceous sandstone  That s a big difference  At 21 Mlb U308 plus byproducts  the resource has just started growing  with the potential to double and ultimately triple in a couple of years  Besides uranium  it will also be getting vanadium  phosphates  rare earth elements and base metals out of this calcite rich rock  Its second project  Laguna Salada  is located in Chubut Province  Argentina  Mineralization occurs within three meters of surface in soft  unconsolidated sandy gravel that should be amenable to low cost mining techniques  The grades are very low but the geology lends itself to considerable beneficiation  in some cases by a factor of ten  which could boost the grades by ten times before it goes through the mill  While resources are currently only around 10 Mlb  there is potential to double this amount by year end through drilling  not to mention potential M A targets in the area  U308 s third project is the Kurupung project in Guyana  which was once its flagship project  We still love its high prospectively with potential for hosting several massive uranium projects  However  exploration will be expensive and time consuming  plus U308 has two other projects in jurisdictions with better infrastructure  Those projects are likely to be advanced in the scoping study stages more expeditiously  Ultimately we think this is a very undervalued development story  The stock trades at about half the level of its peers  and we expect its resources to double during this year  TER  What else do you like at this point  DT  Another developer story I like is in Ur Energy Inc   URE TSX  URG NYSE A   We have a Buy recommendation and a  2 30 target price on this stock  The timing might be right for investors on Ur Energy  It s waiting for final U S  Bureau of Land Management permits that would allow it to build and operate its Lost Creek Mine in Wyoming  The company expects to build a plant that could produce up to 2Mlb annually  starting at 1Mlb from Lost Creek with low operating costs of about  20 lb  We ve liked this story for a while and think there s considerable upside  It s cheap  it s located in a good jurisdiction and it has good economics  good management and quite a deep technical team  It recently picked up a couple of good looking projects from AREVA for its pipeline  Look for some news out of Ur Energy in the next couple of months  Among exploration stories  Kivalliq Energy Corp   KIV TSX V  might be our top explorer pick now  with one of the best exploration teams in the business  We have a speculative buy without a target price on this one  Kivalliq is now drilling its Angilak property in Nunavut  The company seemed to have hit uranium mineralization in every place they ve put a drill in 2011 early 2012 and surprised us by doubling its high grade Lac Cinquante resource to 27 Mlb at 0 69  U308  This is one of the highest grades outside the Athabasca Basin  It s discovered about 10 new zones  many within 3km of the Lac Cinquante deposit itself  Others are located within 25km of the deposit and some of these are potentially big  like the BIF Zone that extends for about 3km along strike at surface  where grab samples often assay between 16  and 30   As more discoveries are being announced  the company has to reprioritize its targets as it goes  We think they re in a uranium district and this story is going to be exciting to watch  Another explorer that is front and center for us is Fission Energy Corp   FIS TSX V  FSSIF OTCQX   We have a Buy Venture Risk rating with no target price  The company has a project immediately west of Rio Tinto s Roughrider deposit in the Athabasca Basin  It s likely that Fission s high grade J Zone discoveries are the same deposit as the Roughrider West Zones  The J Zone now measures about 680m along strike  We think there s considerable room to expand this  not only along strike but also to the north and south  Some impressive high grade areas need follow up there  including 15  U3O8 over 6m and 21 6  over 3 5m  It doesn t take a lot of area to add significant pounds when you re getting grades over 15   That s one of the reasons why we like this company  The initial resource covers about one third the strike length and totals about 9 Mlb  About 7 4 Mlb of that is Indicated  grading about 2   Drilling continues on a second project to the west  That might end up as another Athabasca uranium discovery  if we give Fission sufficient time to search  TER  What kind of timing are we looking at before we see some real activity in these stocks  DT  We believe uranium prices may be at the bottom right now  around  49 lb  We expect firming  especially as the Japanese reactors come back online  We may see some price appreciation later this year and into 2013 as the Megatons to Megawatts agreement expires  We are calling for higher uranium prices down the road  ultimately to our  65 lb long term price  Investors have to pick good and improving companies before we see these stocks run  There s already a lot of volatility in the uranium sector but stocks tend to take off before you know it  so you can t necessarily choose cash flow over near term production or potential blue sky upside  as you can in a bull market  All the stocks will likely lift  but at different rates  Among producers  maybe look at Paladin and Energy Fuels  for developers  UEX  U308 Corp and Ur Energy  and explorers  Kivalliq Energy and Fission Energy  We suggest that investors buy a basket of these stories  I really think this sector will be one that s going to outperform in the coming years  TER  Very good  We appreciate your insights today David  Thanks for talking with us
