195454,416970,MCD,McDonald s Ends a Good Year on a High Note,news,"Investors had some worries coming into the fourth quarter earnings report for McDonald s  NYSE MCD   given that the chain had announced unbalanced results in recent months  Its strong global growth numbers were tarnished by a few warning flags in the core U S  market  which had been showing declining customer traffic for over a year 
On Wednesday  the company didn t announce an end to that traffic slump  But shareholders had plenty to celebrate within its broader results  Let s look at its performance  

Strong sales trends
Global sales rose 5 9   which was exactly even with the prior quarter s expansion rate  This market beating growth rate again came mainly from countries like France  Australia  and China  and easily outpaced the 5  uptick in the U S  That domestic growth still likely beat rivals like Domino s and Yum  Brands  Yet Starbucks is so far the industry s biggest winner  posting a 6  sales boost supported by 3  higher customer traffic 
That customer traffic metric has been a sore spot for McDonald s  and the weakness carried over into the fourth quarter  But there s a silver lining to note in that traffic losses moderated slightly  landing at 1 9  compared with 2 2  in fiscal 2018  That improvement  plus rising prices  allowed comparable store sales gains in the U S  to double to 5  this past year 
Executives highlighted the global increase in traffic  with guest counts rising 1  worldwide compared with a 0 2  uptick in 2018   We once again served more customers the food they crave   CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a press release   marking three consecutive years of global comparable guest count growth  
Profits and outlook
McDonald s finances benefited from the strong global growth  with operating income rising 6  after accounting for currency exchange shifts  up to  9 1 billion  Per share earnings improved at a slightly faster pace thanks to management s aggressive stock repurchase plan that reduced the share count by 25 million over the past year  In addition to that  5 billion in stock buybacks  Mickey D s delivered  3 6 billion to shareholders through dividends to cap off a three year   25 billion cash return binge 
The fast food giant didn t announce a capital return plan for the future  but executives affirmed their broader commitments to  returning all free cash flow to shareholders  after reinvesting in the business  Those payouts should still be significant in 2020  but growth will be limited by McDonald s remodeling initiatives and its aggressive push into home delivery  The chain also won t be benefiting anymore from its refranchising move that has lifted operating margin by over 10 percentage points since 2015  That metric held steady in 2019 at 43  of sales 
The good news is that McDonald s is enjoying some of its best global growth rates in a decade  with comps landing at 5 9  for the year compared with 4 5  in 2018  More progress along that score could easily offset any potential headwinds from margin pressure in 2020 ",2020-02-01,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pprzr,2073697
195455,416971,MCD,McDonald s Makes Restaurant Traffic Its Top Priority for 2020,news,"When it reported full year 2019 results  McDonald s  NYSE MCD  had a nice comparable sales surprise for investors  The comparable sales metric measures revenue at restaurants that have been open longer than a year and serves as a good indication of a brand s popularity with diners  For 2019  McDonald s  U S  comparable sales increased 5     its best results since 2006    and worldwide comparable sales growth was even stronger at 5 9  
McDonald s deserves credit for driving comps higher in 2019  but these stellar results came with a major asterisk  U S  traffic was actually down 1 9  for the year  and new CEO Chris Kempczinski said fixing this problem is the company s greatest priority in 2020 

What drove comps growth 
The first thing driving comparable sales for McDonald s is delivery    a major theme for the restaurant industry in 2019  The company reported over  4 billion in 2019 delivery sales worldwide  Generally speaking  delivery drives comps growth in two ways  First  it can increase how many customers the company serves  since it s not limited by restaurant seating or drive thru throughput  But in McDonald s  case  delivery also contributed to a higher average check  That s because customers have to pay delivery fees  and the fees are steep if you re just ordering off the value menu  so it makes sense to justify the cost with a larger order 
The second factor driving McDonald s  comparable sales is self ordering kiosks  Perhaps ordering at a kiosk allows guilt free purchases  but whatever the reason  these kiosks also result in a higher average check  Kiosks aren t unique to McDonald s  in the second quarter of 2019  Wendy s said it had around 400 kiosks in company owned locations that were also driving higher checks  The difference for McDonald s is it has kiosks at nearly all of its U S  locations  so the positive effect is more noticeable 
The third thing driving McDonald s  comparable sales is Dynamic Yield s artificial intelligence technology  McDonald s acquired Dynamic Yield in 2019 and has implemented the tech at more than 11 000 drive thru menu boards  The technology suggests menu items based on many factors and appears to be working  Management said customers are buying more add on items  resulting in a higher average check  
What can be done for traffic  
A 5  comparable sales increase  especially for a restaurant chain the size of McDonald s  is a praiseworthy feat  Still  it s fair to be concerned over U S  restaurant traffic    down 1 9  and 2 2  in 2019 and 2018  respectively  Here s three things investors should monitor in the coming year as McDonald s addresses the problem 
Kempczinski said that McDonald s has  to win at breakfast   but that meal is getting more competitive  In September 2019  Wendy s announced it was joining its fast food peers by launching a breakfast menu in 2020 that s expected to add 6  to 8  to total sales  Interestingly  Kempczinski noted that overall breakfast traffic isn t growing for the industry  Therefore  for McDonald s to grow breakfast sales  it will have to steal share from competitors  and avoid losing share to the likes of Wendy s 

That ties directly into the next thing that can drive restaurant traffic for McDonald s  In an increasingly competitive environment  the key differentiator could be value pricing  McDonald s is known for being a cheap option  but even still  some of 2019 s comps gains came from menu price increases  If the company starts a promotional pricing war to earn more restaurant traffic  menu price increases won t be as easy in 2020 
Finally  McDonald s is focusing on drive thru speed  The company is aiming to shave 20 seconds to 30 seconds off of wait times in 2020  It made good progress in this area in 2019  notching 15 second and 20 second year over year improvements in the second quarter and third quarter  respectively  Around 70  of McDonald s  U S  sales come from the drive thru  so it s easy to see how improving throughput could boost traffic 
Conclusion
When McDonald s says that something is its top priority  it s imperative to pay attention  After all  if it can t accomplish its highest goal  how reasonable is it to expect it to reach its lesser aspirations  Therefore  in 2020  I d recommend keeping tabs on the U S  traffic issue  specifically in the areas discussed here 
That said  a 1 9  drop in U S  restaurant traffic needs to be kept in context  Worldwide  restaurant traffic was still up 1   so it s not time to push the panic button  Rather  investors should view 2019 as a great year for McDonald s  but to build off of that great year in 2020  it will need to focus on the specific issue of U S  restaurant traffic ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqxvk,2075544
195456,416972,MCD,Australia s wine exports could take a hit from coronavirus  industry body,news,"By Renju Jose
SYDNEY  Reuters    Australia s wine export growth slowed last year and could take another hit in 2020 from the coronavirus outbreak if China  its biggest market  orders fewer crates  a report by an industry body said on Wednesday 
The virus  which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan  has severely impacted food and beverage businesses in mainland China with many global companies including McDonald s  N MCD  and  Starbucks Corp   O SBUX  temporarily shutting stores in the country as a precaution 
 Looking ahead into 2020  we anticipate that coronavirus will have an impact on sales  particularly to China  but at this stage it is difficult to predict the degree of that impact   said industry body Wine Australia in its 2019 export report 
Australia s total global wine exports rose just 3  to A 2 91 billion   1 96 billion  in 2019  compared with 10  growth recorded in 2018  the report said 
Wine exports to China  which is Australia s top market by value  rose 12  to A 1 3 billion last year although the pace of growth slowed from 18  recorded in 2018 
The total value of wine exports was the second highest for a calendar year  however  the volume fell for the first time in seven years  the report showed 
 The volume of exports was down  with the decline heavily weighted toward lower price segments   Wine Australia Chief Executive Officer Andreas Clark said 
 The lower vintages in 2018 and 2019  together with lower inventory levels  meant that there was less wine available for export in 2019  
On Jan  29  Australia s biggest winemaker  Treasury Wine Estates Ltd   AX TWE   which generates a significant portion of its sales from exports to China  said it was too early to say what the effects of coronavirus would be  However  it cut its 2020 earnings outlook citing weakness in its U S  operations ",2020-02-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/australias-wine-exports-could-take-a-hit-from-coronavirus-industry-body-2076256,2076256

195458,416974,MCD,McDonald s Tells Investors to Expect More Cash Returns,news,"McDonald s  NYSE MCD  just took a big step in the right direction  In its fourth quarter earnings report  the fast food chain failed to show a return to customer traffic growth in the core U S  market  However  that critical trend did improve year over year to help it log some of its fastest global growth in over a decade 
In a conference call with Wall Street analysts  CEO Chris Kempczinski and his team discussed that rebound and explained how the company aims to stand out in a crowded restaurant industry in 2020 and beyond  Below are a few highlights from that presentation 

Taking a victory lap

McDonald s and our franchise partners now serve nearly 70 million people in over 100 countries every 24 hours  And  restaurant level  cash flow is at or near all time highs in most of our largest markets  And in the U S   it s at an all time high    Kempczinski

McDonald s 6  global comparable store sales increase capped off a strong year for the business both at home an across its international markets  Sales increased at a 10 year high overall and improved at the fastest rate in the U S  in 13 years  Executives noted that customer traffic remained negative for a second straight year in the domestic market  However  the rate of decline lessened  giving management what they called clear evidence that the growth plan is working   We have strong momentum in the U S    Kempczinski said 
Using all that cash

Over the last three years  we invested about  7 billion in the business to drive growth  we increased our dividends per share by over 30  and paid out  10 billion in dividends  and we reduced our shares outstanding about 10  by purchasing  15 billion of treasury stock    CFO Kevin Ozan

By the end of fiscal 2019  McDonald s met its three year   25 billon cash return goal  which was supported by faster sales gains and a refranchising initiative that pushed profitability far higher  with operating margin reaching 44  of sales 
Management stressed the fact that these huge cash returns didn t get in the way of massive growth investments  McDonald s remodeled 2 000 U S  locations in 2019  for example  to bring its total to 10 000 locations  or 70  of the selling footprint  Those capital spending priorities aren t going to change  either   We expect our free cash flow to continue to grow   Ozan said   and we expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders through     dividends and share repurchases  
Risks and opportunities

The uncertainties before us are no surprise to anyone on this call  whether due to geopolitical challenges  slow  fast food industry  growth  intensifying competition  growing labor costs  or continuous technological disruption    Kempczinksi

McDonald s reiterated that returning the U S  market to customer traffic growth is a main priority for 2020  and its encouraged by several metrics that all point in that positive direction  including record high diner satisfaction scores  Some of the biggest challenges it faces are competition  especially in the breakfast hours  and a delivery program that has yet to achieve the success it has in places like France and the U K  These issues might combine with sluggish restaurant industry growth to pressure comps this year 
Still  with most metrics suggesting further financial and operating gains ahead  McDonald s likes its posture as it targets a fourth consecutive year of global traffic growth   We head into 2020 from a position of strength   Ozan said ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prxey,2077757

195464,416980,MCD,How Will McDonald s Stop U S  Customer Losses ,news,"McDonald s  NYSE MCD  has been able to hide its declining U S  customer base by getting the people who do eat at its restaurants  or order from them  to spend more money  Comparable store sales in the company s home market grew by 5 1  in the fourth quarter while customer count declined by 1 9   
That s a mixed bag of news for investors  The company has succeeded in increasing check size    something that has been aided by kiosk based ordering and delivery    but it s losing customers 
New CEO Chris Kempczinski believes technology can help solve that problem  He wants the company to deliver a simpler  smoother experience with increased personal engagement 
 To that end  we significantly strengthened our digital capabilities in 2019   he said during his company s fourth quarter earnings call   In markets around the world  for example  a growing community of registered users is redeeming digital only offers  giving our teams more opportunity to understand customer needs and create engaging digital customer experiences  

How is McDonald s investing in technology 
The fast food chain has been revamping its restaurant to what it calls the  experience of the future   EOTF   It s also using some pretty cutting edge technology to figure out how to increase how much customers order 
 Throughout the year  we made targeted investments to accelerate our capabilities   Kempczinski said   The suggestive sell capability of Dynamic Yield is now deployed in nearly all outdoor digital menu boards across the U S  and Australia  
Dynamic Yield uses an artificial intelligence technology that shows customers different digital menus based on weather  time of day  and other factors  The CEO believes that Dynamic Yield will help the company grow its business 
 Across the system  there is great excitement about the role  Dynamic Yield  will play in transforming McDonald s by strengthening and deepening relationships with our customers   he said   So we know there s great potential with digital  but there s also a lot of hard work to do to realize our ambitions  
McDonald s is not just continuing to remodel stores to the EOTF model and using Dynamic Yield  Kempczinski also plans heavy technology investment to improve the chain s customer experience 
 I recently announced creation of a new digital customer engagement team to accelerate customer focused digital initiatives  including ordering  personalization  payments  loyalty  and delivery platforms   he added 
Can McTech save the day 
Technology has already helped McDonald s  Customers who order delivery  which is available at about two thirds of the chain s global restaurant base  spend more  as do people who order via kiosk  That s likely partly due to the technology being easy to use  and partly because adding a shake or getting a large fry carries less shame when you re not ordering from a person 
 We continue to see great runway ahead of us to drive awareness and trial  and we re doubling down on our efforts to encourage frequency and retention   the CEO said   As we inject speed  agility  and flexibility into our system through the accelerators of Experience of the Future  digital and delivery  we continue to focus on the fundamentals of running great restaurants  and customers are noticing  
McDonald s has  in recent years  been a leader when it comes to restaurant technology  Its new CEO wants to continue that  and that s good news for restaurant stock investors  
Technology may not directly win the company new customers  It can  however  increase the order size and number of visits for people ordering its food  Tech may also lure lapsed customers back through delivery platforms  It can also increase their satisfaction  and all of those factors lead to a healthier company ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppi55,2073125

sharing ideas with franchisees and suppliers  and visiting restaurants and customers  This invaluable time spent with our people  partners and customers reinforced to me the vitality and global alignment we re seeing behind our Velocity Growth Plan  Our people are energized  they re proud of our culture  committed to the promise of our brand and share my confidence in the business and our direction  This time has also reinforced things that make me deeply proud of our system  We create opportunity for our colleagues across the system At every McDonald s gathering there s a story to tell of the crew person  who s also a grandparent and excited to begin a new chapter of life working for McDonald s  or the company employee who started in the system with a first job in their teens  went to college with the system support and is now on a leadership role  For those who work hard and live our values  McDonald s can change lives  We provide a community space for our customers  When you enter McDonald s  whether in Brisbane  Berlin or Boston  you re entering more than just a restaurant  you re walking into a vibrant community  a place where people congregate  share stories and enjoy simple but powerful and delicious moments of happiness with family  friends and loved ones  That commitment to communities is the spirit that inspired the creation of Ronald McDonald House Charities and has helped friends and neighbors through hurricanes  tornadoes and countless other times of stress  Being integrated into communities worldwide  we know the very real challenges our customers face and we show up with solutions As we have grown  we ve recognized our responsibility as one of the world s leading companies to use our scale to gain traction on some of the globe s most pressing challenges  It s the strength of our business over the past 65 years that enables McDonald s to play this role and a humbling responsibility to lead an organization with the ability to make an impact on the world  Kevin will drill down on our quarterly results  Before then  I d like to share with you some headlines for the year  In 2019  our system marked a historic milestone   100 billion in systemwide sales  For the year  we grew global comp sales 5 9   the highest increase we ve seen in over a decade  2019 was our third consecutive year of global comp guest count growth  To put that in perspective  McDonald s and our franchise partners now serve nearly 70 million people in over 100 countries every 24 hours  And owner operator cash flow is at or near all time highs in most of our largest markets  And in the U S   It s at an all time high  Turning to segment highlights Our International Operated Markets segment  or IOM  generated comp sales growth of 6 1  for the year  This was underscored by every market in the segment delivering both comp sales and comp guest count growth  At the same time  our International Developed Licensee segment  or IDL  generated comp sales of 7 2   And importantly  our three largest IDL markets  China  Japan and Brazil  all posted positive comp sales  leading a list that includes nearly all of our IDL markets  We also have strong momentum in the U S  In fact  we re now seeing the results of our most ambitious turnaround of the U S  History  For the full year  comp sales growth grew 5   our best comp since 2006 or 13 years ago  Across the country  we re seeing clear evidence of the power of Bigger  Bolder Vision 2020  which is our U S  Adaptation of the Velocity Growth Plan developed in combination with our franchisees The initiatives we and our franchise partners deployed in 2017 and 2018  including a new value platform  fresh beef  delivery  EOTF modernization and more  were met with strong approval by our customers and this led to continued strong top line growth over the past three years  As one of the architects of our Velocity Growth Plan  it gives me a great sense of pride to watch two million restaurant crew around the world execute our strategies with such care and conviction  I continue to have great confidence in our ability to grow and shape our industry  and I m equally confident that we have the right leadership in place to meet our customers  evolving needs with increasing ambition and speed  Joe Erlinger  an 18 year veteran of our company  is now head of our U S  business  where he s responsible for the operations of nearly 14 000 restaurants across the country  Joe returned to the U S  after several years of increasing responsibility around the world Most recently  he served as President of our International Operated Markets  where we had oversight for McDonald s wholly owned markets outside the U S  With Joe s transitioning  Ian Borden has expanded his role to oversee both our IOM and IDL segments  Ian began his McDonald s career 25 years ago in our finance department in Canada and have spent 23 of these 25 years in markets outside of North America  In his most recent role as President of our IDL segment  Ian worked with our developmental licensee partners across more than 80 markets  Under his leadership  we will drive greater collaboration across all markets and accelerate our pace of best practice and innovation sharing  building on our rich heritage of learning from each other It s an important role for McDonald s as we maximize the full potential of our 3 legged stool of company  franchisee and supplier resources  Both Ian and Joe have deep track records of delivering profitable growth  while building high performing teams and strengthening collaboration with our franchisee community  Importantly  Ian  Joe and I have also worked closely together as segment presidents over the past few years  embodying the trust  respect and unity of mission that are the hallmarks of our partnership culture  I m thrilled to be working with both of them in their new roles Now I ll turn it to Kevin to talk about our fourth quarter results  Kevin Kevin Ozan    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerChris talked about our impressive full year results  so let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter  Our strong top line momentum continued in the fourth quarter  with global comp sales increasing 5 9   And as we ve seen consistently throughout the year  each of the operating segments contributed meaningfully to our growth  This marks over four years of consecutive quarterly global comp sales growth  Our comp sales performance is a significant achievement given a soft global IEO market and on top of strong prior year results  Our International Operated segment  which represents over 50  of total revenues and operating income  generated comp sales of 6 2  for the quarter  with strong performance across the segment  France and the U K  drove the segment s growth  along with positive comp sales in every market and positive guest counts in nearly all markets France delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth with continued all time high market share  The quarter benefited from delivery expansion  digital engagement and continued deployment of EOTF  The market has also been successful with the balance of premium and core burger offerings  The U K  reported a remarkable 55th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth and continued to gain market share across nearly all dayparts  The quarter benefited from extended breakfast hours  compelling digital offers  successful national LTOs and delivery  which has grown to about 10  of sales in the restaurants that offer it  Turning to the U S  Comp sales increased 5 1  for the quarter  with balanced growth across all dayparts  While traffic was negative  the U S  continues to drive significant average check growth  with contributions from both product mix and strategic pricing  Similar to prior quarters in 2019  Experience of the Future contributed to positive comp sales in the fourth quarter Another 500 EOTF projects were completed during the quarter for a total of about 2 000 projects for the full year  The U S  now has nearly 10 000 restaurants that have been converted to EOTF or about 70  of the estate  In addition  core favorites  including our fresh beef quarter pounders and world famous French fries  continue to resonate with customers and fueled growth for the quarter  Delivery was also a contributor for the quarter as the addition of new delivery partners  like DoorDash and Grubhub drove incremental orders  And the deployment of Dynamic Yield s suggestive sell technology in over 11 000 drive thrus also contributed to the growth in average check  That said  returning to guest count growth in the U S  remains our top priority Sluggish industry traffic growth and unit expansion continue to fuel an aggressive battle for market share  In particular  the U S  is centered on stemming traffic losses at the breakfast daypart by focusing on running better operations  introducing new menu items and offering delicious food at a compelling price point  Finally  in the International Developmental Licensed markets  comp sales were up 6 6  for the quarter  with growth across each geographic region  The largest contributor to segment performance were Brazil  China and Japan  Turning to the bottom line  Adjusted earnings per share was  1 97 for the quarter  a 1  increase in constant currencies when excluding impairment charges in the prior year and tax law change benefits in both the current and prior year  Results reflect strong global comp sales and operating growth  mostly offset by a higher tax rate versus the prior year Consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 7  in constant currencies  reflecting strong sales performance across all segments as well as expansion and the impact of refranchising  Franchise margin percent declined 60 basis points as franchise revenue growth was more than offset by higher depreciation related to EOTF modernization in the U S  and the impact of the new lease standard  Consolidated company operated margins improved 40 basis points to 17 9  for the quarter primarily due to strong comp sales growth  IOM segment company operated margins increased 30 basis points to a healthy 20 1   and U S  company operated margins increased 150 basis points to 16 4  as solid sales performance more than offset continued commodity and wage pressures and EOTF related depreciation  Overall  our restaurant margins increased nearly  180 million in constant currencies for the quarter and over  600 million for the full year And finally  excluding current and prior year special items  operating margin increased 30 basis points to 43 4  for the full year  We also achieved our three year target of returning  25 billion to shareholders  This is a significant accomplishment given our substantial investments in Experience of the Future and technology to drive sustainable  profitable growth  As a perspective  over the last three years  we invested about  7 billion in the business to drive growth  we increased our dividends per share by over 30  and paid out  10 billion in dividends  and we reduced our shares outstanding about 10  by purchasing  15 billion of treasury stock  This also speaks to the progress we ve made in enhancing our free cash flow profile  As a result of refranchising efforts and rightsizing our cost structure over the past several years  we ve evolved to a more stable and predictable business model In 2019  our free cash flow was  5 7 billion  up over 35  from the prior year  And free cash flow conversion  which measures our ability to convert bottom line earnings to free cash flow  was 95   a significant uptick from the prior year  Going forward  our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged  first  to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business  second  to continue growing our dividend  and third  to buy back shares  We expect our free cash flow to continue to grow  and we expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases Now I ll turn it back to Chris to talk more about our Velocity Growth Plan and where we re headed in 2020 Chris Kempczinski    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Kevin  Nowhere is the power of our Velocity Growth Plan and franchise model come more to life than in our restaurants  In my recent travels to our European markets  I saw this firsthand everywhere I went  I was struck in particular during a visit to a restaurant in France  a society that famously values good food and beverages and inviting atmosphere in the spirit of community  There  I saw an engaged owner operator who knew her customers by name and had made her modernized restaurant a vibrant gathering place for the community  Kids were everywhere  Much like their counterparts around the world  young adults were busy multitasking between bites of burgers and fries  Parents appear to be appreciating a moment of rest and other adults were seated in singles and pairs  some having a full meal  others just having coffee With the scene that reinforced the fundamentals of the Velocity Growth Plan by simultaneously pulling the levers of great tasting food with good value  convenience and a pleasing customer experience  this owner operator  and many others across France and other international markets  are growing visits  A similar dynamic is playing out in the U K   where our system is doing a great job meeting customers  expectations for convenience and speed while providing differentiated experiences for guests dining in  visiting the drive thru or ordering through McDelivery  This dynamic is playing out in Italy  where customer satisfaction scores are up at drive thru and dine in and across all three peak dayparts of breakfast  lunch and dinner  The excitement and energy behind our Velocity Growth Plan is widespread  It s a result of this commitment that our business is growing and our strategy continues to deliver At the same time  there s a realization that we can and will do more to deliver better taste  greater value and enhanced convenience for our customers  This is the guiding philosophy behind our three accelerators  Experience of the Future  digital and delivery  With Experience of the Future  our strategy is focused on enhancing the customer experience by improving convenience  hospitality and personalization  As Kevin said  in the U S   we completed about 2 000 projects in 2019 and are on track for just about all restaurants to be modernized by the end of 2020  Customers are recognizing the changes we have made for their benefit  Customer satisfaction scores in the U S  are at an all time high  In our IOM markets  where the vast majority of our restaurants are now modernized  we have a strong foundation for long term success by creating greater convenience  comfort and hospitality for our guests Meanwhile  our digital journey  another critical accelerator  is focused on giving customers simpler  smoother and more personal engagement with McDonald s by leveraging the most relevant technology  To that end  we significantly strengthened our digital capabilities in 2019  In markets around the world  for example  a growing community of registered users is redeeming digital only offers  giving our teams more opportunity to understand customer needs and create engaging digital customer experiences  Throughout the year  we made targeted investments to accelerate our capabilities  The suggestive sell capability of Dynamic Yield is now deployed in nearly all outdoor digital menu boards across the U S  and Australia In both markets  we re using the technology to make smarter recommendations to customers of menu items they are likely to want  There s no question that digital is transforming global retail  Across the system  there is great excitement about the role it will play in transforming McDonald s by strengthening and deepening relationships with our customers  So we know there s great potential with digital  but there s also a lot of hard work to do to realize our ambitions  I recently announced creation of a new digital customer engagement team to accelerate customer focused digital initiatives  including ordering  personalization  payments  loyalty and delivery platforms  Lucy Brady is leading this team  Lucy has been a driving force behind the evolution of the Velocity Growth Plan and rapid expansion of our McDelivery platform in her most recent role leading Corporate Strategy and Business Development Lucy and her team will be responsible for developing new industry leading digital experiences for our customers  and they ll partner with our global technology team to build new product road maps and technology solutions to fuel growth  With our third accelerator  we re bringing more customers the McDonald s they love with the convenience of delivery  Today  about 2 3 of our restaurants worldwide  nearly 25 000  offer McDelivery  In just three years  McDelivery has gone from generating  1 billion in sales for McDonald s company and franchise restaurants to over  4 billion in sales this past year  We now have multiple 3PL partners in most major markets  including the U S   where the rapid scaling of DoorDash is showing consistent growth  and the U K   where we recently announced an agreement to partner with Just Eat We continue to see great runway ahead of us to drive awareness and trial  and we re doubling down on our efforts to encourage frequency and retention  As we inject speed  agility and flexibility into our system through the accelerators of Experience of the Future  digital and delivery  we continue to focus on the fundamentals of running great restaurants  and customers are noticing  Across our largest markets  we ve reduced the time it takes a customer to receive their order by an average of 20 seconds  With this change  most markets saw overall customer satisfaction improve in 2019  Our Velocity Growth Plan provides a solid and sustainable foundation to grow our business in 2020 and beyond  yet we know that we must stay in tune with evolving customer needs and adapt to changing market conditions The uncertainties before us are no surprise to anyone on this call  whether due to geopolitical challenges  slow IEO growth  intensifying competition  growing labor costs or continuous technological disruption  The topics we ve shared before continue to impact the industry and will need to be overcome  And that means continuing to align around a plan that always puts our customers first with great tasting food  convenience and value  It means collaborating with our franchisee community for a successful local execution  That means building flexibility into our system for initiatives that accelerate and sustain growth  and provide new opportunities for McDonald s To build on that  let me turn it back over to Kevin Kevin Ozan    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe head into 2020 from a position of strength  The Velocity Growth Plan has resulted in strong operating performance over the past several years  reinforcing confidence in our ability to deliver long term sustainable results  I want to take a minute to walk through some of our financial expectations for 2020  We anticipate that we ll host an Investor Day this year to provide an update on the business and longer term expectations  With our efficient business model  in 2020  we expect to continue achieving an operating margin in the mid 40s range  which includes the following  Higher depreciation expense of about  80 million versus 2019 related to EOTF in the U S   with the vast majority in franchise margins  With most of our major refranchising efforts complete  we expect gains on restaurant sales in 2020 to be roughly half of the amount in 2019  with most of the gains in the second half of the year And as we have become more efficient with G A required to run the business over the last few years  we have invested in areas that are already contributing to business performance and that we believe will continue to accelerate growth  including technology and research and development  As a result  we expect full year 2020 G A to increase 5  to 7  in constant currencies due to these investments  This includes full year operating costs associated with the 2019 acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente  R D spend and costs related to our biennial worldwide convention  We expect G A percentage increases will be significantly higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year  We also expect our annual tax rate will be 23  to 25   Finally  based on current exchange rates  we anticipate currency translation will negatively impact EPS by  0 01 to  0 03 in the first quarter and a similar amount for the full year As usual  this is directional guidance only as rates will change as we move through the year  Moving on to capital  We ended 2019 with capital expenditures of  2 4 billion  in line with our expectations  As we ve previously indicated  in 2020  we expect to spend a similar amount  About half of the total capital will be dedicated to the U S   including the completion of roughly 1 800 EOTF projects  Restaurant development also continues to be an important driver of our growth equation  We plan to open about 1 400 new restaurants this year  substantially all in markets outside the U S  We ll spend approximately  800 million of our capital to open about 400 restaurants in our wholly owned markets  And our developmental licensees and affiliates will spend their capital for the remaining openings  of which over 450 are planned in China  So while we expect total capital this year will be similar to 2019  we ve shifted about  200 million from reinvestment to new restaurants  which are higher returning investments  As we enter 2020  I m confident that we re well positioned to deliver sustained long term profitable growth for the system and our shareholders Now I ll turn it back to Chris to close Chris Kempczinski    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe ve been on an ambitious journey in the last few years  from turnaround to transformation  And through it all  we ve made a path forward even as the landscape changes  With these changes  customer expectations evolve  placing new demands on the world s leading brands  We re ready for that challenge  embracing it across our business with the enduring strength and values that make McDonald s a force for positive social and economic development in every community we serve  As we enter 2020  we do so from a position of strength and with an unwavering commitment to our Velocity Growth Plan  the accelerators driving it and the incredible people and partners who keep us nimble  agile and open in new innovations and new possibilities We have some exciting milestones ahead of us in 2020  including worldwide convention in April  On a final note  I d like to offer a heartfelt thank you to everyone across the McDonald s system who helped us achieve this milestone of  100 billion in systemwide sales this past year  It s the sum of many things done right every day by every employee  supplier  franchisee and crew member around the world  I m proud of our collective success and grateful for their commitment as we begin a new year With that  let s beginQuestions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions Mike Cieplak    Investor Relations OfficerOur first question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen Andrew Charles    Cowen    AnalystChris  I know you and Joe are prioritizing U S  traffic growth in 2020  but can you help outline your confidence this can be achieved  On the one hand  there s better alignment with operators at the start of this year versus a year ago  which is aided by the simplification efforts that you guys have put in place  But on the other hand  breakfast competition is set to intensify shortly here  will the same store sales benefit from Experience of the Future likely to be lower in 2020 versus what you saw in 2019 Chris Kempczinski    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Good morning  Thank you  Andrew  So as Kevin talked about  and as you alluded to  getting the U S  to positive guest count growth for us is the  1 priority  I think the things that certainly give me confidence or make me feel better about our ability to do that is  as you mentioned  we have really strong alignment with franchisees at this point  that this needs to be a priority  One of the things that s  I think  sometimes not fully appreciated about the U S  on an operator basis  it s largely a franchise    or it s largely a family business in the U S  Over half of our franchisees are second and third generation franchisees  And so for them  they completely recognize that no family business survives or thrives by passing on fewer customers from one generation to the next  So that s an important part of this And then the second is we have a really good understanding of what it s going to take for us to drive guest counts to positive in the U S  It starts with breakfast  Breakfast is the only daypart in the industry that s seeing traffic growth  We have to win at breakfast  There s obviously a lot of focus and attention that we re going to be putting on that in 2020  And then the second is a recognition that on rest of day deal or rest of day value  that we need to be competitive on that  So I think between alignment with the franchisees  between really  I think  a pretty keen understanding of where we need to focus  I feel good about that  we did see  in Q4  modest sequential improvement on it  But for us  there is certainly not    it s too early to call a trend on this  We ve got to see this happen over four or five quarters  And so it s going to be something we re going to be paying attention to and I m sure you guys will be asking us about it as well  So more to come on that Mike Cieplak    Investor Relations OfficerOur next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Eric Gonzalez    KeyBanc    AnalystIt seems like the industry has become a bit more promotional since the start of the year  Would you agree with that  Or is that typical for this time of the year  And then has your view changed at all in response to the current competitive environment in recent weeks as your competitor gets closer to rolling out breakfast Chris Kempczinski    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Thanks  Eric  January is always a highly competitive time of the year  So I think the activity that we re seeing right now  I wouldn t characterize it as being unusually pronounced  I think  again  this is always something that happened at the beginning of the year  But I think what you re talking about and what you mentioned is really a recognition that growth in this industry at this point is going to have to come through stealing share  Traffic in the industry is pretty muted  There s very little traffic growth  In fact  if you re not growing units  you ve got a headwind there  So I think that s one recognition  And certainly  you re seeing  I think  just a lot of people really wanting to make sure that they can get the growth that they need to be able to offset some of the cost headwinds  So I think between those two things  it has been a competitive environment  it s going to continue to be a competitive environment  but I wouldn t say I m seeing an uptick right now Mike Cieplak    Investor Relations OfficerOur next question is from David Tarantino with Baird David Tarantino    Baird    AnalystMy question is on some of the investments you made on the technology side  You made some pretty big bets across the last year or so  and it looks like you re sort of staffing up to support that technology investment with your G A spending  So just wondering  one  are there more big investments on the horizon that you see as needed  And then two  have you considered recouping some of those investments or sharing some of the cost of your franchisees through a technology fee or something similar that others have put in place Chris Kempczinski    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Well  as you noted  we did do two acquisitions last year  we bought Dynamic Yield  which was going to help us with our suggestive sell capability  and we bought Apprente  which is for voice recognition through the drive thru of that capability  I would say our typical approach is partner not buy  And so both of those  for somewhat different reasons were  I think  unique situations  I don t foresee that buying tech companies is going to be our approach going forward  But we do want to be nimble enough where there are situations that come up that we will make an acquisition  I think in the case of Dynamic Yield  what we saw there was really an opportunity for us to accelerate our rollout of suggestive sell across most of our major markets there with what we believe to be kind of the leading technology in the industry And so with the idea of really wanting to drive an acceleration and do it with a leading partner  we made that acquisition of Dynamic Yield  Fast forward  even less than a year later  we ve got Dynamic Yield in all 10 000 plus U S  restaurants with a drive thru  It s fully rolled out in Australia  And we re seeing a comp lift  very consistent with what we had modeled when the acquisition was done  Similarly  with Apprente  we ve got Apprente in test in a handful of U S  restaurants  and we remain optimistic about that  So I think what you re seeing really is  for us  just an emphasis on    we believe digital has the opportunity to really be a huge growth driver for us  When we can partner with people and do it kind of under our traditional model  that s always our preference But if there are times that we need to do an acquisition  we re certainly not going to take that off the table  I think your question about is there a model in terms of how that gets shared with franchisees  I think one benefit is when you get the lift that we are getting with something like Dynamic Yield  we obviously participate through rent and service on that  So I d say the first part is all of these are meant to drive top line growth  and when we see that  we certainly participate from rent and service  On the ongoing costs  the ongoing costs do get passed through to franchisees as part of our normal tech fee  We kind of separate tech costs between development costs and sort of the ongoing operating costs  We will typically pay for the development costs on our own  and then the ongoing costs are what gets shared through a tech fee arrangement with our franchisees  So that s been kind of our model for a long period of time  I don t see that model changing Mike Cieplak    Investor Relations OfficerOur next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley John Glass    Morgan Stanley    AnalystJust following up on that  In the U S   Chris  how comfortable are you with the check growth that you ve experienced in 2019  It s more than 100  of the comp  Is it possible we would see the same kind of check growth in 2020  Or are you less comfortable given that it may hurt the value proposition for the brand  And if you are willing to share  what is the comp lift that you modeled for Dynamic Yield that you re experiencing currently Chris Kempczinski    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  John  One of the things that I do feel good about with the U S  is when you look at the check growth that we ve gotten  it s really come through a number of different things  There has not been sort of a one trick pony on that  We re seeing the majority of that growth is coming through mix as opposed to just kind of straight menu price  But then as you decompose mix  you ve got a number of factors that are worked there  You ve got delivery  which is delivering 2x the average check of a regular order  You have Dynamic Yield  which is typically leading to add ons to an order  You have our self order kiosk  where we know that people tend to have larger orders when they do self order kiosk You ve seen some of our promotional items like donut sticks  D  1  2  3 as a value  which are really driving add on activity  So I think  for me  I do feel better about how we went after check growth in 2019 because it was heavily mix driven from that  But there is a pricing element to this  The inflation that we re seeing out there  particularly on the labor side  that does get priced through  And so I think as we head into 2020  the conversation we ve been having with franchisees  which gets back to the opening question  is we ve just got to make sure that we have balance  We need to have a balance between check growth and we need to get to transaction growth  and that s what everybody in the U S  is working toward right now Kevin Ozan    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd then regarding kind of quantifying the Dynamic Yield lift  we generally don t quantify specific components of our comp  What I would say is it will be potentially different in different countries  So right now  we re certainly getting a bigger lift from Dynamic Yield in the U S  than in Australia  In Australia  they had a rudimentary suggestive sell already in the drive thru  So as we put a Dynamic Yield  there wasn t as larger a lift as we re certainly experiencing in the U S  But the big positive about Dynamic Yield is our plans would be to take that similar decisioning engine type logic and be able to use that further in kiosk and global mobile app ultimately  So that we need    can continue getting further sales lifts in other digital mechanisms also Mike Cieplak    Investor Relations OfficerOur next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer Brian Bittner    Oppenheimer    AnalystCan you just talk a little bit more about the capex strategy moving forward  When we met in December in New York  it sounded like there was somewhat of a pivot happening in how you were thinking about the capex strategy even past 2020  I believe you were really starting to see areas you could invest in moving forward that would maybe keep capex elevated  Can you just talk about this  And ultimately  what does your steady state capex look like  And what year do you expect that to occur Chris Kempczinski    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Thanks  Brian  So as we talked about  we always said  19 and  20 would be similar  So we had  2 4 billion in 2019  we ll have a relatively similar amount in 2020  And as we ve indicated  we expect capex to come down some in 2021  The one area that we re currently reviewing and evaluating is our international business and potential unit expansion there  As you know  our international business is very strong  we see very high returns on investments in new restaurants in those markets  and we believe there s further potential for unit growth in many of those markets  So we re currently evaluating the opportunity to invest in some of those new units outside the U S  You ll see that we have gone up a little bit in our openings in 2020  growing about 1 400 new units that should  between those and the ones we opened in 2019  contribute roughly 1 5 to our sales growth  So that s the one area we re currently evaluating  I think as far as longer term  we want to get through this evaluation  then we ll talk further about that when we have our Investor Day later this year Mike Cieplak    Investor Relations OfficerOur next question is from Chris O Cull with Stifel Chris O Cull    Stifel    AnalystMy question is about value  It sounds like everyday value will be necessary to improve the systems  relative market share this year  And I believe franchisees are only required to feature a few items on the D  1  2  3 value menu  So how does the company convince franchisees to be more aggressive with everyday value given the cost pressures they re facing Chris Kempczinski    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I think it s not just everyday value that are    is part of the equation  there s also what we would call deal value  which is sort of the post on and off type of value  And so I think from our vantage point  it s probably going to be more of the latter in terms of how do we smartly and in a disciplined way  pulse deal value throughout the year on this  and where are there opportunities for us to do it that  in a way  can drive both traffic and can protect margins  So we ve been having a lot of conversations on that  As you would imagine  I m not going to telegraph on this call in terms of how we actually plan to go about it  But I think back to a couple of the earlier points that we ve talked about here  there is strong alignment with the owner operators the U S  that we need to be in a situation where we re getting both transaction growth as well as check growth  And so it s up to us now to deliver on it  but I do think there s good alignment to it  And it s probably going to come more through deal than it is necessarily everyday value  I think we ve got a good everyday value platform embedded already Mike Cieplak    Investor Relations OfficerOur next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim Matt DiFrisco    Guggenheim    AnalystThere s been some reports about you guys closing some stores in China  I wonder    I know you guys don t give specific guidance for the year  but can you sort of at least help us understand how much exposure the MCD shareholders have to that market  whether that s in a worldwide revenue or your operating income Chris Kempczinski    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  yes  Well obviously  the situation in China is fluid and it s concerning  Right now  as you would expect  our priority is really on our employees  on our customers  doing everything we can to make sure that they are safe and taken care of  And so in that vein  we ve been working a lot with the local authorities  particularly in the Hubei province  We have closed all restaurants in the Hubei province  which is several hundred restaurants that have been closed  But importantly  we do still have about 3 000 restaurants in the country that are still open  So several hundred closed  but 3 000 that are still open We ve also  with the China team  we ve put in place an epidemic prevention and control task force  which is something we re doing again in combination with the local authorities there  And it s everything from using our kitchens to help provide meals to healthcare workers in hospitals  We re doing things in terms of giving medical screening for customers who come to some of our restaurants  So it s really an  all hands on deck  effort from that vantage point  China for us is a critical strategic market  but I think it s probably more because of the potential that we see in that market as opposed to its materiality to the business today Just to put it in perspective  when you think about China  it does represent about 9  of our global restaurant count  but it s about 4  to 5  of systemwide sales and it s only about 3  of op income  And so while  again  China is a critical market for us and we re very concerned about the situation over there  its actual impact on our business is going to be fairly small  assuming  again  that it stays contained to China Mike Cieplak    Investor Relations OfficerOur next question is from Sara Sara Senatore with Bernstein Sara Sara Senatore    Bernstein    AnalystA question and also a follow up  please  So just on the outlook for G A  I think at the investor event last month  and certainly you reiterated just now  the sort of very case specific reason to make acquisitions  But I mean  how should we think about tech spend going forward  I think the guidance for G A this year was a little bit higher than I would have expected  I know some of that is the owner operator convention  Maybe you could quantify that But just from the perspective of should we be thinking about technology as a line item that grows faster going forward  sort of in that mid single digit range  more similar to labor than to other investments  Just trying to anticipate that  And then the clarifying question was you talked about franchisees having record owner operator cash flow this year in the U S  Does that give you any more flexibility in terms of the value that you can address  Or are franchisees more looking to kind of protect that after having had a couple of years of declining cash flows Kevin Ozan    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAll right  I ll talk about the G A first  and then I ll let Chris come back and talk about value and the franchisees  Related to G A  a couple of points  We ve talked about how we ve gotten more efficient with our day to day G A  and we re investing in technology and R D  so things like Dynamic Yield and Apprente  And the things we re investing in are either top line drivers or cost saving potentials  So that s how we think about kind of some of these specific investments  We have decreased our overall G A as a percent of sales from around 2 8  in 2016 to 2 2  in 2019 And roughly    today  roughly more than 10  of that G A spend is actually depreciation and amortization related to technology spend  So a chunk of that G A is noncash as it relates to prior year spend  We do    as you indicate  we expect full year G A in 2020 to be up 5  to 7  in constant currency due to those investments  But that s    because I m lapping partial year on some of the acquisitions  we now will have full year in 2020  So that level of increase  we certainly do not expect going forward  But as we ve talked about for 2020 or as I mentioned in my script  first half of 2020 will be significantly higher growth rates than the second half of 2020 And then  I guess  the only other thing I d say is we re in the midst of updating all of our analysis and long term models also with the G A  But so far  we haven t seen anything that significantly changes any of our thinking on G A long term  So we don t think about it any differently today than I did a couple of years ago  But I do have    obviously  to your point  we had an increase in  19  we have a little larger increase in  20  But certainly  we don t expect that increase to be a run rate increase going forward Chris Kempczinski    President and Chief Executive OfficerOn the point about or question about franchisee cash flow  it s exciting when you see the system set a record for franchisee cash flow  And in 2019  in the U S   they did so in kind of a resounding way  I mean  they blew through the prior cash flow record and surpassed that by probably another  50 000 or something like that  So it s a really good thing when you have wealthy franchisees who are making a lot of money because it means that their mentality is to be aggressive to invest in the business  Now that can take a number of different forms That could take investments in the restaurant  And some of the capital investments that we ve been doing  it can take the form of putting more labor in the restaurants and it can take the form of value as you talking about  So to me  it s more about the point that our U S  owner operators are in a really healthy spot right now  I think that s also reflected in their sentiment  and they want to keep it going  And so that s going to require staying aggressive on the business  and I m confident they re going to do that Kevin Ozan    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSorry  Sara  The one other thing you asked about was convention  and I forgot about that  But convention    our operator convention that we have every other year is roughly  25 million to  30 million Mike Cieplak    Investor Relations OfficerOur next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays Jeff Bernstein    Barclays    AnalystSo the question  as we think about the 2020 financial performance  Chris  I know you mentioned you re starting the year strong from a top line perspective  On the flip side  I guess  you re talking about maybe some elevated G A in the short term  So I m just wondering how you think about that in relation to your thoughts on achieving your long term algorithm  which is for high single digit EPS growth  I know you don t necessarily guide specifically to any one year  but just wondering how you see that potentially playing out  whether this is a year where we could expect some more normalized comparison to long term growth  And within that  that return of cash that you mentioned  I know you finished your three year target  I m just wondering whether  going forward  we should now just think of it as you re going to return all free cash in any one year versus perhaps giving a target for one or multiple years Chris Kempczinski    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Thanks  Jeff  Let me hit    it s a couple of different things  Let me first talk about 2020  If you do the math  basically  with all of the guidance we ve given  hopefully you get to similar places where we are  which is we do expect EPS growth for 2020 to meet the high single digit target  Certainly  a lower tax rate is helping that growth rate  And as you mentioned  it may not be even growth rates quarter by quarter through the year because of some of the individual quarter pressures But as we look at the full year  we do have an expectation of being within that high single digit EPS growth rate target for 2020  Regarding cash return  we re fortunate to generate a substantial amount of cash flow and be able to fund both the investments that we want to make in the business and still return a significant amount to shareholders  As I mentioned in my remarks  our free cash flow was  5 7 billion in 2019  which was up over 35   Free cash flow conversion was around 95   As we had internal discussions and discussed with several of our large shareholders  we decided not to give a specific dollar target over a three year period for cash return  But there is    but I do want to reiterate our capital allocation philosophy because there is no change to that As I mentioned  the priorities remain the same  first  to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business  second  to continue growing our dividend  and third  to buy back shares  We do expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders  And in our modeling  we anticipate net incremental debt of roughly  1 billion each year for the next few years  So that should give you an idea of kind of where the cash return comes out to that  Thanks Mike Cieplak    Investor Relations OfficerOur next question is from Chris Carril with RBC Chris Carril    RBC    AnalystSo with so much attention focused on the morning daypart given the rollout of breakfast by a large competitor  how do you assess the opportunity to strengthen your competitive position in the other dayparts as breakfast becomes more of a focus for the industry Chris Kempczinski    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I think as you look at our business and you think about our 2020 plan  when I look at it  there is a good balance  I mean  we certainly have  I think  a pretty strong breakfast plan  We have a combination of menu news at breakfast  We have some service  things that we re really looking at driving at breakfast  And then certainly  we plan on remaining competitive from a value standpoint in breakfast  But there s a lot of other things that we still have on the calendar  And so if you think about a couple of years ago  we talked about really focusing on food and it was going to be a focus on burger  chicken and coffee And I think you re going to see for us  in 2020  that there s going to be burger news  there s going to be things that we re doing there that continue to keep driving our QPC business  which really has been a standout performer for us the last couple of years  Obviously  a lot of discussion about chicken  Don t want to get specifically into timing and what we would do there  but we re committed to really updating it and competing in an aggressive way in the chicken segment  so you should expect something there  And then we do see opportunities as well around beverages  desserts  So as the year unfolds  I think you ll see us staying strong on breakfast  but it s not going to be at the expense of rest of day Mike Cieplak    Investor Relations OfficerOur next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS Dennis Geiger    UBS    AnalystJust wondering if you could touch a bit more on operations and throughput and the opportunities there specific to drive thru times  I think you touched on globally  perhaps how that s been progressing  So specifically in the U S   maybe how much of an opportunity that is in 2020  and perhaps what part technology plays in improving the operations and those throughput times Chris Kempczinski    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Well  I think in the U S   I m really pleased with the performance that the team put up in 2019  As we talked about in our comments  we re at record customer satisfaction scores in the U S  driven by operations  and we re seeing it broad based across a number of ops metrics that we re looking at  The team did a really nice job in 2019 speeding up our drive thrus  We saw good performance there  But I think what we re also excited about is we think there s more that we can do there  We think that there s certainly 20  30 additional seconds that we want to go try to get in 2020  And it s a combination of activities  It s a combination of menu simplification moves  It s a combination of training and really making sure we have the right focus We re doing things to bring fun into the restaurant to create kind of that competitive rivalry there  And then technology is a component to that  I d say right now  in 2020  I don t see technology necessarily being a huge part of what s going to be driving cash flow or driving speed of service  rather  We have ZOOM timers  which is an internal thing that we use  that really gives the team a very detailed breakdown of each kind of part of the customer journey as they go through the drive thrus  We can be very pinpointed on how to drive speed of service  But that s now deployed in most of our restaurants  So I think in 2020  it s going to be a lot of blocking and tackling  Longer term  we re obviously very excited about what technology can do to help with speed of service  which is why we ve done acquisitions like we did with Apprente  If we re able to get that commercialized and deployed  that s certainly going to be something that helps us with the speed of service in the future Mike Cieplak    Investor Relations OfficerWe have time for one more question from Greg Francfort of Bank of America Merrill Lynch Greg Francfort    Bank America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThis is kind of a two parter  But just in terms of the check  I know I might be beating a dead horse here  but just can you quantify how much of that is spend per customer versus customers per ticket  as we try to think about maybe framing up like 7  check is not actually that much on a per customer basis  And then the other question  I know you just touched on it on chicken and you don t want to get into timing of new launches  but can you maybe talk about what your competitors are doing that McDonald    I guess  I would think that there s nothing that McDonald s couldn t replicate that your customers are doing  Is it a space constraint of getting new equipment  Is it getting the right flavors  Or is there something else that you re focused on in trying to improve the chicken quality Kevin Ozan    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo I ll cover the check real quick and then Chris can talk about chicken  A couple of things on check  So roughly right now  60  of check is mix and 40  is pricing  So    and that s been relatively consistent  I ll say  throughout    I think we probably said roughly 2 3  but it s in that range really throughout the year for 2019  We are seeing    in general  we re seeing a little bit higher customers per ticket If you think about the way the business is evolving between things like delivery and the kiosks  we generally now have a little bit higher number of customers per ticket  So that is a piece of it  But even knowing that  we have been able to grow guest counts in many of our international markets  so I don t want to imply that  that would say that we should be able to grow guest counts in the U S  The dynamics are changing  but we believe we can still grow guest counts even with those change in dynamics Chris Kempczinski    President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd on your chicken question  you re right  we have a very detailed and intimate understanding of what our competitors are doing there  I think  for us  it s really all about finding a product that works in our restaurants  And so that has an operations component  Our menu  as you know  is much more broad than some of our competitors  So that s something we need to be mindful of in terms of how    what we might do in chicken  what knock on effect that might have on the rest of menu from a speed of service  And then there are some equipment differences in terms of the equipment that we have in our restaurants versus what some of our competitors would have What we ve been out testing    we re in a test right now  as you probably know  But we re testing a number of different approaches in terms of not just what you might do from a product standpoint  but are there things that we might want to do differently from an operations standpoint or are there things we might want to think about differently from an equipment standpoint  So like anything with menu in McDonald s  it s a little bit of a Rubik s cube of what s the customer looking for  what works operationally and then the business fundamentals under that  But I think I feel good about where we re going to net add on chicken  I think we re getting close to having something that we re excited to bring to customers Mike Cieplak    Investor Relations OfficerThank you  Chris and Kevin  And thank you  everyone  in joining the call

 Reuters    Chinese private equity firm CITIC Capital is actively bidding for a 22  stake in McDonald s Corp s  N MCD  mainland China and Hong Kong businesses  its chairman and chief executive told Reuters on Thursday 
The stake is being sold by state owned CITIC Ltd  HK 0267   which together with CITIC Capital and  Carlyle Group   O CG  bought 80  of McDonald s China business in 2017 
Zhang Yichen  talking to Reuters Global Markets Forum participants on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos  Switzerland  said the final result of the sale should be known in early February 
 Getting an additional stake will consolidate the control of the company in the hands of CITIC Capital which will facilitate  the  long term stability of the company   said Zhang  who is also chairman of McDonald s China and Hong Kong 
Reuters reported earlier this month CITIC Capital would be the most likely buyer of the stake 
CITIC Ltd is the main listed arm of state owned conglomerate CITIC Group while CITIC Capital is the group s flagship PE arm 
The firm  which raised  2 8 billion last August in its fourth China buyout fund  will launch fundraising for a Japan focused mid market buyout fund toward the end of 2020  Zhang said 
CITIC Capital plans to raise  200 million for a special purpose acquisition company in a U S  initial public offering  according to its filing to the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday

195491,417007,MCD,McDonald s Earnings  3 Trends to Watch,news,"McDonald s  NYSE MCD  shares had been keeping pace with the broader market s rally last year    right up until late October  That s when the fast food giant s stock fell in the wake of soft third quarter results 
The chain posted strong global sales growth and industry leading profitability  However  there was no evidence of the U S  rebound that executives have been targeting for over a year  The Q3 report also raised questions about whether Mickey D s can thrive in an environment where consumers opt for delivery over carry out or drive thru options 
Its fourth quarter earnings report should add clarity around these challenges while also helping investors learn the priorities of Chris Kempczinksi  who recently took over the CEO position following the abrupt exit of Steve Easterbrook in early November 
Let s take a look at three things to expect when McDonald s reports results on Wednesday  Jan  29 

1  Traffic for the U S  market keeps shrinking
Easterbrook still led the restaurant giant in late October when McDonald s reported what he described as  strong  global results  That s a fair assessment  given that comparable store sales rose 5 9  to stay roughly steady with the prior quarter  The chain grew much more quickly than peers like Yum  Brands  Domino s Pizza  and Shake Shack  It even edged past Starbucks  impressive expansion pace 
But customer traffic trends have been another story  In the core U S  market  traffic continued shrinking last quarter as it has for about two years  Starbucks  on the other hand  noted a 3  increase in traffic and a 3  boost in average spending  Investors are hoping to see a similarly balanced result from McDonald s this week  but the chain has had to rely entirely on increased average spending through most of fiscal 2019 
2  Delivery challenges related to promotional pricing
The slow growth in the U S  might have something to do with the flood of third party aggregators that are delivering food to homes and businesses today  Right now  many of these companies are offering promotional pricing in hopes of winning market share  and that situation appears to be hurting established national giants like Domino s and McDonald s 
We ll find out this week whether McDonald s sees this issue harming the business into 2020  or if management is as bullish as ever on the new sales channel  Back in October  executives noted that delivery sales were pushing up guest satisfaction while lifting average spending  Results are even better in markets like France and Australia  though  so look for the chain to do its best to close that gap over the next few quarters 
3  Clues provided regarding the financial steps forward
Most rival restaurant chains would kill for McDonald s 44  operating margin  But investors have been disappointed to see that core profitability figure hold steady for the last year after surging higher since 2015  That increase was powered by the chain s refranchising initiative  and now that this program is complete  it s not likely that shareholders will see much more growth here

195520,417036,MCD,Peruvian government firms up labor laws after McDonald s deaths,news,"By Marco Aquino
LIMA  Reuters    Peru s government on Friday night announced measures to strengthen penalties for companies found responsible for workplace accidents  days after two McDonald s franchisee workers died in one of its restaurants 
Minister of Labor Sylvia Caceres said from now on there would be an automatic closure of 10 to 20 days of businesses where accidents happened to allow for a full investigation  which could extend to 30 days if the company s responsibility for the accident was determined 
 Closure  for the 30 day maximum  will be considered when it has been determined that the employer has breached its obligations and thereby affected the health and life of its workers   Caceres told a news conference on Friday night 
She made no mention of the deaths of Alexandra Porras  18  and Carlos Campo  19  a young couple who died by electrocution while cleaning the kitchen of a McDonald s Corp  N MCD  restaurant operated by its Latin American franchisee Arcos Dorados  N ARCO  
The general manager of the McDonald s operating firm in Peru said in an interview with local TV that the drinks supply machine at the restaurant was suffering from an electrical fault that its managers had not reported to the company s maintenance department 
This week the labor inspection agency found Arcos Dorados Peru guilty of six  very serious  safety and health violations that caused the death of pair and proposed the company be fined  254 000 
Caceres said that fines for fatal accidents  have no relevance if they do not even affect the operation of the company economically  
 We believe that this is a step forward to reinforce the dissuasive capacity that the labor inspectorate must exert for employers who deliberately and irresponsibly breach their obligations and affect the health of our workers   she said

NEW YORK  Reuters    McDonald s Corp  N MCD  employees on Thursday sued the fast food giant and several of its franchisees in Chicago over a store redesign that staffers say has made it easier for angry customers to leap over the counter and attack them 
The suit  filed in Illinois  Circuit Court of Cook County by 17 Chicago area McDonald s workers  claims McDonald s has failed to protect them from a pattern of violence 
Employees have been threatened with guns  beaten with a wet floor sign  had kitchen equipment thrown at them by a naked customer  been pepper sprayed  been flashed and propositioned  and even urinated on  according to the complaint 
 McDonald s takes seriously its responsibility to provide and foster a safe working environment for our employees  and along with our franchisees  continue to make investments in training programs that uphold safe environments for customers and crew members   the company said in a statement that did not mention whether it planned to contest the lawsuit 
 In addition to training  McDonald s maintains stringent policies against violence in our restaurants  
The lawsuit targets McDonald s so called  Experience of the Future  store renovations announced in 2017  part of a corporate turnaround plan that came after years of stagnant sales 
The company said last year that it and its franchisees would invest  6 billion to revamp most of its roughly 14 000 U S  stores 
In October  executives said more than 9 000 stores had completed remodeling   about two thirds of all U S  locations   with more in development before year s end  and that the modernized stores had improved overall sales 
But the suit claims that the new design features split and lowered counters  creating easy access for customers seeking to harm employees on the other side 
Filed in conjunction with the Fight for  15 and a Union  the complaint alleges a nationwide epidemic of in store violence  including an armed robbery at a McDonald s in Orlando  Florida when workers were held at gunpoint in a walk in freezer

Chris Kempczinski  who was in charge of McDonald s operations in the United States  took over from Easterbrook on Sunday  following his dismissal over a recent consensual relationship with an employee  which McDonald s board determined violated company policy 
Piper Jaffray   Co on Monday downgraded the stock to  neutral  from  buy   citing the likely disruption from a sudden change of this magnitude 
 Our experience leads us to take a more cautionary view noting the potential lack of momentum and time involved in formalizing a new team   analyst Miller Regan said 
Kempczinski has inherited the top spot at the world s largest fast food chain when its struggling to bring in more customers at its restaurants amid a shift to healthier food choices and delivery apps available at their finger tips 
McDonald s has spent billions to modernize stores  add digital kiosks and automate parts of the ordering process as part of its turnaround plan under Easterbrook  who took over as the CEO in 2015 
He was credited with franchising 95  of McDonald s U S  fleet  launching the popular all day breakfast  revamping restaurants to add digital ordering kiosks and making tech acquisitions to remodel stores  The company s stock has nearly doubled in value under him

 Easterbrook was a change agent at McDonald s and his leadership  particularly in the face of difficult decisions     will be missed    Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analyst Jon Tower said 
For Kempczinski  a Harvard alumnus  the biggest challenge will be rapid changes in the industry and the push to grow restaurant traffic  especially after McDonald s remodeling investments  a switch to fresh beef and cheaper menu items that weighed on margins and service time 
 We are unsure how McDonald s strategy might change under Kempczinski s leadership as most major initiatives are already well underway   said BTIG analyst Peter Saleh

By Kathy Lien  Managing Director Of FX Strategy For BK Asset Management
Currencies and equities traded sharply higher today with the Dow soaring more than 400 points intraday  Based on this rally and the strong performance in USD JPY  it would be easy to assume that coronavirus fears are easing and investors are moving on  However  we have not even seen the beginning of the impact of the virus on economic data and the only thing masking the pain is Chinese stimulus  On Monday  Chinese banks were urged to provide liquidity  the government sent out guidances to limit short selling  cut interest rates by 10bp and injected  175 billion into the banking system  Overnight  the central bank provided even more liquidity through reverse repos and confirmed that the  national team  of state backed buyers is prepared to buy stocks if necessary  For now  all of these efforts combined with strong earnings reports from big U S  names effectively stemmed the slide in currencies and equities 
The U S  and Australian dollars were the best performers with USD JPY experiencing its strongest one day rally in 3 weeks  There s a lot of overhead resistance between 109 50 and 109 70 but if stocks push higher  so will USD JPY  The Australian dollar rallied on the back of the Reserve Bank s rate decision and its gains helped to lift NZD  Euro and the Canadian dollars were the weakest performers  While EZ data has been mostly positive  the conflicting stances by the UK and EU on post Brexit trade along with a close election in Ireland are beginning to weigh on the currency 
Its central banks versus the coronavirus and right now central banks are winning  Investors were also comforted by the Reserve Bank s decision to keep interest rates unchanged  According to RBA Governor Lower  the virus  is having a significant effect on the Chinese economy at present  It is too early to determine how long lasting the impact will be   Based on these comments  the RBA feels that despite the spread of the virus and the potential economic impact  they don t see an immediate need to ease  Although the market still expects a rate cut later this year  equities and currencies are rallying because investors think this wait and see attitude could be shared by other central banks  Another way to explain this is that while the market panicked at the start of the year  everyone but the PBoC has not and they want to see how deep the impact really is before reacting 
With that said  the virus  economic toll will be significant  SARS cost the world  40 billion and between the lost travel revenue to the earnings dent for companies like SBUX  DIS  MCD and AAPL who have closed their stores and airliners who have canceled flights to China  the impact will be much bigger  So while central bankers are successfully propping up the markets right now  when the dust settles and the numbers are shared  risk aversion will return

195581,417097,MCD,Broad Market Sector Rotation Starts In 60  Days   Part II,opinion,"The first part of this article highlighted what we believe is the start of a broad market sector rotation setup in the U S  and global markets   This second part will highlight what we believe are excellent examples of sector trade setups for our friends and followers 
As China continues to pour capital into its markets to stabilize the outflow and fall of asset prices  a number of interesting components of broader sector rotation are setting up   First  the U S  stock market has rolled lower in what we are calling a  first tier  of the  waterfall event   
Additionally  mid caps  transportation  energy and financials have all started to roll over and begun to rotate lower   We believe the contraction in economic activity and global market engagement as a result of the Wuhan virus will result in a much bigger and broader downside price move than many are expecting in the coming weeks  
The death toll for the Coronavirus outbreak reached 910  surpassing the number that died in the 2003 SARS episode  This is causing huge issues with global supply chains and shipping companies as I talked about last week in my HoweStreet Interview 
We believe traders need to be aware of the continued capital shift that has been taking place over the past 4  years   As foreign markets struggle and the U S  dollar continues to strengthen  capital has been moving into the U S  stock market as a protective measure   We think this will continue throughout the virus event  yet we believe the U S  stock market will contract and move lower as a result of the 
Many U S  companies are still exposed to foreign markets through overseas engagement and retail locations   automakers  consumer products  manufacturing  heavy equipment and dozens of other sectors  which derive 5  to 25   of their revenues from China and other overseas markets   McDonald s  NYSE MCD   Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX    Caterpillar   NYSE CAT  and dozens of other U S  companies have broad exposure in China and Asia   We think this virus event could last well into July and possibly much longer   Because of this  we believe a broad sector rotation will set in and that volatility will continue to increase over the next 6 to 12  months 
Here are the three sectors we believe have a strong potential for setting up a fantastic trade 
The Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  has already started to move a bit lower over the last few weeks   Even though the U S  stock market was plowing higher throughout most of December and January  the Russell 2000 is actually showing signs of a rounded top formation with a very clear downside  first leg   waterfall  type of price decline   We believe broader market contraction and sector rotation could push IWM below  144 in an attempt to target historical support near  126 







The technology sector may see a broader market decline over the next 30 to 60 days that could push TECS from recent lows  below  6  to levels above  12 to  16 on a reactionary move in this 3x ETF   TECS has experienced very low volatility over the past 3  months while the U S  stock market has continued to rally in Q3 and Q4   Any breakdown in the global technology sector could push TECS well above recent peak levels near  18 







The financial sector is very likely to experience a 3  to 10  decrease in consumer activity related to the lack of travel  outside entertainment  shopping and food services activities and could see extended risk to loans  debts and other services as a result of a global economic market contraction   We believe a downside risk exists in XLF where the price will likely break below  30 and target the  25 to  26 level over the next 30 to 60  days   Ultimately  XLF must hold above the December 2018 lows near  22 if the current downside rotation ends within recent price ranges   A move below  22 would indicate we have entered a new stage of a bear trend 







The reality of the situation for most of us is that we are not at immediate risk of catching anything except a common cold or flu   As skilled traders  we must identify an opportunity where it presents itself and we must attempt to learn to capitalize on that opportunity   We believe these sectors  and many others  are about to present very real trading opportunities for skilled traders   
The virus is expected to double in scope every 6 5 days based on modeling data   Obviously China and Asia are the biggest risks right now   Our biggest concern is that the virus spreads into India and Africa   We believe a spread into these regions could add hundreds of thousands or millions of infected people to the lists   At this point  it is far too early to tell how extended this virus event will become   yet we feel we are just starting this rotation and the true scope of it won t be known for many weeks or months ",2020-02-11,Chris Vermeulen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/broad-market-sector-rotation-starts-in-60-days--part-ii-200506162,200506162

The action at its restaurants across Britain will save an estimated 320 tonnes of single use plastic every year  the fast food giant said 
Larger rival McDonald s Corp  N MCD  announced on Wednesday that some of its restaurants in Britain and Ireland would allow customers to swap toys in happy meals for a fruit bag from next month and that it planned to introduce books as an option from early next year 
Burger King said it had been galvanized by Southampton sisters Ella and Caitlin McEwan s Change org petition  calling on Burger King and McDonald s to stop giving plastic toys with their kids  meals for the sake of the environment 
The chief executive of Burger King UK  Alasdair Murdoch  said the plastic toy initiative was one strand of a wider strategy to reduce packaging 
 What we are really focused on is removing single use plastics  and that s why we ve done that with the toys   Murdoch said 
Burger King  a unit of Canada s Restaurant Brands International  TO QSR   said on Thursday it was also installing amnesty bins at its UK stores that would accept donations of plastic toys that are given away free by either competitors  magazines or in cereal boxes 
These items would then be given a  new purpose  and transformed into play areas for selected stores and special trays encouraging play across restaurants

The world s largest burger chain joins Tim Hortons  KFC and Dunkin  Brands in moving ahead with versions of a plant based addition to their menus using Beyond Meat s patties 
Shares of Beyond Meat  which have roughly tripled in value since the company s listing on the stock market in May  surged 17  in early trading  while those of McDonald s were up marginally 
The new PLT sandwich  which the company said was without artificial colors  flavors or preservatives  will be priced at C 6 49 plus tax and will be sold in 28 restaurants in southwestern Ontario  Canada from Monday 
Beyond Meat  one of the pioneers of plant based meat substitutes  is competing fiercely with Silicon Valley based Impossible Foods for dominance of the plant based meat market  which  Barclays   LON BARC  analysts say is expected to explode  growing to an estimated  140 billion over the next 10 years 
McDonald s already sells vegan burgers in some European countries  It joined hands with Nestle to launch the  Big Vegan TS  plant based burger in Germany and  The Big Vegan  burger in Israel  It also offers the  McVegan  burger in Sweden 
 A lot of people have been asking McDonald s if they are going to do this  I do think to offer the consumer another option is nice  but again  it remains to be seen on what the uptake is   said Brian Yarbrough  an analyst with Edward Jones 
Yarbrough pointed to Tim Horton s  owned by Canada s Restaurant Brands International

What s Next for McDonald s 
While McDonald s has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

195604,417120,MCD,Impossible Foods signs major meat supplier to make its plant based burgers,news,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Plant based burger maker Impossible Foods on Wednesday announced a partnership with major meat supplier OSI Group  OSIGP UL   a longtime producer of patties for fast food chains  as it ramps up to meet demand from consumers and restaurants including Burger King 
Burger King started offering the Impossible Whopper in April in 59 stores in and around St  Louis  and is expected to launch nationally  which would put the plant based Whopper on the menu in about 7 000 Burger Kings 
The partnership between the vegan burger maker and one of the biggest meat suppliers comes as young  environmentally conscious consumers are feasting on plant based patties and sausages 
 We got ourselves into a supply demand imbalance in which we frankly just did not anticipate the level of demand that came from consumers    Sheetal Shah  Impossible Foods  senior vice president of product and operations  said 
Shares of rival vegan burger company  Beyond Meat Inc   O BYND  are up over 700  percent since it went public in May  Beyond Meat earlier this week forecast its revenue would rise over 170  in 2019 
Privately held OSI  based in Aurora  Illinois  has been supplying McDonald s Corp  N MCD  for about six decades and has 65 facilities in 17 countries 
Shah said California based Impossible Foods and OSI will both be investing in OSI facilities to produce the plant based burger patties and that multiple facilities in the Chicago area will start supplying Burger King and eventually other customers as well  The investment details were not disclosed 
When asked if Impossible would be serving McDonald s too  Shah declined to comment on customers  but said   I see no reason why we shouldn t be able to go anywhere and everywhere  
When it comes to plant based meat substitutes   Its time and place is right now   Kevin Scott  senior executive vice president for OSI North America  told Reuters   The work that s been done in the sector on our behalf and other manufacturers and companies like Impossible Foods are really narrowing that gap to a point of overall consumer acceptance  
Just three months after its IPO  Beyond Meat this week said it was raising more funds in a stock offering to expand its manufacturing facilities  which are also stretched by booming demand

195606,417122,MCD,5 Monster Stocks To Watch For The Week Of January 6,opinion,"S P 500  SPY 
The S P 500 finished the week in less overbought territory with an RSI of 66  It still will need to fall further to set up the S P 500 for higher levels  Based on the current trends in the RSI  I m looking for it to fall to around 60  that would ensure that the longer term direction of the RSI remains higher  while giving the index a chance to cool off  It means that any declines in the index will likely not last much longer 






Meanwhile  the trend in the VIX continues to be lower  which also suggests that the longer term trend for the S P 500 at this point is still higher






We can continue to watch the headlines about the pending doom and gloom  or we can focus on what the market is telling us  and at least in my viewpoint  the trends we have been watching remain constant  suggesting higher prices for stocks still lie ahead 
Roku  ROKU  
Last week I had thought  Roku   NASDAQ ROKU  would surge higher  that was the wrong call  It does seem as if the general trend in Roku is lower  and the RSI confirms that view  However  there is an interesting pattern that appears to be forming called a falling wedge  and it could suggest that long term the stock is setting up for a push higher  just not yet 






Splunk  SPLK  
Splunk  NASDAQ SPLK  has been consolidating for some time in this  140 to  150 region  A bullish pattern known as a rising triangle has formed  and it suggests the stock works higher  with  160 next on the radar

The plant based food company said its new version of its flagship vegan burgers would hit U S  shelves this week  as it seeks to keep up the pace with privately held Impossible Foods  which also rolled out an improved version of its own burger patty in January 
But the outlook on Beyond Meat  NASDAQ BYND  has been soured by a downgrade from JPMorgan to neutral from overweight  sending its share price down 21 7

Beyond Meat had surged 645 7  between its  25 a share IPO in May to its Monday high of  186 43  That prompted the bank to warn that the stock s current valuation is difficult to justify

195648,417164,MCD,Bull Of The Day  Shake Shack  SHAK ,opinion,"Have you had a burger from Shake Shack  NYSE SHAK   
If you haven t and there s an outlet near you  do yourself a favor and try it out  If you re not lucky enough to have a Shake Shack in your town  don t worry it probably won t be too long until you do 
Founded in 2001 by master restaurateur Danny Meyer  Shake Shack has grown organically from a single cart in Madison Square  NYSE SQ  Park in New York city to a global operator of more than 250 fast casual restaurant outlets across the US   as well as in the UK  Russia  China  Singapore  Mexico  the Middle East an too many more to list 
The company plans to have over 320 locations open globally by 2020 
Meyer got his start as a New York City restaurant manager  then studied culinary arts in Europe before opening his own Manhattan restaurant in 1985 at the age of 27 
The author of several books about restaurants  Meyer is legendary for his intense focus on true hospitality and customer service  His restaurant empire is the envy of the industry and his methods and philosophy are emulated by would be restaurateur the world over 
Shake Shack was originally intended to be a single location summertime novelty rather than a chain  but long lines and soaring popularity convinced Meyer and his partners that there was significant opportunity for expansion  In 2004  even they couldn t have imagined just how successful the venture would grow to be 
Shares of Shake Shack more than doubled on the first day of trading following its 2015 IPO  rallying from  21 share all the way to  47 share   and continued to run all the way to  93 share within the first 4 months  Unfortunately  that rocket ride seems to have been fueled more by enthusiasm for the company s products than the fundamentals of its business and the shares fell back into the  30s where they stayed for most of the next two years 
By 2018  with over 100 locations open and the revenues to match the original promise  Shake Shack shares began to rally steadily again with the stock once again hitting new highs above  100 share in 2019 
Take a look at these revenues 
The restaurant industry is fiercely competitive and consistently growing sales at 25  year is almost unheard of  The average Shake Shack outlet brings in between  3M and  4M year   considerably above the  2 7M average of a McDonalds  restaurant 
The company has been spending heavily on expansion  so net earnings aren t increasing quite as quickly as revenues  but the estimates are rising fast enough to earn Shake Shack a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Management and cost control are top notch  so expect Shake Shack earnings to catch up quickly as outlets in all of the intended markets become built out 
A simple menu  loyal customers  great service and a rabid fan base make Shake Shack an enormously popular dining choice  Sensational revenue growth makes it a very solid investment in the sometimes dicey restaurant space

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  0 49   A quarter ago  it was expected that this world s biggest hamburger chain would post earnings of  1 73 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 72  delivering a surprise of  0 58  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
McDonald s  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Restaurants industry  posted revenues of  5 34 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 12   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 35 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
McDonald s shares have added about 20 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 8  
What s Next for McDonald s 
While McDonald s has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for McDonald s was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

195706,417222,MCD,Gold Pennant  Will It Supersize The Rally ,opinion,"At McDonald s  NYSE MCD  restaurant  customers can  supersize  their food orders  Can gold supersize its awesome 2019 price action 

The technical action on this gold chart is spectacular 
Gold has formed a massive pennant formation  There s no guarantee that it plays out  but if it does the technical target is in the  1560 area 
A  1560 gold price would turn most gold producers into gargantuan cash cows  and the near vertical rally already in play in silver would likely become a textbook barn burner 

A pattern like a double bottom is now in play on the weekly Silver chart 
This pattern suggests the silver rally is just getting started and a breakout over the neckline would target the  18 50 area 
The Western fear trade for gold is now the  price driver in play  for all the precious metals upside action  but the love trade is also providing solid and consistent support for the market 
Interestingly  the Indian government tariff taxes of 12 5  have effectively revalued the price of the vast hoards of gold held by Indian citizens by 12 5  
In America  real interest rates continue to decline as the business cycle peaks  Any uptick in inflation could create an institutional  feeding frenzy  in gold stocks and silver stocks 

Many bond market analysts believe that rate cuts from the Fed could accelerate the issuance of negative rate bonds  dramatically 

Some gold analysts worry about the  large  commercial short position in gold on the COMEX  but I predicted years ago that when gold broke out of the bull continuation pattern  the commercial short position could rise to millions of contracts  with the price still going higher 
That s because there are so many institutional money managers getting involved with gold now  The bottom line  Cash pays nothing and has no upside  and a surge in inflation would destroy the bond market and potentially topple the US government 
In this environment  institutional stock market investors are embracing gold and gold stocks  They are beginning to embrace silver too  Because silver is such a small market  even modest institutional buying is producing vertical price action 
Another positive aspect to the arrival of institutional investors in gold  silver  and the miners may be of interest to conspiracy buffs who believe in price manipulation 
I say that because institutional investors have in house investigators who monitor the market action  They are quick to alert regulators when market trades don t make sense 
Whether serious gold price manipulation existed in the past is probably unknowable  but there s no question that the current market feels  cleaner  and more stable than it did when hedge funds dominated the market 
The SPDR fund  NYSE GLD  is now at 825 tons  and the SLV silver fund is now at 11 070 tons  Institutions are buying steadily 
What happens if the Fed disappoints at next week s key meeting  What happens if there s no rate cut  Well  since 2014 I ve talked about all Fed actions being positive for gold 
Gold rallied on QT and rate hikes and the stock market tanked because of the safe haven bid  Gold also rallied on the recent Fed pause  much more than the stock market did 
The bottom line  If the Fed doesn t cut rates at next week s key meeting the stock market will crash and gold will cash a huge safe haven bid  Everything the Fed does is now win win for gold 

This is the fabulous GDX chart  I coined the term  flagification  to describe a market so powerful that numerous bull flags appear in succession  That s happening with GDX and many gold miners now 

A look at the important weekly chart for GDX  If the bull flag on the daily chart plays out  GDX is going to my  30  32 target zone  and to  37  40 if the  supersize  bull pennant on the gold bullion chart activates 
The breakout above  26 on the weekly chart has turned the entire  23  26 area into a massive support zone  so any failure or churning in the flag pennant formations is little more than an annoying bearish fly that should soon be swatted away by a growing army of excited institutional buyers ",2019-07-24,Stewart Thomson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-pennant-will-it-supersize-the-rally-200443638,200443638

195723,417239,MCD,Shake Shack Rides On Global Forays  Rivals  Food For Thought ,opinion,In a classic example of following a rather unconventional path to fuel its growth engine  popular  roadside  burger brand Shake Shack Inc    NYSE SHAK   has chalked a global strategy of international expansion to better connect with its consumers worldwide  The company recently decided to open a new store in Mexico City  Mexico  to take its international footprint tally to 16   a remarkable achievement for a relatively young establishment that turns 15 this summer What makes this expansion strategy all the more unique is the fact that the company opened restaurants in London  Istanbul  Dubai and Moscow before it reached Los Angeles in 2016  Altogether  Shake Shack currently operates about 235 restaurants across the globe with annual revenues of  459 3 million in 2018 David vs  Goliath Despite significant international presence  Shake Shack appears to be lagging way behind its rivals in terms of number of operating restaurants  By the end of 2018  McDonald s Corporation   NYSE MCD   had nearly 38 000 restaurants worldwide  while Restaurant Brands International Inc  s   NYSE QSR   iconic brand Burger King operated nearly 18 000 restaurants  In 2018  McDonald s and Burger King recorded annual revenues of  21 025 million and  1 651 million  respectively However  in spite of the skewed up numbers  Shake Shack seems to be a force to reckon with  generating 27 3  year over year growth in estimated U S  system sales per 2019 Top 200 research  The company also remains poised to claim a position in the top 3 fast casual chain operators ranked by Latest Year growth in U S  systemwide sales   The Success Recipe  The penchant for international expansion appears to be the primary driving force that has helped Shake Shack to punch above its weight  Most U S  companies usually tend to strengthen their regional presence to gain key insights about customer behavior and consumption patterns before foraying into foreign shores with different culinary tastes and cultures  However  Shake Shack has chosen the offbeat path to success as a way of hedging   cashing in on the fact that if anything went wrong in foreign territories  it would hardly have any impact on local business The company uses local licensing companies to run stores in foreign locations  Although the core menu remains broadly similar  it tries to add a local twist without compromising on its brand image  Shake Shack mostly prefers to use American ingredients in international locations to remain true to its distinct taste  In situations where it fails to procure the raw materials from U S  suppliers due to supply constraints or trade tariffs  the company sources the items from local vendors  thus offering it an opportunity to engage more with the community  When a particular menu item with a local flavor becomes a huge hit  Shake Shack tries to introduce it in the U S  market to replicate the success story Being a relatively small firm  Shake Shack is quite nimble  and quickly adapts to the evolving market conditions and usually turns every possible disadvantage in its favor  Moreover  as the international operations are mostly licensed  it requires comparatively less capital than the bulk of the domestic business  The company also aims to tap the huge footfall in international airports to better connect with diverse customer base  This has further created significant customer interests and generated wide publicity through word of mouth and point of purchase display Reaping RewardsThe combination of all these factors seem to be working for Shake Shack as it braces for cut throat competition with respect to price  service  and healthier menu options  Total revenues for the company in the first quarter of 2019 improved 33 8  year over year to  132 6 million  The stock has recorded average return of 45 9  year to date compared with the   s rally of 20 8  The company is betting big on extending its international footprint and plans to open 16 to 18 licensed stores this year with an emphasis on expanding in China  Singapore  the Philippines and Mexico  CEO Randy Garutti perfectly summed up   So much of this story has been our global story  What we learned early on is that people don t want us to be a local version of Shake Shack  They want us to be Shake Shack  So that s what we do  Food for thought for the rivals This Could Be the Fastest Way to Grow Wealth in 2019Research indicates one sector is poised to deliver a crop of the best performing stocks

195779,417295,MCD,Analysts Estimate McDonald s  MCD  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects McDonald s  MCD  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s biggest hamburger chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 74 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 8  
Revenues are expected to be  4 95 billion  down 3 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 04  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McDonald s 
For McDonald s  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 94  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McDonald s will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that McDonald s would post earnings of  1 90 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 97  delivering a surprise of  3 68  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
McDonald s doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-mcdonalds-mcd-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200409463,200409463

195797,417313,MCD,South African business counts on Ramaphosa to plot path to growth,news,"By Tiisetso Motsoeneng
SOWETO  South Africa  Reuters    Ndumiso Madlala  head of the Soweto Gold Brewery  says he is banking on new South African President Cyril Ramaphosa to kick start the economy and help his business grow 
The micro brewery was founded five years ago in the Johannesburg township but has struggled to grow in a fiercely competitive market for beer as high unemployment and a weak economy strangled consumer spending 
Madlala places much of the blame on the administration of Jacob Zuma  who reluctantly resigned as president last week after a nine year tenure plagued by corruption allegations and economic stagnation 
 We started at the time when the economy was not doing so well   Madlala  a chemical engineer who previously worked at Heineken  told Reuters at his brewery where the walls are adorned with photographs of anti apartheid heroes 
 Now with Ramaphosa coming in  we really hope the economy is going to grow fast and with the economy growing fast  small businesses like ourselves can also grow at a much faster rate  
He did not give more specific details of his expectations for the new government  but said his goal of selling 1 million hectolitres of beer by 2020  from 50 000 hectolitres now  could be achieved sooner if Ramaphosa boosted consumer confidence 
Soweto Gold currently only distributes its products to South Africa s wealthiest province Gauteng  but plans to extend to five more provinces by the end of March before launching nationwide in August 
Madlala is one of many business leaders in South Africa  as well as investors at home and abroad  who are pinning hopes on Ramaphosa  a former businessman who held stakes in mining company Lonmin  L LON   mobile operator MTN Group  J MTNJ  and McDonald s  NYSE MCD  South African franchise 
Yet despite the early optimism of Madlala and others  some economists and analysts caution there may be no quick fix for an economy that is forecast to grow just 1 4 percent this year and 1 7 percent in 2019 
Africa s most developed economy needs faster economic growth to reduce the high joblessness rate   currently at 27 percent   and alleviate the widespread poverty that has persisted since the end of white minority rule in 1994 
 NEW COURSE 
Financial markets roared their approval when Ramaphosa of the ruling African National Congress  ANC  was sworn in last week  South Africa s main stock index surged as much as 5 percent  the rand  hit its strongest levels in three years while bond investors pushed the yields on the benchmark 2026 note sharply lower 
Banks  considered the barometer of South African political and economic sentiment  are among the best performing stocks on the bourse  up nearly 8 percent   far outpacing a largely flat blue chip JSE Top 40 index  JTOPI  as of Monday 
 President Ramaphosa has an opportunity to set out a new course and chart a clear vision for South Africa   said Mike Brown  chief executive of No 4 lender Nedbank  J NEDJ    We urge him to set out clear policy ambitions that will help unlock investor confidence and pent up economic activity long stymied by policy uncertainty  
Apart from the revitalizing the economy  business executives would like see more policy certainty   particularly in the mining industry  an important economic engine which has been fighting in court with Zuma s mines minister over an increase in black ownership targets 
Mining industry lobby group  the Chamber of Mines  agreed at the weekend to delay a court challenge  which was set to resume on Monday  against the regulations following an intervention by Ramaphosa 
Mining companies have said the new rules  which also stipulate they must pay 1 percent of their turnover to local communities  were deterring investment in a sector grappling with unpredictable commodity prices 
 I m very optimistic about the future of South African mining   said Peter Steenkamp  chief executive of Randfontein based gold miner Harmony Gold   It s early days but we know the leadership of the new elected ANC leadership is very familiar with mining  we ve got both  ANC chairman  Gwede Mantashe and Cyril Ramaphosa  ex mining people there  
Investors  business leaders and rating agencies are watching closely for how Ramaphosa is going to deal with corruption and clean up cash strapped state owned enterprises 
 There is no time to celebrate   said Bonang Mohale  chief executive of business lobby group Business Leadership South Africa   Our state owned enterprises  SOEs  are bankrupt  We need to address the leadership  capital structure and governance issues gripping these SOEs  
But for Madlala  the real test awaiting Ramaphosa is to raise the disposable income of consumers 
 We ve had doom and gloom for the past few years under the Zuma leadership and now with Ramaphosa coming in there s new energy and we certainly hope it will translate into people visiting restaurants and trying out our brand   he said ",2018-02-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/south-african-business-counts-on-ramaphosa-to-plot-path-to-growth-1278241,1278241
195798,417314,MCD,U S  labor agency overturns major ruling  citing Trump appointee s conflict,news,"By Daniel Wiessner
 Reuters    The National Labor Relations Board on Monday made it easier for companies that franchise their brands  such as McDonald s Corp  NYSE MCD   to be held liable for labor law violations 
The U S  board overturned its own recent decision limiting corporate liability on the grounds that one of its members  appointed by President Donald Trump  should not have taken part in the December ruling because he had a conflict of interest as the case involved his own former law firm 
Monday s decision means the law reverts to an Obama era precedent under which companies which franchise their brand names can be liable for workplace law violations that occur at independently owned businesses that merely rent the franchise 
The NLRB said William Emanuel  who joined the agency last year  should not have taken part in the December decision  which concerned Iowa construction company Hy Brand Industrial Contractors Ltd  because it overturned a 2015 ruling in a case involving his former law firm 
Monday s decision reinstates the 2015 ruling  concerning sanitation company Browning Ferris Industries Inc  which had been heavily criticized by business groups for expanding the definition of  joint employment  under federal labor law 
Under the previous ruling  franchisors may be considered joint employers and required to bargain with unions or be held accountable for franchisees  labor practices  Business groups have said that treating franchisors as employers could upend the franchise model 
Monday s ruling was a temporary hurdle for the board  which has overruled several decisions made during the administration of Trump s predecessor  Democrat Barack Obama 
Employers such as McDonald s have tried to limit their legal liability for employment related rulings involving franchisees  The restaurant operator is in talks to settle a major NLRB case claiming it is a joint employer of franchise workers nationwide 
In the December decision involving Iowa construction company Hy Brand Industrial Contractors Ltd  the NLRB ruled 3 2 that companies are joint employers of contractors  workers only when they have direct control over working conditions 
The earlier Browning Ferris ruling  in contrast  said companies need only to exercise indirect control to be considered joint employers 
Emanuel s former law firm Littler Mendel son  one of the world s largest law firms specializing in labor law  represented a staffing company involved in the Browning Ferris case 
In a Feb  9 memo  the NLRB inspector general said that by taking part in the Hy Brand decision  Emanuel may have violated an executive order prohibiting presidential appointees from handling matters involving former employers or clients for two years after taking office 
Its move also comes after some Democrats in Congress  including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren  raised concerns about Emanuel s involvement 
Trey Kovacs  a labor policy expert with the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute  said Monday s development underscored the need for Congress to narrow the definition of joint employment under federal law 
 Without a permanent legislative fix  the overly broad and vague Obama era Browning Ferris joint employer standard is once again a threat to entrepreneurs and workers nationwide   Kovacs said ",2018-02-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/us-labor-board-overturns-major-ruling-citing-trump-appointees-conflict-1312610,1312610

195827,417343,MCD,McDonald s Dollar Menu Replacement Fuels Industry Price War,news," Bloomberg     The fast food price war is about to get even more intense 
McDonald s Corp    NYSE MCD  the world s largest restaurant chain  unveiled its new value priced menu on Monday  aiming to keep its lead in an industry that s increasingly racing for the bottom  The lineup  set to go live on Jan  4  includes items such as chicken tenders  Happy Meals  sodas  triple cheeseburgers and the Egg McMuffin 
With visits to U S  fast food restaurants seen remaining flat next year  the major chains are jockeying for position and announcing discounts to keep diners  attention  Taco Bell  the Mexican themed chain owned by Yum Brands Inc   is responding with what it calls its  biggest value push in company history  
The new offering at McDonald s  which will run alongside the regular menu at restaurants  is a balancing act for the Golden Arches  If items are priced too high  customers feel like they re getting ripped off and head to competitors  But if the prices are too low  McDonald s own franchisees will do the grousing 
That was the case with the company s Dollar Menu  which was phased out in 2013  McDonald s operators thought it weighed too heavily on profit margins  but the menu was popular with customers  And its absence was felt  The demise of the Dollar Menu was seen as a contributor to a sales slump that lasted two years 
This time around  McDonald s thinks it has a formula that can keep franchisees happy  More than 90 percent of restaurant owners have signed up to participate in the program  according to Chris Kempczinski  who runs the company s U S operations 
 You have to make sure it s something we can sustain   he said in an interview 
Andy Barish  an analyst at Jefferies  upgraded the stock to  buy  on Tuesday and raised his price target to  200  in part because the new value menu will help the chain continue to gain customers 
McDonald s shares climbed as much as 2 percent to  174 in New York Tuesday  in the biggest intraday gain in more than two months  The stock had already climbed 40 percent this year through Monday 
Bolstering Comeback
McDonald s announced in October that it was planning the menu  though it didn t give details until Monday  The idea is to shore up a comeback built on the success of all day breakfast and more targeted discounts like McPick 2 for  5 
When the new menu hits next month  customers will be able to get a handful of options for  1   2 or  3  The cheapest items include sodas  McChicken sandwiches  a sausage burrito and cheeseburgers  The sausage McMuffin with egg is on the menu for  3  alongside a new chicken sandwich  And the company s buttermilk chicken tenders  which sold out last month after a brief run  are returning to the menu    with an order of two costing  2 
One popular item that s absent is french fries  Kempczinski said the company spent months trying to figure out the best way to construct the new menu and ultimately decided it was compelling without fries 
 We didn t need fries to make it attractive   he said 
Taco Bell  meanwhile  is seeking to remain in the mix as McDonald s and its burger rivals at Wendy s and Burger King increasingly look for ways to appeal to the core fast food customers looking for discounted fare 
Shares of owner Yum were little changed Monday at  83 32 
Taco Bell is reminding customers that it has a  1 menu with 20 items  and this lineup will be boosted by 20 more limited time offerings in 2018  The menu will include nacho French fries and a new  stacker  quesadilla    beef and cheese in a folded flour tortilla 
 I think a lot of places begrudgingly try to figure out what food to serve at these price points   Brian Niccol  the chain s chief executive officer  said in an interview   We choose to lean into it

195831,417347,MCD,McDonald s  MCD  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when McDonald s  MCD  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world s biggest hamburger chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 89 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 5  
Revenues are expected to be  5 16 billion  down 3 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 02  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McDonald s 
For McDonald s  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 73  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McDonald s will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that McDonald s would post earnings of  1 98 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 10  delivering a surprise of  6 06  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
McDonald s doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mcdonalds-mcd-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200378438,200378438

195843,417359,MCD,Can High Expenses Affect Dave   Buster s  PLAY  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Dave   Buster s Entertainment  Inc    NASDAQ PLAY   is scheduled to report third quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 11  after the closing bell The company continues to bank on a unique business model that provides guests with customizable experience across four platforms   Eat  Drink  Play and Watch   Apart from great food or beverages  the entertainment business of Dave   Buster s has been driving growth and is expected to have driven revenues in the fiscal third quarter However  a non franchised business model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses  which are likely to have hurt its bottom line in the to be reported quarter Nonetheless  backed by a distinctive business strategy  shares of Dave   Buster have gained 27 3  over the past six months  outperforming the  s collective growth of 12 1  Let us look deeper into factors that are likely to have shaped up the company s fiscal third quarter Top Line Looks StrongThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dave   Buster s sales in the fiscal third quarter is pegged at  274 2 million  suggesting 9 7  growth from the year ago quarter  In the first six months of fiscal 2018  the company s revenues increased 11 4  year over year  We expect the trend to have continued in the fiscal third quarter as well The company s top line growth strategy is to have a solid entertainment business that cushions it from the fluctuating business in the restaurant industry  Notably  amusement and other revenues accounted for 59 2  of total revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and grew 16 6  year over year  We believe the segment to have performed well in the fiscal third quarter as well Another top line initiative by Dave   Buster s includes menu innovation  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  Dave   Buster s appointed new vice president of Food and Beverage development in order to improve the speed of service through menu redesign and positive simplification in the kitchen area  In February  the company streamlined its menu and reduced the number of food orders by about 20   and beverage offerings by 12  to achieve increased efficiency Meanwhile  Dave   Buster s continues to pursue a disciplined new store growth strategy in both new and existing markets  Management believes that it can grow the concept to more than 200 units in North America over time  In the second quarter of fiscal 2018  the company opened five stores  In fiscal 2018  it anticipates opening 14 15 stores   including two latest 17 K format stores  a combination of eight stores in new markets for D B and the remaining located in markets where the brand is already established  With these store openings  it intends to achieve 13 14  annual unit growth rate Earnings to Reflect Cost PressuresAlthough a higher margin business model is supposed to boost Dave   Buster s earnings  high costs of operations remain a drag  Apart from increased labor costs  Dave   Buster s is seeing high costs from sales building initiatives and other operations In the first six months of 2018  total operating costs increased 13 6  year over year and the trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal third quarter  We believe that these high expenses will  in turn  hurt the company s fiscal third quarter earnings  More so because the consensus estimate pegs the quarter s earnings at 22 cents  suggesting a 24 1  decline from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 What Does the Zacks Model Unveil Our proven model does not show that Dave   Buster s is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Dave   Buster s has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   Although the company s Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise  You can see  Peer ReleasesMcDonald s   NYSE MCD   reported impressive third quarter 2018 results  wherein earnings per share of  2 10 surpassed the consensus mark of  1 98 by 6 1  and increased 19  from the year ago quarter Domino s   NYSE DPZ   reported mixed quarterly numbers for third quarter 2018  wherein earnings  1 95 per

63 cents per share missed the consensus mark by a couple of cents  However  the reported figure increased 8 6  from the year ago quarter Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to

estimates while earnings exceeded the same Adjusted earnings of 17 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents by 13 3   The bottom line also increased a whopping 88 9  year over year

million lagged the consensus mark of  406 4 million by 1 4   However  the top line improved 30  from the year ago quarter  driven by increased sales at the company operated restaurants  Sales were

195871,417387,MCD,MCD Stock Is A Bull Trap At New All Time Highs,opinion,"Less than two months ago  on September 19th  the stock price of the biggest fast food chain in the world was hovering below  158 a share  MCD stock had spent most of 2018 moving sideways without making any meaningful progress  The good news was that in the meantime it had formed a textbook triangle correction  which according to the Elliott Wave Principle is a continuation pattern 
In other words  the uptrend which has been in progress prior to the triangle  was supposed to resume and lift McDonald s  NYSE MCD  stock to a new all time high soon  With that in mind we shared the chart below with you  The hourly chart of MCD stock gave us a closer look at five sub waves of the triangle pattern in question  It also allowed us to identify the bottom of wave  c  at  153 15 as the invalidation level for this count  As long as the stock traded above it  the bullish outlook was going to remain valid and targets above  180 were still plausible 
MCD Stock Looks Vulnerable above  180
In the weeks following this prediction  McDonald s hiked its quarterly dividend by 15   received buy recommendations at Guggenheim and Evercore  and beat both earnings and revenue estimates in its Q3 report  None of these developments could have been predicted in advance  Still  the Wave principle managed to put traders ahead of them all   The habit of the market is to anticipate  not to follow   Did Ralph N  Elliott know this was still going to hold true in 2018  when he said it in the 1930s  Maybe  All we know is that the stage was set for a rally in MCD stock on September 19th  All the positive news that came out shortly after was not the cause of anything  It served merely as the catalyst the market needed in order to do what it had in mind anyway  And most importantly  the bears never had a chance to threaten  153 15 
MCD stock rose to a new all time high of  181 08 yesterday  That is less than  2 40 a share above the previous record  but it is enough for breakout traders to start bracing for more big gains going forward  Unfortunately  we do not share their optimism  Triangles precede the final wave of the larger sequence  Here  the final wave is 5 and it is already in progress  According to the big picture outlook  we can expect a notable bearish reversal back to  150    140 as soon as wave 5 is over 
Picking a top is never a good idea  MCD stock is probably going to reach higher levels in the short term  Nevertheless  we think it is no longer worth the risk

195896,417412,MCD,McDonald faces tough task to look good in M S fashion,news,By James Davey LONDON  Reuters    Jill McDonald picks up something of a poisoned chalice when she starts as boss of clothing at Marks   Spencer  L MKS  on Monday  with little room to maneuver as she tackles one of the biggest jobs in British retailing on her first foray into fashion  McDonald s retail credentials are strong  but they were earned as CEO of bicycles to car parts company Halfords  L HFD  and she will have to work within a blueprint set out by her new boss as she looks to deliver the sustained sales and profit growth that has eluded M S for a decade in competition with a burgeoning fast fashion market  She will have to operate within the confines of the detailed strategy already set out by Chief Executive Steve Rowe  an M S lifer  She must also work under the chairmanship of Archie Norman  who joined M S this month and is known for turning around some of Britain s biggest companies  To compound matters  Rowe and predecessor Marc Bolland have already used sourcing directors Mark and Neal Lindsey to boost profit margins by changing the way M S buys and makes clothes  taking away any easy gains for a new boss   If you re not given free rein to implement the strategy that you want  you ve got one hand tied behind your back   said a former M S director speaking on condition of anonymity  In its 1990s heyday M S was the go to British high street destination for clothes  selling everything from party dresses to suits and underwear  In 1997 it became the first UK retailer to post profit of 1 billion pounds   1 3 billion   But while the 133 year old group remains the Britain s largest clothing retailer in sales terms  it has been squeezed by the likes of Inditex s  MC ITX  Zara  H M  ST HMb  and Primark  owned by Associated British Foods  L ABF   Profit was 614 million pounds in 2016 17  RADICAL RETHINK  Rowe s strategy is focused on reduced prices for entry level ranges  cutting back on clearance sales and promotions while improving service  He also has a five year program to close some stores and restructure others to reflect faster growing online sales  Some analysts have questioned whether Rowe s plans are sufficiently radical  but he told shareholders in July that he was convinced it is the right strategy  That makes it hard for McDonald   Is she just coming in to execute that plan    the former director said   Let s say she wants to do something really quite radical that s going to have a major impact on the bottom line  Rowe might say   you can t do that to me  I m 18 months in     I ve given guidance to the City    McDonald will have overall profit and loss accountability for all aspects of M S non food business  from design and sourcing through to the supply chain and logistics  She will work alongside Jo Jenkins  clothing and beauty director  and Queralt Ferrer  director of design   Richard Marwood  senior fund manager at M S investor Royal London Asset Management  said McDonald could be under pressure to cut margins or increase prices after the Brexit related slump in sterling  which is also weighing on consumer spending   The challenge of boosting growth in M S s clothing business will be no mean feat   he said  Rowe maintains that the naysayers miss the point  He has highlighted McDonald s  fantastic customer insight  and a bank of operational  retail and leadership experience developed at Halfords and fast food giant McDonald s  N MCD   COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS  Whether you re buying bikes and bike pieces or dresses and dress pieces  there s the same type of negotiation needed  the same level of detail needed in terms of sourcing and profit margins and relationships with suppliers   said one person with knowledge of the appointment process  M S insiders also point to McDonald s all encompassing job title of managing director  a subtle difference from previous incumbents  title of director of clothing and home  The suggestion is that the change means her role could include wider issues  such as the online service proposition that has lagged behind those of rivals  McDonald will  however  have to deal with a complex set of director relationships  Reporting to McDonald will be Jenkins  who has more than 25 years of fashion experience  She was passed over by Rowe for the top clothing job but may have to teach McDonald the clothing ropes   Meanwhile  Chief Financial Officer Helen Weir will lose responsibilities for clothing  home and beauty supply chain and logistics  which she has handled since last year  There is also a danger that McDonald could be caught between Rowe and new chairman Norman  whose previous turnaround exploits include supermarket chain Asda and broadcaster  ITV   LON ITV  and who won t shy away from tough decisions   Archie s pretty hands on  asking questions and probing strategy  That can be quite a distraction   said the former M S director  McDonald has given away little so far   Whatever business I ve worked in  the number one lesson    and I ll take it forward to M S    is you have to stay as close as possible to your customers   she told reporters   It s amazing how easy it is to slip off that path  ,2017-09-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mcdonald-faces-tough-task-to-look-good-in-mamps-fashion-534130,534130

Merck Options Traders Bet on a Round Number Breakout
Over the past eight quarters  Merck stock has averaged a single session post earnings move of 2   though this time around  the options market is pricing in a slightly higher 4  swing  It s been a flip of the coin as to whether the earnings reactions have been positive or negative  but the two most recent quarters have resulted in moves to the downside 
The stock has been racing higher since bottoming at a two year low of  52 83 earlier this month    thanks to optimism surrounding the company s     and was last seen up 13  at  59 63  However  this rally recently stalled out near the  60  61 region  which coincides with a 61 8  Fibonacci retracement of the stock s late October sell off  its 320 day moving average  and a short term floor in January 

Options traders don t seem too worried about the overhead resistance  though  The May 60 call has seen the biggest rise in open interest over the past 10 days with 6 527 added  and data from the major options exchanges confirms mostly buy to open activity here  The last time Merck stock closed north of the round  60 mark on a weekly basis was Jan  26

PFE is also headed for a big monthly win  up 3 8  so far in April to trade at  36 89  However  this rally really started in late March  when the security took a sharp bounce off its 320 day moving average    a trendline that also contained Pfizer s pullback from its 15 year high of  39 43 from Jan  29  The shares are now facing off with the  37 00  37 40 region  though  which marked tops in December and February 

This level has caught the eye of options traders  too  with the June 37 call home to peak open interest of 38 101 contracts  The May 37 call is not far behind with 35 401 contracts outstanding  and data from Trade Alert points to notable sell to open activity here back in mid April when PFE stock was trading near  36 30 ",2018-05-01,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-dow-stocks-to-watch-tomorrow-200311055,200311055

McDonald s shares got a boost today as investors reacted positively to the fast food giant s latest earnings report  The company posted a beat  with earnings of  1 79 per share  adjusted  vs   1 67 per share expected by analysts and revenue of  5 14 billion vs   4 98 billion expected  Same store visits increased almost 3   The company said net income rose to  1 38 billion  or  1 72 per share  up from  1 21 billion  or  1 47 per share  a year earlier 
A positive point from the latest earnings report is that gains were made via more expensive products on the McDonald s menu rather than the steeply discounted items featured by the chain over the past few years  But  those discounted items on the  dollar menu  did support gains as well  as customers purchased more of the less expensive items 
Analysts also note that McDonald s efforts to move beyond brick and mortar stores are paying off  as delivery with UberEats and mobile ordering programs are growing 
The company is also renovating stores to keep them  fresh  and is investing heavily in this area to make sure that customers receive a new experience when they visit the restaurants

195940,417456,MCD,McDonald s  MCD  Stock Surrenders Morning Gains On Hepatitis A Scare,opinion,"Shares of McDonald s   NYSE MCD   were up more than 1 1  in morning trading Thursday  but the stock surrendered its daily gains after reports surfaced that health officials were investigating a restaurant for possible hepatitis A exposure 
The case involves an employee who was infected with hepatitis A while working at a McDonald s location in Madison County  Kentucky  Local CBS affiliate WKYT  that the county s health department is investigating the matter and suggests people who ate at the location on Mar 23 be on the lookout for symptoms 
Hepatitis A is characterized by symptoms of fever  fatigue  loss of appetite  nausea  vomiting  abdominal pain  dark urine  clay colored stools  join pain  and jaundice  The infection can be prevented with a vaccination 
The Madison County Health Department said that McDonald s has fully cooperated with its investigation  according to WKYT  The restaurant reportedly scored a 100 on its most recent health score 
Following reports of the hepatitis A scare  McDonald s quickly surged to become the top trending ticket on popular investing forum StockTwits  Investors appear concerned that food safety troubles could hurt the brand just as they did to Chipotle  CMG  over the past few years 
However  this particular case appears to be an isolated incident  whereas Chipotle s headache was linked to foodborne illness outbreaks at a number of its restaurants 
McDonald s shares have gained nearly 25  over the past year  but the stock has dropped more than 8  from its late January highs as analyst sentiment toward the company has cooled  Within the past 60 days  McDonald s has witnessed six revisions to its full year earnings estimates  with 100  agreement to the downside 
This negative revision activity has earned MCD a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Nevertheless  cost cutting initiatives appear to be paying off  and despite the company s worsening outlook  it is still expected to witness EPS growth of nearly 14  in 2018

Commentary Another proclamation on monetary policy from the Federal Reserve is   Hanging in the balance is the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   as it precariously clings to support at its 50 day moving average  DMA   The NASDAQ and the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  are barely clinging to the bottom of their respective uptrend channels defined by their upper Bollinger Bands  BBs  


The S P 500  SPY  limps into the coming trading week after just barely avoiding a 5th day in a row of selling that closed the index on top of its 50DMA support for the 3rd day in a row 


The NASDAQ started last week at a new all time high and slid into Friday barely clinging to its short term primary uptrend 


Like the NASDAQ  the PowerShares QQQ ETF  QQQ   spent most of the previous week cooling off from the last all time high and barely clinging to the bottom of its upper Bollinger Band channel 
With the iShares Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM  gaining 0 5  on Friday  my favorite technical indicator  AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  reversed most of its loss for the week  At 49   AT40 is just under the 50 5  it achieved when the NASDAQ and QQQ made new all time highs  and the S P 500 broke out convincingly above its 50DMA resistance  At that time  I thought the stock market had returned to its  originally scheduled programming   Instead  the channel switched right away 
Surprisingly  the volatility index  the VIX  is not reflecting an increase in anxiety even though the major indices performed poorly through most of the week  The 15 35 pivot acted as a powerful gravitational force  If the Federal Reserve works its calming magic this week  the VIX should even plunge below the pivot  I will be looking to add to my latest volatility fade on any increase in the VIX going into the Fed meeting 


Something about that 15 35 pivot  The volatility index  the VIX  could not achieve escape velocity from the pivot even as sellers dominated the trading action for the week 
I kept my short term trading call at bullish given the S P 500 is clinging to 50DMA support and AT40 ended the week on a strong note  However  the Australian dollar  NYSE FXA  and the Japanese yen  NYSE FXY  continue to distract my confidence  I covered my short position on AUD JPY into Friday s selling  as well as a short on AUD USD   At the time of writing  I re established my short position as the currency pair continued its decline right to the edge of support formed by the April  2017 intraday low  I assume a breakdown below this level has bearish implications for financial markets in general 
The Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen is challenging a major support level  AUD JPY continues to flag warning signs for financial markets 

CHART REVIEWS
Logitech  NASDAQ LOGI  LOGI is one of those stocks I never should have sold  Last year  LOGI briefly made a new all time high that beat out the former all time high set in 2007  The stock finally made a new all time high after its January earnings report  That gap up closed with the February sell off  I wish I noticed the pullback then  I DID take note of the latest pullback that has found support the entire month of March at a steeply rising 50DMA  I bought shares on Friday and plan to accumulate down to 200DMA support if the market offers up the discount 

Logitech  LOGI  formed a triangle with its post earnings pullback and solid support at its rising 50DMA  A breakout above  41 50  the previous peak  would be very bullish 

McDonalds Corp  NYSE MCD  MCD was an example of a call gone right and a trade gone wrong  Two weeks ago  I sat astounded at the plunge in MCD and was eager to load up the truck with the stock  I wanted to stay patient  but the very next day the stock ran up on strong buying volume  Despite the strong showing  I anticipated a slow and churning recovery  So I bought a calendar spread at the  155 strike with the short side expiring March 16th and the long side expiring on April 20th  I targeted  155 as the top of the gap down  I figured MCD would be lucky to close the gap in two weeks  Investors had other ideas  MCD simply kept marching higher every single day until on Friday it reached 200DMA resistance  It was an incredible leap  I decided to close out the entire position at a small loss  I basically got too cute with my bullishness on the stock 

After suffering a beating for almost a month  MCD regained its strength in a big way  In two weeks  the stock gained 9 5  nearly straight up

195966,417482,MCD,Bearish Momentum Accelerates For McDonalds,opinion,"Regular readers will be familiar with my analysis of the last few weeks for McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD   which was already showing signs of increasingly bearish sentiment  Indeed my most recent post two weeks ago was entitled Ronald McDonald is not a happy clown which really summed up the mood for the stock 
Friday s price action drove the nail firmly home on the daily chart  with the stock opening almost  8 lower and gapped down at the market open  where it remained for the session  finally closing at  148 27 on ultra high volume  The trigger for the sudden move lower was weaker than expected results  taking thre price rapidly through the support region at  155 

The weekly chart reflects the very negative picture for this stock  but note the wide spread down candle is also associated with a volatility signal  and therefore it s possible we may see a short term recovery  Volume on this candle is ultra high and confirming last week s heavy selling  So with deep resistance now overhead  coupled with the volume point of control at  155 22  and a low volume node below  the longer term outlook continues to remain very bearish 
This is further confirmed with the transition of the trend monitor from blue to red  In the longer term this stock may extend the bearish trend further towards the  130 price area  where a potentially well developed support platform awaits  which may then provide some temporary respite ",2018-03-04,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bearish-momentum-accelerates-for-mcdonalds-200295742,200295742

195974,417490,MCD,Ronald McDonald Not A Happy Clown ,opinion,"The daily chart for McDonald s  NYSE MCD  certainly makes for some interesting reading at present  not least because unlike many other blue chip stocks  this stock has failed to follow through on the recovery in the Dow Jones and sister markets  and instead has continued lower following the after shocks of recent volatility  And of particular interest here is the volume associated with price action  which reveals some interesting anomalies 
If we start with the initial move lower on the 30th January  the volume here is as expected with heavy selling on the wide spread down candle with the stock moving  6 on the day  The following three days then sees the price move lower  before the extreme volatility of the 5th February arrives with the strong recovery later in the day generating the extreme wick to the lower body of the candle  However  note the volume  which is well below what we would expect to see  and indeed is lower than that of the 30th January  so sending a strong signal that unlike other stocks which saw sustained buying in the intraday recovery  for McDonald s this was not the case  with the volume only high  and not extreme  So two signals here  First a clear anomaly with  low volume  given the extreme price action  and second signaling a lack of buying  And it is the latter that is now reflected in the move lower  and despite attempts to rally higher over two consecutive days this was on falling volume  so confirming a lack of buying interest for McDonald s at present 
Friday s price action confirmed this bearish sentiment with volume rising in line with the relatively wide spread down candle  with Tuesday s weak price action on the gapped down open adding further downwards pressure  The support region at  155 is now coming into play  but if this is breached expect the current bearish picture to develop further in the medium term  This weak technical picture continued in yesterday s trading session  with McDonald s attempting to rally  but closing well off the highs with a deep wick to the upper body of the candle  And note the volume on the candle  it is high  and signaling further weakness ahead with the trend monitor indicator also remaining resolutely red ",2018-02-21,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ronald-mcdonald-not-a-happy-clown-200292803,200292803

Food and beverage  life sciences and financial services firms were most likely to consider relocating whilst aerospace firms were the least likely  the survey by law firm Gowling WLG said 
Nearly all the 533 companies surveyed said they would require some third party support to deal with the transition as Britain leaves the European Union  potentially risking part of the close transatlantic relationship between the two nations 
 The strong UK U S  trade relationship that has been carefully nurtured over the past fifty years is in serious jeopardy   said Bernardine Adkins  the firm s Head of EU  Trade and Competition 
 Concerns that Brexit will have an effect on current investment decisions mean this needs addressing now  not later   she said 
But U S  fast food chain McDonald s  N MCD  said last week that it would move its international tax base to Britain from Luxembourg after coming under increased scrutiny from European Union regulators over its tax arrangements in the small country 
President elect Donald Trump has also hailed Brexit and said that Britain would not be  back of the queue  for a bilateral trade deal with the United States  opposing comments made by President Obama ahead of the referendum 
British ministers have been meeting top executives from a range of key sectors in recent months as they prepare for formal divorce talks which are due to begin by the end of March 
One of the thorniest issues will be how to restrict freedom of movement in order to bring down immigration  a key concern for many Brexit voters  whilst retaining unfettered access to the single market  fundamental to many businesses 
A third of U S  business leaders whose firms export to the EU said that two years of regulatory uncertainty as divorce talks unfold could harm them and just over half said they might bypass Britain to do business directly with the European Union

196037,417553,MCD,Why McDonald s  MCD  Stock Keeps Climbing Higher,opinion,"Shares of McDonald s Corporation   NYSE MCD   gained more than 1 6  in morning trading Tuesday after analysts from Jeffries upgraded the stock  Today s gains were enough to send McDonald s to a new all time high  although the company owes its current peak to a year long rally fueled by optimism surrounding its new age initiatives 
 We find the combination of digital  remodels and delivery  with UberEats  will make a  3 percent U S  same store sales result very visible with potential upside depending on how quickly initiatives gain traction   wrote Jefferies analyst Andy Barish 
Barish s firm upgraded MCD to a  Buy  rating and set a price target of  200 for the stock  This bullish call represents a 17 2  upside from Monday s closing price and is the currently the highest analyst price target for McDonald s 
Jeffries is right to credit McDonald s for its digital and delivery related innovation  These new efforts have been a catalyst for the company s current rally  which has witnessed its stock climb by a staggering 45  over the past year McDonald s Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Barish estimates that McDonald s will feature delivery services at 5 000 restaurants by the end of the year  In 2018  the analysts expects an additional 2 000 stores will add delivery  with the company eventually reaching a total of 10 000 locations with delivery options by the end of 2019 
And what some investors might underestimate is the fast food behemoth s unique ability to execute its strategies on an international level  As Barish highlights in his recent note  McDonald s is already doing about  1 billion worth of delivery sales in the Middle East and Asia  About 75  of American citizens live within three miles of a McDonald s  so that vision should easily translate in the United States 
McDonald s is working exclusively with UberEats on its delivery mission  The food delivery wing of ride hailing giant Uber charges a  4 99 fee per order  plus a commission from McDonald s 
Barish estimates that delivery will contribute 0 5  to the company s same store sales this year  In 2018 and 2019  the analyst expects McDonald s to post 3  same store sales growth  thanks in large part to its delivery initiatives 
Our current consensus estimates are calling for McDonald s to report earnings of  6 94 per share and revenues of  20 39 billion in the upcoming fiscal year  Total sales are expected to slump about 10  from 2017 s projected total  but earnings per share figures are expected to expand by an additional 6 4

196104,417620,MCD,Shareholders press Yum for stricter antibiotics policy,news,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Yum Brands Inc investors on Tuesday filed a shareholder proposal requesting that it quickly phase out harmful antibiotic use in its meat supply  taking aim at the practices of the company s KFC fried chicken chain 
The proposal from shareholder activists As You Sow  of Oakland  California  and the Sisters of St  Francis of Philadelphia comes as KFC lags rivals McDonald s Corp  NYSE MCD   Chick fil A  Subway and Wendy s Co in setting policies to curb the routine use of antibiotics in chicken production 
Those policies are a first step for many fast food chains that are under pressure to help combat the rise of dangerous  superbugs   as antibiotic resistant bacteria are known 
Yum s Taco Bell chain has committed to stop using antibiotics important to human medicine in its chicken supply early next year and the company s Pizza Hut chain has made a similar promise for the chicken used in its pizza toppings  KFC  which buys far more chicken than its two sister brands  has not made a similar promise 
Some 70 percent of antibiotics vital for fighting infections in humans are sold for use in meat and dairy production 
Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal  However  as the number of human infections from antibiotic resistant bacteria increases  consumer advocates and public health experts have campaigned to end the routine use of antibiotics important to human medicine for growth promotion or illness prevention in farm animals that are not sick 
Advocates have targeted KFC because it has far more restaurants than any other fast food chicken chain and is second in sales behind Chick fil A  which has committed to finishing its switch to chicken raised without any antibiotics by the end of 2019 
McDonald s USA last week said it completed its move to chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine  Wendy s plans to make a similar switch by 2017 
KFC has said that by 2017  antibiotics important for human medicine will only be used to maintain chicken health and only under the supervision and prescription of a licensed veterinarian  As per federal government guidance  KFC does not allow the use of such antibiotics for growth promotion 
Critics say the stated policy at KFC effectively allows for routine use of antibiotics by its chicken suppliers 
 Yum Brands  silence in the face of this looming antibiotic resistance crisis is bad for business   said Austin Wilson  As You Sow s environmental health program manager 
As You Sow filed similar shareholder proposals at Wendy s and Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International Inc  but pulled them after the companies agreed to set stricter antibiotic policies by the end of 2016 ",2016-08-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/shareholders-press-yum-for-stricter-antibiotics-policy-419284,419284

Building off hawkish comments from her colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee over the last two weeks  Yellen said Friday afternoon that it could be appropriate for the Fed to implement an imminent rate hike if the economy and labor markets continue to show improvement  The FOMC has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a targeted range between 0 25 and 0 50  in each of their three meetings in 2016  after halting a seven year zero interest rate policy in December  Any rate hikes from the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for equities  as investors pile into safer investments such as government bonds in order to capitalize on higher yields

196131,417647,MCD,McDonald s Fights Forex  Cost Woes With Strategic Initiatives,opinion,On Aug 29  we issued an updated research report on burger giant  McDonald s Corp    NYSE MCD   This leading fast food chain currently operates over 37 000 restaurants in more than 100 countries Though the company has solid long term growth potential but the risks from near term headwinds might somewhat restrict its growth momentum Sales Efforts for its Key MarketsIn order to boost comps in the United States  which represents a major portion of the company s business  McDonald s aims to increase focus on growing guest traffic  This will be done by accentuating on operational excellence  product innovation  offering a value menu and rolling out more limited time offerings In fact  the company s first and second phase of All Day Breakfast along with its national value platform   McPick 2   have been immensely popular among guests in the United States and may continue aiding top line growth On the digital front  McDonald s has finally begun testing mobile order and pay capabilities on its app in the United States and is set to launch the option in nearly all 14 000 U S  restaurants and 6 000 others in the UK  Canada  France  Germany  Australia and China by the end of this year Adding mobile to its ordering options is expected to enhance speed and convenience for customers  Moreover  given McDonald s large footprint in terms of locations  this is expected to boost sales and enhance the company s competitive position Meanwhile  to provide augmented convenience to customers  McDonald s is increasingly focusing on expanding the delivery service  Also  it is accelerating Experience of the Future  EOTF  deployment in the United States and building on its success in markets around the world  Through elevating the customer experience at McDonald s  this initiative represents one of the greatest opportunities to build on business momentum  besides growing guest counts Additionally  McDonalds is adapting to changing consumer preference  bringing more transparency in its operations and trying to attract more health conscious eaters by altering its practices and food lineup as well These apart  the company is also trying to improve its performance in the lnternational Lead Markets as well as the High Growth Markets  In fact  it intends to drive comps growth in these markets through introduction of value meals  comprehensive focus around new products and value as well as breakfast platforms  customizing the menu to local customer tastes  reimaging of restaurants  efficient marketing and promotions  improved service  and increased convenience via delivery Notably  global comps at McDonald s have been positive over the last eight consecutive quarters Increased Focus on FranchisingCurrently  nearly 85  of the company s restaurants are franchised  Going forward  McDonald s aims to refranchise 4 000 of its restaurants by the end of 2017 with the long term goal of becoming 95  franchised  We note that increased focus on refranchising will reduce the company s capital requirements and facilitate earnings per share  EPS  growth and Return on Equity  ROE  expansion over the long term In January 2017  the company entered into a strategic partnership and sold the control of its Chinese business  thus reducing its own share to 20   In fact  it continues to look out for similar partnerships to streamline its business and focus on the quality of its offerings  These deals are thus likely to have an upside impact on the company s earnings and margins as McDonald s is expected to gain from trimming its overall cost of operations and preserving its capital ConcernsWith about 40  of McDonald s operating income coming from the International Lead Markets and over 10  from the High Growth Markets  the company s earnings remain vulnerable to negative currency translation  Given that the dollar is strengthening against various currencies  the company s results are likely to be affected Moreover  apart from rise in minimum wage  additional health care costs related to Obamacare in the United States  raise labor costs for the company  Meanwhile  costs

196132,417648,MCD,The Ins And Outs Of Low Volatility ETFs,opinion,"If there s one thing investors love  it s consistency and reliability  Two attributes that deftly describe the trend of exchange traded funds that track low volatility stocks 
This unique category of the ETF universe has rapidly expanded in recent years through a combination of persistent fund flows and sector momentum  The factors that ultimately shape low volatility indexes have proven to offer attractive characteristics for conservative investors that want equity exposure without the downside risk of a typical broad based benchmark 
One leading fund in this group is the iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility  NYSE USMV   which has amassed nearly  14 billion in total assets  USMV is composed of nearly 200 large and mid cap U S  stocks with characteristics of reduced historical price volatility versus their peers  In short  it s a cross section of the U S  stock market that has demonstrated less downside risk over a short look back period 
The USMV portfolio is multi sector in nature with caps placed on the maximum allocation for any single group  At present the top holdings include healthcare  technology  and consumer staples companies such as McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   It also charges a very reasonable expense ratio of 0 15   making it suitable as a long term core holding in certain portfolios 
On a year to date basis  USMV is slightly outpacing the gains of the broad based SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  with a total return of  11 54   It also has a 7  lead on SPY over the last three years as well 

The high demand for innovation in the low volatility category has created a great number of ways to slice varying indexes using this criterion  Other top funds include the Powershares S P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio  NYSE SPLV  and PowerShares S P 500 High Div Low Volatility Portfolio  NYSE SPHD   There is also the iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility EAFE  NYSE EFAV  to consider for those who want a similar strategy directed towards international equities  I could easily name 10 more with varying flavors of global exposure  dividends  or some other tangential quality 
Having owned and observed   I can attest to their strengths  They work well to provide low cost exposure to a subset of high quality stocks  They are also fantastic for conservative investors who would normally be scared out of owning a benchmark like index with far more downside risk 
Nevertheless  they have certain drawbacks as well  The same factors that create the low volatility screens also lead to herding and potentially overcrowding in certain sector groups  The methodology is such that stocks with the lowest volatility are consistently momentum driven and can  
That s not necessarily a bad thing if the trend for those overweight sectors continues to consistently seek out higher prices  Like any smart beta index  funds like USMV and SPLV will ultimately experience periods of outperformance and others where their more conservative nature doesn t fit the market s mood 
The Bottom Line
This is certainly one of those times where smooth sailing  low costs  and sector makeup are in the sweet spot for low volatility ETFs  Yet  some fundamentals such as price earnings and price book suggest abnormally high valuations on a relative and absolute basis

196136,417652,MCD,Fatburger Mini IPO  Strong Expansion  Tough Markets,opinion,"FAT Brands  the parent company behind the cult fast casual burger chain Fatburger and chicken wing chain Buffalo s Caf   has announced that it plans to launch an IPO which plans to raise  20 million  In a Thursday interview with   Fatburger CEO Andy Wiederhon did note that while the IPO has not been formally qualified by the SEC  it will be soon 
Those familiar with IPOs should realize that  20 million is an incredibly low amount for a normal IPO to raise  Instead  FAT Brands will be making a Regulation A  offering  which is often described as a miniature IPO  This means lower SEC fees and reporting requirements  Furthermore  FAT Brands has stated that anyone can invest a minimum of  500 
In this early stage where the IPO has not been fully qualified  it is far too soon to make a decisive judgment on Fatburger s potential  especially without a firm look at its finances  But there are certain things about the company and the fast casual industry in general which can help investors reach a preliminary decision  An Ability to Expand
The FAT Brand IPO may be small  but its ambitions are clearly big  Fatburger was founded in 1952 in Los Angeles  and for most of its history was content to stay in California and offer massive hamburgers  But today  Fatburger has expanded to 19 states as well as countries such as China  India  and Canada  The  website declares that  we will have more than 300 restaurants open or under construction in more than 20 countries  generating more than  300m in sales  and a growth pipeline of another 300 restaurants to be built   And this is on top of FAT s stated intention to purchase additional brands  though no specific acquisition targets have been listed yet 
Perhaps what is most interesting about Fatburger s expansion is where it is not expanding  Fatburger s presence in the United States is limited purely to a few states mostly located in the west  And while Fatburger apparently has plans to expand into Brazil  Vietnam  and Algeria  it appears to have no plans to expand into continental Europe outside of Russia and the Scandinavian countries 
Wiederhon apparently is intent on giving Fatburger its niche as a uniquely American burger influence overseas  as he  in 2014 that  consumers all over the world love American brands  especially burgers  shakes and fries   The strategy appears to be working  as FAT Brand stated that between 2012 and 2016 it achieved compound annual growth rates in net revenue  net income  and EBITDA of 9 9   40 0   and 35 3  respectively 
FAT Brand appears to have seized a unique strategy of overseas and rapid expansion and thus has grown magnificently over the past few years  There are risks in expanding in less stable countries such as Egypt  Pakistan  and Saudi Arabia  But for now  it appears to have done very well for itself in the past few years  Breaking the Fast Casual Problem
The success of FAT Brands is all the more impressive when investors consider how other fast casual chains are struggling  As Bloomberg noted in June  fast casual sales growth is slowing from 10 to 11 percent in the past five years to 6 to 7 percent in 2017  As fast casual chains offer a highly elastic product and places like McDonald s  NYSE MCD  are starting to improve their food quality  diners are choosing to head to cheaper places 
Given how fast casual restaurants are now under siege from the cheaper restaurants that they were once beating  FAT s decision to branch out to countries where the competition for a good  American style burger is weaker looks to be a smart decision  Meanwhile in the United States  Fatburger has also embraced delivery  another trend hurting most fast casual restaurants  Fatburger is currently partnered with UberEats  Grubhub  and Postmates to bring burgers to consumers  doorsteps 
Fast casual restaurants have to adapt to changing consumer trends and no longer assume that offering quality is good enough  But FAT Brands has already begun adapting and has stolen a march over its competitors  another good sign for this company s long term prospects  An Initial Good Feeling
FAT Brands has been able to avoid the plights of other fast casual restaurants with solid international expansion and offering high quality products  and a preliminary look at what it has to offer speaks very well  Investors who are worried about the future of fast casual restaurants should look at Fatburger and how it has been able to thrive even while competitors have struggled  Note that it is still too soon to reach an absolute conclusion  Investors should clamor for more insight into its financial numbers such as exactly how profitable it is and how it will deal with challenges such as growing political demand for higher minimum wages and eventual competition from other American burger chains  But given this initial rosy beginning  investors should for now be willing to patiently listen and accept what Fatburger has to say ",2017-08-07,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fatburger-miniipo-strong-expansion-tough-markets-200205568,200205568

196155,417671,MCD,Restaurant Roundup  McDonald s  MCD  Beats  Domino s  DPZ  Slumps,opinion,"It s been an interesting morning in the restaurant space as several of the industry s major players  including McDonald s   NYSE MCD   and Domino s   NYSE DPZ    reported their latest earnings results  Despite solid beats by both of the aforementioned companies  the market s reaction has been entirely different 
McDonald s topped expectations on the top and bottom line  posting adjusted earnings of  1 73 per share and revenues of  6 05 billion  These results surpassed our Zacks Consensus Estimates of  1 62 and  5 99 billion  respectively  Profits improved 19  year over year  while revenues were down about 2  on a constant currency basis McDonald s Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   The real story for McDonald s was its impressive comparable store sales growth in key markets  Comps in the U S  gained a respectable 3 9   but comps in the company s International Lead Markets which includes mature markets like Australia  Canada  France  Germany and the U K  soared 6 3  
Elsewhere  McDonald s saw 7  comps growth in its High Growth Markets  a segment that includes countries with high restaurant expansion and franchising potential such as China  Italy  Poland  Russia  and South Korea  read more    
Shares of MCD opened at  157 75  nearly 4  higher than Monday s close  following the release of the report 
This price action was not matched by Domino s  despite the pizza chain reporting similarly impressive numbers  Domino s posted earnings of  1 32 per share on revenues of  629 million  surpassing our Zacks Consensus Estimates of  1 22 and  613 million  respectively 
Revenues in the company s supply chain unit  which includes ingredients and equipment sold to franchisees  climbed 15  year over year  Same store sales at company owned restaurants soared 11 2   while international comps rose a modest 2 6  Domino s Pizza Inc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   DPZ shares opened lower on Tuesday  eventually sliding more than 10  to an intraday low of  192 57 in morning trading 
Weakness in the Domino s international business is likely to blame for the market s harsh reaction to the report  For instance  the company s Domino s Pizza Group Plc franchise is the largest pizza delivery chain in the U K   and with like for like sales growth coming in much lower than last year  investors might be worried about the company s strength in key markets 
Overall  the retail restaurant business has been more familiar with challenges this year  The industry is sitting in the bottom 19  of the Zacks Industry Rank  and its modest growth has been outpaced by the S P 500 so far

Winning Stock Picks from Top 4 Industries for Job Growth 

	Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy   from retail sales to housing  to international trade to consumer sentiment 

	In fact  on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports 

	And while the financial media does cover them  they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive 

	This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading 

	For example  in the Employment Situation report  it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion  and which ones contracted 

	I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them 

	In fact  I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible  But  after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report  I knew the housing market had turned  And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery   for those who knew where to look 

	But the headline number and the obligatory one or two sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile  or paragraph  

	Well here we are again  with more stock picking insight  straight from last week s Employment Situation report  Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these four industries 

	1  HealthCare   37 000
	 up 336 000 over the last 12 months 

	2  Professional and Business Services   35 000
	 up 624 000 over the last 12 months 

	3  Food Services   Drinking Places   29 000
	 up 277 000 over the last 12 months 

	4  Finance   17 000
	 up 169 000 over the last 12 months 

	Once these reports point you in the right direction  you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups 

	This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis  But you can go to any screener  like the one on Zacks com or the Research Wizard  and locate the sector  then industry of interest 

	Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock picking criteria to drill down to the best ones  such as Zacks Rank 1s or 2s  Strong Buys or Buys   market beating growth rates  below industry valuations  upward earnings estimate revisions  etc 

	Here are 4 stocks from some of the industries singled out as the biggest job creators in last week s Employment report 

	Anthem  HealthCare   NYSE      

	ManPowerGroup  Professional   Business Services   NYSE      

	McDonald s  Food Services   Drinking Places   NYSE      

	Lakeland Financial  Finance   NASDAQ      

	Profitable stock ideas can come at any time and any place  But instead of waiting for the next great stock to fall into your lap  you can actively search for them  And by reading a few extra reports and then putting those ideas into a capable screener  you ll soon be amazed at some of the new picks you come up with

The move is a significant change considering about 7o percent of sales at the restaurant chain are made to customers who never exit their vehicles  In addition to the new ordering protocol  McDonald s has also asked restaurants to turn off pre recorded greetings at drive through lanes    workers will instead say hello in an effort to make the experience more pleasant    and employees have been instructed to no longer fold over the tops of paper bags so customers can quickly inspect their order 
McDonald s Corporation  N MCD    FindTheCompany
 Ask  ask  tell   was first pushed in the summer  but is optional for franchised McDonald s  which make up about 90 percent of the corporation s total restaurants  Bloomberg reported  The method allows an employee to confirm the order is correct during the order  at the pay window and as the bag is handed through the window  Over the summer McDonald s also cut half of the options on their drive through menu in order to make the process more simple  It s all a part of series of shifts at the company attempting to right the ship after a prolonged slump 
 Simplifying the drive through operation  underpins everything else we have been doing   Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said on a conference call with analysts and investors in October  via Yahoo  O YHOO  
Amid increased competition from  fast casual  restaurants  Easterbrook took over during the company s worst sales slump in more than 10 years  but has since led changes to make kitchens more efficient and improve food options  McDonald s also rolled out all day breakfast in the United States  Global sales were up a better than expected 4 percent in the third quarter  ending six consecutive quarters declining or flat results 
 The progress we have made in a short amount of time gives me confidence we re making the right moves to turn around our business and reposition McDonald s as a modern  progressive burger company   Easterbrook said on a conference call with analysts and investors at the time 
The most recent data on drive through service showed that in 2013  McDonald s got about 88 percent of orders correct  according to a study by QSR magazine and Insula Research  That put the company ahead of Wendy s and Burger King but behind Taco Bell and Chick fil A ",2015-11-23,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mcdonald's-makes-drive-thru-changes-372550,372550
196178,417694,MCD,Chicago calm a day after release of video of police shooting teenager,news,"By Mary Wisniewski
CHICAGO  Reuters    The white Chicago policeman charged with murdering a black teenager he shot 16 times spent his first full day in custody on Wednesday in a jail hospital ward  but calm prevailed in the city despite fears of civil unrest over a video of the slaying 
Five people were arrested late on Tuesday in mostly peaceful demonstrations following release of the graphic footage showing 17 year old Laquan McDonald being gunned down in the middle of a street on Oct  20  2014  as he was walking away from police who had confronted him 
A new round of protests on Wednesday at Chicago s criminal courthouse and City Hall were sparsely attended  although members of the City Council s black caucus again demanded the resignation of Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy 
 We want McCarthy gone  We want new leadership   Alderman Roderick Sawyer told a news conference 
Critics of the police department and Cook County prosecutors have questioned why it took investigators 13 months to bring charges in the case and to release police video footage of the McDonald slaying 
The tape  recorded from a dashboard mounted camera in one of the patrol cars arriving on the scene  was made public on Tuesday under court order hours after the officer who fired the fatal volley of gunshots  Jason Van Dyke  was charged with first degree murder 
Van Dyke  37  is the first Chicago police officer charged with murder over an on duty exercise of lethal force in decades  If convicted  he could face 20 years to life in prison  He was denied bail at a hearing Tuesday 
President Barack Obama  who hails from Chicago and began his political career there  said on Facebook  O FB  he was  deeply disturbed  by the video but  personally grateful to the people of my hometown for keeping protests peaceful  
Investigation of the case comes amid a national debate on race and police tactics sparked by a series of high profile killings of unarmed black men at the hands of mainly white law enforcement in several U S  cities in the past two years  leading to widespread demonstrations and some violent unrest 
PROTECTIVE CUSTODY
Van Dyke began his incarceration under protective custody at a hospital facility segregated from the general population of Cook County Jail  the county sheriff s office said  No information was given about his medical condition 
Van Dyke s lawyer  Daniel Herbert  told CNN that the video was not an indicator of his client s guilt  He said Van Dyke arrived on a street on the southwest side of Chicago 18 minutes after a suspect carrying a knife was reported to have threatened businesses and vandalized police cruisers 
 Video by its nature is two dimensional  It distorts images  So what appears to be clear on a video sometimes is not always that clear   Herbert said  Van Dyke  he said   truly was in fear for his life as well as the lives of his fellow police officers  
Authorities said McDonald was carrying a pocket knife and had the hallucinogenic drug PCP in his system at the time 
The video shows McDonald jogging away from patrol vehicles pursuing him from behind  then veering off diagonally at a walk as two more officers  one of them Van Dyke  pull up in a squad car ahead of him 
The officers are seen emerging from their vehicle and drawing their weapons while advancing toward McDonald  who continues to move away  Within seconds he is shot  spins and crumples to the ground  his body jerking as he is hit by more gunshots 
Prosecutors said 16 rounds fired by Van Dyke struck McDonald as the officer unloaded his weapon at the youth 
MORE RALLIES PLANNED
Authorities in Chicago  a city of 2 7 million people  had girded for the possibility of civil unrest on a scale seen in cities such as Baltimore and Ferguson  Missouri  but the city remained mostly tranquil by Wednesday night 
A group of between 100 and 200 protesters began a march at the start of the evening rush hour in Chicago s busy downtown area  and were still on the streets more than five hours later despite the onset of rain 
The racially mixed crowd chanted  16 shots  and  Hands up  don t shoot   There were unconfirmed social media accounts of some arrests but police declined to confirm or deny the reports 
Another protest planned earlier in the evening farther south outside police headquarters fizzled out after only a couple of dozen people turned out 
Additional rallies were planned for Chicago s annual Thanksgiving Day parade on Thursday and another for Friday 
On Wednesday  authorities dismissed a felony charge against Malcolm X  London  22  a Chicago poet and activist accused of striking a police officer during Tuesday s protests 
The video at the center of the case was made public only after an independent journalist filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit  The police department had argued that releasing the video would taint multiple investigations 

Alderman Howard Brookins said the council  which signed off on a  5 million city settlement with McDonald s  N MCD  family even before a lawsuit was filed  was misled about the contents of the video  Brookins said council members were told something was  fuzzy  something grey  about it ",2015-11-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/chicago-calm-a-day-after-release-of-video-of-police-shooting-teenager-372894,372894
196179,417695,MCD,Here s Why You Should Steer Clear Of Potbelly  PBPB  Stock,opinion,Potbelly Corporation   NASDAQ PBPB   has been recording substandard performance and disappointing investors  of late  In fact  shares of this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company have lost 9 3  in the past one year against the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 9 9  Furthermore  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter s earnings has also seen one negative revision for the last two months versus none in the opposite direction  This  in turn  has led to a 7 1  decline in the consensus estimate trend Here are some other factors that also suggest why it would be a wise decision to drop the stock from your portfolio now Lackluster Earnings Growth  While Potbelly has historical  3 5 years  earnings per share  EPS  growth rate of just 4 9  compared with the industry s average of 8   investors should really focus on projected growth  Here  the company s EPS is actually estimated to decline a whopping 17 2  year over year  During the same time  the industry is expected to record an average EPS growth of 6 4  Earnings growth is often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  ahead  for the company in question and is thus one of the most important factors to consider  Evidently  Potbelly falls very weak on this front according to current estimations Valuation Looks Unreasonable  Potbelly s Forward PE ratio  price relative to current year s earnings  is pegged at 31 14  This level is higher than its current trailing twelve month PE ratio of 24 9 as well as the industry average forward PE ratio of 21 12 Further  Potbelly s Price to Free Cash Flow  P FCF  comes in at 32 2  higher than the industry average of 24 8  It is to be noted that this ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  But it doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  thereby depicting a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business Industry headwinds  Over the last few quarters  the U S  restaurant space has not been too enticing  Despite economic growth  somewhat lower energy prices and higher income  consumers increased their spending only modestly on dining out  which resulted in low consumption  This is because  along with wage growth  inflation is also on the rise  which translates to lower real income and thus less disposable income  The situation has taken a worse turn  thanks to higher health care costs and tightened credit availability in the country Moreover  as consumers demand high quality products at lower prices  it is pushing grocery stores to decrease their food prices in order to remain competitive  This  in turn  is resulting in a bigger gap between food at home and food away from home indices Consequently  same store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment  Traffic too has been weak  In fact  the first quarter of 2017 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole  thus continuing the somber mood  Potbelly is no exception to the trend and resultantly  the company s sales have come under pressure Margins under pressure  Of late  the company s profits have been under pressure owing to a rising wage rates scenario  Moreover  pre opening costs of outlets given the company s unit expansion plans  and expenses related to initiatives are adding to the costs and are likely to hurt profits We note that Potbelly has recorded trailing twelve month net margin of just 1 9  compared with the industry average of 15   Given the rising expenses scenario  the trend is not expected to reverse for the company any time soon Meanwhile  Potbelly expects the shut down of its Midway International Airport outlet to pose a large loss to its business as it was the highest volume location Stock to ConsiderInvestors interested in the restaurants space can consider some better ranked stocks instead Dave   Buster s Entertainment  Inc    NASDAQ PLAY   surpassed earnings estimates in all of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 30 50   It currently carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  presently  You can see  Red Robin Gourmet Burgers  Inc    NASDAQ RRGB   is

196182,417698,MCD,Winning Stock Picks From The Top 4 Industries With The Biggest Job Growth,opinion,"Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy   from retail sales to housing  to international trade to consumer sentiment 
In fact  on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports 
And while the financial media does cover them  they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive 
This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading 
For example  in the Employment Situation report  it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion  and which ones contracted 
I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them 
In fact  I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible  But  after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report  I knew the housing market had turned  And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery   for those who knew where to look 
But the headline number and the obligatory one or two sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile  or paragraph  
Well here we are again  with more stock picking insight  straight from last week s Employment Situation report  Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these four industries 
1  HealthCare   37 000 up 336 000 over the last 12 months 
2  Professional and Business Services   35 000 up 624 000 over the last 12 months 
3  Food Services   Drinking Places   29 000 up 277 000 over the last 12 months 
4  Finance   17 000 up 169 000 over the last 12 months 
Once these reports point you in the right direction  you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups 
This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis  But you can go to any screener  like the one on Zacks com or the Research Wizard  and locate the sector  then industry of interest 
Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock picking criteria to drill down to the best ones  such as Zacks Rank 1s or 2s  Strong Buys or Buys   market beating growth rates  below industry valuations  upward earnings estimate revisions  etc

196195,417711,MCD,McDonald s Launches Its First Organic Burger In Germany ,news,"By   

The iconic McDonald s  NYSE MCD   golden arches  have been an international emblem of American junk food for decades  With its greasy burgers and salty French fries  the burger chain has become the prime example of what fast food restaurants once aimed to be  quick  cheap and predictable  but not necessarily healthy 
Consumers  changing tastes and demand for healthier foods  however  have brought tough times for McDonald s  with slumping sales both domestically and internationally  The iconic burger chain has tried a slew of new initiatives sin the U S  from an all day breakfast menu to a kale salad to turn around its plunging profits  Now  the corporation has turned its attention overseas  In its latest effort to appeal to the health conscious European market  it launched its first 100 percent organic beef hamburger for a limited time in Germany this month  But marketing experts and dieticians alike predict an organic burger in a fast food joint won t be enough to make over McDonald s global reputation as a purveyor of greasy American food 
McDonald s decision to roll out its first organic burger in the German market  instead of its largest market in the U S   isn t too surprising  With a large global presence  the fast food giant has consistently offered different menu items in its global stores to cater to the local demand  In India  McDonald s offers a variety of vegetarian items that cannot be found in the U S   including the McVeggie and Veg Pizza McPuff  In Malaysia  McDonald s put a twist on a local Malaysian dish with its Burbur Ayam McD  and in Korea  McDonald s customers can find a shrimp burger on the menu  Still  the burger joint has seen plunging profits globally  For the second quarter ending July 23  global comparable sales decreased 0 7 percent  reflecting negative guest traffic in all major segments  In Asia  sales were down in Japan and China after meat processing scandals 

McDonald s  known for its caloric Big Macs and salt ridden French fries  has especially struggled with how to appeal to health conscious German consumers  making Germany one of its toughest markets  In the fourth quarter of 2014  weakness in McDonalds  France and German markets  which has almost 1 500 restaurants  contributed to a 1 1 percent decline in comparable sales in Europe  according to Reuters  In fact  Britain  France  Russia and Germany together accounted for only 67 percent of European revenue in 2013  However  Germany s quarterly sales recently grew for the first time since 2012  making it one of Europe s top markets 
Colleen Liace  27  resides in Washington  D C  but lived in Germany from January until September for a work assignment  Liace said she noticed that most Germans instantly associated McDonald s with an unhealthy American lifestyle  but that the chain still remained popular there  She predicted that the organic burger could do well in the German market  but it s lasting success would be dependent on price points 
 I feel like the meat standards in general are higher in Germany  which may lead to higher popularity   Liace said in an e mail   I ve eaten there myself and feel like the quality in ingredients are night and day compared to the U S  

But Nico Bokesch  19  a resident of Taufkirchen Vils  Germany  predicted that an organic burger would flop  Germans are aware that the fast food chain is  unhealthy and fattening   according to Bokesch  but they still go to McDonald s because  it just tastes good  
 The Big Mac is the most popular burger and most consumers eat it   said Bokesch   I think McDonald s shouldn t try to turn healthy    no one goes to McDonald s because they want a healthy  good meal   McDonalds  strong points are tasty and quick meals  
Dieticians also noted that offering an organic burger at a fast food chain likely won t appeal to the typical McDonald s customer  who values time and price over everything else  Organic beef is at a higher price point than regular beef  and a loyal McDonald s customer probably won t fork over extra cash just to eat organically  according to Lisa Moskovitz  a registered dietician and founder of NY Nutrition Group 

 Most people who are eating out  they aren t really influenced by health for the most part  A lot of time they are influenced by it being fast  by money  by time  by taste  I would automatically assume that the organic meat is not going to appeal to many of the patrons  at McDonald s     said Moskovitz   It s good for people who have no choice and are on the road a lot  but for the average McDonald s patron  health is not a priority  so I don t think it will be successful  
Christine Palumbo  a registered dietician and nutritionist RDN from Naperville  Illinois  also agreed that most people skip the salads at McDonald s and typically go for the cheap and quick option  but she said that she thinks McDonald s could eventually shake its fast food image  However  it will take time  money and an open minded consumer base  said Palumbo 
 Unfortunately there is a distrust of major corporations  and McDonald s is one of those companies where people distrust them   said Palumbo   People will likely say   well  how can it be organic if it s McDonald s   but they  McDonald s  were the ones who started offering sliced apples years ago   anything could happen  
While McDonald s did not comment on whether the company has any plans to introduce an organic burger in other markets  the potential launch of an organic burger in the U S  isn t too far fetched  The company s new CEO Steve Easterbrook has recently introduced a myriad of changes in an effort to revamp the corporation into a  modern  progressive burger company   McDonald s tested this year a kale salad in its California stores  and in the past  Easterbrook said that McDonald s USA planned to switch to chicken raised with fewer antibiotics 

All of these changes are putting McDonald s more in line with popular chains like Chipotle and Panera Bread  NASDAQ PNRA   which both have healthier images  but its core product of traditional hamburgers is reportedly suffering  according to Larry Light  CEO of the consulting firm Arcature and McDonald s global chief marketing officer from 2002 to 2005  If McDonald s does launch an organic burger in the U S  as a long term item  it could be a recipe for disaster 
 I think the core products are being ignored   said Light   The quality of the core product has deteriorated  while competition s quality has improved  Burger King and Wendy s are saying  thank you very much   and are growing at the expense of McDonald s  
Light said McDonald s should focus on revitalization  not growth   You don t build a tall building on a weak foundation   he said ",2015-10-09,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mcdonald's-launches-its-first-organic-burger-in-germany-365429,365429

196198,417714,MCD,Should You Buy McDonald s  MCD  Stock  ,opinion,"It hasn t quite been the best time for retail restaurants  but some of the companies that have seen success recently have been the iconic brands that have fed loyal customers for decades  In fact  one of the hottest restaurant stocks on the market lately has been McDonald s   NYSE MCD   
Indeed  this iconic American food chain has been on fire throughout 2017  and shares have gained more than 25  year to date  Nevertheless  such a steady gain especially one that outpaces the overall  by double digits is enough to leave many investors wondering whether MCD has entered  overbought  territory 
So should investors be buying McDonald s stock right now  or is it finally time for a pullback  Let s check out some of the basic metrics first 
The first thing we need to talk about here is comps growth  the all important metric that has been sluggish throughout the retail sector  In the most recent quarter  McDonald s posted global comps growth of 4   which was boosted by 11  comps growth in its  Foundational Markets  segment 
This market has owed its recent success to strength in Japan  and it underscores the international success that McDonald s has also seen in its  International Lead Markets  and  High Growth Markets  units  Domestically  comps were up about 1 7  in the most recent quarter  primarily because of All Day Breakfast and promotions 
This comps growth is in contrast to what might be a problem  which is the company s continuously slumping total revenues  Of course  we have to remember the impact that refranchising has here  Revenues at company operated stores declined 9 1  in the most recent quarter  but revenues at franchise operated stores were up 5 3  
And despite these slumping revenues  McDonald s has been able to post earnings growth  In fact  our current consensus estimates would represent full year EPS growth of nearly 12   Looking ahead  the Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for earnings growth of 6 2  next year 
Nevertheless  investors will notice that MCD is only a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   While the company has seen plenty of positive earnings estimate revisions  there have been a few negative revisions too  In fact  we only see 90  agreement on current quarter revisions and just 70  agreement on next quarter revisions  This can cause a stock s Zacks Rank to lag 
Value minded investors will also notice that McDonald s is currently trading at about 24x earnings  which isn t exactly incredible  but it is relatively on par with its retail restaurant industry peers 
Now  let s move into more technical analysis by taking a look at a couple of charts 
In the top chart  we see MCD s price movement over the past two years  This is noteworthy because we see that  over this timeframe  the stock has undergone two significant rallies  As we can see  the current rally  which really started in November of last year  has now matched the previous rally in significance 
Is this an accurate indicator that the rally is over  Of course not  But we can also note from the second chart  which shows today s intraday pricing  that MCD is now trading above its 50  100  and 200 day moving averages  Again  not a perfect indicator  but this certainly does show that MCD is now trading in relatively uncharted territory 
It will be interesting to see how MCD behaves at these levels  The next big test for the stock will come in late July when the company reports earnings again  Make sure to check back here for our analysis when that day comes

196199,417715,MCD,The Meteoric Rise Of China s Middle Class,opinion,"Despite some worries lately  the burgeoning middle class in China is a force to be reckoned with on the global stage  In the short time since Deng Xiaoping s economic reforms  China has become home to the largest middles class on Earth  with over 225 million households now in this category 
These households reflect a dramatic change from the five million households that represented the demographic just 17 years ago    the current criterion for those within the middle class involves earning between  11 500 and  43 000 a year in current U S  dollars  a metric that should be kept in context with China s lower cost of living 
This growth has led to a major shift in quality of life within China   presented at an international conference on sustainable development in 2005  China managed to reduce the proportion of the population in sever poverty from 250 million to 26 million between 1978 and 2004  This  coupled with the aforementioned boost in middle class citizens  reflects the fact that Chinese people are experiencing a kind of financial stabilization that to many was otherwise unthinkable in the past 
From the opening of the first McDonald s   NYSE MCD   in Beijing in 1991 to now  the rise of consumerism in China has dramatically altered the way people choose to spend their money  also read      by Global X  the issuers of the China Consumer ETF   Chinese GDP growth is expected to be propelled largely by consumption in the years to come 
In 2014 alone  the annual per capita income rate of households grew by 9 4   Smaller cities in China are becoming more urbanized  and the Urbanization Plan under the  is now targeting 60  national urbanization by 2020 
Newer generations in China that have lived under better economic standards are more confident about personal income growth  and are more loyal to brand names  they are also less hesitant to try new products and services  Retail sales have grown every year since 2005  a trend that will likely continue in the years to come    retail sales rose 10 7  year over year in May

looks forward to perk up its alcohol and beverage mix as well as its to go business compared with the industry  Meanwhile  the company has rolled out its Kitchen Display System  which is linked to table management software  This is expected to result in annual sales growth of roughly  50 million  as kitchens can handle higher peak volumes Moreover  in Nov 2016  the company announced the

China s Communist Party  obsessed with social stability  brooks no challenge to its rule and has cracked down on cults  which have multiplied in recent years  Demonstrations have been put down with force and some sect leaders executed 
Xinhua said the nine were all members of the group Quannengshen  or the Church of Almighty God  and were convicted of  undermining the implementation of laws by making use of cult organizations  
Police found books  leaflets and memory sticks used to promote their group  the report said 
 They also recruited and brainwashed believers   it said 
Quannengshen gained notoriety in 2014 when a video distributed online appeared to show group members beating a woman to death at a McDonald s  NYSE MCD  food chain store  That incident led to two members being sentenced to death for murder

196229,417745,MCD,McDonald s Great Kale Experiment,news,"By    

Carson Walter sat on her lunch break  sipping soda  a cheeseburger wrapper stuffed into a paper bag by her feet  in the upstairs dining room of a crowded McDonald s  NYSE MCD  in lower Manhattan Thursday afternoon   I try and eat healthy at least half the time   said Walter  23  who dined with a friend   We come to McDonald s because it s quick  it s close  and it s cheaper  We know we re not being healthy  but it doesn t bother us   It s an attitude that the fast food chain McDonald s has been working hard to overcome of late  In nine restaurants in California  McDonald s is testing out a breakfast bowl that includes kale as an ingredient  the company said Wednesday  The initiative is the most recent effort from the global chain to make itself more appealing to consumers and to bolster lagging sales  In March  for instance  the company announced that it would phase out chicken raised with human antibiotics  These changes are testing how just how deeply McDonald s reputation as a destination for tasty junk food is engrained in the mind of the American public  But analysts said they are skeptical that the company s newest efforts could dramatically re brand it as the  modern  progressive burger company  that Steve Easterbrook  the corporation s new CEO who helped rebuild the chain in the U K   wants it to be   I don t think kale is the solution   Larry Light  the CEO of the consulting firm Arcature and McDonald s global chief marketing officer from 2002 to 2005  said  McDonald s desperately needs what he called a  dramatic turnaround   yet it lacks a coherent strategy to make that happen   They try a tactic  and then next month they try a different tactic   he said  Light suggested products such as kale could be abandoned in favor of focusing on fundamentals  like taking  bad stuff  out of its foods  including the anti foaming agent that is one of 19 ingredients in its French fries  He pointed out that just months ago  McDonald s had aired an advertisement that mocked the idea of using kale as an ingredient  evidence that it was flip flopping and lacked a cohesive strategy to rebrand itself  Marion Nestle  a professor at New York University and the author of Food Politics  said that adding kale recalled McDonald s past efforts to win over new consumers with salads  She said that decision was  designed to address the deal breaker problem  groups of people going to lunch when one or two wanted something healthier   But in the long run  adding kale was unlikely to change McDonald s image    or its most regular visitors  Nestle predicted  Serving kale at McDonald s seemed questionable from a health perspective  nutrition and food experts said  Depending on how the nutritious  dark leafy green is prepared  the menu choice could backfire and have unintended consequences   I d be interested to see if they can really keep it as a healthy and nutritious option rather than adding it to something that s unhealthy to begin with   said Lisa Moscovitz  a registered dietitian and founder of New York Nutrition Group   Are they going to be putting it in things that contain tons of saturated fat  Is it going to be smothered in tons of Caesar dressing   Lisa McComb  a spokeswoman for McDonald s  said the California restaurants were offering a turkey sausage and egg white breakfast bowl  which comes with kale and spinach   The breakfast bowls are freshly prepared   McComb said in an email  She said the eggs and sausage were  freshly grilled  and a bruschetta topping was prepared in the restaurant  She did not offer specifics about how the spinach and kale were prepared before being added to the breakfast bowl   Consumers will overeat something that s not actually healthier for them  So if people think   Oh  this is a kale salad  so I can eat this  plus treat myself to a dessert   Marie Bragg  an obesity and food policy researcher and an assistant professor at New York University  said  If that happens  then people aren t actually eating healthier  especially if the kale itself is not prepared in a nutritious way  Bragg said  Lisa Watkins  a vegetarian who eats at McDonald s once or twice every two weeks  usually with her children  said she would welcome any healthier changes to McDonald s menu  She loved the idea of kale in salads  but said that McDonald s could also make simpler  more fundamental changes  such as offering veggie burgers  which the chain currently does not sell  Or  instead of French fries as a side with value meals  they could give customers the options of getting a small side salad or a baked potato  Watkins suggested  Ultimately  McDonald s campaign to overcome its image as an unhealthy chain  or a fast food guilty pleasure  will probably be more difficult than simply swapping ingredients or re sourcing to antibiotics free meat  After all  its greasy burgers are what it s known for  Watkins said that even if McDonald s decides to add more healthy alternatives  they should leave at least one menu item untouched   Keep the fries as they are   Watkins said   Every now and then  you want a little junk  ",2015-05-07,International Business

196239,417755,MCD,McDonald s To Serve Up Mobile Ordering Ahead Of Its Fast Food Competition ,opinion,"McDonald s Corporation   NYSE MCD   is set to offer mobile ordering and payment options at all of its 14 000 US locations by the end of the fourth quarter  according to a Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   analyst note on Monday 
In a note to clients  Wells Fargo analyst Jeff Farmer reported that McDonald s would be the first major US fast food chain to offer completely mobile ordering at every US location 
 Restaurant consumers are aggressively gravitating toward concepts that offer the greatest level of convenience and control across ordering  payment and distribution   Farmer said   Among the hamburger players  we believe that MCD is establishing a first mover advantage with digital that can drive sustainable share gains in late 2017 and beyond  
McDonald s stock was up marginally on Monday and is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Despite all the talk of healthy eating and more options  McDonald s stock is currently trading near its all time high at  131 35 per share 
On top of rolling out mobile smartphone ordering and payment options at all 14 000 McDonald s locations in the US  Farmer noted that the fast food giant is set to add digital ordering kiosks in 2 500 US stores by the end of the fourth quarter  Wells Fargo boosted McDonald s valuation range to  145 to  150 from  125 to  130 
 Among the hamburger players  we believe Wendy s is closest to this timeline with mobile order   pay expected to be offered across half of its system by the end of 2017   the note said   Burger King   Jack in the Box are in test  
According to   mobile ordering is expected to become a  38 billion industry by 2020  accounting for 10  of total fast food sales  By moving to mobile ordering now  McDonald s is ahead of its competition  which could prove valuable in the short term 
 its mobile order and pay plan on March 1  noting it would add the optional method at a total of 20 000 locations by the end of 2017  Mobile ordering will allow customers to choose curbside delivery instead of going through the drive thru line  Customers who choose to go through the drive thru with their mobile order will simply read their mobile code and pick up their order at the window 
Other Potentially Positive McDonald s Moves 
McDonald s recently announced it would begin to make the switch to fresh  never frozen beef for its  Quarter Pounder  burgers by mid 2018 at most locations  The move comes after many consumers increasingly want more fresh options  even when it comes to their burgers 
 Over the past two years  we ve made a series of bold  tangible changes for our customers   McDonald s President and CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a    Serving All Day Breakfast  moving to cage free eggs and testing delivery are all proof of our commitment to building a better McDonald s  And we are committed to transforming more aspects of our business  including offering a more modern and enjoyable dining experience  adding new levels of convenience and technology  and making more positive changes to the food we serve  
On top of adding mobile ordering and improving some of its menu options  the Illinois based company is set to officially move from its corporate headquarters in Oak Brook into its new 500 000 square foot  starting in 2018 
McDonald s move into the city is part of a larger corporate exodus from the suburbs that hopes to help attract a greater amount of young  exceptional talent

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

McDonalds Switching to Fresh Beef  Should Competitors Worry  

McDonald s Corp    NYSE         is set to discard the use of frozen patties in favor of fresh beef in all its popular  Quarter Pounder  burgers across the majority of its U S  restaurants by mid 2018 

	Notably  the burger giant tested fresh never frozen beef patties in Quarter Pounders burgers in over 400 restaurants in the Dallas Fort Worth area as well as in Tulsa  OK region  It received immensely positive feedback from customers and employees 

	Meanwhile  it is to be noted that the fresh beef initiative is yet to be implemented for other McDonald s burgers like the Big Mac and McDouble 

Rationale Behind

	This latest shift marks one of the biggest moves by the company to turn around its struggling U S  business  Ever since the announcement of a turnaround plan by the company s CEO  Steve Easterbrook  last May  a string of changes has been implemented on the restaurant chain as well as its menu in an effort to rejuvenate the brand 

	The company has thus invigorated sales and profits by trimming costs  simplifying menus  offering value meals and rolling out all day breakfast in the U S 

	McDonald s is also going full steam on its digital initiatives and has begun testing mobile order and pay capabilities on its app in the U S   reportedly  Moving ahead  the company plans to increase the number of restaurants that provide table service and self ordering kiosks and is also testing food delivery 

	Meanwhile  at a time when the U S  restaurant industry is facing a slowdown  food companies are adapting to changing consumer preference  bringing more transparency in their operations and trying to appeal to more health conscious eaters by altering their practices and food lineup 

	Also  McDonald s is not far behind  The company has discontinued the use of chicken raised with antibiotics  started using real butter  not margarine  in breakfast sandwiches  and removed high fructose corn syrup from buns 

	Additionally  to meet consumer preference for quality food  in Sep 2015  the company announced plans to shift completely to cage free eggs for approximately 16 000 restaurants in the U S  and Canada  over the next 10 years 

	Though the usage of fresh beef is not a first for a fast food chain  it is a noteworthy shift for McDonald s in its strive to keep in pace with the industry that is migrating toward fresher ingredients  With this the company also aims to combat the overall slowdown in the U S  restaurant space and rising competition in the patty space from fast casual burger chains like The Habit Restaurants  Inc   NASDAQ           Shake Shack Inc   NYSE          and even fast food rival The Wendy s Company  NASDAQ           which has taken pride in its fresh meat for a long time 

Bottom Line

	McDonald s shares have gained 12 1  over the past six months outpacing the 2 1  growth witnessed by the Zacks categorized  industry  Moreover  McDonald s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past 10 quarters  with the trailing four quarter average earnings surprise coming in at 5 67  

	However  the company s U S  restaurants has now witnessed four straight years of traffic declines  resulting in 500 million lost transactions  since 2012 

	The switch to fresh beef is thus another move by the fast food chain to enhance its food and entice health conscious customers and reverse recent foot traffic declines  It would also aid McDonald s in keeping with its efforts to transform itself to a contemporary burger company 

	However  the transition to fresh beef is not going to be that smooth as it might slow down service due to major disruptions in its supply chain as well as changes in kitchen operations and equipment  Also  the company will need to ramp up its food safety as fresh  never frozen meat poses danger of food borne illness 

	Though McDonald s is a somewhat late entrant in the fresh beef game  we believe that its large footprint in terms of locations lends it an advantage  Thus  the switch may perhaps prove to be challenging for its close competitors as the company might eat up their market share 

	McDonald s currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

The US dollar is weaker this morning  oil is slightly lower  and global indices are mixed  US markets in particular are being cautious  waiting to see which Donald Trump shows up in the Oval Office this week  the man who will focus on deregulation  lowering taxes and fiscal stimulus  which would likely be a boon to markets  or the combative chief executive who might spark a trade war  to the dismay of investors  Safe haven assets  including gold  silver  and the Japanese yen  are up 
Overnight  Asian markets finished mixed  The Shanghai Composite rose 0 43   to close at 3 136 77 and the Hang Seng inched 0 06  higher  to 22 898 52  The Nikkei however  fell 1 29  to 18 891 03  as the stronger yen weighed on Japanese businesses

The US dollar is lower against all the currency majors today as uncertainty reigns 

Though the dollar rose after Trump s election on promises of  1 trillion in fiscal stimulus and infrastructure growth  the new President s shine may have diminished considerably  since his inauguration speech on Friday  in which Trump mostly emphasized a protectionist agenda  the dollar has weakened 
The British pound rallied 3 5  since last week  it s currently trading at  1 247  The British Supreme Court is expected to rule tomorrow on whether Parliamentary approval is necessary to trigger Article 50 in order to begin the Brexit process  Their ruling could agitate markets  but with PM Theresa May already stating last week that Brexit will go to a Parliament vote  it s unlikely to cause substantial upheaval  Of additional significance for the pound s outlook this week  May is scheduled to meet with Trump on Friday  Depending on how their trade discussions go  headlines from the event could impact the cable s trajectory 
The yen is up to 113 36 versus the dollar  According to Boris Schlossberg 115 is a pivotal battleground for yen bulls and bears  If USD JPY advances past 115  it could signal that the Trump Rally is back on 
One poorly performing emerging market currency of note  the Turkish lira  One of the worst performing currencies in 2017  the lira has declined nearly 7  since the New Year holiday  Economic growth in Turkey turned negative in the third quarter  and the full year 2016 forecast calls for growth of just 3 6   a far cry from the upper single digit growth rates the country experienced under Prime Minister Erdogan from 2003 2014  Since Erdogan became President of Turkey in 2014  adding considerably to his power  and ahead of an April 2 referendum on constitutional reform it s likely the lira could fall further 
The Mexican peso is currently trading at 21 4279  Sentiment regarding the peso appears to be closely tied to what is said in Washington  so unless Trump changes his rhetoric about immigration  trade  and the US Mexico border wall  expect the peso to remain under pressure 
Finally  after Chinese regulators cast a spotlight on Bitcoin two weeks ago  three Chinese exchanges which trade in the crypto currency  BTCC  Huobi  and OkCoin  said late yesterday that they would begin charging traders transaction fees in efforts to curb market manipulation and curb extreme volatility  Bitcoin is flat today  trading at  923 52

196254,417770,MCD,McDonald s To Decline On Q4 Report,opinion,"Why Fourth Quarter Reports Will Disappoint Most Investors Following Steady Growth For 2016
After McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  shares soared during the last month of 2016  reports from analysts now show that the upcoming fourth quarter earnings report to be released by the company on Monday might lead to a decline in the recent gains in the shares of the company  Prior to the earnings report  analysts estimates also showed that the report might show lesser same store sales and a slowdown in the number of the fast food chain s numbers 
According to a research conducted among the branch operators of the fast food chain  the colder weather proved to be a challenging condition for their sales as more competitors came up with ways to challenge their current dollar menu which cannot be discounted further 
A week before the release of the earnings report  forecasts for their franchise numbers and same store sales dropped as the company faced the issues mentioned above  Meanwhile  overall earnings forecasts also declined with the forecasts dropping by 70 points and a weaker sales outlook for January still driven by the harsh weather conditions  Despite the challenges to be faced by the fast food chain  the company has come up with promotions for the winter including a dollar coffee which includes a special for less pricey hot beverages from Mcdonald s  The brand s coffee line currently generates around  4 billion in yearly sales for the company in the United states alone 
What To Expect From Q4 Results
Mcdonald s previous quarter report showed that the company s same store sales jumped by 3 5  compared to the 1 8  growth during the second quarter and a 5 4  increase in the first quarter 
This time  collective analysts estimates show that Mcdonald s might be posed for a decline led about by a decline in same store sales and revenue to about 1 2   Nomura Instinet analysts Mark Kalinowski stated that he lowered is same store sales expectations by 70 points with the fourth quarter consensus to be down by 1 4  
For the EPS  Wall Street Analysts have issued an earnings estimate of about  1 41 per share this fourth quarter from the third quarter s  1 5 earnings per share  Other estimates range to an EPS of  1 46 
Meanwhile  consensus revenue forecast is at around  5 99 billion less than 5 52  year over year while Wall Street estimates stand at  52 million  a 2 12  increase year over year  Total earnings for the whole year stands at a 14  rise year over year with a  5 69 EPS to a total of  24 59 billion revenue 
Majority estimates show that Mcdonald s is set for a decline as Mcdonald s is set to a 2 4  decline in the same store sales in the U S just in December and 1 4  during the year 
Should McDonald s come out successful with their dollar coffee and big mac promotion which they have rolled out earlier in December  the company should have a positive first quarter for the year 
Stock Overview
Mcdonald s opened on Friday higher at  122 68 before settling lower at  122 10  The stock then had a day s low of  122 01 and a day s high of 122 93 
For the quarter  the stock of the fast food chain has climbed by as much as 11 points since September while it traded above its 20 day moving average of 121 746 and above its 50 day moving average of 120 508 
Despite the weak outlook for the upcoming fourth quarter earnings report  analysts are expecting that there is a long term growth for McDonald stocks with a  128 92 price target higher by 5 2  compared to last week s close ",2017-01-23,FSM News,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mcdonald’s-to-decline-on-q4-report-200173260,200173260

The wage hikes come in the wake of a flurry of protests by McDonald s workers nationwide demanding higher wages and increased benefits  In late December  an attorney from the National Labor and Relations Board  NLRB  filed a complaint against the company alleging worker abuse over wage protests 
Easterbrook was named CEO of McDonald s in January  following the retirement of predecessor Don Thompson  At the time  McDonald s stock only increased roughly 1  in Thompson s 31 months as company CEO  The company also endured a period of 13 consecutive months when it failed to post a gain in sales

Shares of McDonalds were soaring in the past few sessions as the strategic plan of the prominent fast food chain provided a bullish path of the stock in the coming year  From the new delivery services and the growing number of outlets worldwide  McDonald s lived up to the market expectation  The company has been living on its commitment in providing convenient solutions for customers on the go 
Will the fast food juggernaut end the year in the offensive ground 
Stock MovementIn the previous close of the market  McDonalds opened in 123 30 and settled at 123 29  advancing 0 74 percent  The stock had a session high of 123 29 and a session low of 123 56  the highest range for the fourth quarter 
McDonalds traded above its 20 day SMA of 122 87 and its 50 day SMA of 122 02  The resistance was found at 123 84 and support at 121 35  Apparently  the stock was away from its support level  indicating a bullish outlook for the next session 
The stock started at 115 000 level in the last quarter of the year  and now that we re two week away from the end  the stock was soaring at 123 000 levels  It seems McDonalds has properly implemented its strategic plan to sustain the investors  interest 
 will release its fourth quarter earnings report on January 23  2017 and will be followed by a conference call webcast  Currently the market capitalization of the stock is  101 94 billion  with a price earnings ratio of 23 03 and dividend yield of 3 05 percent  The stock s 52 week high was  4 45 percent  while its 52 week low was at 12 71 percent 
Steve Easterbrook stated during the third quarter earnings results that  Looking ahead  we are focused on growing global comparable sales and serving more customers while being mindful of the near term challenges in several markets  We remain committed to driving long term  profitable results while pursuing our goal of being recognized by our customers as a modern  progressive burger company   These pledges would be highlighted next month 
Global Services and OutletsAs part of the franchising commitment of the company  McDonalds would keep its business in the mainland China  The second largest economy in the world  recently confirmed that it would still be part of the US fast food chain s menu  McDonalds has around 2 400 outlets in China an about to add 250 on an annual basis 
McDonalds has been mastering the local taste that would fit better for the Chinese consumers  Although the competition among other fast food chains is evidently tight and the Chinese market lives by its own rules  the company has shown a steadiness in conquering the headwinds 
Mr  Easterbrook initially wanted to widen the company s franchising activity  The company follows its three legged stool for its success  the collaboration and synergy of its employees  suppliers and franchises  Approximately  more than 80 percent of the company s restaurants are owned by franchisees globally 
Meanwhile  the company has announced its plan to launch its very own delivery service in Florida through its partnership with UberEats  Around 200 restaurants in Orlando  Tampa and Miami will get to experience home delivery service starting January 2017 
Providing accessibility to its customers has been the main mantra of UberEats  This application lets everyone choose their orders and have them delivered at the front door  McDonalds may have seen this as an opportunity to go with the trend and to increase sales 
According to reports  McDonalds is gearing up for the release of its own mobile up in the beginning of 2017  In the meantime  it would likely use another party in catering the delivery concerns of its customers 
Taking into consideration the upcoming plans and partnership of the fast food giant plus its stock movement  McDonalds will likely end the year with significant growth  As long as the strategies of the stock remain  the direction will be smooth for the stock  Adding to this  the consumer spending rallies during holiday seasons and all the sectors of the market benefit from this hype  Investors may just continue to love McDonalds ",2016-12-19,FSM News,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mcdonald’s-strategic-direction-200170132,200170132

196292,417808,MCD,Can McDonald s  MCD  Stay On Its Post Earnings Hot Streak ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for McDonald s NYSE MCD   Shares have added about 5  in the past month  easily outperforming broad markets in that time frame 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to their next earnings release  or is the stock due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers 
Recent Earnings  McDonald s Tops Q3 Earnings on Solid Comps GrowthMcDonald s posted robust results in the third quarter of 2016  wherein both the bottom line and the top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate Earnings and Revenue DiscussionEarnings per share  EPS  of  1 62 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 48 by 9 5  and improved 15 7  from the year ago quarter  The upside can be attributed to the turnaround plan announced by CEO Steve Easterbrook in May 2015 Meanwhile  foreign currency translation had a negative impact of  0 03 per share on earnings in the quarter  Notably  at constant currency  earnings grew 17  year over year Revenues of  6 42 billion fell 3  year over year mainly due to the impact of refranchising and currency headwinds  At constant currency  the figure declined 1   Revenues  however  surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 29 billion by 2 1  Behind the Headlines NumbersIn the quarter  revenues at company operated restaurants declined 7 3  to  3 97 billion  Revenues at franchise operated restaurants  however  grew 5 1  to  2 45 billion Global comps grew 3 5   supported by positive comps across all the segments  marking the fifth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales  Moreover  comps compared favorably with last quarter s increase of 3 1  Key Segment DetailsU S   Comps grew 1 3  in the third quarter  reflecting the success of the All Day Breakfast platform launched in 2015 and the popularity of the company s national value platform   McPick 2  The introduction of Chicken McNuggets with no artificial preservatives also boosted the segment s performance  However  comps growth was less than the prior quarter improvement of 1 8  due to softening industry growth Segment operating income jumped 8   mainly driven by improved restaurant profitability and higher gains from refranchising Going forward  the company will remain focused on expanding its All Day Breakfast menu  the quality of food and on enhancing guest experience International Lead Markets  Comps at the International Lead Markets segment grew 3 3   driven by strong performance in the U K  and upbeat results in Australia  Canada and Germany  The upside reflects multiple menu  service and value initiatives across most of the markets  which led to positive consumer response  Moreover  comps were better than an increase of 2 6  recorded last quarter Operating income was up 2   including the impact of foreign exchange headwinds  At constant currency  the figure was up 5  on the back of sales driven improvements in franchised margin dollars across most markets High Growth Markets  Comps grew 1 5  in High Growth Markets  as positive performance in almost all markets was partially offset by negative comparable sales in China due in part to temporary protests concerning events surrounding the South China Sea and strong prior year comparisons  Notably  comps had witnessed growth of 1 6  last quarter The segment s operating income rose 8   10  in constant currencies  fueled by improved restaurant profitability in China  which benefited from the recent VAT reform  
How have estimates been moving since then 
It turns out  fresh estimates flatlined during the month following earnings  at least when looking at the current quarter  MCD s prospects for the full year are brighter  as the consensus estimate here has been on the rise over the past month and analysts are now expecting EPS growth close to 15  year over year 
Arguably  the long term turnaround in the fortunes of McDonald s shareholders is continuing  as evidenced by the chart below 
 MCDONALDS CORP Price and Consensus    
VGM Scores
At this time  McDonald s stock has a nice Growth score of  B   though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a  D   Charting a somewhat similar path  the stock was allocated a grade of  C  on the value side  putting it in the third quintile for this investment strategy Overall though  the company is just average from a fundamental look  as its VGM score comes in at  C   putting it into the middle 20  of all companies we study  
Outlook
Thanks to the positive longer term trends in estimates for MCD  shares of the stock have a Zacks Rank   2  buy   This means that we are expecting the run in MCD to continue  and we are looking for more outperformance in the weeks ahead too

196299,417815,MCD,Vinyl Found In Nuggets At A Japanese McDonald s ,news,"By   

Japan s McDonald s  NYSE MCD  restaurants are facing another food crisis after a customer in Aomori found vinyl in their McNuggets  according to a spokesperson from the company on Monday  Japan s McDonald s already rely on sourcing its nuggets from Thailand  away from Chinese suppliers of meat products  after they were shut down for failing food safety checks 
The McDonald s spokesperson said the contaminated nuggets were recalled back to its Tokyo headquarters for investigation  according to the Wall Street Journal  The incident received widespread media attention on Monday after Japan s national broadcaster NHK and national paper Yomiuri reported it  according to the India Times 
When Chinese supplier Shanghai Husi Food Co  was reported to be selling expired meat to McDonald s chains in July 2014  Japan s McDonald s  which sourced its meat from both China and Thailand at the time  stopped importing from China because of consumers  distrust  Japan s McDonald s has since depended on chicken from three suppliers in Thailand  McDonald s China announced that it will still continue using the same supplier for its Chinese branches 
Just last month  McDonald s Japan experienced a shortage in its shipments of frozen French fries after imports from the United States were delayed because of labor disputes at shipping ports along the United States  West coast  McDonald s had to temporarily stop sales of medium and large size portions of its French fries across Japan  but resumed the sales of all sizes of fries on Monday

196301,417817,MCD,Clinton Gets Past FBI Investigation  ETFs In Focus,opinion,"Putting all speculation to rest  the FBI absolved Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton right ahead of the election  stating that her usage of private e mail servers did not amount to misconduct  The issue hit Clinton s popularity lately and pushed Republican candidate Donald Trump a step forward  tightening the race to the White House 
However  FBI s clean sheet turned in favor of Clinton again with poll tallies of 45 3  to 43  for Trump  as per the national polling average published on   Meanwhile  most of Clinton friendly investments gained  if we rule out the general election induced phobia and uncertainty 
Last week s U S  Jobs data came in favor of the Democrats  as well  October job growth of 161K  fell short of analysts  expectation of  and September s upwardly revised addition of   but a 4 9  unemployment rate was the  for the month before a presidential election  Wage growth of 0 4   2 8  year over year  was also there to accompany the optimistic job report 
Below we highlight a few investing areas that should be closely watched the day before the election  read    
U S  Stocks 
If Clinton wins  the S P 500 will likely snap its nine day losing stretch and stage a relief rally  But along with many analysts  we also believe that Clinton s win is largely priced in investors  sentiment and so there will be limited upside in the market   believes that the S P 500 Index will likely see a 3  gain  This puts SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY    AX SPY   in focus 
Mexican Peso
The Mexican peso popped about 2 2    the most in about    as the FBI confirmed that Clinton s act was not a crime  Mexico peso is a Trump unfriendly investment due to his plans of building a wall along the border as part of his immigration strategy and making Mexico pay for it  Thus  higher chances of Clinton winning should push iShares MSCI Mexico Capped  higher 
Bullion 
Though SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD    V GLD   added about 0 07  gains on November 4 on safe haven demand  Clinton s win may put pressure on this investment as greenback should rise and stocks should be in the positive territory  Both conditions normally go against bullion 
Healthcare 
Hillary Clinton s tweet on concerns over aggressive price increases on life saving drugs has gained a lot of attention  Since then  her constant moves against price gouging in the healthcare sector has kept this issue in her scope  Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLV   will thus be closely watched  read    
Infrastructure 
Clinton intends to boost infrastructure spending giving an edge to utility ETFs like PowerShares S P SmallCap Utilities Portfolio   And if continued uncertainty keeps bond yields at check  it would be an added advantage  read    
Defense 
Clinton has always been seen as a supporter of     Moreover  since defense and aerospace stocks gained considerably in the democratic rule even in the days of sequestration  the future of this sector looks bright  So  defense and aerospace ETFs including iShares US Aerospace   Defense   HN ITA   should get a lift 
Consumer
Clinton seeks to hike the minimum wage from  7 25 to roughly  per hour  This will hit several consumer discretionary ETFs  The restaurant sector is a great example  as it employs many such lower income workers  On the wage hike issue  the ex CEO of McDonalds   NYSE MCD    Ed Rensi  said that it would be a better option to purchase a  for  35K than paying an incompetent employee  15 an hour 
As a result  Restaurant ETF   will likely be hurt by the implementation of minimum wage  While consumer staples ETFs like Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF  appear to be benefitting from this government move  one should note that restaurateurs bearing the brunt of higher minimum wages will eventually pass on this hike to increased menu prices and will turn more tech savvy  All in all  consumer staples ETFs may not gain as much as they should 
Banks 
Clinton seeks to restrain extreme risk taking tendencies among big financial institutions and curb risks lying underneath the shadow banking system  She is in favor of levying a tax only on high frequency traders who terminate   These might hurt banking stocks and ETFs like PowerShares KBW Bank ETF

196315,417831,MCD,Weary of the market rollercoaster  investors turn again to steady stocks,news,"By Francesco Canepa LONDON  Reuters    The big story of recent stock market investment has been volatility  and the opportunities that sharp price swings can bring for those with strong nerves 
But good news is emerging now for those who prefer safer strategies  some of the best returns this year have come from stable stocks like billionaire Warren Buffett s holding company Berkshire Hathaway  N BRKa  or Swiss toilet maker Geberit  VX GEBN  
A basket of the two least volatile stocks in each STOXX Europe 600  STOXX  sector index  as compiled by Thomson Reuters  up 8 percent year to date  or almost twice as much as the STOXX Europe 600 overall   Here volatility is defined by the size of price moves in either direction  
Though that high performance might seem odd   particularly looking at double digit returns yielded by other European stocks that see sawed at the prospect of a U S  interest rate hike recently   in fact it demonstrates that low volatility stocks are often stronger companies with healthier earnings power 
That distinction really matters when European companies  earnings recovery is still vulnerable   and it s one that more people are waking up to 
 Investors are ready to invest on the equity market but under the condition that they are not too exposed to risk and that s one argument for investing in the least volatile stocks   said Laurent Lagarde  head of quant equity management at investment firm THEAM  a unit of BNP Paribas 
    The Reuters basket included traditionally defensive stocks like drugmaker Novartis  up 29 percent  but also benefited from similar gains by cyclical companies   those whose profits and share prices track the pace of the economy  Among those weGivaudandan  VX GIVN   the world s biggest maker of flavours and fragrances  or media groReed Elsevierier  L REL  
Stocks from Switzerland   home to reliable earners such as Geberit   accounted for 13 out of 38 components 
The strategy also worked globally  BNP Paribas  World Low volatility strategy returned 15 percent in the first 10 months of the year  helped by a rally of nearly 20 percent in the shares of Berkshire Hathaway  among others 
    A Lipper basket of 53 exchange traded funds which tracked stocks with low volatility returned 8 percent year to date  That compares to a 6 percent return for the MSCI World Index  Datastream data showed 
And the trend continues to pick up steam  As last month s volatility gripped financial markets  assets under management at low volatility stock funds attracted net inflows of over  1 billion even as other stock funds lost money  Markit data shows 
This reflects investors  weariness with jumpy markets  After a rollercoaster October more jitters are expected as the United States shuts off the flow of cheap money that has been buoying its banks and businesses  and economies from the euro zone to China struggle to grow 
Fund manager Ossiam s head of business development Isabelle Bourcier said interest in its low volatility ETFs had grown 
 Expectations from clients that there will be volatility is helping us   she said 

Assets in low volatility ETFs have grown to  16 billion currently from  15 million when the financial crisis hit in 2008  Markit data showed

196326,417842,MCD,Russia keeps up pressure on McDonald s with new sanitary inspections,news,"By Vladimir Soldatkin
MOSCOW  Reuters    Russian authorities extended their scrutiny of McDonald s  N MCD  to several regions on Friday  carrying out inspections at a number of restaurants run by the U S  fast food chain  amid a standoff with the West over Ukraine 
The inspections are viewed by many businessmen as retaliation for Western sanctions against Russia because of its support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine  and they fear the retribution could spread to other symbols of Western capitalism 
A spokeswoman for the country s food safety agency  Rospotrebnadzor  said the inspections were not related to the standoff 
 The checks are not politically motivated   she said 
The agency also said it had no plans to close down the company s business in the Republic of Tatarstan  two days after the agency shut three McDonald s branches in Moscow  Checks in Tatarstan were announced on Thursday 
An agency spokeswoman in Tatarstan s largest city  Kazan  said checks were under way at McDonald s  which has 17 restaurants in the region   one of the highest concentrations in Russia outside Moscow and St Petersburg 
 We are making checks there  There are some irregularities and we are likely to punish them  but we will not close down their restaurants   she said 
The regulators had earlier extended the checks outside of Moscow  including in Central Russia and the Urals 
Local press also reported that it plans to begin inspections in the North West Leningrad region on Aug  25  A regional official declined to comment 
McDonald s operates 440 restaurants in Russia and considers the country one of its top seven markets outside the United States and Canada  according to its 2013 annual report  Almost 1 million people a day use its restaurants in Russia 
In Tatarstan  some 1 500 people work for the fast food chain 

A McDonald s Russia spokeswoman said earlier this week the company was aware of the situation and  was open  to any checks

196327,417843,MCD,McDonald s replaces U S  chief for the second time in two years,news,"By Lisa Baertlein
 Reuters    McDonald s Corp is replacing its U S  president for the second time in two years  a move that suggests increased pressure on Chief Executive Don Thompson to improve sales in the fast food chain s home market 
The company on Friday named former McDonald s executive Mike Andres as president of McDonald s USA  replacing Jeff Stratton  who had been in the job since December 2012  McDonald s said Stratton  58  is retiring 
Since last November  the world s biggest fast food chain by revenue has suffered flat or declining monthly sales at its established U S  stores  Among other things  analysts blame bloated menus for slower service  and said pressure has intensified from resurgent rivals such as Wendy s Co and Burger King Worldwide Inc 
 It s hard to argue that this type of turnover doesn t put more scrutiny on a CEO   Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said of the U S  management change 
 If results stay weak despite turnover in these executive roles  then ultimately it s the responsibility of the CEO  
Thompson  who became president and CEO in July 2012  has presided over a period of disappointing results from the U S  region due in part to internal missteps  brutal competition and cautious spending by the lower income consumers that frequent the chain 
In selecting Andres  who currently is the CEO of Nashville based Logan s Roadhouse  McDonald s took the  rare  step of choosing an outside executive to lead the U S  business  said Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Howard Penney  Stratton was McDonald s chief restaurant officer prior to being named president of the U S  division 
 They re desperate   said Penney  who is among Wall Street s most bearish restaurant analysts 
Still  Penney said Thompson likely has until the end of 2015 to show improvement in the business because some issues are seen by investors to be beyond his control  such as the U S  economy and Russia  which shut some of McDonald s branches in Moscow this week 
The Moscow closures were widely viewed as retaliation for Western sanctions against Russia
Franchisees  investors and analysts have urged McDonald s to simplify its menus to better compete with the likes of In N Out Burger and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc 
Thompson has promised to get back to basics at McDonald s USA  At the same time  he is introducing new kitchen equipment that will allow diners to customize their hamburgers and sandwiches  a strategy that has fallen flat with critics 
Andres  56  will take over on Oct  15  He rejoins McDonald s after serving as chairman and CEO of Logan s Roadhouse  a chain with 261 full service restaurants in 23 states  He also will oversee McDonald s Canada business 
Andres started his career at the Golden Arches as manager of his family owned McDonald s in northern California  During his 30 years he was president and CEO of Boston Market  then a McDonald s subsidiary  and president of McDonald s central U S  division  the company said 

Shares in McDonald s edged down 10 cents  or 0 1 percent  to  94 43 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange

196334,417850,MCD,McDonald s casts doubt on sales outlook after China food scare,news,"By Lisa Baertlein and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Reuters    McDonald s Corp  N MCD  said on Friday that its global sales forecast for 2014 was at risk after a China food scandal drove away diners and forced the chain to scramble to find new suppliers of ingredients for Chicken McNuggets and Big Macs 
The warning could portend the company s first full year of global sales declines at established restaurants since 2002  Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a client note 
McDonald s global same restaurant sales dropped a steeper than expected 2 5 percent in July  which Kalinowski said was the company s worst monthly performance in a decade 
The trouble in China hit as the world s biggest hamburger chain was already scrambling to bolster its U S  business  where monthly sales at established restaurants have been down or flat since November 
But investors were braced for bad news  and McDonald s shares were down just 0 1 percent at  93 19 in morning trading 
McDonald s on Monday warned that sales in markets including China and Japan were experiencing a  significant negative impact  following a local Chinese TV report on July 20 that showed workers at a supplier using expired meat and doctoring food production dates 
 As a result of the China supplier issue  the company s global comparable sales forecast for 2014 is now at risk   McDonald s said in a statement on Friday 
Last month  executives said they expected full year worldwide sales at restaurants open at least 13 months to be  relatively flat  due to increased competition  pricing and other cost pressures 
McDonald s said same restaurant sales in Asia Pacific  Middle East and Africa  APMEA   which includes China and Japan  fell 7 3 percent in July 
McDonald s had 35 683 restaurants in 119 countries around the world on June 30  Roughly 2 000 of those were in China  and about another 3 100 were in Japan 
The company did not quantify the magnitude of the sales impact in China  where sales had just recovered from the double whammy of a separate food safety scandal and bird flu outbreak that crushed business there last year 
McDonald s Holdings Co Ltd  T 2702   the long struggling Japan unit  on July 29 withdrew its full year earnings forecast after the China meat scare caused sales to drop 15 percent to 20 percent on a daily basis 
U S  same restaurant sales fell 3 2 percent in July  more than the 2 6 percent decline expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix 
McDonald s has been losing ground in its home market  hurt by tough competition from Wendy s Co  O WEN  and Burger King Worldwide Inc  N BKW   sluggish job and wage growth  and consumer s diminishing appetite for processed food

196335,417851,MCD,Russian Food Ban Woes  Eat A Happy Meal,news,"By    MOSCOW    In a shiny food store in southern Moscow on Sunday  a young clerk emptied cartons of donut shaped peaches from Spain into a display  pieces of fruit bouncing on the floor as he made an ever higher mound  To the side was a smaller mountain of nectarines  also from Spain 
The store is just one of thousands of supermarkets in Russian cities and suburbs with reams of fresh vegetables and fruits  deli counters with cheese wheels and sausages  and freezer cases full of prepared meals  much of it from Europe  Smaller stores are also filled to the brim  
So far in food stores  the effects of Russia s ban on virtually all prepared and fresh foods from the European Union  Norway and the United States    as well as Canada and Australia    haven t yet materialized  European fruits are still piled high  Packaged goods will remain on shelves or in refrigerators for months to come 
But those scenes of plenty may change soon  With Russia s sweeping import ban  Europe s farmers  dairy producers and fishermen are going to find themselves shut out of the huge Russian market  Europe s largest by population 
Farmers and seafood providers  especially in Europe  have been scrambling to find new buyers for hundreds of tons of food that had been destined for Russia until late last week 
That s when the Russian government imposed its one year ban on meat  dairy products  produce and fish from the targeted countries  a response to the latest economic sanctions against Russia by the US and EU 
The food ban  signed by President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday and enacted on Thursday  derails more than  8 billion in exports 
Retailers  importers and producers have had scant time to react  The day the ban took effect  representatives of major Russian food store chains met with government officials and asked them what to do with goods already in transit   The answer was   Turn them around    Russian newspaper Vedomosti reported 
The foods falling under the ban accounted for about 8 percent of Russia s total food supply last year  said Valery Mironov  deputy director of the Center of Development Institute at Moscow s Higher School of Economics  According to the institute s calculations  the banned items amounted to  8 3 billion in 2013 sales 
The actual number might be even higher  Citing Russian customs data  the Wall Street Journal said the banned foods totaled close to  9 billion in 2013  out of about  43 billion of imported food  
Most of the affected imports came from Europe  The United States accounted for just about  440 million in 2013  the Journal reported 
Moscow is already making overtures to Brazil  as well as Argentina and Paraguay  to find new exporters  Russia s food inspection agency  one of the departments handling the ban along with the Federal Customs Service  is heading some of those replacement efforts  Inspection agency director Sergei Dankvert has held phone negotiations with Argentina s ambassador to Russia  and Argentinian and Russian officials will meet in Moscow in the next two weeks  said inspection agency spokeswoman Yuliya Trofimova 
On Tuesday  Dankvert was in Belarus  where he planned to meet with officials to obtain more exports from that former Soviet republic  Trofimova said  Officials in Belarus  a member of a Russian led free trade zone with Kazakhstan and a staunch political backer of Putin s  already have offered their farm products to help Russia fill the gap 
The eastern part of another ex Soviet state  Ukraine  is a breadbasket that already feeds the entire country  But Ukraine and Russia are at loggerheads over the issue of Russian backed separatists  with swaths of Eastern Ukraine under siege as government troops try to end rebel control  And using Ukraine s agricultural products  would entail other giant hurdles  Ukraine already is facing its own Russian food ban on its dairy products  Meanwhile  the Kievgovernment is preparing its own sanctions against Russia  raising the prospect of more retaliatory trade moves from the Kremlin 
Unlike individual governments  major international food companies are largely insulated from the embargo  That s partly because the measure doesn t touch the import of chocolate  coffee beans  tea leaves or alcohol  according to Trofimova 
Those conpanies are also protected by their substantial investment into Russia during the past two decades  when many of them built their own factories and began to source ingredients locally    thereby avoiding the new ban on imported foods 
Mondelez International Inc  NASDAQ MDLZ  the maker of Milka chocolate and Jacobs Monarch instant coffee  is one such company that has built up manufacturing here  Mondelez has 3 200 employees and five factories in the Russian Federation  and in April announced plans to spend  110 million on a new plant in Western Siberia  with construction to finish by the end of 2015 
Sales in Russia made up  1 2 billion out of  35 3 billion net revenue for Mondelez in 2013  spokesman Michael Mitchell said  He said  almost all  of the company s Russian products are made domestically 
Anglo Dutch company Unilever plc LON ULVR  which sells Lipton teas and Inmarko ice cream in Russia  can manufacture almost all of its items here  using factories in European Russia and Siberia  said Unilever spokeswoman Keti Tavdishvili 
The Russian division of Swiss chocolate and coffee powerhouse Nestle SA VTX NESN said more than 90 percent of what it sells is made in country  Exports from Switzerland would be exempt from the ban  in any case  since the country isn t an EU member 
Fast food giant McDonald s NYSE MCD  which operates more than 400 restaurants throughout the country  gets 85 percent of its menu items from domestic suppliers  it said in a statement 

Even with Russian suppliers and factories  however  replacing 15 percent of the product chain overnight is a Herculean task  In addition  McDonald s efforts come on top of legal challenges from the Russian food inspection agency and consumer protection agency over the nutritional value of the chain s burgers and ice cream and the safety of its salads and cheese  A McDonald s Russia spokeswoman declined to comment on how the food ban might affect the government inquiries 
Traditional cafes and restaurants have seen their menus hit by the embargo  as well   Restaurants of course aren t thrilled  because in general the Russian market already has gone through more than one ban on various products for various reasons   said Anna Kukulina  an editor at Russian magazine Simple Wine News  Wines from Georgia  for example  were blacklisted after the short Russo Georgian war of 2008 
 The detailed list of food items falling under the  ban  appeared only on Thursday  and even the suppliers haven t figured it out entirely   Kukulina said   It is impossible to give specific prognoses in percentages and rubles just yet  There are too many factors that still haven t been studied and accounted for   she said 
Yet the vast majority of Russians probably won t see radical changes at their neighborhood grocery stores  That s because most of the country s 143 million people live in underdeveloped or rural areas  where Western food isn t really a part of everyday life 
In Moscow and St  Petersburg  the two largest cities  roughly 40 percent of the food is imported  but for Russia as a whole  that figure is under 20 percent  Mironov said  Those numbers include imports from all countries  he noted 
One other international relationship being strained by the food ban is Russia s role in the World Trade Organization  which it entered less than two years ago after a nearly 20 year process to join  Under WTO principles  member nations must avoid discriminating between trading partners or between foreign and domestic products 
After the last EU and U S  sanctions  Russia s WTO representative  Gennady Ovechko  said the measures violated WTO rules  Now the nations targeted by the food embargo could turn to the trade group to press a case against Russia 
The array of business affected is easy to see in the Perekrestok supermarket in southern Moscow  In two aisles of refrigerated packaged cheeses  only about a quarter of the cheeses are produced in Russia  either by Russian companies or foreign brands 
Cheeses not made in Russia included Arla s feta cheese produced in Denmark  Svalya s sliced Edam made in Latvia  Valio s Viola spread from Finland 
Finnish based Valio is one of the European companies hardest hit by the embargo  It has been making almost all of its products in Finland and then shipping them over the border  Last year  Russia generated nearly 20 percent of sales for the company  Valio stopped the production of all of its Russia bound products last week 
In a Monday statement  Valio said its subsidiary in Russia  which employs about 500 people   has begun preparations for the gradual run down of operations as the current inventory becomes exhausted and sales end  ",2014-08-13,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/russian-food-ban-woes -eat-a-happy-meal-303198,303198

Based in Maryville  TN  Ruby Tuesday Inc  together with its subsidiaries engages in the ownership  development  operation  and franchise of casual dining restaurants in both the United States and internationally 
Chairman  President  and CEO JJ Buettgan commented   Our fourth quarter was impacted by softness in the casual dining industry and increased promotional activity by our peers  Given that we expect the macro environment to remain challenging for some time  we are taking the necessary steps to change the trajectory of our business  
The company posted adjusted net earnings of  0 10 per share and revenue of  279 3 million  These missed street expectations by  0 01 and  5 68 million respectively  Ruby also saw a 3 7  decrease in same restaurant sales during Q4  down further from the 1 7  decrease a year before 
As per the official statement  the fourth quarter same restaurant sales decrease was  driven in part by traffic declines resulting from a challenging and competitive external environment   Year over year guest counts fell 4 6  while average check rose 0 9  
During fiscal year 2016  the company closed 12 corporate owned Ruby Tuesday restaurants and 17 corporate owned Lime Fresh Mexican Grill restaurants  However  it also opened one corporate owned location domestically and one franchised location internationally 
The company plans to create long term value for shareholders through its  Fresh Start  initiative  which seeks to improve the menu and create new amenities  Ruby Tuesday plans to close another 95 corporate owned locations in fiscal year 2017  along with another 5 10 as leases expire 
It provided a full year net income guidance of  0 05 to  0 09 per share  although this does not include the tax costs associated with the aforementioned closures 
Ruby Tuesday is the latest restaurant to announce decreased sales  with McDonald s   NYSE MCD   and Wendy s   NASDAQ WEN   posting lower year over year sales numbers  If Ruby s new initiatives can t spark sales growth  the company could be in serious trouble moving forward

196342,417858,MCD,Fast Food Workers Celebrate McDonald s Ruling ,news,"By    After months of protests from fast food workers around the United States  the world s largest hamburger chain may soon face investigations about its labor practices  which may set the groundwork for worker unions 
 The National Labor Relations Board Office of the General Counsel have investigated charges alleging McDonald s  NYSE MCD  franchisees and their franchisor  McDonald s USA  LLC  violated the rights of employees as a result of activities surrounding employee protests   the agency announced on Tuesday 
It said that McDonald s could soon face investigation  given its designation as a joint employer in cases where workers at franchise locations filed complaints  This has never happened before  and the company said it will challenge the ruling 

 This is such a radical departure that it should be a concern to businessmen and  women across the country   said Heather Smedstad  senior vice president of human resources for McDonald s USA  to the Associated Press 
Labor groups celebrated the news  The Service Employees International Union  SEIU  called the ruling a  huge  victory 
One of the suits claims that workers in three different states had to wait before clocking in to satisfy the company software that monitors the ratio of labor costs as a percentage of sales 
Since November 2012  the National Labor Relations Board Office has seen 181 cases involving McDonald s  Of those  just 43 have been found to have merit  with another 64 pending investigation 
That year was the beginning of a series of high profile fast food worker strikes  in which employees called for better wages at McDonald s and other chains 
 Employers like McDonald s seek to avoid recognizing the rights of their employees by claiming that they are not really their employer  despite exercising control over crucial aspects of the employment relationship   Julius Getman  University of Texas labor law professor  said to the New York Times ",2014-07-30,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fast-food-workers-celebrate-mcdonald’s-ruling-299204,299204
196343,417859,MCD,Plaintiffs Awarded  27M In McDonald s Texas Outlet Case,news,"By    McDonald s Corporation NYSE MCD  which was sued by the families of two teenagers who claimed that inadequate security arrangements at one of its Texas outlets led to their deaths  was asked by a jury on Wednesday to pay  27 million to the plaintiffs 
The College Station outlet in question was reportedly the scene of several fighting incidents  and the Illinois based fast food giant was sued in February 2012 by the parents of the teenagers  who claimed that the company s outlet did not provide protection to its customers at the location  Bloomberg reported  Denton James Ward  18  was beaten to death by a mob at the fast food outlet while his girlfriend  Lauren Bailey Crisp  19  died in a traffic accident as she attempted to transport Ward to a hospital 
The Texas state court s jury awarded the Ward family  16 million while the Crisp family was given  11 million  McDonald s spokesperson Terri Hickey said that the company will appeal the jury s verdict 
 We respectfully disagree with the jury s verdict   Hickey said  according to Bloomberg  arguing that the award to the Crisp family could be contested as the 19 year old Crisp was killed in an accident after she jumped a red light while taking Ward to the hospital 
The outlet where the teenagers were sitting had reportedly been the scene of several fights and authorities had responded to more than 200 calls of distress from the location over the past three years 
 This was a dangerous location  and McDonald s knew it   Chris Hamilton  an attorney for the Crisp and Ward families  said  according to Bloomberg  adding   Yet they did nothing to prevent their senseless deaths  

 The verdict should stand up on appeal   Hamilton said  adding that the families had never asked for punitive charges 
The verdict is the second legal setback for the company in two days  On Tuesday  the National Labor Relations Board had ruled that McDonald s could be held accountable for labor and wage violations committed by franchise operators ",2014-07-31,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/plaintiffs-awarded-$27m-in-mcdonald's-texas-outlet-case-299491,299491
196344,417860,MCD,McDonald s CEO Thompson  under siege  at home and abroad ,news,"By Lisa Baertlein   Reuters    McDonald s Corp CEO Don Thompson sure could use a break   The head of the world s biggest restaurant chain  who for much of his two years at the helm has been battling to spark sales growth in the United States and Europe  got battered by headline grabbing bad news in late July   In the final days of the month  its China business was hit with a food safety scare involving a key supplier  the chain got ensnared in the West s sanctions standoff with Russia  burger flippers at U S  restaurants claimed an incremental win from the National Labor Relations Board in their fight to hold McDonald s responsible for the actions of franchisees  and  a Texas jury slapped the company with a  27 million verdict  Add to all that its results showed second quarter profit dropped more than expected    They re under siege on three continents   said Howard Penney  restaurant analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management  an investment research firm   To be sure  the company s famous name and the ubiquity of its restaurants worldwide help to fuel the media storm  said Penney   McDonald s is a pawn in many instances around the world  It s an easy target     Such upheavals are not uncommon for McDonald s and other global power houses  including Coca Cola Co and Wal Mart Stores Inc  experts said  though perhaps not quite so many in such a short period    In a statement a McDonald s spokeswoman said   In the last few weeks  we ve seen issues in various parts of the world which directly or indirectly affect our brand and others  We have 35 000 McDonald s restaurants in 120 countries  and skilled professional communications teams in every area of the world    She said that dealing with a 24 7 news cycle around the world is par for the course  and the communications teams address such issues so that the company can keep its focus on serving customers   Thompson was not made available for comment    DEFAULT BRAND   Analysts and investors said the latest  largely external events appear to pose manageable risk to McDonald s profits  but they are a headache at a time when the company is grappling with intense competition  shifting consumer tastes and service slow downs stemming from the menu additions of everything from salads and wraps to lattes and smoothies aimed at broadening its audience and boosting sales   Branding expert Robert Passikoff  said McDonald s needs to find a way to stand out from the crowd    McDonald s has reached the point where it s become a default brand  It s there  That s it   said Passikoff  president of Brand Keys   Shares in McDonald s are up less than 7 percent since Thompson took the helm on July 1  2012  lagging the S P 500 s gain of nearly 42 percent in that period    Investors  analysts and franchisees are clamoring for the company to stop trying to be  all things to all people   They want it to simplify its unwieldy menu and point to the success of rivals like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and In N Out Burger  which have won passionate fans by selling just a few items   McDonald s was caught up in the latest China food safety scare after a July 20 television expose showed workers allegedly mishandling meat at Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd  a factory owned by OSI Group LLC  a major supplier to the chain    When the story broke  McDonald s China business had been rebounding from the double whammy of a food safety scare and a bird flu outbreak that crushed sales in 2013    McDonald s roughly 2 000 restaurants in China suffered meat shortages after it ended its relationship with OSI China  Executives from the chain s long struggling Japanese unit  McDonald s Holdings Co Ltd  who were forced to find alternate chicken McNugget supplies  said the scare sent sales down as much as 20 percent    RUSSIA CONCERN  Seattle based portfolio manager Bill Smead  whose firm Smead Capital Management holds nearly 516 000 shares in McDonald s  took news of the China food scandal in stride    We assume that something is going to go amazingly haywire with companies in China   said Smead  who added that he has ceased adding to McDonald s holdings while the company works through its  tribulation  period    About 15 percent of McDonald s operating profit comes from the Asia Pacific  Middle East and Africa unit that includes China and Japan  said Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore   The bigger concern  she said  are McDonald s troubles in Russia  where the company has about 400 restaurants    Against the backdrop of the political tussle over U S  sanctions imposed on Russia because of Moscow s intervention in Ukraine  Russia s chief sanitary inspector Anna Popova on July 25 accused the company of violations  which put the product quality and safety of the entire McDonald s chain in doubt    Europe contributes about 35 percent of McDonald s operating profit  The company does not break out country specific contributions  but Russia  up until recently had been one of the stronger markets for them in Europe   Senatore said   Meanwhile at home  the troubles also piled on    McDonald s workers  union backed fight for better wages and working conditions scored points when the general counsel for the U S  National Labor Relations Board said in a letter made public on July 29 that McDonald s  not just its franchisees  can be held liable in complaints that the company violated employee rights   David Hess  associate professor of business law at the University of Michigan s Ross School of Business  said the NLRB attorney s finding is just an early step in what is usually a long process   As for the  27 million jury verdict awarded to family members of two teenagers who died following a beating in a McDonald s restaurant in Texas  legal experts said that is expected to fail on appeal   
McDonald s executives have promised to boost sales over the next 12 to 18 months by doing things like focusing on value  digital advertising and the quality of its food    As for Thompson  Penney predicted that he will survive the current crises and gets more time to fix the longer term problems  at least into 2015   I don t think he s going anywhere  It s too soon   he said       Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles  Editing by Jilian Mincer and Martin Howell ",2014-08-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mcdonald's-ceo-thompson-'under-siege'-at-home-and-abroad-300343,300343
196345,417861,MCD,Forget Growth  Buy McDonald s  MCD  Stock For The Dividend,opinion,"It s been just over a week since McDonald s   NYSE MCD     and the results were disappointing   The company missed revenues expectations across the board  and global comparable sales increased by a meek 3 1    Total sales were down by over  230 million compared to the same quarter last year  and McDonald s ability to hold onto its market share in the fast food space has come under increased scrutiny  
The company has attempted to bolster sales growth by having an expanded all day breakfast menu and introducing its  Pick 2 for  5  promotion  but these methods have been scrutinized for leading to hampered sales growth since many  at McDonald s restaurants   Peers in the fast food space growing more competitive  and they are resorting to fighting for consumer dollars through many creative ways   While all this is happening  McDonald s is struggling to hold onto its strong footing in the industry  
There is still a bright spot for investors though   McDonald s is still McDonald s  and this company is not about to blink out of existence anytime soon   That being said  MCD stock looks pretty attractive from an income standpoint   The company has been growing its dividend payout per share every year for decades  and it should have the ability to grow its dividend significantly in the years to come since it consistently produces a high level of free cash flows   McDonald s is currently paying a quarterly  0 89 dividend  and this amounts to  3 56 given to investors every year for each share they own   At the current share price  this amounts to a yield of about 3 03  
If you bought shares in early August of 2010  you would currently be collecting an annual dividend yield of about 5   and since that year  the annual cash payout has grown by 52 2    Now  McDonald s performance has contracted relative to 2013 revenue numbers  but they are still churning out a high level of sales  and it is reasonable to assume that they will continue to do so for a long time  
The fourth quarterly payout of  0 89 is scheduled to be paid on the 16th of September   After this  the company should raise its quarterly dividend once again if it follows through with its decades old practice of raising its payout annually   When this happens  the yield per share will increase relative to the stock s current share price 
Bottom Line
MCD shares could stand to lose some weight over the short term  but the stock definitely makes for an intriguing income play if you re set on holding onto this over the long run   The company is looking to make some sort of turnaround with regards to    Hopefully this will translate into better sentiment among customers as the company moves forward   McDonald s stock is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold    Pay attention to movements in the rank so that you can better gauge an ideal time to pick up shares

196353,417869,MCD,Amid China Food Scandal  OSI Workers Allege Violations At US Plant,news,"By    The American meat supplier at the center of a major food safety scandal in Asia engages in widespread food safety and labor violations at its massive processing plant in West Chicago  Illinois  former employees alleged Wednesday in exclusive conversations with International Business Times 
OSI Group LLC  which posted more than  6 billion in sales last year  has been under fire since Sunday  when Chinese regulators shuttered OSI s Shanghai Husi Food Co  Ltd  meat processing facility  Chinese authorities later detained five individuals connected to the company  The moves came in the wake of an investigation by a local TV station that revealed that OSI sold expired meat and meat that had fallen on the floor to several fast food chains throughout China and Japan 
OSI said Monday that it had launched its own investigation into the practices at the Shanghai Husi plant  and issued a statement saying that   o ur company management believes this to be an isolated event  
The Aurora  Illinois  company s West Chicago plant reportedly produces more than five million beef patties per day  making it one of OSI s largest facilities  Sheldon Lavin  CEO and chairman of OSI  has said that the company is the world s largest protein supplier for McDonald s  NYSE MCD   The West Chicago plant is mostly dedicated to providing meat products for the fast food giant  which the supplier has done without major scandal for four decades 
But OSI s food safety problems may extend beyond Asia  Aurora resident Rosa Maria Ramirez  47  described practices she allegedly witnessed at the West Chicago plant where she worked for six years 
 The meat would fall on the floor and they would put it back in and pack it   Ramirez told IBTimes through a translator Wednesday evening   They would spit in the meat  and have sweat dripping off their faces into the meat  and there were times when people s gum would drop out of their mouths into the meat and they would just let it go if they couldn t find it  It s a requirement for every person to wash their hands when they go into the production area but pretty much nobody did it  
OSI did not respond to phone and email requests from IBTimes seeking comment Wednesday evening 
The claims by Ramirez  who worked as a meatpacker at the plant until last week  jibe with those of another former West Chicago plant worker who spoke with IBTimes on condition of anonymity 
The former OSI employee worked at the plant as a grinder operator and production line team leader for a little more than a year  ending in 2011 when he quit for a less demanding  higher paying job  He says that workers engaged in a wide range of food safety and labor violations  pretty much every day  while he was employed there  As a team leader  he says he reported suspected food safety violations  but alleged that he was often rebuffed by supervisors 
 You were supposed to throw out the meat if there was someone picking it up off the floor and throwing it back in  but sometimes I reported it and they just let it go through and I couldn t do anything about it   he said 
 Another big problem was hair  When they kill the cows  a lot of times hair got into the meat  If we saw it on the line  we were supposed to  kill  the meat    throw it out  But sometimes  once or twice a month  they would let it go through  have us pick out the hair and then let it go through  People picking up things with their hands and not changing gloves would happen pretty much every day  
Both Ramirez and the unnamed former worker said there was only one United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  inspector employed by the plant when they worked there  and that he almost never actually visited the plant s 10 production lines  which produce about 1 200 patties per minute each  according to Ramirez 
 They had their own quality control people who walked around but they weren t really there watching   Ramirez alleged   I would see  the USDA inspector  in the production office  which is separated from the production floor  once or twice a week  and most times when I d walk by he d be asleep  He never came down to the floor  

The other former worker corroborated Ramirez s allegations   There was a USDA inspector but I only saw him once downstairs  Most of the time he was in a special office upstairs and he just sat up there most of the time  
Both sources also allege that OSI consistently violated labor regulations in order to ensure that workers were as productive as possible  OSI did pay both workers more than  10 per hour    more than the Illinois minimum wage of  8 25 per hour    for the majority of their tenures with the company  but  working conditions were very bad   Ramirez said   We worked liked mules  There was discrimination every day  
Ramirez said that discrimination allegedly manifested itself in the form of inappropriate touching and sexual harassment by her team leader  But  she claims  her supervisor said she  was lying  when she reported the behavior and fired her days later  She also alleges that she was pressured by OSI to work while injured 
 I ve hurt myself there multiple times  I did something to my shoulder a couple of times  but they forced me to come back to work   she said    OSI s  doctor said I was fine and if I did not come back to work I would be fired  My doctor said I needed surgery  
The other former OSI employee alleges that the company did not allow workers enough time even for bathroom breaks 
 They had cameras everywhere and if you took more than two minutes past a 15 minute bathroom break  they yelled at you   he said   Your break starts the second you leave your machine  and it takes five minutes to get to the break room  get all your equipment off  and then it takes five minutes to get the equipment back on and wash your hands  So you really have only a couple minutes to actually be in the bathroom  pretty much  
After Chinese media reported on the food safety violations at the Shanghai Husi Food Co  Ltd  meat plant  McDonald s issued a statement 
 We are committed to the highest standards of food safety and our customers are always our number one priority   the company wrote   If confirmed  the practices outlined in the report are completely unacceptable to McDonald s  We are no longer serving product from the factory  This matter is being thoroughly investigated and we are cooperating fully with the authorities

196354,417870,MCD,Russian consumer watchdog seeks ban on some McDonalds  products,news,"MOSCOW  Reuters    Russia s consumer protection agency has filed a lawsuit in a Moscow court seeking to ban some of McDonald s Corp s burgers along with its milk shakes and ice cream  a court spokeswoman said on Friday 
A regional branch of the consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadzor asked the court to declare production and sales of some products illegal due to  inappropriate physical chemical parameters   she told Reuters 
The lawsuit s list of contested products named the fast food chain s Royal Cheeseburger  Filet o Fish  Cheeseburger and Chicken Burger but not its Big Mac burger 
McDonald s said in a statement it had not received any complaint from the agency and had no information about the lawsuit  It said its food was produced according to methods approved by Russian authorities 
The lawsuit comes three months after the fast food chain decided to close its restaurants in Crimea  the Ukraine region whose annexation by Russia in March triggered U S  and European sanctions  At the time  some Russian politicians called for all McDonald s outlets in Russia to be shut 
The court will hold a preliminary hearing on Aug  13 with the key hearing likely to be scheduled for September  she said 

The fast food company  which first opened in Moscow in 1990  operates about 400 restaurants in Russia and sees the country as one of its top seven major markets outside the United States and Canada  according to its 2013 annual report

The price action since the gap higher in October has been building a possible AB CD pattern  that wold target a move to about 140 if triggered  A price break over 132 would be the conservative trigger  In the meantime the break over the short term resistance at 124 was enough to get long the stock 
Into the earnings report the RSI is starting to turn back from a technically overbought level  but strongly in the bullish zone  The MACD is rising  and no where near the prior extremes  The Bollinger Bands  have opened to the upside to allow a continued move higher  Short interest is under 2   The chart looks really good into the report 
Options expiring this week suggest traders see a  2 95 move in the stock price by the end of the week  That is about 2 3  and less than the 2 6  move the stock has made on average following the last 6 earnings reports 
Open interest shows the 126 Put Strike standing out  with 2 000 contracts  4 times bigger than any other Put Strike  But it is dwarfed by the 13 000 contracts at the 128 Strike on the Call side

The first two trades look for the large open interest at 128 to draw and hold the price this week  Trades  3 and  4 also look for 128 to hold it this week and then continuation higher  with  4 adding leverage and a possible entry into the stock at 124 if it closes there or below on August 12th 
Trade  5 participates in any downside this week and then looks for a rebound above 127 by August Expiry  Trade  6 is profitable on a close between 124 and 131 Friday  I personally like the calendars the best  How about you

196360,417876,MCD,Should McDonald s Buy Shake Shack  ,opinion,"Shares of Shake Shack   NYSE SHAK   have been on a great run recently and the stock has gained nearly 10  in just the last four weeks  After a rough start to the year  this recent trading activity has been a welcome change for the often volatile fast casual burger chain 
The volatility that comes with Shake Shack stems from investors that trade the stock based on hype rather than its actual metrics  Even still  the company has consistently posted strong growth numbers and should inevitably catch up to that hype 
What s most interesting about Shake Shack is that  even though the chain has less than 100 stores worldwide  it is already a recognizable brand name in the restaurant industry  A new option that claims to offer better tasting  higher quality food tends to throw a wrench in the operations of the established industry leaders 
In the burger world  there is no bigger name than McDonald s   NYSE MCD    While Shake Shack is not yet big enough to be running McDonald s out of business  it certainly has the ability to steal some customers who are hungry for a hamburger  In other words  it s safe to say that McDonald s is well aware of Shake Shack and must look for ways to overcome this new challenge 
One way that industry giants often combat new competition is to simply eliminate the competitive element by buying that company while it s still young  Scooping up Shake Shack at this point would be an undeniably powerful move for McDonald s  but that doesn t necessarily mean it is the smartest idea  Let s take a closer look 
Growth vs  Value
To begin this conversation we need to look at what is working for both of these companies  For Shake Shack  as mentioned before  it s the company s ability to consistently grow the brand  At the end of last quarter  there were 88 Shake Shacks in operation  up 22 from a year before 
The ability to open new stores helped Shake Shack post revenue growth of nearly 44  on a year over year basis  Even  same Shack  sales growth came in at an impressive 9 90  
Part of Shake Shack s success in growing the brand has been that its stores are proving to be much more dynamic than many expected  The company quickly expanded outside of its typical storefront locations and has opened or is planning to open restaurants in airports  public transportation hubs  and even the Mall of America 
On the other end of the spectrum is McDonald s  where growth has basically stalled  In 2015  the company saw comparable store sales growth of just 1 5   and in its latest quarter McDonald s reported a 1  year over year decline in revenue  Also  from 4Q15 to 1Q16  McDonald s saw a net decline of 58 restaurants worldwide 
Of course  for one of the biggest restaurant brands in the world  storefront and revenue growth aren t necessarily the most important factors  McDonald s has still been able to grow earnings  and we can t expect it to be opening new stores at the same rate of a growing company like Shake Shack 
In short  we would expect Shake Shack to be out pacing McDonald s in the key growth categories right now  Anything else would be underwhelming  However  when we talk about whether buying Shake Shack would be a good move by McDonald s  we need to look at the value metrics 
Right now  Shake Shack as a P E ratio of 87 92  a P S ratio of 4 07  and a PEG Ratio of 3 49  These lackluster scores have earned the company a Value grade of  F  in our Style Scores system  Its market cap stands at about  860 million  and it just doesn t seem like that price tag matches what McDonald s gets out of the brand right now 
Bottom Line
The hype that I mentioned earlier is what plagues Shake Shack in these situations  While the stock has proven that it can make month long runs of impressive gains  it remains incredibly volatile as investors continue to trade on daily news and future valuations instead of today s metrics 
For a lot of companies in a similar position to Shake Shack  this ends up working out  The stock may rise and dip uncontrollably for a while  but if the company continues to grow  the revenues and earnings will eventually catch up  However  from the prospective of a potential buyer  this hype makes the company overvalued at the moment ",2016-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-mcdonald's-buy-shake-shack-200141954,200141954

Sterling stalls despite good jobs data

Hedging against a stronger yen pre BoJ
The Japanese yen remains offered on rising speculations that the Bank of Japan  BoJ  could lower its inflation forecasts and add further monetary stimulus at next week s monetary policy meeting  Yet the enthusiasm among the BoJ doves could lead to disappointment  as the BoJ may choose to hold fire  or to intervene via a softer than expected action  given that its manoeuvre margin has critically narrowed  Additionally  a gradually lower support from the market and the inefficient outcome in terms of growth and inflation has become an important headache for the BoJ Governor Kuroda  The BoJ is in a sensitive position today  it is nearly obliged to feed the market with additional stimulus to keep investors satisfied  Yet  the actual monetary tools are now insufficient to grant a continuation in the current unorthodox policy trend 
As of today  the BoJ is known to hold about one third of Japanese government bonds and is estimated to buy about 90  of new debt issues to keep up with its ultra expansive monetary policy  It is also among the top ten shareholders in 90  of Nikkei 225 companies  Hence  we can argue that sooner rather than later  the BoJ will bump against physical constraints  Therefore  there is an increasing necessity to further shift toward alternative policy tools  such as ETF purchases and deeper negative rates  which are already on analysts  watch lists  Yet  the market reaction to alternative tools has been quite discouraging so far  We remind that the latest BoJ rate cut has resulted in a near 25  appreciation in the yen against the US dollar  The IMF is also downplaying the need for a further depreciation in the yen  given that the costs of the monetary stimulus are becoming hard to justify 
While the sell off in the yen is occurring at a reasonable pace  exporters are reported to be hedging against trend reversal risks  sell orders are presumed at the 106 50 107 00 area 
From a technical perspective  the USD JPY will remain in the bullish trend above the 104 mark  major 38 2  retracement on July rise  and could extend gains toward 107 40  the 100 day moving average  as BoJ doves are building fresh long positions before next week s BoJ meeting  Still  any disappointment could rapidly drag the USD JPY below the 104 mark and suggest a mid term bearish reversal toward the 100 mark 
On a side note  the USD JPY is sustained by the recovery in US sovereign yields  The US 10 year yield bottomed at 1 3180  on July 6th before recovering to 1 60  last week  But the positive momentum is losing pace as the market gives no more than a meagre 42 6  probability for the Federal Reserve  Fed  to raise the funds rate by the end of 2016 ",2016-07-20,Ipek Ozkardeskaya,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gbp-timid-despite-solid-jobs-report-200142895,200142895
196365,417881,MCD,Nearly 140 Arrested At Protest Outside McDonald s HQ,news,"By    More than 100 demonstrators protesting for better wages outside the McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  headquarters in Oak Brook  Ill   were arrested Wednesday  a day ahead of the company s annual shareholder meeting 
Oak Brook police reportedly said that a group of about 101 McDonald s workers and about 38 clergy and union activists had been arrested for criminal trespass after they crossed a police barricade  The protest against the world s biggest restaurant chain operator by revenues came a day before the annual shareholder meeting where executive pay  including that of CEO Don Thompson who reportedly received a total compensation of  9 5 million in 2013  is expected to be discussed  The workers were reportedly demanding a minimum wage of  15 an hour and the right to unionize without retaliation 
 We need to show McDonald s that we re serious and that we re not backing down   Jessica Davis  a 25 year old McDonald s crew trainer  who earned  8 98 an hour at a Chicago McDonald s  told Reuters 
Fast Food Forward  a group that organizes workers  reportedly said that more than 2 000 people had gathered for Wednesday s protest  while McDonald s executives estimated the number at 600  and police officials estimated the crowd at 1 000 to 1 500 
According to police officials  workers reportedly chanted  Hey McDonald s You Can t Hide  We Can See Your Greedy Side   and  No Big Macs  No Fries  Make our Wage Supersize   as the arrests were made 

Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem  a spokeswoman for McDonald s  told Reuters    15 is unrealistic  but we know that the minimum wage will increase over time   She also said that the company and its franchisees have been monitoring the debate over minimum wage  adding   Folks have a right to protest peacefully and express their views

the company s turnaround plan to restructure its worldwide operations and various efforts to transform itself in a contemporary burger company  shares of McDonald s have lost nearly 4  in the past three months Estimates too have been going down ahead of McDonald s second quarter 2016 earnings release  expected later this month  Moreover  for 2016  sales are projected to decline over 3   further raising questions over this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company s prospects  What s Hurting the Burger Giant Notably  McDonald s has been reporting weak traffic trends for quite some time now in certain major markets due to a slowdown in the regions Moreover  we expect the economic slowdown in China  macroeconomic uncertainties and decreasing consumer purchasing power in Russia to remain headwinds through the rest of 2016  Also  in Europe  the economic political conditions are expected to be challenging post Brexit which is likely to impact the company s results Meanwhile  negative currency translation is a concern for McDonald s despite the weakening of the U S  dollar against other major foreign currencies in the recent past  Notably  management expects adverse currency translation to hurt EPS in the range of 5 cents to 7 cents for 2016  During the second quarter  currency translation is expected to dent EPS by 2 cents to 4 cents Moreover  of late  McDonald s margins have been under pressure from worldwide wage increases and the trend is expected to continue through the rest of 2016 Also  other restaurants have been working on providing customers with innovative menu options and healthier food in the fast casual restaurant space  intensifying competition for McDonald s All is Not LostInvestors  however  need not sweat bullets just yet as the restaurant industry on the whole has been doing pretty well on the back of improving consumer spending patterns  which in turn were positively influenced by rising wages and cheaper fuel  As dining out is usually directly proportional to consumers  disposable income  restaurant sales are projected to rise further this year According to the industry forecast released by the National Restaurant Association  NRA  for 2016

196369,417885,MCD,McDonald s Canada  A Guest Worker Program Under Scrutiny,news,"By    As the Canadian government opens up an investigation into alleged labor violations involving temporary guest workers at franchises of McDonald s Corporation NYSE MCD in the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia  McDonald s Canada said Monday it s launching an internal review of hiring practices across its entire Canadian network 
The country s Temporary Foreign Worker Program  as it is officially known  allows employers to hire foreign workers where there is a  demonstrable shortage of Canadian citizens and permanent residents  to do the job  But Canada s guest worker system has faced increasing scrutiny for its recruitment of lesser skilled jobs  such as bagging burgers and cleaning hotel rooms while youth unemployment in Canada stands at almost 14 percent  Employers claim there aren t enough Canadians to do the jobs 

 We have launched a comprehensive review of all corporate and franchise operated restaurants across the country to ensure our operations are fully aligned with the requirements of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program and consistent with our McDonald s Values   McDonald s Canada said Monday   The Temporary Foreign Worker Program was created to help employers resolve staffing issues and it provides important support for businesses when used as intended  
The government has launched an investigation into the hiring practices of both corporate owned and franchise operated McDonald s outlets after employees of two separately owned franchises complained earlier this month that locals were being pushed out in favor of the short term foreign guest workers who were getting more hours while the local hires were seeing their hours and pay cut  Christian Morrow  a 54 year old assistant restaurant manager who has worked at a Parksville  B C   McDonald s franchise for 24 years  told the CBC she was let go from her job because her boss said the guest workers  mostly Filipinos  were better workers 
 What is often called a better work ethic is really them  the guest workers  working under a fear ethic   Dennis Gruending of the Ottawa based Canadian Labour Congress  said  He points to three reasons why guest workers tend to do more for less money  They pay recruitment fees for the privilege of working in a developed country like Canada and often have accuse debts in the process  they cannot easily change jobs and in most cases have to leave the country if they re fired or let go  and employers can use these workers to fill their entry level positions regardless of an individual foreign temp s skill level  which can shut out locals from foot in the door positions and help keep payroll expenses down with a pool of foreign temps less likely to ask for raises or complain about working conditions 
In Alberta  franchise operator Dan Brown was accused by his former Canadian restaurant manager Chris Eldridge of housing his foreign temps in cramped living conditions and deducted from their paychecks  400 a month for rent  Brown has denied any wrongdoing and confirmed to the CBC that he employs 90 foreign temps who work full time  He says he pays part timer less than full timers but that all full timers are paid equally 
Migrant rights advocates don t necessarily want to see the program scotched  and labor economists routinely say such guest worker programs are necessary to fill small pockets of demand where there aren t enough locals to meet demand  which can happen in more sparsely populated areas 
Chris Ramsaroop  an organizer for Toronto based migrant rights organization Justicia for Migrant Workers said employers use the  stereotype  of the hard working migrant laborer to justify what they really want to  pay workers less and really on a revolving door of employees bonded to them under threat of being asked to leave the country 
 The reason why employers like to use those stereotypes is that they simply want to deny people rights   he said 
Migrant rights and labor advocate both say that if Canada is facing a shortage of burger flippers  or hotel housekeepers  or other forms of lesser skilled low wage workers then they should bring workers in on a path to citizenship and given them equal rights to their counterparts in the labor market   
 From pickers to pipe fitters and burger flippers  Canadian businesses have become hopelessly hooked on short term foreign workers   the Toronto Globe   Mail said in its Sunday editorial   The program has become a crutch for too many employers   an excuse to pay lower wages  or avoid the cost and effort of training  ",2014-04-14,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mcdonald’s-canada:-a-guest-worker-program-under-scrutiny-277457,277457
196370,417886,MCD,McDonald s Earnings Fall On Costs  Fewer Customers,news,"By    McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  posted a lower quarterly profit on Tuesday as high beef costs bit into margins and fewer customer visits resulted in a bigger than expected decline in sales at the fast food chain s established U S  restaurants 
McDonald s has reported roughly two years of turbulent sales at U S  restaurants open at least 13 months  due to sluggish economic growth  stiffer competition and internal missteps that have complicated menus and slowed service 
Chief Executive Don Thompson  who is likely to come under more pressure to improve McDonald s results nearly two years into his term  said in a press release that he expects same restaurant sales in April to be  modestly positive  
Still  this year promises to remain challenging as Thompson grapples with record high beef prices  labor cost increases  protests from its minimum wage workers and aggressive competition for its market leading U S  breakfast business from the likes of Yum Brands   YUM N  Taco Bell chain 
Those restaurant sales fell 1 7 percent in the United States during the first quarter  That was worse than the average estimate of 21 analysts polled by Consensus Metrix  which forecast they would slip 1 4 percent  and the sixth straight quarter they have missed Wall Street projections 
Wall Street analysts warned improvement could be slow in coming 
 We continue to view McDonald s domestic business as hampered by a menu with far too many items on it  which is slowing average service times   Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a research note 
Slow service likely will stunt efforts to improve traffic by running more diners quickly through restaurants  Kalinowski said  Quick service is key to a fast food chain s success 
Elsewhere  the world s largest restaurant chain by revenue fared better  Global comparable sales rose 0 5 percent last quarter  helped by gains in Europe  where they were up 1 4 percent  slightly better than analysts  forecast for a 1 2 percent increase 
In the Asia Pacific  the Middle East and Africa  APMEA  region  same restaurant sales rose 0 8 percent  compared with analyst projections for a 0 5 percent increase 
McDonald s said first quarter net income fell to  1 2 billion  or  1 21 per share  missing Wall Street s estimate by 3 cents  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S  That compares with a profit of  1 27 billion  or  1 26 a share  a year earlier 
Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said higher beef costs were likely a factor in the disappointing profit numbers ",2014-04-22,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mcdonald's-earnings-fall-on-costs,-fewer-customers-278769",278769

196372,417888,MCD,McDonald s  MCD  Stock Falls On Brexit Fears  Credit Suisse Downgrade,opinion,"Fast food giant McDonald s Corporation   NYSE MCD   fell nearly 3  in trading Monday  closing the day at  116 30 per share  McDonald s joined the broader market in closing the day in the red as the aftershock of last week s Brexit decision continues to bring the markets down 
Aside from the general sell off  McDonald s was also hurt by being downgraded by analysts at Credit Suisse   TO CS   who dropped their price target for the stock from  135 to  130  By the analysts  measure  nearly 37  of McDonald s revenues come from Europe  and nearly 9  comes from the United Kingdom alone 
Such exposure to the volatile area could provide major headwinds for McDonald s  especially as European currency has and continues to decline against the dollar 
The analysts also cited a pullback in customer spending as a reason for the downgrade  in addition to the excitement over promotions starting to calm down  McDonald s has seen great success in the offering of breakfast menu items all day  but the longer the promotion runs the more it likely will become just another part of the menu 
McDonald s is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   though it does have an A Growth Style Score and a dividend yield of almost 3   The rest of the year will be something to watch for the company as it continues to face a more health conscious customer and international headwinds  McDonald s stock is still up over 21  in the last year  but it will need to continue to come up with promotions and menu innovation to continue to see solid results ",2016-06-27,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/mcdonald's-(mcd)-stock-falls-on-brexit-fears,-credit-suisse-downgrade-200138519",200138519

196380,417896,MCD, Golden Arches Theory    McDonald s Enters Vietnam   Finally,news,"By    U S  fast food retailing giant McDonald s  NYSE  MCD  has opened its first restaurant in Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City  formerly known as Saigon   four decades after the end of the Vietnam War which saw the American military suffer a humiliating defeat to the Communists 
Hundreds of people lined up for meals on the first day of the 350 seat restaurant s debut on Saturday  Agence France Presse reported   I like fast food  I don t like Vietnamese food  I don t like fish sauce   25 year old customer Nguyen Hoang Long told AFP   McDonald s in Vietnam is seen as a high class restaurant  In the U S   it s just  considered  normal   USA Today noted that customers found a festive atmosphere on hand  with techno pop music and a Ronald McDonald clown greeting them  adding that Vietnamese diners enjoyed the burgers and chicken meals  but were less enamored with the French fries   We don t really like the fries   said 24 year old Mai Phu Toan  Cars and motorbikes trudged past the drive through window as well   in Ho Chi Minh  a teeming city of some 7 million people  motorbikes remain the predominant form of transportation 
Henry Nguyen Reuters
The franchise is owned by Nguyen Bao Hoang  also known as Henry Nguyen     who worked in a McDonald s diner when he grew up in the U S   and who just happens to be the son in law of Nguyen Tan Dung  the Prime Minister of Vietnam  BBC reported that Henry Nguyen had dreamed of introducing the Golden Arches to his native country  which he returned to about ten years ago  Nguyen is also the founder of Good Day Hospitality  a food and travel services cvmpany  and managing general partner of investment firm IDG Ventures Vietnam  a unit of a network of venture capital funds based in San Francisco  Cal  He also has degrees from Harvard and Northwestern universities   I think in many ways McDonald s is a symbol of something bigger  particularly for a country or market when it enters  I think it s a big deal for McDonald s  and I think it s something that people here feel is a special milestone   Nguyen said 
McDonald s now operates in 38 Asian countries  with the latest venture representing their first footprint in Vietnam  where a youthful population is increasingly attracted to western style food and consumer brands  McDonald s has said that it wants to have 100 restaurants in Vietnam within a decade 
However  Big Macs and Happy Meals have made a rather belated entry into the Southeast Asian state   other U S  companies like Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   privately held Subway sandwich shop  Burger King Worldwide Inc   NYSE  BKW  and KFC and Pizza Hut     owned by Yum  Brands Inc   NYSE YUM     have already established a presence in Vietnam  KFC  formerly known as Kentucky Fried Chicken  is the largest foreign brand in Vietnam  with some 135 outlets in the country  KFC first entered Vietnam in 1997  only a few years after Vietnam and the U S  normalized relations  Burger King  which now has about 20 restaurants in Ho Chi Minh City  Hanoi and Danang  jumped in three years ago and aggressively expanded  Pizza Hut boasts 34 locales in the country 
Other U S  brands in Vietnam include Baskin Robbins ice cream  a unit of Dunkin Brands Group Inc   NASDAQ DNKN   Dairy Queen ice cream  a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE  BRK A    Carl s Jr  restaurant chain  owned by privately held CKE Restaurants   and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen  NASDAQ PLKI   The New York Times reported that U S  companies still trail Asian fast food outlets like Lotteria from South Korea and Jollibee from the Philippines  as well as Vietnamese coffee chains like Highlands Coffee and Trung Nguyen 
Henry Nguyen explained why McDonald s took so long to enter the Vietnamese market   McDonald s is a very careful organization  If you show up in a market you ve got to do things right   he said  according to USA Today   The food standards have got to be there  so  the  supply chain was definitely an issue  But from what I know  Vietnam has been at the top of McDonald s list of the next market to open for a very long time  
McDonald s is virtually an American icon that many young Vietnamese have long been fascinated with  With a population of some 90 million and a growing middle class  Vietnam is an untapped market for the fast food behemoth   Right now  the majority of what we serve is imported food   Nguyen said   The long term goal over the next five to 10 years is that we help develop a local supply chain  That to me is one of the peripheral benefits for why I wanted to be a part of this  We re going to change the food industry here  
Euromonitor International  a market research firm  said the fast food industry in Vietnam is modest in size  but expanding quickly  In 2013  the business generated total revenues of  535 million  up 14 5 percent from the prior year  Euromonitor projects that revenues from Vietnam s food service industry will climb to  670 million in 2015   Vietnamese are not necessarily going to fast food for the wonderful taste   Ralf Matthaes  managing director for Vietnam and the Mekong region at TNS Global  a British market research consulting firm  told USA Today   Coming to McDonald s is more of a treat  more of something aspirational  
McDonald s has made it entrance during a time of economic recession in Vietnam  including a fragile real estate market  But Matthaes claimed that the recession may have benefited McDonald s since the economic malaise had pushed down the price of real estate   Vietnam is in the middle of a recession  but what that actually creates is a lower cost of entry   he said 
USA Today also noted that food at McDonald s typically costs more than meals available for sale from street vendors  For example  a Big Mac costs 60 000 Vietnamese Dong   2 82   and a  value meal  with fries and a soda costs 85 000 Vietnamese Dong   3 99    more than double the price of a bowl of pho noodle soup from a street seller  According to EatingSaigon com  the cost of street food in Ho Chi Minh City can even cost as little as 5 000 or 6 000 Dong  Nguyen Thi Hang Nga  a Hanoi street vendor who sells the staple bowl of pho  complained to the New York Times   That  McDonald s  food may be tasty  but it s expensive for normal Vietnamese   Consequently  food like McDonald s is targeted towards the youthful urban middle class  not the poor 
Looking at the bigger picture  consumer spending in Vietnam makes it an attractive place to target for foreign retailers  The World Bank estimated that between 2008 and 2012  per capita income rose from  1 000 to  1500   It s got a big population  the government is making it easier to enter  and Vietnamese are now having that basic income level where there is not just sustainability but genuine opportunity for growth and profits   Matthaes told the Times 
Moreover  in a country where it is still difficult to open new businesses  Henry Nguyen was likely given a boost by his powerful and influential father in law   Laws and regulations are often rather vaguely written  giving officials plenty of opportunity to delay or assist an investor s plans  but Mr  Nguyen has been able to negotiate these difficulties with ease   Bill Hayton  a former foreign correspondent in Vietnam and author of  Vietnam  Rising Dragon   told the Times   Having the second most powerful man in the country as father in law is like having a golden ticket and get out jail free card all rolled into one  
The rising popularity of western fast food retailers reflects a changing attitudes among the young   the World Bank reported that last year  the total consumption of that ancient staple  rice  declined in Vietnam for the first time ever  as the middle classes seek other forms of carbohydrates  And  as in western societies  Vietnam is now confronting rising rates of obesity and diabetes  in the affluence urban regions ",2014-02-10,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/'golden-arches-theory'---mcdonald’s-enters-vietnam-…-finally-265440,265440

196382,417898,MCD,McDonald s Looks Supported,opinion,"During the Friday session  McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  pulled back in order to test the  120 level  but found enough buying pressure at that region to form a hammer  This is one of my favorite trading signals  a hammer at an area that has shown support in the past  McDonald s looks supported by not only the psychological aspect of the round number and former action  but the 61 8  Fibonacci retracement level as well  The level is often where a lot of traders will get involved  so I think that a bounce is likely 
Remember  McDonald s is considered a safety play of sorts  as the economy in America is struggling  as shown by the anemic jobs number on Friday  When you aren t working   food needs to be cheap  and I think this is another reason to suggest that traders may be attracted to this stock  Because of this  a bounce makes sense as well  as CFD traders will be looking at this market on Monday due to the technical set up  I think that a run to the  131 level is possible  but remember this is an investment  not a scalp  You have to be able to deal with the volatility that we will see from time to time as we grind higher  I think it could take several weeks to get there  but these types of trades are what makes for a good year  Nice and steady wins the race 
McDonald s should continue higher
The stock should in conclusion grind higher  and I think that you will have several opportunities to get involved  My favorite strategy with a situation like this is to buy a little bit more every time it pulls back  and in small increments  I would start out with a small position  and simply add a few shares every time we see signs of  value  in this marketplace  I think that the overall look of indices in America is strong right now  and this should continue right along with them  However  the strength in those indices probably has more to do with the idea that interest rates will remain very low in the USA for some time  This market is more about people having less income ",2016-06-05,Christopher Lewis,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mcdonald’s-looks-supported-200134037,200134037
196383,417899,MCD,Looking For Growth  Part 2   Leapfrog To The New Frontier,opinion,"Yesterday  I examined Asia s two big economies  Japan and China  In particular  their slowing growth and what it means for investments in those countries 
Today  I m going to show you where to find 6  to 8  annual growth 
To find high and lasting growth  you need to invest in countries that are booming  Many of these so called  frontier  markets have many more motorcycles than cars on the road  and some don t even have a McDonald s  NYSE MCD  
Frontier markets offer investors a combination of great value  huge upside  and unique challenges 
As giants run into growing pains  higher costs  and negative returns  frontier markets are being fueled by a bit more political stability and easy access to modern communications  technology  and capital  The simple smartphone has connected every citizen to the global economy  as well as MIT s free online education 
My reasoning for choosing frontier markets is simple and powerful  Frontier countries are far behind developed countries like Japan and America  and are even playing catch up with countries like Thailand  Singapore  and Malaysia 
But they re catching up fast  Imagine a chance to invest right now in the China of 1990 or even 1980  when its wages were at rock bottom levels and it exported in a year what it now does every day 
As you can see from the chart below  many of these countries are at levels of gross domestic product  GDP  per capita that were achieved by America before 1900 

Youthful populations and the migration from rural areas to higher income jobs in the cities are supercharging growth in these economies 
The median age of many of these countries is at the demographic sweet spot of 25 years  compared to 37 years in China and South Korea  and 45 years in Germany and Japan 
This explains the optimism driving families to open their first bank accounts and purchase new houses  washing machines  refrigerators  cars  as well as better food and medical care  This  in turn  explains why big companies from Japan  China  America  Europe  and South Korea are falling all over themselves and each other to invest in frontier Asia 
And it s not just lucrative new consumer markets and rising tourism that s driving this wave of capital  but the need to access the region s natural resources 
Evidence of this optimism and virtuous cycle of growth is everywhere 

Since 2009 and the cooling of its civil war  Sri Lanka s GDP has surged 40  and is now double that of India on a per capita basis 
The 12th largest shopping mall in the world is in Dhaka  Bangladesh 
A  20 billion energy investment by Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  in Papua New Guinea has the potential to double the size of its economy 
And even China is pouring capital into these markets  investing more than  1 billion in one industrial park in Vietnam 

Be Wary of Frontier ETFs
But I caution you to avoid broad based frontier market exchange traded funds  ETFs  such as iShares  or Guggenheim s  They take too much of a shotgun approach with respect to countries and sectors 
You need to zero in on Asian frontier markets using an active strategy that balances diversification and focus 
You might consider the Asia Frontier Capital Fund  which I like for a number of reasons 

47  of its portfolio is in consumer stocks aiming to capture the young and rising consumer class 
I like the fund s 30  top weighting to Vietnam and the smart strategy of investing in each country s strengths  such as tourism in Sri Lanka  mining in Mongolia  consumer food companies in Vietnam  and textiles and manufacturing in low cost Bangladesh 
Many of the fund s companies have significantly lower valuations compared to similar emerging and western companies  making them attractive acquisition targets 
The fund produces a nice 4 3  dividend yield for income and lower risk 

The Asia Frontier Capital Fund has delivered the best performance of all frontier funds in the world over the last three years with lower volatility 
It s up 33 4  versus the MSCI Frontier 100  NYSE FM  Index  which is up only 2 4   In addition  it s the only frontier fund in the world that was up in 2015 
High growth frontier Asia is on the move  Make some room in your portfolio for these markets today

196389,417905,MCD,INTERVIEW UPDATE 1 Burgers and pizza to swell Glanbia in 2010,news,"  Expects to return to earnings growth next year
   U S  production expanding  benefits from fast food growth
   Sees consolidation in Irish milk processing sector
 By Andras Gergely
 KILKENNY  Ireland  June 18  Reuters    Irish dairy group
Glanbia expects to return to earnings growth next year as global
recession encourages consumers in the United States and Europe
to dine on cheeseburgers and take away pizza 
 Glanbia warned in April it would not meet an earlier
forecast for growing earnings this year due to losses at its
Food Ingredients Ireland unit  which makes butter  cheese and
other products from 1 4 billion litres of milk a year  
 But Europe s biggest supplier of mozzarella cheese for
pizzas and a major manufacturer of cheese for McDonalds and
Burger King told Reuters on Thursday that its overseas units 
including a profitable Nigerian joint venture  would drive the
bottom line in 2010 
  At the end of the day people are not buying into Glanbia
for that business  Food Ingredients Ireland    Group Managing
Director John Moloney told Reuters on Thursday  signalling that
the Irish division was non core 
 Glanbia  which is majority owned by an Irish farmers 
cooperative  expects adjusted earnings to drop to a range
between 30 and 32 euro cents this year from 35 9 cents in 2008 
 Next year it expects to return closer to the earnings growth
path of around 10 to 14 percent which it targeted until April s
profit warning  Moloney said 
 Profit from its Nigerian joint venture Nutricima  the
recently announced expansion of its U S  joint venture Southwest
Cheese and the growth of Optimum  a U S  body building
supplement maker acquired last year  will together overshadow
problems at the Food Ingredients Ireland unit  Moloney said 
 Glanbia s stock finished up 1 percent on Thursday at 2 344
euros  outperforming the general index  which closed flat 
Glanbia s shares gained 10 percent since the start of the year
compared with a 19 percent increase in the main index 
 
 DAIRY BUSINESS
 Moloney said the Irish milk processing industry faced
inevitable consolidation to be able to compete with countries
such as New Zealand with more unified sectors  and Glanbia was
open to a reshuffle in the sector
  If our assets would make a contribution and take that
forward to a better place we would certainly have an open mind
in looking at that   Moloney said in an interview at the group s
headquarters in Kilkenny  around 65 miles south of Dublin 
  It could form a joint venture with others  
 After the expansion of Southwest Cheese  Glanbia will be the
leading manufacturer of cheddar cheese in the United States with
20 percent of that market 
 A lot of its U S  output is turned into processed cheese
which fills cheeseburgers at chains such as McDonalds and Burger
King  which have benefited from consumers trading down in the
recession  Moloney said 
 Glanbia  which also supplies the cream blended into Baileys
Irish Cream liqueur  has seen slightly increased demand for its
pizza cheese output    bought by chains such as Domino s and
Pizza Hut 
  The phenomenon we re seeing on the pizza side is we d see
year to date our volumes up a bit   Moloney said   The chains
focused on home delivery are doing well

196395,417911,MCD,RPT FEATURE Socialism  consumerism rub shoulders in Tripoli,news,"By Tom Pfeiffer
 TRIPOLI  Nov 19  Reuters    As economic barriers fall
between Libya and the West  a boom town atmosphere fed by the
novelty of consumer culture has gripped its capital Tripoli 
 Hotel rooms are in short supply as foreigners flock to the
Mediterranean port city to seal business deals made possible by
the OPEC member country s recovery from years of sanctions 
 As the sun sets and a cool breeze wafts through shady
colonial era arcades  Tripolitans stroll past shops laden with a
growing array of imported goods  from veiled Barbie dolls to
England football shirts  designer handbags and silk scarves 
 According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development  foreign direct investment into Libya rose to  2 5
billion in 2007 after a slow recovery since 2004  the year after
Libya gave up its weapons of mass destruction programme  
 That put it on a par for inflows with Morocco and Sudan in
Africa  
 Near Green Square s glaring floodlights and posters
celebrating 39 years of Muammar Gaddafi s Islamic socialist
revolution  businessmen with the latest laptops discuss
investment projects over Italian coffee and fruit smoothies 
 As the number of flights to Tripoli grows  the airport s car
park has overflown into a field nearby  A  2 billion project to
increase passenger capacity more than sixfold is under way 
  If you don t visit a particular area for a while it becomes
hardly recognisable   said Libyan singer songwriter Ahmed
Fakroun   You ask yourself   When did all this happen   
 With unemployment estimated by the U S  embassy to run at a
minimum of 30 percent in Libya as a whole  the laid back people
of Tripoli appear unfazed by the level of activity and growing
number of foreign visitors 
 The most significant arrival by far was that of U S 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  whose September trip was
intended to end decades of enmity 
 It raised hopes that Libya is on its way back into the
international mainstream after years when it was seen in the
West as a supporter of terrorism  To judge by the atmosphere in
Tripoli  the shift to modernity is well rooted 
 
 WHEEL SPINS AND NEW HOTELS 
 A tailback of BMWs and sport utility vehicles forms along
wealthy Ben Achour Street and young male drivers show off their
powerful engines with screeching wheel spins that send up plumes
of smoke 
 The noise fails to distract a group of old men playing
draughts over a water pipe of tobacco 
 Billboards across town advertise towering hotel
developments  French perfume and Italian designer clothing
stores have appeared to cater for a new class of wealthy 
sophisticated Libyan with money to burn 
  Business is booming and next year promises to be even
bigger   said Mustapha  a Tunisian working for Italian furniture
group Doimo   We ve stopped taking more business for now as we
just wouldn t be able to honour the contracts  
 U S  companies got involved in Libyan oil and gas after the
end of sanctions in 2004 but many held back until this summer
when the two countries agreed to set up a fund to cover
terrorism compensation claims 
 Today  big American brands are still conspicuously absent 
There are burger bars  but no McDonalds  A man dressed in a
furry duck outfit greets visitors to a family restaurant  yet
Disney stores are nowhere 
 Libyans interviewed in Tripoli say their country is opening
to the global economy on its own terms  encouraging inward
investment while eschewing symbols of western economic power 
 They prefer not to discuss politics but some defend Libya s
system in which young families are sold starter homes at
favourable rates  flour is subsidised to ensure it stays
 cheaper than sand  and few citizens are reduced to begging 
 Gaddafi s Green Book  the theoretical foundation of his
system of government published in the late 1970s  calls the
employee employer relationship one of slavery and proposes  Not
Wage Workers  but Partners   Now his influential son Saif
al Islam has put his weight behind a campaign for more Libyans
to set up small businesses 
 
 INFLUX OF FOREIGNERS
 Some Tripolitans say reforms to encourage people to retrain
for real jobs rather than relying on government sinecures are a
sign the country can modernise without a new revolution 
  You can get what you want in Libya  but you do need to work
hard at your studies   said Abdelhafid Shtiwi  a 30 year old
desert oil field engineer   Some people might take government
money and just stay at home  but that s not much of a life  
 Others say Libyan society has become a little more
meritocratic    their compatriots can be seen working as
mechanics and even street cleaners where before they would have
turned down such work 
 They say a new atmosphere of enterprise has infected part of
the population  and Tripoli s shops draw Tunisians stocking up
on cheap consumer electronics and household appliances  Tripoli
is some 180 km  112 miles  from the Tunisian border and in the
years of sanctions  Tunisia was a relatively easy route in 
 Yet Libyans with less well paid jobs complain the influx of
foreigners has pushed up the cost of living and family incomes
have failed to keep pace 
  Everything is expensive  expensive  expensive   said taxi
driver Mustapha   My father is dead and I struggle to support my
sisters and brothers  Only petrol is cheap  
 Gaddafi has ruled out changing his system of government 
which bans political parties in favour of rule by local
committees  But he has suggested citizens should be handed more
of the desert country s oil wealth and allowed to decide how to
spend it themselves 
 That reform is meant to start in January  although Libyan
experts say it may be derailed by global financial turmoil 
  If the international circumstances do not permit such a
programme to be carried out now  it could be delayed   said
Saleh Ibrahim  a member of Libya s National Planning Council and
director of the Academy of Graduate Studies  
 And after so many years of isolation  some Libyans remain
suspicious of the growing foreign presence   Apart from all
these hotels  are they going to give us scholarships  better
education and help our government offer free health   said
economic consultant Ismail Thurki   I worry it will be the
foreigners who take the profits  not us Libyans

Last year  McDonald s took an aggressive stance to reset its core business which had otherwise been failing  The first step  and perhaps most successful  was a change in leadership  In March 2015  McDonald s appointed Steve Easterbrook as CEO  and they haven t looked back since  The company has topped expectations in each quarter under the new CEO and is well positioned to do so again  Last quarter  McDonald s boasted a 5  increase in global comp sales and a 7  increase in operating income  Unfortunately  revenue decreased 7  during the same period  largely due to currency headwinds  Exchange rate volatility is expected to be an ongoing hinderance for McDonald s moving forward Some of McDonald s most notable initiatives include the debut of All Day Breakfast and the introduction of its McPick 2 promotion  McDonald s has noted that All Day Breakfast was the primary drive of increased traffic last quarter  The ingenuity of day long breakfast differentiates McDonald s from direct competitors like Wendy s and Burger King but also compete against traditional breakfast establishments such as Denny s and IHOP

196405,417921,MCD,How To Double Your Wealth Overnight,opinion,"Editorial Note  This week s chart comes from our good friend Karim Rahemtulla  editor and co founder of Beyond the Dollar  It shows the price of a McDonald s Corporation  N MCD   Big Mac around the world  using the U S  dollar as its base  Stateside  a Big Mac costs  4 93 at the moment  But in Peru  the signature burger costs 10 sol  the equivalent of  2 93 
Purchasing power is the key measure of wealth  Does a can of Coke really taste better in Switzerland or United States versus Malaysia  You better hope so  Because if you re buying that can of Coke in Zurich or New York  you re paying about 60  more for it than you would in Kuala Lumpur  Bangkok or a host of other countries
As the owner of U S  dollars or Swiss francs  you re missing out on one of the greatest opportunities of your lifetime  You re missing out on getting rich    or if you re already rich  you re missing out on getting richer 
Imagine paying  500 a month in rent for an oceanfront condominium in a city not much different from most in the West  How about a live in maid for less than  300 per month or an Uber ride across town for  1 50 
These are not fantasies  In fact  I just returned from a country where all of this is the norm  not the exception  And I am not talking about some  third world  dump where you would not want to live at any price 
It s a notion that is often misunderstood  the value of money versus the purchasing power value of that same money  You may think you don t have much money if you are making  50 000 a year in the U S   but in places like Thailand or Malaysia you would be living like a king 
The currencies of both countries and many others are trading much lower thanks to the strength of the dollar  But the purchasing power on a local basis has not adjusted higher  The opposite is true 
In early 2015  a 12 mile Uber ride from George Town in the Malaysian state of Penang to the airport would have cost you 20 Malaysian ringgit or about  6  Last week  that same ride would have cost you  4 40  A condo overlooking the Strait of Malacca would have set you back  630 last year but only  500 today  The prices on the local level have not changed year over year  but for you or me the bargains have gotten only better 
The U S  dollar is indeed in rarefied territory today  And that s something to celebrate if you own dollars  Many major economies are on the other end of the spectrum  especially if that economy is tied to resources  or perceived to be tied to resources  
Take the Mexican peso  for example  It just hit 18 50 to the dollar  down 7  just since the end of last year  Two years ago  the peso was trading at 12 to 1 compared to the dollar  The fall is attributed to the decline in oil prices  Yet  on the streets of Mexico  things are not indicative of a 50  collapse in the currency  In fact  the lower currency is inviting even more economic activity 
The Canadian dollar is trading at less than US 0 69  a level not seen in more than a decade  Again  the perception is that the Canadian economy is so dependent on oil prices that it s heading for a recession  Last week  home prices in Toronto hit record highs  far from a recessionary mood  And this week  the Bank of Canada stepped back from reducing interest rates  commenting on the resiliency of the economy and its diversity 
But if you re buying imported goods such as fruits or vegetables from California  you re paying through the nose as a Canadian 
In fact  as the chart above shows  of all the major and not so major global currencies  only three are pricier than the U S  dollar 
Now  this is not to say that you should make plans to move to Venezuela  the lowest on the totem pole  and with good reason  But it should make you step back and ask this question  Am I as wealthy as I could be ",2016-01-31,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-to-double-your-wealth-overnight-382431,382431
196406,417922,MCD,McDonald s Is Back,opinion,"McDonald s  N MCD  stock has risen 39  over the last year  The S P 500 is down 1  over the same time period  These are not the excellent results one would expect from a well established business in a  boring  industry 
McDonald s is not a trendy investment  The company has been serving cheap fast food since 1955  The company may not be trendy   but it does have a long history of success 
Case in point  McDonald s has paid increasing dividends every year for 39 consecutive years  This makes McDonald s one of only 50 Dividend Aristocrats   stocks with 25  years of dividend increases without a reduction  Click here to see all 50 Dividend Aristocrats 
Excellent Recent Results
McDonald s posted excellent 4th quarter results  The company saw global comparable store sales grow 5   Earnings per share grew 16   Excluding the effects of currency changes  earnings per share grew 26  
The company s growth is a result of recovering from bad PR in Japan and China from the previous year  McDonald s suffered from a tainted meat scandal as well as someone finding a human tooth in their food in these regions 
In the United States  McDonald s saw rising comparable store sales thanks to its move toward all day breakfast 
In addition  McDonald s is focusing on increasing margins by refranchising more of its stores  The company s goal is to have 95  of its stores franchised  up from 80  currently 
Refranchising efforts combined with streamlining the company s operations are targeted to provide net annual savings of  500 million per year by 2017 
Shareholder Friendly Management
McDonald s goal is to return  30 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through 2016  The company will return around  14 billion to shareholders in 2016 to hit its goal  Much of this will be funded through low cost debt financing 
To put this  14 billion number into perspective  it is 12  of the company s current market cap 
McDonald s current CEO Steve Easterbrook began leading the company in March of 2015  His time as CEO has already led to a renewed focus on quality  cost cutting  and returning capital to shareholders 
These factors  culminating in rising earnings per share  have driven McDonald s surging share price 
Recession Performance
McDonald s stock generated total returns of 55 9  for shareholders from 2007 through 2009 during the Great Recession  The S P 500 had total returns of negative 15 9   McDonald s stock outperformed the S P 500 by over 70 percentage points over this 3 year period 
McDonald s is one of the most recession resistant Dividend Aristocrats  The company s performance over the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 is nothing short of remarkable 
The company s earnings per share growth through this difficult time period are shown below to illustrate this point 

2007 earnings per share of  2 91
2008 earnings per share of  3 67
2009 earnings per share of  3 98

The reason McDonald s performs so well through recessions is because the company sells low priced food 
When times are tough  people often substitute down  Someone who would normally dine at a more expensive restaurant may opt to eat at McDonald s instead to save money  McDonald s reputation for low prices is what drives excellent recession results 
Valuation   Final Thoughts
There s no denying McDonald s is a shareholder friendly corporation with a well known brand  Unfortunately  the market has taken notice of McDonald s recent success 
The company is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio of 25 9  McDonald s appears somewhat overvalued at current prices  The company s historical average price to earnings ratio over the last decade is around 17 
As a result of its current overvalued status  McDonald s is ranked as a hold using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing 
When McDonald s price to earnings ratio declines again  it will make an excellent holding for long term dividend growth investors

Stock Market Crash 2016  This Is The Worst Start To A Year For Stocks Ever    From rightsidenews com

And the list goes on and on 
The Naysayers are busy listing several factors that in their opinion does not bode well for the market
Ultra low oil prices  we are told that low oil prices are bad for the economy  Hold on  was it not too long ago they were telling us that high oil prices were bad for the economy  so which one is it  Many oil companies will go bankrupt  but the ones that are left will emerge strong and be ready for the next bullish phase  It is because oil prices are low that car sales jumped and set a record last year  17 5 million vehicles were sold and many consumers started purchasing Gas guzzlers they were avoiding before due to high gas prices  Ultra low oil prices are the equivalent of central bankers injecting roughly  1 trillion dollars into the global financial system  as that is how much the global economy will save at these rates 
The China factor  China s economy is slowing down  and so the fear is that this could have a significant impact on our economy 
A big deal is being made over China s slowing economy  this growth is something every developed economy can only dream off  U S  Corporations export roughly  500 billion year worth of Goods to China  We have an  18 trillion economy  so this is a drop in the bucket and nothing to panic over 
Uncertainty after the Fed raised rates  For crying out loud  the Fed only raised rates by a paltry 0 25   and they can immediately turn around and reverse their position if they wanted  However  in our opinion  even another 2 3 rates will do nothing to derail this economy as rates are being raised from ultra low levels 
Let us take a pause and think about the current situation  Have we not seen this before  The theme is always the same  something bad is going to happen a stock market crash is imminent  take cover and run for the hills  Sure  in the short term the markets have experienced some violent moves  but fast forward  in every case  the markets recouped and traded higher  People will mention Japan as an example of a market that is still trying to play catch up decades later  Well  what happened in Japan happened in a different era  We are now in the era of devaluing or die  in other words  every nation is hell bent on debasing its currency or it is being forced to because major players have jumped on the bandwagon  In such an environment  normal rules  do not apply  and central bankers usually respond by flooding the markets with money  Regardless of this issue  look at this long term chart of the Dow and it clearly illustrates that every so called disaster was nothing but a buying opportunity 

We have never advocated buying right at the top  our theme was to view strong pullbacks as buying opportunities to open new positions  Has the situation changed so much since last year  Are we also going to join the pack of naysayers  Before we answer that question  let s examine the issue of volatility  Last year we emphasized several times that volatility was going to be a major issue as our Volatility Indicator had soared into record territory  In fact  in early Jan  we republished comments that we had sent out to our subscribers in Dec 2015  listed below

Our V indicator has surged to yet another high  so extreme volatility is here to stay  In fact  2016 will probably be remembered as the most volatile year on record 
Volatility is a two way street  this means that one should expect large price swings on both ends of the scale  Given the run up the markets have experienced over the past seven years  the current correction while strong is nothing to panic over 

Technical Outlook

It goes without saying  that the traders are panicking  and that market psychology in the short term has taken a beating  However  the short term and long term is not the same  Last week we noted that the volume on most down days was significantly lower than the volume on up days  It appears someone is stepping in and buying  could this be the smart money in action  Time will tell 
On the short term timelines  the markets are oversold so a relief rally could take hold anytime  Both the MACD s and Relative strength indicator are trading in the oversold ranges  The MACDS are about to make a bullish crossover  Given the strength of the correction  there is a good chance that we have not seen the lows as yet  The Dow is likely to rally to the 16700 16900 ranges before pulling back and trading below the current lows  The drop to below the August lows should drive out all the bears setting up the bedrock for a bottom and a move to higher prices  As we stated in several of our past updates  expect 2016 to be the most volatile year on record to date  Now is the time to build up a nice list of stocks that you always wanted to own but felt were too expensive to buy  History indicates that the stronger the markets deviate from the norm  the better the buying opportunity 
Here is a small list of stocks that have held up remarkably well during the current sell off   N PBY    O IGLD  O PRMW    N MCD    N JNJ   etc

196428,417944,MCD,2 Cheap Turnaround Plays,opinion,"Barron s didn t have much good to say about one of my favorite long term stock holdings a few weeks ago 
But now it seems that we re singing from the same songbook on two cheap turnaround plays  McDonald s  N MCD  and General Motors  N GM  
I ll start with McDonald s  I started getting bullish on this stock in March  see  Dividend Smackdown  and  Musings on the McDonald s Dividend   and I bought shares of McDonald s in my Dividend Growth portfolio in May  Wall Street was almost unanimous in its hatred of the stock and the share price had barely budged since 2011 
In my view  the sentiment that McDonald s was doomed to terminal decline was ludicrous  This is a company that has redefined itself multiple times over the decades  most recently about 15 years ago  And it s been a veritable champion of shareholder friendliness throughout 
Let s see what Barron s had to say about McDonald s 
From  McDonald s Turns Around 

After Mickey D s released much better than expected third quarter results on Oct  22  the stock jumped 10   The fast food giant  with 36 000 restaurants around the world  reported that comparable sales at U S  units were up 0 9   the segment s first rise in two years  Global comparables were up a robust 4  
Howard Penney  an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management  an independent research outfit  says McDonald s is evidencing a turnaround that will continue  leading the stock higher  Only about a third of the 32 sell side analysts following the Oak Brook  Ill  based company rate its stock a Buy  That s a useful contrarian indicator  but there are other  fundamental reasons to like the stock 
Restaurant companies fix themselves in the same ways  Penney says   Slow growth temporarily  cut costs  and focus on the four walls   That s what McDonald s has been doing since Steve Easterbrook took over as CEO last March  after years of corporate and stock underperformance  Prior to his arrival  the company had added dozens of new menu items and McCaf  coffee offerings  increasing complexity in the back of the house and decreasing throughput 
Speculation is rife that the company will unveil a  McREIT  this Tuesday at an analyst meeting  but Penney s view doesn t depend on a real estate investment trust  REIT  structure  According to a recent report from Morgan Stanley  N MS   McDonald s owns about 45  of the land and 70  of the buildings in its  consolidated markets   which include 27 000 restaurants around the world  Roughly half of its operating income comes from franchise rents 

We ll see about  McREIT   We should know more later today 
Now let s take a look at General Motors  I bought shares of General Motors
This is what Barron s had to say about it  from  General Motors  Revival is Here to Stay   

Year to date  the stock is up just 2   but should be up far more  Consider that Wall Street s 2015 earnings consensus has swelled by 11  since the end of last year  The 2016 consensus has grown 16   The chief worry among GM sceptics today is that profits are close to peaking  That looks unlikely  but the next downturn  when it comes  could actually improve long term sentiment on the stock by demonstrating that the much improved car maker can remain solidly profitable in good years and bad 
For now  GM  ticker  GM  looks likely to approach earnings of  6 a share by 2017  which would mark a three year doubling  As that number comes into view a year from now  and as investors realize that GM s new profitability is no fleeting fantasy  shares could hit  48  or eight times earnings  for a return of about 40   including the dividend yield of nearly 5  

I ve said for a while that  come what may in the economy  auto sales are poised for a sustained rebound  The average age of cars on American roads is nearly 12 years  That s the average of cars currently still in operation  not the average lifespan before getting junked 
But what if I m wrong and new car sales really do continue to lag  As Barron s continues 

Consider what GM s profit statement would look like if the U S  suffered a 25  decline in vehicle demand  It could look like it did in 2011  when the SAAR ended the year at 13 5 million vehicles  GM that year turned a  7 6 billion profit and reported EPS of close to  4  Results since then have been marred by a collapse in Europe and deep ignition switch losses  But if  4 a share is the new bottom for earnings or  3 a share  for that matter the stock deserves a sharply higher price ",2015-11-10,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-cheap-turnaround-plays-270909,270909
196429,417945,MCD,McDonald s Corporation Has Rallied 10  In Last Month,opinion,"It seems that McDonald s Corporation  N MCD  is trying to regain some of its lost ground  The company s CEO  Steve Easterbrook  launched turnaround tactics in the face of multiple issues hurting its results in the last years and the first quarter of the current year results  For the first time in two years  the company s same store sales witnessed growth in the third quarter  Still  the CEO is not completely happy with the performance and believes that there is an urgent need to do a lot to reset the business  However  investors were impressed with the recent performance of the company  As a result  the stock surged 10  in the last one month period on the back of 14  in October alone  That raises a question as to what awaits next for the company and the shareholders 
New Menu Items Play A Key Role
One of the main reasons for McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  s change is the new menu items that are driving traffic  as well as sales in the third quarter  The company has been focusing All Day Breakfast as it was proving to be more popular among the visiting customers  The company did add products to it  thereby helping customers to select their own menu also for all day breakfast  Before Easterbrook entered the scene  the company was pushing dozens of fresh menu items  as well as McCafe coffee offerings  That ultimately increased the density in the back of the house  as well as falling throughput 
Currently  McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  s focus appears to be simplifying its operations with the all day breakfast menu gaining ground more and more  The company does not bother to shrink the menu if it does not enjoy the patronage of the customers  At the same time  it is also ready to add products  It will not be a tough thing to add since it does not need any fresh equipment or training  Easterbrook believes that the changes would fuel efficiency  as well as throughput at the store levels  Above all  same store sales would continue to show enhancement in the upcoming periods  thus erasing the negative factors 
Cost Cutting Measures
It is an oft repeated measure to reduce expenses to boost the bottom line or enhance the operating margin  McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  and its CEO  Easterbrook  also preferred to follow the same  That would ensure growth on a slower basis temporarily  thus giving the management some time to think out of the box to address the larger issue  The food retailer s CEO aims to cut general and administrative expenses by as much as  300 million  Hedgeye Risk Management analyst  Howard Penney  expects the company to gain more from cost cutting measures  He also said that the food retailer would shut down approximately 800 stores that are underperforming  Total  it has about 36 000 restaurants throughout the company 
The third quarter EPS was 14 cents a share higher than the Street analysts expectations or 9 4  positive surprise  which is significant considering 1 6  recorded in the second quarter  The increasing positive percentage can be interpreted as the strengthening of its turnaround tactics  though some might reject that one quarters numbers are not enough to take it as yielding of turning around results  Penney believes that whatever McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  has taken so far are first steps as the gains would percolate to the coming quarters  The Wall Street analysts have also started following the lead as they have steadily increasing their estimations upward  This is significant considering years of witnessing a drop 
Street Confidence Boosted
The fact is that the Street has gained confidence in the company s stock  as well as its performance  That s the main reason behind boosting their expectations from the chain of restaurant retailers  For instance  consensus estimations increased to  1 22 a share for the December quarter from  1 17 a share predicted two months ago  Similarly  for the current year  Street has boosted its earnings estimations to  4 86 a share from  4 69 a share two months back  Similarly  they have increased their EPS projections to  5 29 from  5 16 a share  That demonstrated the renewed confidence in McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  shares that started uptick following the third quarter numbers 
Speculation On REIT Move
There is a speculation that the restaurant firm would launch a  McREIT  during an analyst meeting  The recent report of  Morgan Stanley said that the restaurant retailer owns 70  of the buildings and approximately 45  of the land in its consolidated markets  That included 27 000 restaurants throughout the globe  The company gets at least 50  of its operating income from its franchise rents 
Penney believes that McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  might unveil tax advantaged structure for rental income  However  there are doubts that REIT would solve all the issues as there are fears that they don t perform well in an increasing interest rate environment  If by any chance  the company disappoints the investors in respect of a REIT structure  it might reflect in share prices getting dragged down  though temporarily  Such an occasion could be a buying opportunity  according to Penney 
Valuation
By the turn of the year 2017  Penney expects McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  s annual earnings potential to be  6 32 a share  That means the company would achieve the number a year ahead  At a price earnings ratio of 20 5 times  the stock should be worth around  130  Similarly  the stock will be valued around  150 based on PE of 23 5 times  which is near the historical range of high 
Conclusion
The company s turnaround tactics appear to be on a strong footing  The cost cutting is an additional factor that would drive McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  s EPS higher to warrant a higher valuation  The most important factor is that the company has come out of the supplier issue in China where it is recording significant growth in same store sales  There could be some disappointment in store due to the decision on REIT  However  that would be for a short period only

196430,417946,MCD,Global Economic Transformation  At Your Service,opinion,"The evolution of national economies tends to follow a well established pattern  They all start out as mostly agricultural economies  They evolve into manufacturing economies  In the next stage of development  services increasingly predominate  In the final stage  economies become knowledge based  Most emerging economies are currently based on labor intensive agricultural and manufacturing businesses  but moving towards more services  On balance  most developed nations around the world are in the third stage  with services outpacing manufacturing 
While the recent batch of weak industrial production indexes for Germany  down 1 1  in September   the US   0 2   the UK   0 2   Brazil   1 3   Taiwan  and Singapore  both little changed after big declines  suggests that a global manufacturing downturn may be underway  the increasingly services led global economy isn t falling into a recession  Indeed  it seems that services industries are creating enough jobs to boost some of the demand for what factories make  especially autos  Let s have a closer look 
 1  Global perspective  All this is increasingly evident in the JP Morgan Global PMIs for manufacturing  M PMI  and non manufacturing  NM PMI   The available data we have since 2010 show that the global NM PMI has generally exceeded the global M PMI  The spread between the two has actually widened since early 2014  During October  the NM PMI was 53 7  while the M PMI was 51 4 
 2  Country perspective  Not surprisingly  these trends which admittedly are still relatively new and therefore open to debate can be seen in most of the major economies of the world  since they must add up to the totals compiled by JP Morgan  During October  the spread between the NM PMI and M PMI in the US was 9 0ppts  the most since February 2001  and the fourth highest in the history of the series going back to July 1997 
In the Eurozone  the two were nearly identical from 2010 through 2013  but since then  the region s NM PMI has been consistently higher than the M PMI  In China  the NM PMI has exceeded the M PMI every month since the start of 2010  with an average spread of 4 4ppts  Interestingly  over the past two years since October 2013  NM PMIs among emerging market economies have averaged 51 3  while the comparable measure for developed countries has averaged 54 7 
 3  Third stage economies  Of course  this is all circumstantial evidence of a global transformation from manufacturing to services  However  there is plenty of evidence showing that the major  industrial  economies including the US  the UK  Canada  Australia  Japan  and the Eurozone countries have evolved into  services  economies  That s easiest to see by comparing employment in the services producing and goods producing sectors of these economies  The former has been outpacing the latter for at least three decades  A similar conclusion can be deduced by comparing real GDP of goods versus services 
So  for example  in the US  payroll employment in goods producing industries accounts for only 14  of total payroll employment  down from 44  during 1943  During Q3  services accounted for  9 9 trillion  saar  of real GDP  while goods accounted for  5 3 trillion of real GDP  Since services producing businesses tend to be less cyclical than goods producing ones  this transformation should moderate the business cycle 
 4  Know it alls  On the other hand  the transformation of the US economy from services producing industries to knowledge producing ones may increase the problem of structural unemployment for some workers  That s because knowledge workers spend their entire workday trying to figure out how to put the rest of us out of work 
They ve already figured out how to replace factory workers with robots  Indeed  robots are even starting to displace workers in China s factories  Last year  China was the single largest market for industrial robot sales  according to the International Federation of Robotics  IFR   and within two years there will be more industrial robots in Chinese factories than in either the European Union or the United States 
This is just the start  There are only 30 robots for every 10 000 manufacturing workers in China  compared with 323 per 10 000 in Japan and 437 per 10 000 in South Korea  IFR data show  Automation is also coming to the services sector  San Francisco start up company Momentum Machines  Inc  has set out to fully automate the production of gourmet quality hamburgers  McDonald s  N MCD  is well on the way to offering self serve kiosks at a majority of their stores instead of paying employees to ask   Do you want fries with that  ",2015-11-14,Ed Yardeni,https://www.investing.com/analysis/global-economy:-at-your-service-(excerpt)-271298,271298
196442,417958,MCD,Time Is Money  So What Can We Learn About Money From A Time Machine ,opinion,"For Americans who came of age in the 1980s  the future arrives today  Oct 21st  2015  the day Back to The Future s Marty McFly drops in from 1985 
The film s celebrated optimism and humor regarding the future has made a lasting cultural impression  including hoverboards  futuristic consumer electronics  and the  soon accurate   predictions of a female U S  President and the Chicago Cubs winning baseball s World Series 
It s fun to forensically diagnose technological predictions of the past  so we decided to tackle a form of technology also important to Marty and the film  the technology of money 
The film had many fun predictions  some of which landed just a bit off the mark  such as  50 00 for a bottle of Pepsi  But how have prices actually changed in since the mid 1980s  and why 
With the benefit of hindsight  what might 1985 Marty have done to protect his savings over the past 30 years  aside from knowing future sports scores  part of the plotline of the movie  and the film s other prediction of inequality  moral hazard and a general dystopia created from one way bets  
Big Mac Indexed Through Time
We start with a simple question  would Marty have been better off landing in the future with dollars  gold  or a savings account left to compound interest for 30 years  assuming of course his bank remained intact through the 1990s and 2000s crises   The result proves an important point in our core thesis  that gold is not an investment that grows over time  it is simply a store of value  something to protect your wages without taking a risk that your currency  bank savings  or investments are being managed poorly 
The Economist Magazine created a popular index of prices around the world by referencing one simple metric  the cost of a McDonald s  N MCD  Big Mac  Applying the same index across time  if 1985 Marty showed up at a McDonalds today  or  tomorrow I guess    how many Big Macs could his 1985 dollars  gold  or compounding savings account buy now  The results are as expected  see figure 1   the dollars are designed to lose value over time by the policy that guides them  which they did  a bank savings account performed better while banks paid interest  but with risk  and the price of a Big Mac in gold is basically unchanged  even after three decades and a radically different world politically  economically  and technologically   When it comes to savings  especially for tangible natural goods such as food and energy  gold has always been money technology defined by physics and geology  not creed or economic theory 
Figure 1  The price of a Big Mac in grams of gold is basically unchanged from 1985

Prices and the Technology of Money
We often forget that money and currencies are just another form of technology  And like other forms of technology  currency undergoes changes every decade or so  The dollars that Marty used in 1985  his standard measurement for value  are quite different than the dollars we use today  but we might not think about it because we use the same brand of currency and adapt along with it  while rarely testing other models  We know that Marty can no longer buy a new black pickup truck for less than 10 000 dollars  and he won t be buying a central California home for less than 100 000 dollars like his parents did  Is it because these things changed so significantly in quality or inputs  became scarce with more population and competition for them  or did the biggest change come from the money  technology  that measures them 
We learned from the Big Mac index that gold holds its value particularly well against other commodities  especially over long periods of time  Or conversely  food prices seem to only go up against currency  but are much more stable when saving with gold  Does this hold for other prices  Marty s movie ticket for that Jaws sequel 30 years later  the gasoline being pumped by robots at Texaco  What about the big expenses  the suburban house  tuition for Marty Jr   or health care for George McFly s back 
The prices that Marty would find outrageous  just as we do in our never ending bewilderment over today s lack of affordability  movie tickets  gasoline  new automobiles  even housing  all would have barely changed for Marty if measured in gold  see figure 2   Unfortunately  there remain costs  such as education and healthcare  where simple gold savings just don t keep up  proving that even gold cannot compete with the value of a good education or a healthy life  though these sectors could use a bit better technology as well   
Figure 2  Marty can buy roughly the same things if he brought gold to the future

Wages and the Technology of Savings
In 1985  it would have been hard to imagine the level of experimenting and reconfiguration taking place today in the technology of the US dollar and other world currencies  If Marty walked into a 2015 bank to find  08  interest rates on deposits  he would likely conclude that bankers had been outlawed along with the lawyers  as envisioned  yearned for   in the movie  Savers in 1985 received 125 times more interest on their deposits when lending to their banks  Marty would then be even more shocked to find that despite this absurdity  essentially paying to lend out wages as deposits  we spend more money on banks and financial services as a share of economy than ever before 
Today  bank savings rates are all but non existent  as policy makers attempt to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates under ever increasing public and private debt burdens  Inflation in real things has never gone away  especially the things that last and matter most  but the one price that hasn t kept up is the price of wages  Comparing prices another way  we try to project 1985 prices to 2015 levels using the consumer price index  CPI   We find that the CPI index is fairly meaningless for linking things like housing  food  or tuition  significantly undershooting them all  but does match the slow  growth  of wages  see figure 3 and 4   Which  of course  means that wages have not keep up with the price of essential things in life  and therefore it is more important than ever to save wages prudently  even when urged not to by negative real savings rates 
Figure 1  Prices for essential goods have gone up much more since 1985 than the respective CPI measures suggest
Figure 2  The only thing that stayed in line with CPI were wages  meaning that somebody with a median income is falling behind the cost or real things

Powering a Savings Time Machine 
At GoldMoney  we believe that prosperity and progress can only be achieved through hard work  savings and progressive innovation  There are no short cuts  there is no almanac from the future to deliver one way bets or risk free returns  We can only deliver on our hopes for the future through incremental progress and cooperation using a sound measurement system 
Gold is not an investment  it s not a quick fix that will make you rich  and it won t buy you more hamburgers  cars  or a better house in the future  But it has proven time and time again that it can store the value of labor in savings better than any other currency or banking technology  Gold is simply an extremely rare  dense  and high utility element that takes a lot of energy and labor to produce  Once it is produced  however  it takes very little effort to maintain  compared to all other elements or things that decay or disappear   and therefore  used over and over in calculations and transactions with almost infinite scalability  Gold powers cooperation by being the ultimate barter or exchange between savings and consumption of other necessities  While the mass of consumer goods of 1985 are essentially worthless as anything more than collectables at this point  October 1985 launch of Nintendo Entertainment System excluded  naturally      we still exchange the gold mined in 1885  the time when Seamus and Maggie McFly settled Hill Valley 
Or another way to look at it  gold is a highly efficient way to exchange the value of labor and energy over long periods of time  So how much energy powers this savings time machine  Well  if Marty bought a kilo of gold instead of his 1985 Toyota  we could calculate the energy value of this savings  Using 2015 average futures prices for oil and gold to date  we find that a kilo of gold is equivalent to roughly 712 barrels of oil  Using the Depart of Energy s energy equivalent standards for oil  we find that a barrel of oil is 5 8   10 6 BTUs or 1 7MWh 
So a kilo of gold is worth 712 x 1 7MWh  or   ",2015-10-21,GoldMoney News Desk,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/time-is-money,-so-what-can-we-learn-about-money-from-a-time-machine-268747",268747

The momentum is also falling off  Although the RSI remains in the bullish zone  it is pulling back  The MACD is about to cross down  which is a bearish signal that portends for some short term downside  It s not uncommon for a breakout to retest the breakout level before moving higher  This may be the case  or it may prove to be a failed breakout eventually  Either way  the chart looks better to the downside into the report

196455,417971,MCD,Is McDonald s Cooked  Or Serving Up More Dividends ,opinion,"We keep hearing about the demise of   NYSE MCD  
Now  there s no doubt that the company has faced some challenges lately 
Labor disputes  currency effects  questions over the food quality and nutrition  and changing consumer tastes have all coalesced to put the company   and its stock   in a precarious position 
Same store sales are down regularly and marketing initiatives haven t connected well with consumers 
But let s not forget that this is a  91 billion company that franchises and operates a combined 36 000  restaurants across 125 countries 
Let s also not forget that people have to eat  As long as McDonald s continues to conveniently provide good food at a great value  they ll very likely continue to sell billions of dollars  worth of cheeseburgers  fries  and beverages 
So let s talk about that demise  
What does that demise look like for the stock 
Well  first the long term performance  McDonald s total return over the last 10 years is an annualized 16 64   That obviously trounces ARCA SPY s 10 year annualized 7 71  
Short term  The stock is up 1 46  YTD  The S P 500 is roughly flat 
So that s the demise of MCD s stock  We now see that there s perhaps just a little hyperbole involved there 
What about the company s performance  That s ultimately what matters most  Stock prices go up and down  but long term business performance is what will ultimately drive returns  And it s growing earnings that will fuel growing dividends 
Using that same 10 year time frame as above  we can see revenue grew from  20 460 billion to  27 441 billion from fiscal years 2005 to 2014  That s a compound annual growth rate of 3 32  
Top line growth isn t particularly impressive  though the company is a victim of its own success  It s somewhat difficult to grow from such a large base  especially at a meaningful rate 
But per share profit growth is more impressive  earnings per share increased from  2 04 to  4 82 over this period  which is a compound annual growth rate of 10 02   However  growth over the last five years has slowed markedly 
Improving margins and a substantial reduction of the outstanding share count drove a lot of that additional bottom line growth  Shares outstanding have been reduced by over 20  over the last decade  That means there s 20  less shares across which to spread out the remaining profit 
S P Capital IQ anticipates that earnings per share will grow at a 7  compound annual rate over the next three years  which  while lower than what we saw over the last decade  is nowhere near a company on the brink of failure  That s still a pretty solid growth rate 
However  what makes this stock really attractive right now is the 3 6  yield  That s about 160 basis points higher than the broader market   a significant difference 
Add that 3 58  yield to the 7  expected underlying EPS growth  and you have the recipe for pretty solid returns moving forward 
But what really juices the prospects is the dividend growth  MCD has increased its dividend for the past 39 consecutive years  McDonald s is the only restaurant stock that is a  
That s almost four decades  That time frame includes the massive inflation of the early 80s  the savings and loan crisis  multiple wars  the financial crisis  and the Great Recession  So if you re looking for durability and consistency  look no further than McDonald s 
What s perhaps just as impressive as the length of dividend growth streak is the rate at which the dividend is growing  Over the last decade  the dividend has increased at an annual rate of 19 6   However  like recent EPS growth  the dividend hasn t increased as fast over the last five years 
Part of the reason the dividend hasn t grown much lately   besides the lack of underlying profit growth over the last five years   is the fact that the payout ratio now stands at 76 4   That means for every  1 in profit the company takes in  they re sending out a little over 76 cents to shareholders in the form of a dividend  The other  23 cents is retained by the company to continue growing 
That s a very high ratio  which limits the potential for future dividend raises because the company is already retaining somewhat little profit to reinvest back into the business  That huge dividend growth we see above has come at the cost of a payout ratio that s doubled over the last decade  so it s something to be mindful of in terms of one s expectations moving forward 
One other area of the company that does concern me a bit is the balance sheet 
While not necessarily worrisome in and of itself  it has deteriorated some over the last decade  This is a somewhat common sight among a lot of companies because cheap debt has made it easy for companies to leverage up and potentially boost returns to shareholders  But McDonald s balance sheet has deteriorated while growth has simultaneously slowed 
The long term debt equity ratio is 1 17 and the interest coverage ratio is approximately 14  Again  not bad numbers  especially relative to the industry  but I think there s room for improvement there 
However  McDonald s profitability really shines bright  Over the last five years  the company has averaged net margin of 19 59  and return on equity of 35 58   Really incredible numbers here  especially the margin  However  both metrics have been slipping as of late  That s something to keep an eye on 
Fundamentally  the company is in good shape  There has no doubt been some chinks in the armor lately  though  Growth is essentially flat over the last five years  margins are slipping  the balance sheet has deteriorated some  and global comparable sales decreased by 0 3  in May 2015   another disappointing sales report in a long line of them 
But there are initiatives here to be excited about  Steve Easterbrook  who took over CEO duties earlier this year  has announced that the company is going to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy through restructuring segments  refranchise 3 500 restaurants which will increase their franchised restaurants to 90  of the company total  improve the food  slim the menu  and also offer the ability to build custom burgers in select markets 
It will take time to turn a behemoth like McDonald s around  but you re paid a very attractive 3 58  yield to wait in the meanwhile  And you have to like the odds that people will continue to buy their products  The stores are ubiquitous and the food is still highly convenient and provides a great value proposition 
I m certainly enjoying being paid   the stock is in  and has long been a favorite of The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing 
Looking at the valuation  however  the stock appears a bit pricey  McDonald s sports a price to earnings ratio of 21 35  Not only is that high in absolute terms  but it also compares unfavorably to the five year average of 17 3  I always look for a margin of safety  especially with a company that s involved in a turnaround story 
But the P E ratio can only tell us so much 
I valued shares using a dividend discount model analysis with a 10  discount rate and a 6  long term dividend growth rate  That growth rate appears conservative  but the high payout ratio and lack of much growth over the last five years means that s likely what we ll see for the foreseeable future  especially with the forecast for EPS growth where it s at  For perspective  the most recent dividend increase was less than 5   The dividend discount model analysis gives me a fair value of  90 10 
So the stock doesn t appear significantly overvalued  but there also isn t a margin of safety here  As such  I d be cautious about buying MCD right now 
Overall  I think there s a lot to like  Ubiquitous stores across the entire world  A product that s improving  The company s aware of their issues and aiming to rectify them  Almost 40 straight years of dividend increases  which will likely continue well into the future  And a yield that s substantially higher than the broader market 
However  shares appear to lack a margin of safety right now  The current valuation doesn t seem to price in all the risks and potential for permanent lower growth moving forward  Not the best opportunity in the market  but a minor pullback would make this an interesting long term pick that provides substantial dividend income that s also likely to grow in excess of inflation ",2015-07-05,Sure Dividend,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-mcdonald’s-cooked…-or-serving-up-more-dividends-257169,257169

196467,417983,MCD,The Road To Hell Is Paved With Good Intentions ,opinion,"Seems like many politicos and main stream economists believe the solution  or at least part of the solution  for too many low incomes is to mandate a higher minimum wage  Let me say to start I believe the minimum wage is too low for a primary wage earner 
Follow up 
From the  

The weekly take home pay for a 40 hour a week minimum wage employee  after Social Security and Medicare taxes  That adds up to  13 926 38 per year  or just over  1 150 per month 

The average Joe is working for less compensation  red line on graph below  then average Joe did in the previous century 

Unless you live with others and ride a bike  instead of owning a car which is impractical for most Americans    few families can survive on  1 150 each month  Further  it suppresses spending per capita  lowering GDP  Low wages are NOT market friendly  Generally one would think that an economy running on all cylinders would raise wages  but there are other forces at work 
Many point to free trade agreements being the problem   which allows import of goods made by lower wage workers  In the past  it was likely this was true  there is no proof that trade agreements are good for employment   I doubt in 2015 it is a negative dynamic as the loss of jobs caused by lower wage imports was transitioned years ago 
The governing dynamic is that the natural worth of labor is now  1 per hour  This is because the average cost of a robot works out to  1 per hour over its operating life  However  the movement to robotics will be slow for a variety of factors  e g  public acceptance of directly dealing with a robot  working a robot into the operating structure and validating its worth   When labor costs rise  the urgency to use people replacing robotics increases  Many companies are in the later stages of    McDonald s  NYSE MCD  is rolling out its first robotic restaurant 



When thinking of mandating minimum wage  consider the effect of the  on shipping  The purpose of the Jones Act was to protect the Merchant Marine ships and maritime jobs by mandating certain requirements for USA flag ships  It did not save USA flag ships or jobs   it did the opposite  The Jones Act made USA shipping non competitive  Consumers generally purchase the cheapest item of acceptable quality   and ignore who is providing the product 

It is problematic to regulate economic elements that ultimately are driven by market forces  exceptions are for short periods to smooth out transitory factors   Low wages are a problem  The solution of mandating higher wages only reduces the number of jobs in the long term when market forces can provide remedies for reducing or eliminating the costs of higher wages through elimination of jobs  The problem is distribution of income in a world that has fewer and fewer jobs  Setting a higher minimum wage for a smaller working population has the best of intentions   but the road to hell is paved with good intentions

196483,417999,MCD,Entering Next Phase Of Global Economic Crisis,opinion,"Well  the Nasdaq finally did it  It has climbed all the way back to where it was at the peak of the dot com bubble  Back in March 2000  the NASDAQ Composite set an all time record high of 5 048 62  On Thursday  after all these years  that all time record was finally eclipsed  The Nasdaq closed at 5056 06  and Wall Street greatly rejoiced  So if you invested in the Nasdaq at the peak of the dot com bubble  you are just finally breaking even 15 years later  Unfortunately  the truth is that stocks have not been soaring because the U S  economy is fundamentally strong  Just like the last two times  what we are witnessing is an irrational financial bubble  Sometimes these irrational bubbles can last for a surprisingly long time  but in the end they always burst  And even now there are signs of economic trouble bubbling to the surface all around us  The following are 11 signs that we are entering the next phase of the global economic crisis 
 1 It is being projected that half of all fracking companies in the United States will be  dead or sold  by the end of this year 
 2 The rig count just continues to fall as the U S  oil industry implodes  Incredibly  the number of rigs in operation in the United States has fallen for 19 weeks in a row 
 3 McDonald s  NYSE MCD  s has announced that it will be closing 700  poor performing  restaurants in 2015  Why would McDonald s be doing this if the economy was actually getting better 
 4 As I wrote the other day  we could be right on the verge of a Greek debt default  In fact  we learned on Thursday that the Greek government has been  running on empty  for months 

Greece warned it will go bankrupt next week after failing to stump up enough cash to pay millions of public sector workers and its international debts 
Deputy finance minister Dimitras Mardas set alarm bells ringing yesterday when he declared the country had been  running on empty  since February 
With a debt repayment deadline looming on May 1  Greece faces the deeply damaging prospect of having to snub its own employees to make a  200m payment to the International Monetary Fund 

 5 Coal accounts for approximately 40 percent of all electrical generation on the entire planet  When the price of coal starts to drop  that is a sign that economic activity is slowing down  Just prior to the last financial crisis in 2008  the price of coal shot up dramatically and then crashed really hard  Well  guess what  The price of coal has been crashing again and it is already lower than it was at any point during the last recession 
 6 The price of iron ore has been crashing as well  It is down 35 percent in the last nine months and David Stockman believes that this is because of a major deflationary crisis that is brewing in China 

There is no better measure of the true contraction underway in China than the price of iron ore  The Wall Street stock peddlers will tell you not to be troubled by the 70  plunge from the 2012 highs and the 35  drop just in the last nine months  According to them  its all the fault of the big global miners who went overboard opening up massive new iron ore pits and mining infrastructure 

 7 At this point  China accounts for more total global trade than anyone else in the world  That is why it is so alarming that Chinese imports and exports are both absolutely collapsing 

China s monthly trade data shows exports fell in March from a year ago by 14 6  in yuan terms  compared to expectations for a rise of more than 8  
Imports meanwhile fell 12 3  in yuan terms compared to forecasts for a fall of more than 11  

 8 The number of publicly traded companies in the United States that filed for bankruptcy during the first quarter of 2015 was more than double the number that filed for bankruptcy during the first quarter of 2014 
 9 New home sales in the United States just declined at their fastest pace in almost two years 
 10 U S  manufacturing data has been shockingly weak lately 

On the heels of weak PMIs from Europe and Asia  Markit s US Manufacturing PMI plunged to 54 2 in April  from 55 7   Against expectations of a rise to 55 6  this is the biggest miss on record  Of course  this is  post weather  so talking heads will need to find another excuse as New Orders declined for the first time since Nov 2014 

 11 When priced according to  the average blue collar hourly wage   U S  stocks are the most expensive that they have ever been in history right now  To say that this financial bubble is overdue to burst is a massive understatement 
For a long time  I have been pointing to 2015 as a major  turning point  for the global financial system  and I still feel that way 
But for the first four months of this year  things have been surprisingly quiet   at least on the surface 
So what is going on 
Well  I believe that what we are experiencing right now is the proverbial  calm before the storm   There is all sorts of turmoil brewing just beneath the surface  but for the moment things seem like they are running along just fine to most people  Unfortunately  this period of quiet is not going to last much longer 
And those that are  in the know  are already moving their money in anticipation of what is coming  For example  consider the words of Snapchat founder and CEO Evan Spiegel 

Fed has created abnormal market conditions by printing money and keeping interest rates low  Investors are looking for growth anywhere they can find it and tech companies are good targets   at these values  however  all tech stocks are expensive   even looking at 5  years of revenue growth down the road  This means that most value driven investors have left the market and the remaining 5 10   increase in market value will be driven by momentum investors  At some point there won t be any momentum investors left buying at higher prices  and the market begins to tumble  May be 10 20  correction or something more significant  especially in tech stocks 

It may not happen next week  or even next month  but big financial trouble is coming 
And when it finally arrives  it is going to shock the world  even though anyone with any sense can see the coming crisis approaching from a mile away ",2015-04-24,Michael T.

196495,418011,MCD,McDonald s  The Next Fast Food REIT ,opinion,"With bond yields at historic lows  normally conservative investors have been forced to accept risks outside of their comfort zone 
These conditions are pushing activist investors to radically change the market s landscape with creative financial engineering 
Just look at the increasing pressure placed on restaurant chains 
Activist investors are forcing restaurants to spin off their real estate holdings into publicly traded   REITs  
On the surface  the rationale seems logical  The REIT provides significant tax advantages and increased dividends to investors  and the spinoff can potentially unlock massive value to shareholders 
Now  while it s true the ceding company would see added rental expenses  it s assumed that the increased value of the REIT s shares would far outweigh them 
In theory  it would be a win win for corporations and investors alike 
And the Golden Arches could be next 
Market Provoking Words
It s this all win theory that sent McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  shares up by more than 1 6  on Monday 
The increase came on the heels of comments made by Glenview Capital Management CEO Larry Robbins  who believes that McDonald s can unlock upwards of  20 billion in shareholder value 
Robbins believes that since REITs are currently trading at roughly 20x earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  EBITDA   the company s real estate assets aren t being properly reflected in MCD s current EBITDA valuation 
So  in a letter dated March 18  2015  Robbins stated that McDonald s shares could trade as high as  169 by monetizing its real estate assets  which  of course  includes his desire for a REIT conversion 
Robbins makes a valid point  but there are things for him to mull over  first 
A Few Financial Challenges to Consider
McDonald s must re establish its core mission before creating shareholder value via a REIT conversion  MCD shares have languished in a  15 range since 2011  amid lackluster sales and several years of losing customers to other fast casual competitors 
And this shows in the company s financial statements 
The company s Q4 2014 results showed total revenue of  6 5 billion  a decline of 7 3  against the  7 billion reported in the same quarter a year ago 
MCD also saw a decline in operating income   20    as well as in its diluted earnings per share  EPS   which fell 19 3  from the year ago period  Mind you  the falling EPS is a trend that has continued for roughly two years now 
For these reasons  my colleague  Chris Worthington  remains  
Why I Still Like McDonald s 
While the company s current problems run deep  McDonald s has experienced these same kinds of issues in the past  And it has always shown an innate ability to adapt to the changing times 
I m confident that the company will make another amazing comeback this time  too 
Now  in the interim  investors can take some consolation knowing that McDonald s treats its shareholders well  This is made evident by the company s 38 consecutive years of dividend increases and a current yield of 3 4   based on Monday s close 
Add to that the potential of a REIT conversion at some future time  and MCD will have to change its sign to read  Billions of Dollars Made Here

MCDONALDS 
Shares of McDonalds continue to drop  reaching the lowest levels of the past two weeks on Thursday as the announcement that it will raise the average pay at its U S  restaurants threatens to complicate an ongoing labor dispute on whether McDonald s  NYSE MCD  can be held responsible for the labor violations of its franchisees  The decision to hike wages will affect only 90 000 of the roughly 750 000 McDonald s restaurant workers in the United States  because almost 90 percent of McDonald s restaurants are run by franchisees  The decision to raise wages puts pressure on franchisees to do the same

196526,418042,MCD,Contrarian Trade  Time To Accumulate McDonald s,opinion,"On September 9  2014  McDonald s  NYSE MCD  produced yet another awful  

 McDonald s Corporation today announced that global comparable sales decreased 3 7  in August  Performance by segment was as follows  U S  down 2 8   Europe down 0 7   Asia Pacific  Middle East and Africa  APMEA  down 14 5   

In the U S  the problem is sluggish industry growth paired with intense competition  In Europe it is poor performance in Russia  surprise  surprise  and weak consumer sentiment  In Asia  MCD is dealing with major supplier issues in China  The Wall Street Journal blames millennials  but  of this explanation  The bad news completely overshadowed  later in the day that McDonald s will accept Apple Pay throughout the U S  Or perhaps this news helped propel MCD to an apparent bottoming the following day 
MCD closed on September 9th at a fresh 21 month low with a loss on the day of 1 5   The next day  MCD gapped marginally lower  traded marginally downward from there  and then the buyers took over  On volume of 12 0M shares   more than double  and much higher than the 9 7M shares traded on September 9th   MCD closed the day with a GAIN of 2 1   This 2 day whiplash created what is known as   a common bottoming pattern as buyers finally swoop in to pick up shares on the  cheap   the weakest hands are finally washed out  sellers are exhausted  and bulls and  value  players begin to reverse negative sentiment  In other words  this is a contrarian trade here 
McDonald s finally finds some surer footing as buyers rush in

It is not easy to find such an emphatic bottoming pattern  So when I find one  I get excited 
I am as bullish as I can get on this one by beginning a phase of aggressive accumulation of a position in MCD  I am starting with long term call options since I do not expect a quick and easy road back to all time highs  After all  MCD is NOT a momentum stock despite a decades long rise  see chart below   With a 3 4  yield  I am very interested in buying shares as well  but will wait out the bottoming pattern a little longer  stiff resistance is looming overhead with a declining 50 day moving average  DMA   Traders have a very clear stop sitting right below the intraday low for the year  If sellers manage to push MCD that low again  the bullish engulfing pattern is invalidated 
I rate those odds to be very low  MCD seems like a great risk reward buy here

196527,418043,MCD,McDonald s Looks Ready To Recover,opinion,"McDonald s   NYSE MCD  recent 13 dollar sell off caught many investors unprepared  If you are one of them  you may benefit from reading this 
 So  the Elliott Wave cycle 5 3 is complete and another rally is highly probable   This is an excerpt from our   posted on 2nd March 2014  The analyzed stock was McDonald s Corp  On the chart below you can see what the situation looked like  when that article was published 

As you can see  we were bullish on McDonald s  which  in terms of the Elliott Wave Principle  means that the minimum target for the expected upside move was above the previous top  left by wave 5 of the impulsive rally  Now  more than half a year later  we will show you what has happened with this forecast  The next chart illustrates the present condition of McDonald s stock prices 
 The chart shows that soon after our article  prices began rising and on 14th May  the new top has been reached  thus fulfilling the minimum target expectations  However  this rally did not have the necessary five waves  It consists of only three  labeled a b c in red  Then came the sharp five wave decline from 103 70 to 90 50  If we take a look at the whole price action on the daily chart  we will see a clear impulsive rise from 83 28 to 103 63  followed by a corrective pattern  that includes three waves A B C  with a 3 3 5 wave structure and a new top in wave B     Furthermore  pay attention to the level  where wave C seems to have found support   the 61 8  Fibonacci level

196528,418044,MCD,Here s Why McDonald s Stock Still Has Plenty Of Upside,opinion,"I believe McDonald s Corp   NYSE MCD  stock still has its best days ahead of it 
You won t hear it from the mainstream financial media  where a general sense of doom and gloom over the company seems to have settled in like a late summer thunder boomer because of a 3 7  downturn in global same store August sales   the worst since 2003  Worse  that comes on the heels of a report showing global sales decreasing by 2 5  in July 
Naturally  this has generated a fresh wave of criticism  Millions of investors have evidently listened  judging from MCD stock s performance as the herd piles on   or  out   as the case may be  It s off 10  from a 52 week high set on May 2014  My personal favorite obituary came from a memo to clients from Janney Capital Markets  stating  That s Not Ketchup    It s Blood  
No doubt it s fashionable to pile up on McDonald s right now  truthfully  there are some troubling indications for the company s short term outlook  But what s happening now is not the end of the world 
McDonald s stock still makes one heck of an investment if you ve got the right time frame  Readers who listened to me when I recommended it several years ago saw gains of more than 40  at the time of our strategic exit in August 2012  And those profits were made under circumstances very similar to today s   public ire and doubt 
So  at the risk of bringing back some of your most iconic childhood memories  let me explain to you why I m lovin  it 
MCD Stock  A Slump from a Perfect Storm
When I see a sharp downturn in any trend   be it employment numbers  a stock s price  or a company s sales   one question immediately comes to mind  Is this based on the company s fundamentals    or are external factors at work here 
In the case of McDonald s  we can conclude the latter  It s not commonly known  but a geographically broad swath of the world s middle class eats at McDonald s  This makes the company s quarterly profits  and specifically same store sales  a useful indication of how the world s middle class is powering consumer spending    or causing it to slow down during tougher times 
Two sharp  consecutive drops like we ve seen in the last two months are clear signs to me that the world s middle class is feeling pinched  that the  slowcovery  that s been championed by Washington and central bankers around the world since 2010 still shows no sign of taking off 
So yes  it s a global slump  But with more than 40  of all McDonald s stores located in the United States  it s no surprise that a pinched American middle class is the main factor here  In the same time period  sales in Europe were down a mere 0 7  
After a July meat packaging scandal in Shanghai  China  August sales were down by 14 5  in the Asia Pacific  Middle Eastern  and African  APMEA  segments  But the U S  market size dwarfs that of the APMEA s  making the global drop off far closer to the 2 8  seen in America 
Now  while these trends are a problem for the company that will cost it billions of dollars in revenue this year  there s no reason to think that they re here to stay 
McDonald s is facing headwinds on two major fronts  but like most short term market influences  they ll both stop blowing sooner or later  It was hurt terribly in Asia when Beijing  in response to the Shanghai meat scandal  enforced bans on imports of products processed by Husi Food Group  therefore suspending the sale of McDonald s chicken nuggets and chicken fillets in many Shanghai branches  Even worse  the scandal spilled over to McDonald s Corp  s Japanese unit  because 20  of the meat for chicken items in Japan is supplied by Husi  With 3 000 McDonald s stores in Japan  that marked an enormous setback 
As for the struggling American middle class that affected 40  of MCD s revenue last August    this too shall pass  The worst may be yet to come  in fact  I say it will   but that s another story  too  At the end of the day  this company was founded in 1940 on the eve of WWII and has survived wars  recessions  and now the Financial Crisis  It s got plenty of staying power 
A Model for Success
McDonald s may have a U S  presence that makes it vulnerable to turbulent times here  but that s rapidly changing  The company has undertaken  actually accelerated  to be more accurate its international expansion both to grow and defend itself against U S  economic troubles 
Just consider  McDonald s opened up 225 new stores in China in 2013 and is on track to open 300 more by the end of 2014  That s an increase of almost 15  in China this year alone  The company could open more than a 1 000 new outlets and still not achieve anything even remotely resembling the density it has here 
And the focus on China makes sense  A McKinsey   Co  report found that the number of people in China earning between  17 000 and  35 000 a year   China s middle class   is set to explode to more than 50  of China s populace by 2020  That s a more than 800  increase since 2010 
As has been the case in the United States  middle class customers are MCD s best demographic  The fact that McDonald s is expanding in China in such a serious way is an enormously bullish sign  Other regions are similar 
And it s just a fraction of the 1 500 new store openings that McDonald s has planned worldwide for 2014  It s a continuation of the  Plan to Win  laid out in a 2013 conference call by Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson  Thanks to this expansion  the company that serves 69 million customers a day will be able to serve even more 
Just Another Sign of Stability
A lot of analysts wondered  in the aftermath of that bad Sept  9 sales report  what McDonald s would do to reassure MCD stock investors  The answer was already apparent with a glance at the company s basic history  raise dividends 

McDonald s has raised its dividend every year since it began paying one out in 1976    bringing its total dividend payout to  0 85 a share  payable to shareholders on December 15  2014  This makes the company one of precious few worthy of your trust and secures its position as  Dividend Royalty  
All told  it will be paying out  800 million this quarter in the form of dividends    a remarkable feat for a company whose days are supposedly numbered 
I expect that McDonald s will turn the chapter on its sagging sales  perhaps even within the next quarter  That will be a great time to buy MCD stock and take part in its historic dividend 
In the meantime  investors who believe in  buy low and sell high  like I do should acknowledge the setbacks  accept them    and understand that they  too  will pass

196529,418045,MCD,USD CHF  Approaching Confluence,opinion,"Markets are in a bit of a better mood this morning as virtually all of the major equity indexes around the world either closed in the green or are currently levitating healthily in that area with the lone exception being the Japanese Nikkei index that closed down over 2   The impetus for the Nikkei fall was likely due to the Chinese GDP release that was actually better than consensus  but was still the worst result since 2009 and encouraged some JPY strength along with it  US stock markets on the other hand  have enjoyed a comfortable run to the topside despite McDonald s  NYSE MCD  missing on its earnings release this morning 
US economic data is lending a helping hand as well as Existing Home Sales beat consensus expectations of 5 11M with a 5 17M read  The 2 4  increase from last month s number is a welcome surprise particularly after last week s string of bad market days  and gives the US housing market a much needed boost 
Due to the positive vibe and good US data  the USD is catching a bid this morning as well  with one of the more interesting currency pairs being the USD CHF  Throughout the month of October  this pair has been slowly descending with an occasional retracement back up to a declining trend line  and coincidentally  it has approached that level once again  In addition  it is also approaching a level of previous support resistance which  combined with the trend line  forms a very interesting confluence 
So despite the positive feel of the market for the USD  the USD CHF may be prevented from advancing as our old friend  the trend  defends its turf  If this were to hold  watch for 0 9475 0 95 to potentially provide the necessary resistance for this pair to retest the 0 94 region once again  which it has been doing since early last week

196539,418055,MCD,Has Healthy Eating Hit A Tipping Point ,opinion,"Last week Sprouts Market  NASDAQ SFM   a smaller competitor of Whole Foods  NASDAQ WFM   made a comment that stood out to me on its conference call   The company said that middle income consumers are adopting healthier eating habits faster than any other segment 

 Studies today show that the most rapidly growing segment of Americans adopting healthier eating habits is primarily middle income consumers  For years  price and availability have long been viewed key barriers to attracting this middle income shopper 

If this is accurate  it may be an indication that the healthy eating trend has  crossed the chasm  to mass market adoption   The healthy eating trend has been brewing for a long time  but we may be at a point where awareness  availability and price have converged to a tipping point 
The  tipping point  theory could be an explanation for why we are finally starting to see negative comps at a company like McDonald s  NYSE MCD     Even though the healthy eating movement has grown rapidly for years  it may have been too niche up to this point to have a material impact on a behemoth like MCD s numbers   MCD grew US guest count all throughout the recession   In 2013 and so far this year though  guest count has been declining   If this is indeed an inflection point  it could be the start of more to come

196540,418056,MCD,Russia Risk to Western Companies  Mostly  Overblown,opinion,"Russia made news last week but shutting down four Moscow McDonald s restaurants  ostensibly for health code violations   But the move is widely viewed as Russia s latest  countersanction  against the West in retaliation for Western sanctions against Russia for its involvement in Ukraine   McDonald s first Russian restaurant opened in 1990 when Russia was still the communist Soviet Union is the most visited McDonald s location in the world 
While Russia is one of the company s biggest markets outside of North America  the closures are expected to be temporary and are not expected to inflict major long term damage on McDonald s Corp  NYSE MCD  
Other Western companies may indeed feel the pinch  and not just from sanctions or official bullying   Russia s economy is also contracting  potentially taking consumer spending with it 
Let s take a look at Western companies with strong ties to Russia and assess their potential Russia risk 
I ll start with German luxury automaker Daimler  OTC DDAIF   maker of the iconic Mercedes Benz   Daimler has been steadily increasing its presence in Russia  and as recently as July the company planned to  
Daimler s sales in Russia have also  up until very recently  been growing at a blistering pace   In the first half of 2014  Daimler sales in Russia were  after rising about 19  in 2013   But with Germany now leading the sanctions charge  its companies are now at risk   And Western automakers are a likely candidate in the event that there is another round of countersanctions 
Daimler s Russia sales could come grinding to a halt  and that seems to be the fear driving investors in the stock over the past month   German stocks  as measured by the iShares MSCI Germany ETF  ARCA EWG   were down about 13  from the June peak to the early August trough  though they have recovered modestly since then   Over the same period  Daimler was hit harder  down about 18  before recovering slightly 
Should Daimler investors be worried 
No   Though Russia was a promising market for Daimler and may be again once Ukraine fades from memory Russia is not one of Daimler s biggest markets   Daimler sold 1 5 million cars globally last year   Only 44 376 were sold in Russia  or less than 3  of the total   Were that amount to fall to zero which is unlikely it would not be catastrophic to Daimler s business 
Taking a bigger picture  while Russia is a promising export market for Germany  Germany s exposure to Russia is overstated   Russia accounts for only about 3  of total German imports  making Daimler pretty typical as far as German companies go 
Meanwhile  Daimler sells for a very reasonable 10 times earnings and sports a 3 6  dividend yield 
Moving on  let s take a look at European brewers    Heineken  AMS HEIN  recently warned that its sales volumes were down more than 10  in Russia  and this was before the effects of any countersanctions   But as a diversified global brewer  the slowdown in Russia is not particularly damaging for Heineken   Heineken s most promising growth markets are in Africa  Latin America and Asia   The entire Central and Eastern European region  of which Russia is a part  accounted for only 10 1  of operating profit last year 
I can t say the same for rival Carlsberg A S A  COP CARLa    Carlsberg which is based in Denmark is the largest brewer in Russia and generates about a third of its sales by volume in the country   Carlsberg saw is beer sales volumes  in Eastern Europe fall by 13  in the second quarter  and again  this is before the effects of any countersanctions by Moscow   Consumer confidence has been sagging for months  and the Russian government has been discouraging beer consumption for months as part of a public health drive 
Carlsberg is not expecting a speedy recovery either  the company indicated it might be closing some of its 10 breweries in Russia 
I ve been a major Heineken bull for years based on its strong competitive position in Africa  and I do not see any developments in Russia having much of an impact   But I would probably steer clear of Carlsberg for the time being 
What about oil and gas companies   Russia is  of course  one of the biggest players in the global energy industry  and virtually every international oil major has some connection to the country 
One U S  company potentially at risk is Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM    Exxon partnered with Russian energy giant Rosneft  MCX ROSN  in 2011 to develop Russia s massive artic reserves in a deal that could eventually  be worth as much as  500 billion   Exxon had negotiated a very favorable tax deal in exchange for its investment and expertise  and by Russian estimates the Artic region in question  
As a visible symbol of American industry  you might think that Exxon would be a very easy target for Russian reprisal   Though thus far  Putin has made no indication that he intends to punish Exxon  and in fact  as recently as mid August Putin praised Exxon as an  old and reliable partner     While Putin is no doubt itching to thumb his nose at the West  his relationship with the oil majors is simply too important to blow up over a political row 
The bigger risk to Exxon is not punishment from Russia  but rather the reality that it might not be able to invest as much as originally planned due to Western sanctions that limit the export of oil production equipment to Russia 
What about Exxon stock 
Despite being near its 52 week high  XOM is not particularly expensive  particularly by the standards of today s market valuations   XOM trades for less than 13 times forward earnings and yields a respectable 2 8  in dividends   A deepfreeze in Exxon s Russia operations would take a bite out of growth   But at current prices  you re not exactly paying a premium 
XOM is a decent buy at today s prices   Should it sell off on any escalation in tensions with Russia  I would consider it a strong buy

196551,418067,MCD,Where Next For The Big Mac ,opinion,"With earning season now in full swing  I thought it would be interesting to consider one of the Dow s bellwether stocks  namely McDonald s  NYSE MCD  which is due to report later today  The analysts  consensus view is that the stock is a mild buy with an EPS forecast for the quarter of  1 43  This is against the reported figure for the same quarter last year which was  1 38  So let s take a look at the technical picture 
On the daily chart  104 per share has certainly been the tipping point for McDonald s to date with the stock testing this price point twice last year in April and May before declining to find support in the  93 50 region  In 2014 this level has been tested once again  ironically at the same time of year  with the long legged doji candle signalling indecision coupled with falling volumes  The candle of early May was topped off with an isolated pivot high with the subsequent sell off through the  100 level and down to today s trading price of  97 98  The volumes over the last three weeks have been rising  suggesting further downside pressure  Any reversal on the fundamental news today will need to be accompanied by stopping volume and associated price action 
The deep platform of support between  95 and  96 50 should prevent the stock price declining further  and provided today s results are in line  or better   this may the catalyst for a return of some mildly bullish momentum ",2014-07-22,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/where-next-for-the-big-mac-220129,220129

196563,418079,MCD,S P Futures Rally  Timing Is Everything,opinion,"608 days since last 10  correction
As of Friday s close the S P futures  ESH14  have rallied 62 handles in 19 hours and 15 minutes in approximately 3 trading days  closing up  2 6  in two days and closing out the week with the first weekly gain in four weeks 
The S P took Friday s bad news of a lower than expected jobs number and made good of it  The S P closed out the two day rally with its best two day gain in four months 

Jobs Friday
Predicting the growth of the U S  job market is nearly impossible  What we do know is there is a lack of jobs 
When you take November s miserable 75 000 jobs created and Friday s  December s  113 000 jobs  that equals 188 000 jobs  basically one bad month  That s less than 4 000 jobs per state in two months 
Maybe my way of looking at it is slightly archaic  and we understand people are retiring  but when you consider that it would take 260 000  jobs a month for an extended period of time to get the U S  economy back on track  these numbers are way off  There is no job growth 
Timing is everything
By the end of January the S P was already unstable  Last January the S P closed up 16   down 5 out of 21 trading days  This January the S P closed up 11 out of 21 trading days with some big losses in between  Overall it was down 3 6  its worst monthly loss since May of 2012 
Believe it or not  the S P has actually been up 4 out of the first 5 trading days of February  Feb 3   43 8  Feb 4  10 9  Feb 5   30  Feb 6  22 6  Fed 7  26 9  This leaves the S P up 0 80  for the month 
The key to the rally is the timing  In the first 5 business days of February  the mutual funds showed up in force  While many traders overlook money flows and historical stats  we don t  and last week was a perfect example of why it s so important to follow month end and beginning of the month flows 
JP Morgan has advised investors to stay the course and buy the weakness rather than brace for a larger 7  10  correction  It doesn t matter what side you re on  the 62 handle turnaround was both jaw dropping and stunning and goes right back to our rule 
Want to know where the S P is going  Follow the money
The big stories over the weekend were mostly about the lower than expected jobs number and the big stock market rally  That the S P again took bad news and turned it into good news 
That s what the other writers want to tell you  but that s not really how it worked 
You know what  I will go one step further  it didn t matter what Friday s NFP number was because the S P was going up either way and it had nothing to do with the jobs number or some earnings name 
It had everything to do with beginning of the month mutual fund inflows  I have not seen any one else write about it but what I am going to show you is just the buying in the SPX from Monday  Feb  3  to Friday  Feb 7  It totaled 5 75 billion in SPX to BUY 
Monday  Feb  3  Buy  1 bil SPX Tuesday  Feb  4  Buy  1 9 bil SPX Wednesday  Feb  5  Buy  900mil SPX Thursday  Feb  6  Buy  950mil SPX Friday   Feb  7   Buy  1 bil SPX    5 75 billion To BUY in 5 days
Bull vs  bear
S P traders as a whole are used to the quick U turns  Unlike many of last year s  false starts   it will be hard to just overlook the last five 14  to 44 handle drops in the S P since Jan  2  Has the S P been tested  Yes 
Is the decline over  We don t think so  but we also want to point out that the Fed is still buying  65 billion a month in bonds and the PPT  never said they were going to just disappear  As MrTopStep has said several times   the bulls are not going down without a fight 
The Asian markets closed mostly higher and in Europe 8 of 11 markets are trading modestly higher  This week there are a total of 15 economic releases  10 T Bill and T Bond announcements and auctions and four Fed governors scheduled to speak  Today s trade starts with no economic releases and earnings from Loews Corp   L   Sprint Corp  S   Cisco Systems  CSCO Nasdaq   Deere   Co  DE    PepsiCo inc  PEP    MetLife Inc  MET  and McDonalds  MCD  January sales  According to Thomson Reuters  data shows that  of the 343 companies that have reported earnings in the S P 500 through Friday morning  67 9  have beaten Wall Street s expectations  just above the 67  gain of the last four quarters 
The S P has made a stunning turnaround  The speed of the rally tells us that not everyone has covered yet  Right now we don t think it will pay to be overly bullish or bearish  Including today  we have 10 trading days until the January S P options expiration 
Our view
The S P is a fast market right now  moving 20 to 45 handles a day  SPX volatility took a big hit with the VIX trading down to 15 29 during Friday s late push higher  its largest retreat since October 2013  What we learned last Friday is exactly what we said  the algos locking on to the jobs number headlines and after wiping out the sell stops down to 1732 earlier in the week it was time to chase the upside stops with all the new money going into stocks greasing the way  Sure  some people will say they  called  the low on Monday  but I bet they were not screaming  buy  buy  buy  on Wednesday morning when the ESH14 was pouring lower down to 1732  As for today  the numbers speak for themselves  Mondays are never kind to the S P and we suspect after such a big rout that bulls may get tired today  Above 1794 will be the first trap for the longs   you take it from there 
As always  keep an eye on the 10 handle rule and please use protective stops when trading futures and options

196564,418080,MCD,SoupMan  A Great Play For The Long Term ,opinion,Super Bowl XLVIII has come and gone  but its memory is still with us  The game itself made history  Big public companies were there to advertise their products  as always  However  contrary to what you may be thinking  it wasn t only the companies that paid  4 million that had their products promoted  SoupMan  SOUP   for instance  had its soup promoted without having to pay  4 million  This singular advantage opens up great opportunities upon which SoupMan can capitalize   The NFL selected SoupMan to serve cups of soup at the event as one of New York s iconic brands  I do find it fascinating that the NFL identifies such a small company as an iconic brand  In addition  I believe that  by serving its soup at the biggest event on TV  SoupMan got the best kind of promotion at the event   Bear in mind that SoupMan competes against a company like McDonald s  MCD   The truth is only a few people would take SoupMan seriously if all it did was play some jingle to attendees who are already addicted to well established fast foods like McDonald s  What it needed to do was to let its target customers taste its soup for free  which is exactly what it did  This would certainly play to its advantage considering that trials drive more sales than mere advertisement  Interestingly  investors can benefit from the free promotion that SoupMan enjoyed too   Investment highlights The first thing is that this free promotion will help SoupMan widen its reach  Considering the importance of the Super Bowl in the US  it is certain that every state were sufficiently represented at the event  In addition  it s next to certain that attendees from other states tasted SoupMan s soups  This  therefore  lays a basic marketing foundation for SoupMan to build on  As such  it should be relatively easier for SoupMan to expand into other states   Another benefit that the free Super Bowl promotion presents is brand loyalty  which is needed to thrive in the food services industry  Judging from the positive reviews SoupMan has had  it s safe to say that its soups are well accepted  Moreover  the fact that big grocers like Wal Mart and Whole Foods are displaying its soups on their shelves also suggests that its soups are delicious  Therefore  anyone who tasted its soup during the event and liked it would most likely want to buy it again  which is how brand loyalty grows   In addition  brand loyalty would foster a capital efficient business  Overtime  I ve found that businesses that have high brand loyalty are usually the most capital efficient ones  You just need to look at likes of Coca Cola Enterprises Inc   CCE  and  again  McDonald s to understand what I m saying  These companies don t have to spend a fortune on advertisements   The truth is you don t buy a bottle of Coke because you saw a Coke advert  You buy it because it s what people drink  This gives them the ability to cut down costs when need be  without really hurting their businesses  Moreover  this is why a company like Coca Cola was able to survive the last recession easily  Therefore  with brand loyalty  SoupMan will be able to build a capital efficient model   Interestingly  while the said brand loyalty is not huge at present  it appears SoupMan has already established a capital efficient business   The first thing that shows this is the way it markets its soups  The company understands that it doesn t have huge cash reserves  So instead of building its own stores  it went for the option of partnering with big supermarket across the country to display its soup on their shelves  It s easy to say that this is the only option it has since it doesn t have the capital  But NO  there are other options  Some companies would have taken on some debts to build or rent stores  Therefore  that SoupMan has taken this route shows that its management is quite prudent   Another thing that shows this is the fact that the company was able to reduce its operating expenses on a year over year basis during the first quarter by 15   You d appreciate this better if you think of the fact that most companies of its size are used to seeing their operating expenses increase at this stage   Looking at the performance of its products also shows that the company is expanding  During its first quarter ended November 30  2013  the company reported a 48  increase in revenue  The company said   Our quarter over quarter revenues increase of approximately 39  was primarily attributable to the continued introduction of our new Tetra Recart line of soups    Whenever a single product has such a huge effect on a company s growth  one should know that there is something special about the product  Simply put  the special thing about this particular line of soups is the Tetra Recart packaging  With information spreading around that canned products contain a cancer causing agent  consumers are beginning to avoid canned foods   Fortunately  it has been proven that Tetra Recart packaging doesn t carry this cancer causing agent  This gives SoupMan a competitive edge in the fast food market  something that s already apparent in its financial figures  For the first quarter  the company reported that its Tetra Recart soups accounted for 78  of its total revenue  And considering the free publicity that SoupMan enjoyed from the Super Bowl  I expect that the company will sell more of the Tetra Recart line of soups this year   Final words I would like to make it clear that I m taking a long term view for the company  Therefore  you should note that everything I discussed above is more feasible over a long term  As such  if you re always on the lookout for long term investment options  SoupMan could turn out a great play  In addition  you should note that its stock is a quite volatile at the moment  But that shouldn t be a problem if you re investing for the future ,2014-02-23,Craig

196565,418081,MCD,McDonald s Breakfast War Earnings Preview,opinion,"McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings before the market opens on Tuesday  April 22nd  On Tuesday earnings reports from both McDonald s and Yum  Brands may indicate who has drawn first blood in the fast food breakfast wars  Taco Bell recently rolled out a breakfast menu while McDonald s countered by offering a free coffee promotion  which could boost sales but simultaneously pressure margins  With the United States going through a shift away from greasy fast food McDonald s has done a commendable job to keep its menu fresh and add healthy alternatives to its menu like oatmeal  salads  and yogurt  This quarter Wall Street expects MCD s EPS to fall by 3c while revenue rises by 2  compared to FQ1 of last year  Here s what investors are expecting on Tuesday 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for McDonald s to report  1 23 EPS and  6 732B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 26 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  1 24 EPS and  6 735B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting McDonald s to beat the Wall Street consensus on both EPS and revenue by a very small margin 
By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a thin differential between the two groups  expectations 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  1 21 to  1 27 EPS and from  6 622B to  6 816B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a narrow distribution of estimates on MCD 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A narrow distribution of estimates signaling more agreement in the market  which could mean less volatility post earnings 

Over the past 4 months the Wall Street EPS consensus has fallen from  1 28 to  1 23 while the Estimize consensus declined from  1 28 to  1 24  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus sank from  6 878B to  6 732B while the Estimize consensus gradually decreased from  6 842B to  6 735B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and downward estimate revisions at the end of the quarter are often a bearish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is WallStreetBean who projects  1 24 EPS and  6 712B in revenue  WallStreetBean is ranked 10th overall among over 4 150 contributing analysts  This season WallStreetBean has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 64  of the time throughout 11 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case WallStreetBean is expecting McDonald s to report in line with the Estimize community s EPS consensus but come up short on revenue 


Fast food breakfast wars have played out on the public stage this quarter  Taco Bell targeted Mickie D s with an ad campaign featuring real men named Ronald McDonald talking about how much they loved the new Taco Bell breakfast offerings  McDonald s maintains roughly 30  market share on the breakfast crowd and has bigger fish to fry than Taco Bell  Instead McDonald s is setting its sights on Dunkin  Brands and Starbucks which have both experienced phenomenal growth in recent years  Giving away free coffee is an inexpensive ploy to get more breakfast goers in the door and if any of them add a morning coffee at McDonald s to their daily routine instead of Starbucks or Donut Donuts this could prove to be a fruitful move

196584,418100,MCD,January High Yield Dividend Champion,opinion,In December 2010  I created a screen hypothetical portfolio called the  High Yield Dividend Champion Portfolio   The screen is tracked publicly as a continuous hypothetical portfolio with a starting balance of  100 000 on     The High Yield Dividend Champion Portfolio uses a small number of historically relevant ideas to create a simple  yet powerful investment plan  As I   Some studies have shown that the  highest yielding  low payout stocks perform better over time than stocks with higher payouts and lower yields     The High Yield Dividend Champion Portfolio attempts to capture the best high yield  low payout stocks with a history of raising dividends  There are numerous ways to rank high yield low payout stocks  The screening process for this portfolio starts with the  Dividend Champions  as compiled by   The list is comprised of stocks that have increased their dividend payout for at least 25 consecutive years    To date the portfolio is up over 74   I mentioned in the  that valuation of high yield stocks was a concern  see  and    I do not know what 2014 will bring  but I have lowered my expectations for future returns of US equities and high yield stocks    There are a number of ways to filter high yield stocks to avoid those susceptible to a  crash   The High Yield Dividend Champion portfolio starts with the Dividend Champion list  comprised of quality stocks that have sustained dividend growth over the past 25 years  In addition  the payout ratio rank and dividend growth rank filter stocks which may have unsustainable payouts or low dividend growth    For 2014 I am adding a valuation filter to the screen  We still begin with the Dividend Champion list  which is first sorted by yield and the lowest 50  yielding stocks are eliminated  Eliminating the lowest yielding stocks ensures only stocks with a relatively  high  yield make the portfolio    The remaining stocks are then assigned a rank based on their yield  the higher the yield the higher the rank   payout ratio  the lower the payout ratio the higher the rank   3 year dividend growth rate  and price earnings  P E  ratio  Extra weight is given to yield and payout ratio rankings  The 5 10 year Dividend Acceleration Deceleration metric will no longer be used  5 year average increase divided by 10 year average increase    The top 10 stocks based on the new ranking system make the portfolio  Stocks will be sold at the re balance date  generally around the 5th of the month  when they drop out of the top 15  to limit turnover  and are replaced with the next highest rated stock    There is turnover in two positions this month  WGL Holdings Inc   WGL  is being sold at a capital gain of 2 49  and original purchase date of 12 6 12  Northwest Natural Gas  NWN  is being sold at a capital loss of 4 66  and original purchase date of 4 5 13    Proceeds from the sales will be used to purchase McDonalds  MCD  and Tompkins Financial  TMP     The top 15 stocks based on my ranking methodology are below and displayed in order of their overall ranking  figures are December month end  The current portfolio is below If you enjoy these free tools  please consider making a donation on the home page of Scott s Investments using the Paypal link in the upper right corner Disclaimer  Stock Loon LLC  Scott s Investments and its author is not a financial adviser  Stock Loon LLC  Scott s Investments and its author does not offer recommendations or personal investment advice to any specific person for any particular purpose  Please consult your own investment adviser and do your own due diligence before making any investment decisions ,2014-01-06,Scott's Investments,https://www.investing.com/analysis/january-high-yield-dividend-champion-197595,197595
196585,418101,MCD,Warren Buffett s Secret For Picking Great Stocks   Moat  Investing,opinion,One of Warren Buffett s greatest investment ideas concerned  economic moats  What he meant by this was to invest in companies with significant competitive advantage that stops competitors from breaking into their market share  These competitive advantages served as  moats  around these businesses  much as a moat of water would protect a castle from intruders in medieval times To consider how  moat  investing works in the real world  let s consider McDonalds  MCD  For starters  MCD has a moat  MCD was launched in 1940  Burger King was launched in 1953  Wendy s was launched in 1969 Despite these competitors moving into its space  MCD has thrived  growing to become the largest hamburger based business in the world  its 2012 revenues were  27 billion compared to Burger King s  1 9 billion and Wendy s  2 5 billion Today  MCD has over 34 000 restaurants based in 199 countries employing 1 8 million people  Obviously the company is able to defend its market share from competitors  That s an economic moat Between this and the company s focus on producing returns to shareholders  those who invested in MCD and held for the long term have dramatically outperformed the market and built literal fortunes Indeed  had you in McDonalds in 1986  you would have outperformed the S P 500 by a simply enormous margin  see Figure 1 below   Not only that but you would have crushed every asset manager on planet earth with very few exceptions Regarding returns to shareholders  MCD has paid dividends every year for 37 years and has increased its dividend at least once per year Dividends per share have increased from  0 11 in 1986 to  2 87 in 2012  Those who invested in MCD shares in 1986 are receiving a yield of nearly 30  per year on their initial investment today just from dividends alone MCD is so focused on producing returns for shareholders that the company has bought back 23  of its shares outstanding in the last ten years  So even investors who bought in 2000 have experienced a synthetic yield of roughly 5  per year However  the most dramatic returns produced by  moat  investing are evident through the power of compounding as illustrated by MCD s Dividend Re Investment Plan or DRIP  a plan through which cash dividend payouts were automatically used to buy more MCD shares  If you had invested in MCD s DRIP program in 1988  you would have turned  1 000 into over  23 000 by the end of 2012  This is not by adding to your positions  this is the result of one single  1000 purchase of MCD stock This example of  moat  investing is precisely the kind of wealth generating investment that has made Warren Buffett a billionaire ,2014-01-16,Phoenix Capital Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/warren-buffett’s-secret-for-picking-great-stocks:-""moat""-investing-198918",198918
196586,418102,MCD,What The Buy Side Expects From Starbucks,opinion,"Starbucks Corp   SBUX  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings after the market closes on Thursday  January 23  Over the past few years we have seen the rise of Starbucks as a global leader in coffee  The company founded in Pike Place Market in Seattle now touts 20 891 stores in over 60 countries  In 2013 SBUX stock had an incredible year  the price was up 43  and financial expectations are very high for 2014 
Wall Street analysts are projecting about 13  year over year revenue growth and about 21  yoy EPS growth  As Starbucks are setup in malls across the US  the poor retail sales numbers from this holiday season could become a factor  Less shopping mall traffic could easily mean fewer sales for Starbucks and that may have an impact on the top line  Additionally increased competition in the coffee business from McDonald s  MCD  and Dunkin Brands Group  DNKN  could come into play making it more difficult for Starbucks to keep up with the high expectations from Wall Street  Here s what the buy side is expecting from Starbucks this quarter 
contributors 
The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Starbucks to report 69c EPS and  4 298B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 39 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 69c EPS and  4 286B revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com communtiy is expecting Starbucks to miss the Wall Street consensus on revenue and report in line on profit 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a very small differential between the 2 groups  forecasts 
By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69 5  more accurate than Wall Street  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the
expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus  
The distribution of estimates published by analysts on Estimize range from 66c to 72c EPS and  4 209B to  4 367B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a moderate distribution of estimates compared to previous quarters 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A larger distribution of estimates signaling the potential for greater volatility post earnings  a smaller vice versa 
The Wall Street EPS consensus went up temporarily but returned to its original value of 69c  The Wall Street revenue consensus increased throughout the quarter from  4 285B to  4 298B  The Estimize EPS consensus slipped from 70c to 69c and the Estimize revenue consensus fell from  4 295B to  4 286B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and at the very end of the quarter we saw upward revenue revisions from both groups 
The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is Analyst 7718081 who projects  2 52 EPS and  5 640B in revenue  In the Winter 2014 season  Analyst 7718081 is currently ranked as the 46th best analyst and is ranked 253rd overall among over 3 450 contributing analysts  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case the highest rated analyst agrees with the Estimize community that Starbucks will report inline on profit but come up slightly short on revenue 
The growth projections are high for Starbucks which helps to explain why the stock price has increased so steadily since 2009  However  this quarter analysts on the Estimize com platform are expecting Starbucks to meet Wall Street expectations on profit but miss on revenue

196587,418103,MCD,Stocks Reviewed  Valeant  Celgene  McDonald s And More,opinion,"Over the weekend I offered to look at any one stock you may want some additional insight on during the sell off at the end of last week  Usually I just response to each individual but this time I decided to create one post where all of the stock analysis can be found for all to see 
Valeant Pharmaceuticals   VRX 
Q  I would like your opinion about a pharmaceutical stock thats just coming on the radar   VRX  I would like to know your opinion of purchasing   say another 200 shares for long term investment 
A  I believe VRX is susceptible to a deeper correction based on how long the RSI has remained in an over bought state  My targets are between  105    110  if you where looking to add to a position that you are already currently invested in 
CELG
Q  I don t currently own Celgene Corporation   CELG  but I m looking for an entry 
A  The  135  140 range should provide good support if you were looking for a swing trade in CELG  Also watch the RSI as it trades down near the 40 level  this should coincide with a short term bottom in this stock 
GWPH
Q  How about GW Pharmaceuticals Plc   GWPH   I don t own it and I missed it completely but I m looking for a safe entry to go long on it  Please let me know  Thanks 
A  I agree that you have missed it and if you do want to own this stock your going to have to be patient and let it come back a bit  It needs to have a deep correction and work off some of its over bought condition  If I was looking to buy this it would be in the  30  32 range  Buying it any higher than that level would expose yourself to a lot of risk as it does have the potential to have a swift pull back  I don t normally cover stocks that have a average daily volume of under 500 000  so please be aware of that for next time 
MCD
Q  I am currently Short   McDonald s Corporation   MCD  stock from 95 45  Your analysis of downside price targets would be appreciated  thanks 
A  Based on my analysis  I believe McDonalds has a good shot at breaking through the 93 level of support and could trade down to the  86 to  88 in a fairly short amount of time  that would be a good target objective for one  who is short at this stock  It is my belief that this bullish cycle that McDonalds has been in since 2006 is over 
GE
Q  I would like your opinion on General Mills Inc   GIS  as I am currently long and have owned this position with the long term gain in IRA 
Not liking the recent  price action and Fri s close below 6 month 50  Fib of  25 34
Based on Fundamentals  news  and blog reading I m waiting for a bounce to buy more  but I don t want to loose my gain   I consider Fri s close to be out of the uptrend and EMAs are pointing down 
Even the 1 22 average broker score was Bullish 
A  GE may temporary bounce up into the  25 50 to  25 80 level  but over all I think that this stock is going to pull back much further  As you know being a tradewithZEN subscriber I closed out of this position back in November at  26 90 and I no longer feel its a stock worth covering on a long side 
ARTX
Q  I m currently holding Arotech Corporation   ARTX  and the stock has come down almost 25  from its high  Please advise if it is likely to rebound and if it is advisable to hold on a 1 month time period 
A  Given that I don t know your entry price I m gonna give my analysis on this as if I was thinking about buying the stock without having a position   Given current levels and how strong of a rally it had of the November lows I believe now represents a decent level where I would potentially take a 1 3 position  Expect some volatility and also know that there is an outside chance that this pulls back to  2 40 to  2 50 leve  That is why I only enter a small position now because I do believe there is some downside risk  Having said that  there is an opportunity for this stock to rebound from current levels because it has been so strong  If you are under water in this position  I would use any rallies up near the  320 to  330 to unload my shares if it moves higher before it pulls back to my target of  2 50 
CHK
Q  Looking to buy 
A  Well I m not crazy about the daily chart of Chesapeake Energy Corporation   CHK   when viewing the weekly chart it appears there are strong support in the  24 area  It may not make it down that low  but if I was looking to buy this that s the level that would offer the best reward risk 
AFOP
Q  I own Alliance Fiber Optic Products Inc   AFOP  at  17 25 should I cut and run or is it worth holding presently 
A  I really like the look of the weekly chart of  AFOP and believe the worst of it is behind it  When you view the RSI you see how last spring and summer this stock was really strong and a pullback into the 40 range which is exactly what a strong stock should do and it should bounce in that level just as it has  I believe that this stock will trade back up into previous resistance between 20 and 22 and I think once it gets back to the 20 level you should take half off and said a stop at your entry price and allow this  some flexibility to run higher because it could take out previous highs and move beyond that 
IDRA
Q  Please give me your opinion on Idera Pharmaceuticals Inc   IDRA  
A  Given the run that this has had since November 2013 from  2 a share all the way up to  5 50 share  I believe this is put in a short term top and needs to have a decent pullback and reset before this one moves higher  A good level to start accumulating the shares of this stock would be around  3 a share  I would scaling a 1 3 position there and average down when it hit  2 50  if it hits  2 50  Often times when I see a RSI that is a strong as it was in August pullback and not go below 50  and then rally back up above 70 it normally signifies a stock that is over heated and it needs to have a deeper correction to remove some of the bullishness from the stock 

I also wanted to give you a heads up that there are only 17 spots left in the tradewithZEN trade advisory service before it s capped at 100  I won t allow more than that as I don t want that many people watching the same stocks as me  Take a look below at some recent testimonials and decide for yourself if  25 month is worth it to have a watchlist of high performing stocks delivery via twitter with a complete trade plan and real time entry exits ",2014-01-27,Jeff Pierce,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-reviewed:-valeant,-celgene,-mcdonald's-and-more-200108",200108
196588,418104,MCD,You Would Be Better Off Buying McDonalds,opinion,"Okay let s roll the promoted stocks scoreboard 
Tonight s loser in waiting is Fresh Healthy Vending  VEND    But before I go there  let me point you to an article I read today regarding promoted stock scams 

We ll start with the fact that there is  sic  essentially four kinds of penny stock companies in the Pump   Dump world   1  the kind where the management is in on the scam and is directly knowledgeable and complicit with the intent to deceive the public   2  the kind where some poor schmoe has a great idea  at least he thinks it is  that requires financing  and becomes the mark of a parasitic  funder  who makes all kinds of promises of unlimited monies and riches beyond the mark s wildest dream   3  the kind where the company is absolutely for real but the shares have been hyped  sometimes hijacked  into ridiculous valuations  and   4  a hijacked empty and inactive shell 

The following    I appreciated it  because it clarified my thinking   I ve seen all four of these  but I did n t realize it until now   My error was looking for one common modus operandi  when there are a variety of parties that can benefit from a stock promotion 
Fresh Healthy Vending fits the first category of promoted stock scams   Read this portion of the Disclaimer 

The Wall Street Revelator and or its publisher  Andrew   Lynn Carpenter  dba The Wall Street Revelator has received a total amount of Seventeen thousand five hundred dollars in cash compensation to assist in the writing of this Advertisement  as well as potential future subscription and advertising revenues  the amount of which is not known at this time with respect to the publication of this Advertisement and future publications  Brown Dog Marketing  Inc  paid two million three hundred thousand dollars to marketing vendors to pay for all the costs of creating and distributing this Advertisement  including printing and postage  in an effort to build investor and market awareness 
If successful  the Advertisement will increase investor and market awareness  which may result in increased numbers of shareholders owning and trading the common stock of Fresh Healthy Vending Inc  increased trading volumes  and possibly increased share price of the common stock of Fresh Healthy Vending Inc 
Brown Dog Marketing  Inc  was paid by non affiliate shareholders who fully intend to sell their shares without notice into this Advertisement market awareness campaign  including selling into increased volume and share price that may result from this Advertisement market awareness campaign  The non affiliate shareholders may also purchase shares without notice at any time before  during or after this Advertisement market awareness campaign  Non affiliate shareholders acted as advisors to Brown Dog Marketing  Inc  in this Advertisement and market awareness campaign  including providing outside research  materials  and information to outside writers to compile written materials as part of this market awareness campaign 

The bolding is mine 
The scam is rarely this bald   The type for the disclaimer is 5 or 6 points   Very tiny  though I have seen smaller   But why be so plain   Because few read it  and it immunizes them from any lawsuits 
In this case  one guy owns  65  of the company  and he got the shares at a very low cost in the reverse merger that converted a  green advertising  company into a company that vends healthy snacks   He has a history of his own that should raise a yellow flag   But the rest of the holders that provided financing  have the chance to get out at much higher valuations as a result of the pump and dump going on here 
As a result of the reverse merger  this is a real company  unlike most promoted stocks   It has real revenues  but still has negative net worth and regular losses   Why this company has a market cap over  100 million is a mystery to me  aside from the promotional activity over the last few months   Aside from that  its revenue growth is slowing  and it faces a number of lawsuits over its behavior as a franchisor 
Given trading volumes since the promotions began  it would not surprise me if the selling shareholders are out of their positions in full by now   It would also not surprise me if this company did a PIPE or a secondary to monetize the gains of the main holder at a lower valuation 
As with all promoted stocks  this is something to stay away from   On a speculative level  one can never tell where a stock like this will break down  but I can tell you this  it is coming soon  and holders at this price level will lose money ",2014-02-05,David Merkel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/you-would-be-better-off-buying-mcdonalds-201334,201334
196589,418105,MCD,McDonald s Supported By 92 86 Level  Will It Bounce ,opinion,"McDonald s Corporation   MCD  has fallen to the important support area of the 92 86 level  If the downward momentum continues for today  then we may see a breakout of this level to the downside  None the less  there is a good probability of prices bouncing from this zone to the upside  If we do get a breakout to the downside  then we should wait for the retracement to go short  sell   To the upside  the most relevant resistance is still the 96 00 area  where we have the 200 EMA and the 55 EMA crossing by 
  On the 4 hour chart  we see in better detail the visits that the price has done to the 92 86 level and how strong this support area has been  We also see that the 200 EMA on this 4 hour chart is almost exactly at the 96 00 level  making this zone an even more relevant resistance area  In case of a breakout to the downside  we already know what to do  but again  there is a higher probability of prices bouncing from here to the upside ",2014-02-05,Masterforex-V,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/mcdonald’s-supported-by-92.86-level,-will-it-bounce-201399",201399

196605,418121,MCD,Monday  Expect Stock Market To Rise ,opinion,Stock Markets will likely rise on Monday due to last week s positive momentum moving forward this weekUS stock markets will likely rise for Monday  as investors seem poised to keep the bulls running hard after last week s volatility  The S P 500  SPY  added  65  on Friday to close at 1744 50  which is a new record   while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DIA  added  18  to close at 15 399 65 and the NASDAQ Composite  QQQ  added 1 32  to close at 3914 28 Last week was a tough one as I only called one correct day out of five trading days  Investors appeared so certain that a US default was off the table  contrary to my belief that the US can default under certain political circumstances  Naturally  I understood the  no default  relief rally on Thursday and Friday  despite the fact that we will be facing this problem again in February So for Monday  October 21st  I am predicting a stock market rise  due to the fact that the bulls are still in control and that investor sentiment appears to be fueled by greed and the need to see just how high markets can go From a technical perspective  the S P 500  SPY  has a very robust MACD at 5 516 and a rising RSI at 65 89  The index is showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon  although my first red alert will come when the RSI rises above the 70 0 threshold  indicating an overbought situation  So with momentum on the bulls side  I say let the bulls run for Monday International markets are already trading in the green at the time of this writing  with the Nikkei Index  FXY  trading into solid 1  gains and the Hang Seng Index  EWH  adding half a percent  European markets finished last week well into the green  with the FTSE 100  EWU    DAX  EWG  and CAC 40  EWQ  all clearing over half a percent  All of these performances bode well for the Bulls on Monday US futures markets are also trading green at the time of this writing  suggesting more positive investor sentiment for Monday The VIX Index  VXX  or fear indicator lost a whopping 3 26  on Friday and a total of 17 05  all last week  Fear does not appear to be in style at the moment  clearly   which bodes well for the bulls US Treasury Bond prices are perhaps the only divergence from a positive day on Monday  with the 30 Year US Treasury Bond Index  TLT  rising  33  on Friday  Although this move may suggest lower prices for equity markets in the near future  such a small move for US Treasuries should to have that large of an impact on Monday Gold  GLD  prices are currently down  28  compared to a  17  increase for oil prices  USO  last week  I would call these results a wash at the moment for influencing Monday s stock market performance Monday also brings us a heavy week of earnings reports from Wall Street favorites Netflix  NFLX   McDonalds  MCD   Texas Instruments  TXN   and Amazon  AMZN   The general projected consensus for this week s earnings reports appears positive  or at least accepting of the fact that the US economy continues to bump along at an anemic rate  We are also due out for an Existing Home Sales Report  which is forecast to be negative And  for our fun fact of the day  Singapore Airlines currently runs the longest flight in the world  which connects Singapore and Newark  New Jersey with a 19 hour flight  According to CNN com  the airline plans to drop the longest route in the world this year  due to lack of demand  I guess not many people want to chill out on a plane for 19 hours  surprise surprise Bottom line   I predict a stock market rise for Monday  due to current bullish momentum  Is another record in sight for the S P 500  SPY  Disclaimer  The content included herein is for educational and informational purposes only  and readers agree to Wall Street Sector Selector s     and  before accessing or using this or any other publication by Wall Street Sector Selector or Ridgeline Media Group  LLC ,2013-10-21,John Nyaradi,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monday:-expect-stock-market-to-rise-188716,188716

196607,418123,MCD,Don t Worry   The Government Says That The Inflation You See Is Just You,opinion,If you believe that there is high inflation in the United States  you are just imagining things  That is the message that the U S  government and the Federal Reserve would have us to believe  You might have noticed that the government announced on Wednesday that the cost of living increase for Social Security beneficiaries will  next year  This is one of the smallest cost of living increases that we have ever seen  The federal government is able to get away with this because the official numbers say that there is hardly any inflation in the U S  right now  Of course anyone that shops for groceries or that pays bills regularly knows what a load of nonsense the official inflation rate is  The U S  government has changed the way that inflation is calculated numerous times since 1978  and each time it has been changed the goal has been to make inflation appear to be even lower  According to John Williams of shadowstats com  if the inflation rate was still calculated the same way that it was back when Jimmy Carter was president  the official rate of inflation would be somewhere   But if the mainstream news actually reported such a number  everyone would be screaming and yelling about getting inflation under control  Instead  the super low number that gets put out to the public makes it look like the Federal Reserve has plenty of room to do even more reckless money printing  It is a giant scam  but most Americans are falling for it  Meanwhile  the prices of the things that most Americans buy on a regular basis just keep going up  The following are just a few examples of price inflation that we have seen lately     McDonald s has killed the dollar menu because it is becoming impossible to     But don t worry   the government says that the inflation you see is just your imagination   Amazon com has raised the minimum order size required for free shipping   But don t worry   you can afford to order more stuff thanks to the great new job that you got during this  economic recovery    It is being projected that those using natural gas to heat their homes will see their heating costs rise  this winter  But don t worry    global warming  should kick in to high gear any day now   The price of chocolate has gone up  since 2007  and it is being projected that it will now be increasing at an even faster pace  But don t worry   eating chocolate is bad for you anyway   Thanks to Obamacare  the health insurance premiums of many American families are absolutely skyrocketing  As I wrote about   one family down in Texas just got a letter informing them that their health insurance premiums are going up by 539 percent  But don t worry   this is just  health care reform  in action  Meanwhile  things just continue to  for middle class American families  Household incomes have actually been declining  and total consumer credit has risen by a whopping  over the past three years  The quality of our jobs continues to go down and our paychecks are not keeping up with inflation  In fact  40 percent of all U S  workers are now making less than  after you account for inflation  So what do the  authorities  say that the solution to our problems is  They want even more inflation of course  According to   many Federal Reserve officials  including Janet Yellen  believe that what the U S  economy really needs is a lot more inflation    Inflation is widely reviled as a kind of tax on modern life  but as Federal Reserve policy makers prepare to meet this week  there is growing concern inside and outside the Fed that inflation is not rising fast enough  Some economists say more inflation is just what the American economy needs to escape from a half decade of sluggish growth and high unemployment  The Fed has worked for decades to suppress inflation  but economists  including Janet Yellen  President Obama s nominee to lead the Fed starting next year  have long argued that a little inflation is particularly valuable when the economy is weak  Rising prices help companies increase profits  rising wages help borrowers repay debts  Inflation also encourages people and businesses to borrow money and spend it more quickly  The rest of that article goes on and on about how wonderful inflation is for an economy and about how the U S  economy desperately needs some more of it  Well  if that was actually true  then  should have had one of the best economies in the history of mankind  But this inevitably happens when a nation starts producing fiat currency that is backed by absolutely nothing  There is always a temptation to just print a little bit more  In the end  we are going to be destroyed by our own foolishness  We have the de facto reserve currency of the planet  and the rest of the world has trusted it for decades  But now we are systematically destroying our currency  and the rest of the globe   If you want to see a very good example of the impact that inflation has had on our economy in recent years  just check out  which shows what the Federal Reserve s reckless policies have done to the prices of commodities  Ultimately  the U S  dollar will be destroyed  and we will have done it to ourselves  Many people are attempting to protect themselves against this inevitability by putting a lot of their money into hard assets such as gold and silver  but before you do that you might want to make sure that you don t have a vengeful spouse that will toss it all into a dumpster someday  The following is from a recent     A Colorado man was so angry at his ex wife for divorcing him that he had the couple s life savings of  500 000 converted to gold   then tossed it in a dumpster so she couldn t have any of it  the   In June  Earl Ray Jones  52  of Divide  Colorado  was ordered by a judge to pay  3 000 a month to the woman he d been married to for 25 years  so he pillaged the couple s retirement account and had it converted into 22 pounds worth of gold and silver bars  the paper reports  Jones claims he then tossed the modern day treasure into a dumpster behind a motel  where he had been living temporarily  later telling the judge he had no money to give his ex wife  according to the paper  Did that story make you smile  It sure did the trick for me  But that story is also a picture of what the Federal Reserve is doing with our dollar  Our currency has been used for decades by almost everyone else around the planet  In fact  more U S  dollars are used outside of our country than inside of it  But now the Federal Reserve is systematically trashing the dollar and the rest of the globe is starting to lose faith in it  Instead of realizing their mistakes  Fed officials say that we need to create even more inflation and they just keep on wildly printing more money  In the end  we will all pay a great price for their foolishness ,2013-10-31,Michael T.

196609,418125,MCD,Yum Brands Expanding In The Wrong Country,opinion,Yum Brands  YUM   the parent company of KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell  is on the offensive  Its  in the next 10 years    To put that in perspective  there are currently about 6 000 Taco Bell restaurants scattered across America  This means that the chain will be increasing its presence by fully one third in a country that already has no shortage of fast food taco joints    Most of these new units will be franchises  as opposed to company owned   and Yum Brands is specifically targeting women and minority franchisees in an effort to attract  new blood     I ve been known to frequent Taco Bell a little more often than my doctor might like  it seems I have a weakness for tacos that sell for less than a dollar  But my own  admittedly awful  dining preferences aside  Yum s massive domestic expansion raises a few questions    I m a big fan of the franchise restaurant model as opposed to the company owned restaurant model  It turns a gritty  hypercompetitive and low margin business into a higher margin brand management company    But strong brands don t need to go out looking for franchisees  they normally have would be franchisees knocking on their doors  Yum brands   may be creating major headaches for YUM stock down the line if some of these inexperienced new franchisees find themselves in over their heads    But more fundamentally  why the sudden domestic push  Yum Brands jumped into emerging markets with both feet decades ago  primarily through the expansion of KFC  and emerging markets have long been the company s primary engine of growth  In fact  I would go so far as to say that Yum is first and foremost an emerging market company  YUM stock gets 60  of its revenues from emerging markets and has more than 13 000 emerging market locations   nearly double that of McDonald s  MCD     The sudden emphasis on the American market raises questions about management focus  Sure  China s growth is slowing  and 2013 has been a rough year for emerging markets in general  But refocusing on the American market seems like a major distraction in what has otherwise been a remarkably successful expansion strategy    Furthermore  its Taco Bell restaurants have major competition from Chipotle Mexican Grill  CMG  and its imitators  and that s a battle the company will have a hard time winning  Chipotle is wildly popular among younger and more health conscious Americans for its use of organic ingredients    Taco Bell has responded by taking its menu upmarket and in a healthier direction  For example  its Fresco Menu and Cantina Bell Menu are both massive steps up from its traditional low budget options    It s tempting to dismiss this as putting lipstick on a pig  but the quality of Taco Bell s food really has improved in recent years  Whether it has improved enough to realistically compete with Chipotle is another story  however    So  what about YUM stock  Is it a short    No   or at least  not yet  YUM stock trades at 21 times expected 2014 earnings  which is a little on the expensive side  But at 2 6 times sales  the company is considerably cheaper than MCD stock  3 43 times sales   CMG stock  5 27 times sales  or Burger King stock  BKW   5 82 times sales     And as I mentioned before  Yum Brands  strong presence in China and other emerging markets is a major plus    So  I m not shorting YUM stock any time soon  But I m not buying it either   not until I see management refocus its efforts where they are likely to bear the most fruit    Disclosure  Charles Lewis Sizemore  CFA  is the editor of Macro Trend Investor and chief investment officer of the investment firm Sizemore Capital Management  As of this writing  he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities   to receive his FREE weekly e letter covering market insights  global trends  and the best stocks and ETFs to profit from today s exciting megatrends ,2013-12-10,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/yum-brands-expanding-in-the-wrong-country-195104,195104
196618,418134,MCD,Walmart s Response Is Brutally Irrelevant,opinion,Yesterday a Walmart  WMT  spokesman criticized the petition I ve been circulating that asks Walmart  and McDonalds  MCD   to pay their employees at least  15 an hour Walmart s spokesman told the Huffington Post that my petition fails to mention that Walmart is a major job creator and that it promotes some of its employees The spokesman is correct  In fact  Walmart is America s biggest employer  And I d be shocked if some of its employees weren t promoted But the brute fact is Walmart s typical employee is still paid less than  9 an hour To offer lousy jobs on such an extraordinary scale is not something to brag about  Indeed  the point of the petition   as well as the national movement to raise the minimum wage to  15 an hour   is to recognize that most people who work for big box retailers like Walmart  as well as those who work in the fast food industry  are adults  They are responsible for bringing home a significant share of their family s income  A decent society requires they be paid enough to lift them and their families out of poverty   When Martin Luther King  Jr   led the March to Washington for Jobs and Justice  fifty years ago this week  one of the objectives of that March was to raise the minimum wage to  2 an hour   2 an hour in 1963  adjusted for inflation  comes to over  15 an hour in today s dollars  Walmart doesn t come close to the American dream ,2013-08-30,Robert B.

196620,418136,MCD,Qualcomm  Poised For Growth,opinion,Thesis For Growth Qualcomm  QCOM  is a global company founded in 1985 that designs  develops  manufactures  and markets digital telecommunications products and services  The  is  to continue to deliver the world s most innovative wireless solutions   Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the company is the underlying licensing business model  As Qualcomm indicates   the goal was simple  provide wireless companies with the R D to bring their    Qualcomm has gone about achieving this goal primarily through developing breakthrough technology and making strategic partnerships  The company then openly licenses the innovations across the industry  In essence  the licensing aspect of the business is very similar to McDonald s  MCD  renting land or selling equipment to McDonald s franchisees  Qualcomm is responsible for the product  but they re able to leverage it well Now it should be made clear that the majority of Qualcomm s revenue comes from the sale of wireless chips  In turn  the company faces a host of competition in this area from the likes of Intel  Samsung  Nvidia and others  However  the licensing model appears to be at both the heart of the company s mission and future profitability  as nearly three fourths of the company s earnings are derived from this segment  Thus  in the spirit of due diligence  one would obviously want to determine the market for chips  But more importantly  an investor would want to know how susceptible the licensing business is to future threats Qualcomm holds thousands of wireless intellectual property patents  which allows the company to charge nearly every handset maker a royalty fee  The risk associated with this strategy is that the licensing revenues are dependent on the pricing of handsets   something Qualcomm does not control  Still it s an attractive business strategy and one that has worked well thus far  In addition  Qualcomm has a firm grip on the technology that 3G networks are based on  but less of a foothold in the 4G market  Sequentially  one might believe that this would be a lasting disadvantage moving forward  Yet many of the 4G phones today are backward compatible with 3G networks  And of course  an innovative company like Qualcomm has the ability to expand upon its current and future capabilities Qualcomm likes to indicate   innovation is more than something we do  it s who we are   To this point  we have seen a strong track record of providing valuable and lasting originality  But even without the well executed R D  the company still stands a reasonable shot at creating solid business results  Qualcomm has a business unit   Qualcomm Ventures   that has been making investments in technology focused start ups since 2000  Qualcomm is able to utilize its own capabilities to expand upon the acquired partnerships  Current and on the horizon products include the Snapdraggon 800 chipset which is being used by the new  along with Qualcomm s development of its own smartwatch      which should be available shortly  It s expected that smartwatches will see an  in the next year  Overall  Qualcomm appears poised to grow with a variety of differentiating opportunities  Selling chips remains as their largest revenue generator  but the licensing business model   where  due to very high margins  the bulk of Qualcomm s earnings come from   appears especially compelling  With a growing middle class and emerging markets  Qualcomm stands to benefit from a variety of inherent catalysts  Whether the technology is developed in house or acquired through its venture capital capabilities  Qualcomm has the size and drive to continuously search for the next big thing in wireless  Finally  the company has taken the initiative far beyond licensing and is developing new and interesting products  15 Years of Results Qualcomm has grown earnings  orange line  at a compound rate of 27 6  since 1999  resulting in a  115  billion dollar market cap  In addition  Qualcomm s earnings have risen from  0 34 per share in 1999  to today s forecasted earnings per share of approximately  4 54 for 2013  Further  Qualcomm initiated a dividend  pink line  in 2003 and has been able to increase this payout at a robust pace over the last decade  For a look at how the market has historically valued Qualcomm  see the relationship between the price  black line  and earnings of the company as depicted on the Earnings and Price Correlated F A S T  Graph below  Here we see that Qualcomm s market price previously began to deviate from its justified earnings growth  starting to become overvalued in 1999 and coming back to fair value around 2002  Today  Qualcomm appears undervalued in relation to both its historical earnings and relative valuation In tandem with the strong earnings growth  Qualcomm s shareholders have enjoyed a compound annual return of 23 7  which correlates closely with the 27 6  growth rate in earnings per share  A hypothetical  10 000 investment in Qualcomm on 12 31 1998 would have grown to a total value of  229 117 14  without reinvesting dividends  Said differently  Qualcomm shareholders have enjoyed total returns that were roughly 14 times the value that would have been achieved by investing in the S P 500 over the same time period  It s also interesting to note that an investor would have received about 8 times the amount of dividend income compared to the index as well  Looking to the FutureBut of course   as the saying goes   past performance does not guarantee future results  Thus while a strong operating history provides a fundamental platform for evaluating a company  it does not by itself indicate a buy or sell decision  Instead  an investor must have an understanding of the past while simultaneously thinking the investment through to its logical  if not understated  conclusion In the opening paragraphs a variety of potential catalysts and opportunities for growth were described  It follows that the probabilities of these outcomes should be the guide for one s investment focus  Yet it is still useful to determine whether or not your predictions seem reasonable  Forty four leading analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ come to a consensus 5 year annual estimated return grow rate for Qualcomm of 16   In addition  Qualcomm is currently trading at a P E of 15 2  which is inside the  value corridor   defined by the orange lines  of a maximum P E of 19 2  If the earnings materialize as forecast  Qualcomm s valuation would be  149 14 at the end of 2018  which would be a 17 8  annualized rate of return including dividends  A graphical representation of this calculation can be seen in the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator below  Now  it s paramount to remember that this is simply a calculator  Specifically  the estimated total return is a default based on the consensus of the analysts following the stock  The consensus includes the long term growth rate along with specific earnings estimates for the next two upcoming years  Further  the dividend payout ratio is presumed to stay the same and grow with earnings  Taken collectively  this graph provides a very strong baseline for how analysts are presently viewing this company  However  a F A S T  Graphs subscriber is also able to change these estimates to fit their own thesis or scenario analysis Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Qualcomm to an equal investment in a 10 year Treasury bond  illustrates that Qualcomm s expected earnings would be 4 6 times that of the 10 year Treasury bond interest  This comparison can be seen in the 10 year Earnings Yield Estimate table below  Finally  it s important to underscore the idea that all companies derive their underlying value from the cash flows  earnings  that they are capable of generating for their owners  Therefore  it should be the expectation of a prudent investor that   in the long run   the likely future earnings of a company justify the price you pay  Fundamentally  this means appropriately addressing these two questions   in what should I invest   and  at what time   In viewing the past history and future prospects of Qualcomm we have learned that Qualcomm appears to be a strong company with solid upcoming opportunities  However  as always  we recommend that the reader conduct his or her own thorough

196623,418139,MCD,Restaurant Stock Outlook  October  2013,opinion,After hitting highs in April May of 2013  the restaurant industry has been struggling since June  with the Fed s  taper talk  adding to other issues  Despite this macro overhang  the underlying growth drivers of the restaurant industry remain intact  The outlook for the rest of the year has a positive bias given easy year over year comparisons and an easing in food cost inflation  Restaurant sales witnessed a modest gain in August  as per the preliminary figures from the U S  Census Bureau  Eating and drinking place sales totaled  45 9 billion in August  up 0 3  sequentially  As per National Restaurant Association  pent up demand in the sector is high  promising long term earnings growth for the sector  Statistics bear out this relatively favorable environment  A recent survey by the National Restaurant Association revealed that the Restaurant Performance Index  RPI   measuring the present condition and outlook on the U S  restaurant industry  was 100 7 in July  exceeding the 100 mark for the fifth successive month  The Current Situation Index  which measures comparable store sales  traffic count  labor costs and capital expenditures in the restaurant industry  was 100 1 in July  also above 100 for last fourth months  The latest index is indicative of the underlying strength in the industry  The Expectations Index  which measures the restaurant operators  six month outlook on the above indicators  was 101 3 in July  staying above the 100 level for seven consecutive months  While all three Indices managed to beat the safety threshold of 100  reaffirming operators  positive outlook on the industry for the near term  all indices were down 0 6  sequentially  reflecting the  taper concerns   The Conference Board came out with the slightly discouraging Consumer Confidence Index    a barometer of the U S  consumer health    on Sep 24  2013  After increasing 5 points in August  the index fell 2 1 points to 79 7 in September  We believe  issues like trimmed GDP outlook for 2013 and 2014 for the U S  by the Fed  new stipulations related to  Obamacare   volatility in housing data  higher fuel prices and excess supply may cloud the long term picture  An extensive focus on value proposition along with moderate pricing power could also prove unfavorable to margins if exercised on a long term basis Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification  the restaurant industry is grouped within the broader Retail sector  As a guideline  the outlook for industries in the top 1 3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and the bottom 1 3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of  177 and higher is  Negative   The Zacks Industry Rank for the restaurant industry is currently  120  This is in the mid 1 3rd of all industries ranked  highlighting the group s near term Neutral outlook Key Performers in Second Quarter 2013 Not all companies performed equally well in the quarter  While some were laggards  others posted solid results mostly on their individual strength  While 31  of operators missed the Zacks Consensus earnings estimates this season  60  surpassed theirs and about 9  met  Some operators blamed a softer economic trend for the insignificant growth in revenues  Industry behemoth McDonald s  MCD  delivered weaker than expected earnings in the second quarter and in line revenues hurt by comps deceleration  while another renowned operator  Yum  Brands  YUM   topped its earnings estimate but fell shy of revenue expectations mainly due to issues in China  However  we believe that both the companies will rebound in the long run  once the global issues subside Earnings Trend The restaurant industry falls under the broader Retail Wholesale sector  which portrays a stable earnings trend in recent times  The second quarter 2013 results for the sector were impressive in terms of both beat ratios  percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises  and growth  The earnings  beat ratio  was 51 2   while the revenue  beat ratio  was 32 6   Total earnings for this sector went up 7 2  in the second quarter from 5 6  growth in the first quarter of 2013  The improvement came from the upside in revenues  On the revenue front  the sector has seen an increase of 4 2  in the second quarter on the top of a 2 8  increase in the prior quarter  Looking at the Consensus earnings expectations for the rest of the year  we are positive since earnings are expected to grow a modest 3 9  in the third quarter of 2013 and 7 1  in the fourth quarter thereby registering full year growth of 7 6   For the next year  the sector is poised to expand around 16 5  with 10 9  growth in the first quarter itself   While revenue surprises started off on the weak side  the sector is anticipated to gain momentum from the fourth quarter of this year  For more details about earnings for this sector and others  please read our  Earnings Trends  report OPPORTUNITIESCooling Commodity Inflation in the US The food cost inflation seems to have eased as the nation emerged out of severe drought in the Midwest growing region last year  Food costs account for about one third of restaurant sales  thus making the industry vulnerable to food cost inflation  As suggested by the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  report  price inflation for all food is expected at 1 5 2 5  in 2013 down from 2 5 3 5  estimated previously  Commodities like fish and seafood  dairy products  fats and oils  sugar sweets  non alcoholic beverages  cereals and bakery products and other foods will likely witness a decline in prices  Although USDA expects poultry costs to increase in 2013  feed prices will likely cool off with a favorable weather in the new harvest season  leading to lower poultry prices in 2014 Domestic and International Unit Expansion Emerging from a lackluster economy from more than three years back  most of the companies have accelerated their pace of restaurant openings  A relative recovery in consumer confidence has also encouraged companies to return to unit expansion  Besides spreading their wings in the home country  the companies also aim to test waters in foreign shores  Restaurateurs are primarily concentrating on emerging markets that provide ample opportunities for expansion  The burgeoning middle income population in emerging countries encourages the companies to shift their spotlight from the somewhat saturated domestic market  McDonald s  Yum   Krispy Kreme Doughnut Inc   KKD   Dunkin  Brands Group Inc   DNKN  and Darden Restaurants Inc   DRI  have been quite active on this front Digital Ordering and Delivery Gaining Precedence Digital ordering is in fashion now and restaurateurs are leaving no stone unturned to capitalize  So far  Domino s Pizza Inc   DPZ  has been a huge beneficiary of this trend  generating over  2 billion in digital sales globally in 2012  As a matter of fact  the company s mobile ordering system together with traditional online ordering accounts for more than 30  of its revenues globally  and is likely to account for more than 50  of total sales over the long term  Industry bellwether McDonald s also looks to tap into the opportunity as it recently announced various digital schemes like self ordering kiosks in Europe  mobile ordering  mobile payments and other smartphone tie ins  Though delivery was common in the restaurant sector  especially among pizza chains  it got a boost of late thanks to the busy lifestyle of consumers  The world s second largest hamburger chain Burger King Worldwide Inc   BKW  is the latest to join this bandwagon  Apart from this  catering initiatives are also doing the trick for companies like Panera Bread Co   PNRA  and Jack in the Box Inc  s  JACK  Qdoba Mexican Grill chain  Some other initiatives that have been undertaken to boost sales across the wide spectrum of operators are renovation of restaurants and continued reinvigoration of menu options  Currently  Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc   RRGB  carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Companies with a Zacks  2 Rank  short term Buy rating  include CEC Entertainment Inc   CEC   AFC Enterprises Inc   AFCE   Burger King  The Cheesecake Factory Inc   CAKE   Chuys Holdings  CHUY   Domino s Pizza Inc   Dunkin  Brands and Sonic Corp   SONC   These companies have positive earnings estimate revision trends  highlighting the favorable momentum in their underlying businesses WEAKNESSESGlobal Economic Backdrop Yet to Recover at Full Swing  Strengths aside  companies are caught up with macroeconomic tensions like implementation of austerity measures in Europe owing to the sovereign debt crisis and decelerating growth in Asia  The big chains have considerable exposure in European nations like France and Germany and in Asian countries like China  Although debt ridden European regions have started witnessing improvements  they have yet to reach pre crisis levels  Despite improving economic data  German customers remain extremely value sensitive  Among the emerging nations  China and Brazil have their own share of problems  Japan also continues to be a dampener as it is still on the way to recovery from last year s earthquake Affordable Care Act to Hurt Margins  Since the sector plays a key role in the nation s employment picture  the recent Affordable Care Act by President Obama  commonly known as Obamacare  is expected to have an adverse impact on the operators  margins starting in 2014  The law entails companies to provide coverage for workers or face government penalties  though not applicable for employees who log less than 30 hours per week on average  To avoid these austerities  most companies are trying out different labor models like involving more part timers and cutting work hours ahead of the implementation of the healthcare reform Limited Pricing Power  As per USDA  the food away from home inflation index in the U S  is expected to grow in the range of 2 3  while food at home inflation will likely go up by 1 0  to 2 0   The scenario leaves less room for operators to exercise pricing action as the pocket pinch will be more upon eating away from home  This  coupled with the slight decline in projected IEO traffic for 2013  might restrict eateries  pricing in the U S Change in Consumer Preference  The latest trend in U S  eateries is to serve a healthy menu  owing to consumer preference for fresh  organic  nutritious and low calorie food  Rising health concerns and increasing awareness to obesity and related diseases have led to the shift in consumer preference toward healthy and  good for you  products  Focus on child nutrition is also a priority  However  the fuss about nutrition poses challenges  There are some names that induce our cautious outlook  These include Bloomin  Brands Inc   BLMN   Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc   CBRL   Darden Restaurants  Buffalo Wild Wings Inc   BWLD   Chipotle Mexican Grill  Jamba Inc   JMBA   Kona Grill Inc   KONA   Brinker International Inc   EAT   Panera Bread Co   Krispy Kreme  McDonalds and Yum   all of which retain the Zacks  3 Rank  Hold   Cosi Inc   COSI  and BJ s Restaurants Inc   BJRI  carry a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  due to their prolonged struggle on the earnings front Bottom Line In hindsight  the performance of the restaurant sector was more or less satisfactory in the recent times  Cautious consumer spending in the light of  Taper Hold  along with a reduced growth outlook for the nation will likely result in sector stagnation for a short while  The upcoming quarter does not enthuse much optimism  and faster upward revisions in estimates should be seen fourth quarter onward  Overall  the restaurant industry is expected to sustain recovery in the rest of 2013 but at a slower clip as it is at the receiving end of several global economic concerns  Our proprietary Zacks Ranks indicates the movement of the stocks over the short term  1 to 3 months   At present  respectively 27  and 51  stocks sport a positive and neutral outlook and the rest is negative ,2013-10-02,Zacks Investment

196637,418153,MCD,McDonald s Proving Position As  Best Of Breed  In The Fast Food Sector,opinion,There may be some slowing in the fast food sector  but I look at this as more of a buying opportunity than a time to sell  The trick is simple  you need to make sure you have the right stocks  As many of you know  my top buying opportunity in the fast food sector is McDonalds Corporation  MCD   The restaurant  with its  golden arches  that are easily recognizable from miles away  is and in my estimate  will continue to be the  Best of Breed  in its sector  There will obviously be challengers  but I highly doubt any company will be able to vault over McDonalds  Below  the chart of McDonalds shows the company s impressive and steady share price appreciation from less than  20 00 in 2003 to more than  98 00 today   What a great buying opportunity that was a decade ago   As you can see in the chart  the stock  red candlesticks  has also outperformed the S P 500  green line   based on my technical analysis  Of course  there will be those companies that will try to emulate the success that made McDonalds what it is today a  100 billion worldwide fast food empire and a good long term buying opportunity  Take Burger King Worldwide  Inc   BKW   for instance  which is about 14 times smaller than McDonalds based on market capitalization  The seller of the  Whopper  has expanded its menu offerings  but based on the results so far  it is not a threat to the  Big Mac   In its second quarter  Burger King reported an abysmal 48 5  decline in its revenues to  278 3 million well below the Thomson Financial consensus estimate of  322 3 million  The company blamed its plunge in revenues on the business climate and competition  Heck  while I m not much of a fast food eater  I would be more inclined to go to McDonalds than Burger King  But another one of my top fast food stocks is Chipotle Mexican Grill  Inc   CMG   which may also offer an attractive buying opportunity  A few months back  I also talked about Denny s Corporation  DENN   the maker of the  Grand Slam  breakfast  as a potential buying opportunity  Denny s is no match for McDonalds  but it s not meant to be  as it s in a different class of restaurants with a focus on dine in and higher cost food and services  Disclaimer  There is no magic formula to getting rich  Success in investment vehicles with the best prospects for price appreciation can only be achieved through proper and rigorous research and analysis  The opinions in this e newsletter are just that  opinions of the authors  Information contained herein  while believed to be correct  is not guaranteed as accurate  Warning  Investing often involves high risks and you can lose a lot of money  Please do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose ,2013-08-04,George Leong,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mcdonald’s-proving-position-as-“best-of-breed”-in-the-fast-food-sector-178196,178196
196638,418154,MCD,Trimmings For Labor Day,opinion,The good news this Labor Day  Jobs are returning  The bad news this Labor Day  Most of them pay lousy wages and low if non existent benefits  The trend toward lousy wages began before the Great Recession  According to a new  from the Economic Policy Institute  weak wage growth between 2000 and 2007  combined with wage losses for most workers since then  means that the bottom 60 percent of working Americans are earning less now than thirteen years ago   This is also part of the explanation for why the percent of Americans living below the poverty line has been increasing even as the economy has started to recover   from 12 3 percent in 2006 to around 14 percent this year  More than 35 million Americans now live below the poverty line  Many of them have jobs  The problem is these jobs just don t pay enough to lift their families out of poverty  But wait a minute  Over this same period  productivity has grown by nearly 25 percent  That means the typical American worker is now producing a quarter more output than he or she did in 2000   So if wages have flattened or declined for the bottom 60 percent  yet productivity has increased  where have the gains gone  Mostly  to corporations and the very rich   All of which gives some context to the strikes in recent weeks at fast food chain stores  such as McDonalds  where workers are demanding a raise to  15 an hour from their current pay of  8 to  10 an hour  And the demonstrations and walkouts at Walmart stores  whose workers are also demanding better pay  The average Walmart employee earns  8 81 an hour  A third of Walmart s employees work less than 28 hours per week and don t qualify for benefits  Few of these workers are teenagers  Most have to support their families  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the median age of fast food workers is over 28  and women  who comprise two thirds of the industry  are over 32  The median age of big box retail workers is over 30  These workers typically bring in half their family s earnings  They deserve a raise  At the very least  the minimum wage should be increased from the current  7 25 an hour to  10 50   and to  15 in areas of the country with a higher cost of living  Had the federal minimum simply kept up with inflation from the late 1960s  it would already be well over  10 today  Contrary to the predictable pontifications of conservative pundits  such a raise won t cause many low wage workers to lose their jobs  Unlike industrial jobs  these sorts of retail service jobs can t be outsourced abroad  Nor are they likely to be replaced by automated machinery and computers  The service these workers provide is personal and direct  Someone has to be on hand to help customers and dole out the burgers  And don t believe critics who say any wage gains these workers receive will be passed on to consumers in higher prices  Big box retailers and fast food chains have to compete intensely for consumers  They have no choice but to keep their prices low  This means wage gains for low paid workers are most likely to come out of profits   which  in turn  would slightly reduce returns to shareholders and compensation packages of top executives  That wouldn t be such a bad thing  According to a  by the National Employment Law Project  most low wage workers are employed by large corporations that have been enjoying healthy profits  Three quarters of these employers  the fifty biggest employers of low wage workers  are raking in higher revenues now than they did before the recession  McDonald s   bellwether for the fast food industry   posted strong results during the recession by attracting cash strapped customers  and its sales have continued to rise  McDonald s CEO  Don Thompson  was awarded a big whopper of a compensation package last year  valued at   Yum Brands  which operates and licenses Taco Bell  KFC  and Pizza Hut  has also done   Its CEO  David

196663,418179,MCD,Are High Yields Good For Growing Your Passive Income  ,opinion,One Reader of my blog  Devirick  wrote me on Facebook a question  Here are his sentences   What strategies are u using To be able To live off of dividends  I m am working on creating extra income as a monthly contribution toward dividends paying high yields around  5   Well it s hard to explain in a few words  In core  I would say that I m a long term dividend growth investor  I buy dividend stocks with a solid growth performance and a higher capitalization   The company should be good diversified  I say core because I put around 60  of my net worth into boring companies like Nestl   Procter Gamble or Coca Cola etc   Those are my core investments   Some might say they are not boring but they are because nothing spectacular happens  The good thing is that you can count on the company as basis growth engine for your portfolio  normally with a growth in a high single digit range   Coca Cola  Procter or even McDonalds have strong cash flows which they use for share buybacks and dividend payments in nearly the same amount  The ratio varies  depending on the payout policy of the company  If they grow 5  in sales  earnings and dividends could grow with a higher rate because of the share repurchases  If you count with 7  8  dividend growth  your yield on cost doubles in 10 years from alone  If you start buying stock with 100k  you could get around 3k in dividends  In 10 years  your income should grow to 6k but the inflation pushed prices only 30  to 50  higher  I have around 80 companies and my average growth rate is a little bit higher than 10   I believe it s around 12 13  for the moment  But this should slow down if the economy weakens  The reason for the higher rate is that I bought some lower yielding companies with a stronger growth and low debt and payout ratios   In my view  faster growing stocks deliver you a better return if you stay longer by your investment  The risk also rises because you are no more a swing trader  you are an investor  As investor your job is to identify the long term growth perspectives and potentials of a company without losing the feeling for the risk  Your question to High Yield stocks  That s no solution for wealth in my view  Most high yielding stocks are low growing stocks with high debt levels  Look at AT T  Sure they look good at the yield is fantastic compared to the business model but they have a big debt burden and they need really big amounts of money to grow  if it s really possible to grow because the carrier market is still developed and market shares are distributed   You can boost your income in a short time but you will loose this advantage over the time  If you buy AT T shares for 100k  your gross dividend income would  4 98k but in 10 years it should only at 6k or so  This is only an example  I have no idea how fast T could grow their dividends  What if you start with an investment of 100k that pays only 1  or 1k in annual dividends and 10 years later you receive 10k  I would prefer the second alternative  Low payout and debt ratios as well as high growth potential is the key in this example  I hope my answers helped you to understand my investment strategy a bit more  If not  feel free to submit a comment on my   I always try my best to help others ,2013-03-24,Dividend Yield,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-high-yields-good-for-growing-your-passive-income-160170,160170

196687,418203,MCD,Why Austerity Economics Hurts Low Wage Workers Most,opinion,What does the drama in Washington over the  fiscal cliff  have to do with strikes and work stoppages among America s lowest paid workers at Walmart  McDonald s  Burger King and Domino s Pizza Everything Lousy PayJobs are slowly returning to America  but most of them pay lousy wages and low if non existent benefits  The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that seven out of 10 growth occupations over the next decade will be low wage    like serving customers at big box retailers and fast food chains  That s why the median wage keeps dropping  especially for the 80 percent of the workforce that s paid by the hour It s also part of the reason why the percent of Americans living below the poverty line has been increasing even as the economy has started to recover    from 12 3  in 2006 to 15  in 2011  More than 46 million Americans now live below the poverty line Many of them have jobs  The problem is these jobs just don t pay enough to lift their families out of poverty So  encouraged by the economic recovery and perhaps also by the election returns  low wage workers have started to organize Work StoppagesIn New York  Thursday  hundreds of workers at dozens of fast food chain stores went on strike  demanding a raise to  15 an hour from their current pay of  8 to  10 an hour  the median hourly wage for food service and prep workers in New York is  8 90 an hour  Last week  Walmart workers staged demonstrations and walkouts at thousands of Walmart stores  also demanding better pay  The average Walmart employee earns  8 81 an hour  A third of Walmart s employees work less than 28 hours per week and don t qualify for benefits These workers are not teenagers  Most have to support their families  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the median age of fast food workers is over 28  and women  who comprise two thirds of the industry  are over 32  The median age of big box retail workers is over 30 Organizing makes economic sense Outsourcing Isn t An OptionUnlike industrial jobs  these can t be outsourced abroad  Nor are they likely to be replaced by automated machinery and computers  The service these workers provide is personal and direct  Someone has to be on hand to help customers and dole out the burgers And any wage gains they receive aren t likely to be passed on to consumers in higher prices because big box retailers and fast food chains have to compete intensely for consumers  They have no choice but to keep their prices low That means wage gains are likely to come out of profits   which  in turn  would affect the return to shareholders and the total compensation of top executives That wouldn t be such a bad thing According to a recent report by the National Employment Law Project  most low wage workers are employed by large corporations that have been enjoying healthy profits  Three quarters of these employers  the fifty biggest employers of low wage workers  are raking in higher revenues now than they did before the recession McDonald s    bellwether for the fast food industry    posted strong results during the recession by attracting cash strapped customers  and its sales have continued to rise The McBonusIts CEO  Jim Skinner  got  8 8 million last year  In addition to annual bonuses  McDonald s also gives its executives a long term bonus once every three years  Skinner received an  8 3 million long term bonus in 2009 and is due for another this year  The value of Skinner s other perks    including personal use of the company aircraft  physical exams and security    rose 19  to  752 000 Yum Brands  which operates and licenses Taco Bell  KFC  and Pizza Hut  has also done wonderfully well  Its CEO  David Novak  received  29 67 million in total compensation last year  placing him number 23 on  of highest paid chief executives Walmart    the trendsetter for big box retailers    is also doing well  And it pays its executives handsomely  The total compensation for Walmart s CEO  Michael Duke  was  18 7 million last year    putting him number 82 on Forbes  list  The wealth of the Walton family  which still owns the lion s share of Walmart stock  now exceeds the wealth of the bottom 40  of American families combined  according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute Early DividendsLast week  Walmart announced that the next Wal Mart dividend will be issued December 27 instead of January 2  after the Bush tax cut for dividends expires    thereby saving the Walmart family as much as  180 million   According to the online weekly Too Much  this  180 million would be enough to give 72 000 Wal Mart workers now making  8 an hour a 20  annual pay hike  That hike would still leave those workers making under the poverty line for a family of three  America is becoming more unequal by the day  So wouldn t it be sensible to encourage unionization at fast food and big box retailers Yes  but here s the problem  The unemployment rate among people with just a high school degree  which describes most  but not all  fast food and big box retail workers  is still in the stratosphere  The Bureau of Labor Statistics puts it at 12 2   and that s conservative estimate  It was 7 7  at the start of 2008 The Cost Of UnemploymentHigh unemployment makes it much harder to organize a union because workers are even more fearful than usual of losing their jobs  Eight dollars an hour is better than no dollars an hour  And employers at big box and fast food chains have not been reluctant to give the boot to employees associated with attempts to organize for higher wages Meanwhile  only half of the people who lose their jobs qualify for unemployment insurance these days  Retail workers in big boxes and fast food chains rarely qualify because they haven t been on the job long enough or are there only part time  This makes the risk of job loss even greater Which brings us back to what s happening in Washington The Cliff s Collateral DamageWashington s obsession with deficit reduction makes it all the more likely these workers will face continuing high unemployment    even higher if the nation succumbs to deficit hysteria  That s because cutting government spending reduces overall demand  which hits low wage workers hardest  They and their families are the biggest casualties of austerity economics And if the spending cuts Washington is contemplating fall on low wage workers whose families are under the poverty line    reducing not only the availability of unemployment insurance but also food stamps  housing assistance  infant and child nutrition  child health care  and Medicaid    it will be even worse   It s worth recalling  in this regard  that 62  of the cuts in the Republican budget engineered by Paul Ryan fell on America s poor  By contrast  low levels of unemployment invite wage gains and make it easier to organize unions  The last time America s low wage workers got a real raise  apart from the last hike in the minimum wage  was the late 1990s when unemployment dropped to 4  nationally    compelling employers to raise wages in order to recruit and

196699,418215,MCD,Managing Downside Risk With The Fiscal Cliff,opinion,Having been pushed into the background in recent weeks by the election  the Fiscal Cliff is now at the forefront of investors  concern  Basic game theory dictates that a resolution should not occur until late in December  Negotiators won t know if they have extracted the maximum concessions from the other side if they agree too soon  In addition  since America returned approximately the same set of leaders to power that engineered the Debt Ceiling mess in the Summer of 2011  there s little reason for high expectations  Ultimately  one would think the Democrats are more inclined to compromise to get a deal  since it is  their  economy  However  for Republicans so opposed to taxes  a failure to agree will result in automatic tax hikes and just what they don t want The one caveat to all this is that  living in the North East U S  and having just endured the disruption of Hurricane Sandy  the economy is a little more vulnerable than a month ago  Losing power for days on end can really mess with your productivity  On balance we expect a compromise that will avoid the more dire forecasts  but it won t be an easy road to get there  In our Deep Value Equity Strategy we ve raised from more cyclical names  Yesterday we invested a small amount in McDonalds  MCD   which remains under pressure because of disappointing sales  and today we added to Kraft Foods Group  KRFT   which reported earnings yesterday and now sports a dividend yield of 4 55   Yesterday s earnings report was good and although their payout ratio is high at 77  based on 2013 EPS guidance of  2 60 supporting the  2 dividend  we think it s well covered and an attractive investment here Cash ReservesBut we continue to hold back some cash because of the increasing likelihood that the market will respond poorly to the undoubtedly messy negotiations The reflation theme remains compelling  with developed country central banks fully committed to keeping interest rates below inflation  Owning gold bullion through the Gold Miners ETF  GDX  remains one of our larger positions  Corrections Corp  CXW  also held their earnings call this morning and are still working towards restructuring themselves as a REIT which we think provides further compelling upside  The Fiscal Cliff represents a potential source of uncertainty for them since the Federal government is such an important client of theirs  but while that may cause some short term uncertainty we don t belive it materially alters the value of the company ,2012-11-08,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/managing-downside-risk-with-the-fiscal-cliff-142856,142856
196727,418243,MCD,Is McDonald s A Short After Earnings ,opinion,Based on a Diamond Top and the reversal of McDonald s   MCD  three year uptrend and even from someone who does not short personally  the answer is yes even though it is a slightly different tactic from shorting MCD on its earnings report  Shown above in the three month daily chart is a Diamond Top born of a Symmetrical Triangle fulfilling to the upside toward a target of about  94 and one that was nearly achieved last Thursday and something that  frees  the Diamond Top to take MCD back down into a near term sideways range of about  86 to 94   It is likely that this potential move will be born of the company s report tomorrow before the bell when the company potentially discusses continued weakness out of Europe to which it has significant exposure  However  this pattern can break either way and if the Diamond Top takes MCD up  it confirms at  93 32 for a target of about  96 and one that would MCD back above its 200 DMA   Such a possibility is less likely  though  not only due to the fact that the Diamond Top tends to act as its name suggests but due to the aforementioned reversal of MCD s three year uptrend as shown by the weekly chart below   That being said  maybe MCD fills out its larger Symmetrical Triangle perfectly with a move to about  95 before it likely drops back down into that aspect and one that is supported for a bearish break by the long term uptrend reversal  This bearish reversal is likely to result in MCD dropping to about  70 to prevent the Symmetrical Triangle from taking MCD toward its upside target of about  124  Levels will provide the tell on that bull and bear battle at  86 and  110  though  with a close below or above either side required to think that the more extreme target will follow   It will be surprising if the bears fail to win that fight  but it is for the small shot of MCD moving slightly higher to  95 before dropping down that suggests MCD is a short  possibly on  but quite certainly after earnings ,2012-07-23,Abigail Doolittle,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-mcdonald's-a-short-after-earnings-130442,130442

196743,418259,MCD,Dividend Mania Meets Farrell s Rule  7,opinion, Our friend Doug Behnfield  the savviest financial advisor we know  is skeptical about the dividend mania that has captivated Wall Street of late  In the essay below he explains why investors seduced by dividend paying stocks may be overlooking more than offsetting risks and better opportunities  Doug works exclusively with high net worth individuals  many of whom are undoubtedly grateful for his prescient skew toward Treasury paper since the beginning of last year  To contact him about his services  click here and I will forward your message  RA As you read this essay  keep Bob Farrell s Rule  7 well in mind   Markets are strongest when they are broad and weakest when they narrow to a handful of blue chip names  Most stock market participants can remember back to 2000 if they really try  It was common back then for typically risk averse investors  like retirees  to be insistent that half of their portfolios consisted of Microsoft  MSFT   Intel  INTC   Cisco  CSCO  and Dell  DELL   The price of each of these stocks had gone parabolic and none of them paid dividends  which was a good thing because that left them with all those earnings to plow back into their business  If the investor needed to buy groceries  they could just sell a few shares for cash flow My  how things have changed  Today   dividend paying stocks  are all the rage  McDonalds  MCD   Procter   Gamble  PG  and Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  are emblematic  Apple  AAPL  has just begun getting into the act by declaring its first dividend and Intel and Microsoft are now on the list after ramping up dividends soon after the tech stock meltdown in the early 2000s What these companies have in common is that they are blue chip names and they have taken on a  one decision  aura  For example  Procter   Gamble has raised its dividend every year for 55 years  These are growth stocks for the most part so dividend increases are expected to continue  And they are usually  global mega caps   meaning that they are very big companies that do business  often the majority of their business  outside the U S  The highest yielding stocks of a more domestic and defensive nature  like the utilities  fail to inspire  It is my opinion that  largely because of the headwinds to growth here at home compared to the emerging markets like China and India  belief in the process of globalization has become linear  There is also a generally negative view toward the value of the dollar vs  the currencies of our trading partners and so all the benefits that accrue to these companies that relate to a weak dollar are expected to continue  A weak dollar gives a boost to multinational companies  earnings and a strong dollar does the opposite  A weaker dollar also makes our products cheaper and therefore more competitive  and vice versa  Globalization May Be PeakingBut the current cycle of globalization may be peaking and the dollar may be set to rally  Slowing demand in the developed world  particularly in Europe and Japan is becoming evident and could have a meaningfully negative impact on trade in general and specifically for developing countries like China and India in particular  Protectionism and Isolationism are clearly on the rise as fiscal strains increase and geopolitical fatigue sets in  So the globalization story may not be as bullet proof as conventional wisdom suggests  But the story does not have to be proven wrong for the stock market to disappoint  For example  Intel retained its status as the global leader in computer chips from 2000 to 2003 even as the stock price dropped from 76 to 13  The flaw in the rationale for stocks that have already performed exceptionally well is often the fact that they command near universal acceptance In the case of the blue chip  mega cap international dividend paying stocks  the biggest risk to the story may be the belief that a 3  dividend yield will somehow prevent the wild swings in stock prices that we have been experiencing for the last 13 or 14 years  One of the biggest rationalizations for dividend paying stocks is that a 3  yield is 50  greater than a 10 year Treasury bond  But will McDonald s  26 year track record of dividend increases really matter to investors if the price drops from the recent price of 100 to 75  where it was a year ago   Will the newly announced dividend from Apple really matter if the stock drops from 640 to 400  where it stood just 3 months ago   At least the Treasury bond matures and you get your money back Price Is KeyPerhaps more to the point  there is very little correlation between stock yields and bond yields  For example  way back in the 1930s  1940s and early 1950s when the 10 year Treasury bond was last yielding in the low 2  range  the dividend yield on the S P500 as a whole was frequently over 7   More recently  in early 2000 when the Treasury bond yield exceeded 6 8   the dividend yield on the S P500 reached an all time low of 1 1   The yield on stocks and bonds are currently about equal at 2 1  and based on yield alone  neither one is particularly attractive  What matters going forward in terms of relative performance is what the price does  In order for the Treasury bond to drop in price  interest rates must rise   But it still comes due at face value   In order for Procter   Gamble to drop in price  well who knows  In the past  bear markets in stocks have occurred due to a combination of high valuations and generally poor performance in the economy  P G has raised its dividend at least 4 times since the highs in 2007 and the stock price is down 10   You have to ask yourself  Do I feel lucky  Returning to Rule  7 of Bob Farrell s  Market Rules to Remember   there are indications that a handful of blue chip stocks are driving the stock market rally lately and that suggests vulnerability to a more meaningful decline phase  Markets are weaker when one theme dominates the bullish rationale  Honestly  the underlying appeal of stocks today is not the dividend yield at current levels  It is the hope for further price appreciation  Any broadly accepted rationale that the risk of loss is minimized by the dividend yield in the face of dramatic  even parabolic upward price performance should be met with skepticism  The narrowness of the list of favorites adds to the risk Disappointing DataRecent enthusiasm toward the possibility that the economy was reaching  escape velocity  or a  virtuous cycle  where improving growth feeds on itself has been dampened by stubbornly disappointing economic data  Most recently  the March jobs report produced half the hoped for number of hires and the underlying data was even more negative  There are a number of reasons to expect that the business cycle will be delivering the next recession as the year progresses  Most importantly  household and government debt continue to be enormous and all that debt exerts a deflationary impact on the economy and on asset values  The changes that are required to put the overall economy in a position to expand again will depress demand for many years to come These forces should keep the Fed on hold with 0  short term rates for the next 2 years at least and longer term interest rates still have room to fall  The end game for 10 year and 30 year Treasury bond yields are likely to be 1   and 2  respectively  roughly 1  lower than today  Tax free Municipal bond yields may have even further to fall and this means that the Great Bull Market in Bonds is still in force ,2012-04-19,Rick Ackerman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dividend-mania-meets-farrell’s-rule-7-120646,120646
196744,418260,MCD,McDonalds Back In Value  Above Average Growth And Above Average Yield,opinion,McDonald s  MCD  is a great favorite of the dividend growth investor  However  Mr  Market knows this and has historically applied a premium valuation to this blue chip dividend stalwart  Due to its consistently above average earnings growth  McDonald s is a company that you could even pay a little too much for and still make money over the long run through dividend increases and capital appreciation  At its current valuation  McDonald s sits at the high end of its valuation range  Therefore  although it is not a screaming bargain  today s valuation represents a sound valuation given McDonald s quality and consistency    Dividend Champion   McDonald s Corp  MCD      This article looks at McDonald s Corp  a Dividend Champion  through the lens of the F A S T  Graphs  Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool  Since a picture is worth a thousand words  the reader will be provided the  essential fundamentals at a glance  expressed vividly in pictures  In order to provide you the opportunity to research this company deeper and faster we are providing a link to a live  fully functioning earnings and price correlated set of graphs    Tip   Run your mouse over the various lines and watch the graphs come to life     A Dividend Champion is defined as a company that has increased its dividend every year for 25 or more straight years  McDonald s Corp is a Dividend Champion that has raised its dividend every year for 35 consecutive years  The complete Dividend Champions list is compiled    Open as an excel spreadsheet and look at the tabs on the bottom to find the Dividend Champions list   McDonald s is the world s leading global foodservice retailer with more than 33 500 locations serving approximately 68 million customers in 119 countries each day  More than 80 percent of McDonald s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent local men and women  McDonald s Corp  A Dividend Champion with 35 Consecutive Years of Dividend IncreasesLearning from the Past   Looking at Earnings OnlySince dividends are paid out of earnings  a clear perspective of a company s historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor s prudent due diligence process  The following graph plots McDonald s Corp s earnings per share since 1998  A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that McDonald s Corp has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 11 1   see purple circle on graph  per annum Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income  The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income  The earnings growth rate line or True Worth   line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings    Since dividends are paid out of earnings  and therefore represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at  they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line  Therefore  a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed    1  The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide  2  The percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends  payout ratio     The value in this article is through carefully analyzing the earnings and price correlated fundamentally based graphs  Notice that one glance tells you how well the company has performed on an operating basis historically and how the market valued that historical performance  Therefore  the reader is free to discover whether or not current valuations make sense based on historical norms coupled with fundamental values  Instead of opinion  this article is designed to produce facts that can be analyzed to the readers investing benefit  Performance Table  Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income McDonald s CorpThe associated performance results  with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return   Capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 9 8  capital appreciation  Closing Annualized ROR   long term shareholders of McDonald s Corp would have received an additional  57 087 47 in dividends that increased their total return from 9 8  to 10 9  per annum  Note   Since this is a Dividend Champion it  has raised its dividend every year for at least 25 years  therefore   negative dividend growth rates shown  if any  will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company s regularly reported dividend rate The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for McDonald s Corp is 3 40  which is historically normal Looking to the Future   Extensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns  and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants    1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings 2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earnings   Therefore  forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance    Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation  McDonald s Corp represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Champion at a reasonable price  The important factor is that McDonald s Corp has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns    The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions    The consensus of 27 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast McDonald s Corp long term earnings growth at 10   McDonald s Corp has medium long term debt at 46  of capital  McDonald s Corp is currently trading at a P E of 16 8  which is inside the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  If the earnings materialize as forecast  McDonald s Corp s True Worth valuation would be  138 36 at the end of 2017  which would be a 10 3  annual rate of return from the current price  including assumed dividends  Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price and dividend income in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in McDonald s Corp to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds illustrates that McDonald s Corp s expected earnings would be 5 7 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component This report presents essential  fundamentals at a glance  on Dividend Champion McDonald s Corp  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company  it s imperative that the reader conduct his or her own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not  Follow the link we provided at the beginning of this article to a fully functioning F A S T  Graphs  on McDonald s Corp Summary   ConclusionsMcDonald s represents an excellent choice for the prudent dividend growth investor seeking both capital appreciation  and above average current yield and the opportunity to grow both in the future  With its recent pull back  McDonald s is priced at the upper end of our valuation corridor  Therefore  although the company is not cheap  we do consider it a sound long term investment at these levels  Furthermore  we would suggest that if the stock continued to drop from these levels  the prudent investor could use the lower price as an opportunity to average down their cost basis  As always  we recommend you conduct your own thorough due diligence Disclosure   Long MCD at the time of

repeating itself is no longer an issue  our financial markets have not conquered the problem of repetition  More specifically  the timing of the  6 3  stock market decline during May  as measured by

debate and credit downgrade of 2011 So far  the  Sell in May and go away  mantra has followed the textbook lessons over the last few years  but as you can see from the chart below  the short lived seasonal sell offs have been followed by significant advances  up  33  from 2010 lows and up  29  from the 2011 lows   Given the global challenges  a two steps forward  one step back pattern in equity

196747,418263,MCD,Are Price Increases Killing Consumption ,opinion,Based on comments on   that there are misconceptions about consumer spending patterns and the effects of price increases  Consider several potential effects caused by price increases A consumer can do without   No vacation  no private school  no newspaper  or no medical insurance A consumer can perform the same task with lower unit consumption   Examples are buying a more fuel efficient car  moving closer to where you work Lower the quality of what you buy   single malt to blended whiskey  steak to hamburger  private car to public transport  change the temperature in your home  big house to little house  Cheesecake Factory to McDonalds Change the item purchased   switch from fuel oil to natural gas  theatre to satellite TV Do it yourself   haircuts  gardener  home or car repair   maintenance Find a cheaper source of a product or service Three specific items with relatively large consumer price increases were health care  food  and gasoline  One would expect these price increase would result in generally taking a larger and larger share of the consumer budget  Yet  the data says otherwise In the graph above  the change in spending pattern was determined by calculating the ratio of the individual elements  health  care  food and gasoline  to the total personal consumption expenditure  PCE   All values were normalized to 100 for first quarter 2007  The price index comes from the BEA PCE price index I keep writing  but many miss  that there is no such thing as an average consumer  Each one of us is a different animal with different consumption profiles  The graphs above represent BEA s total of all consumption  Joe Sixpack  0 01   banksters  retired  farmers  students      To believe a consumer stands still for any long period in the face of price changes is ludicrous  Price changes beget consumption changes On the other hand  I believe the vast majority of consumers spend much of what they make  This is why many pundits  including me  keep their focus on changes in real income  This was the point of last week s post  The downward trend in Real Disposable Personal Income has been broken for at least one month   both on a real and per capita basis  This is one of the few positive trends currently in play economically One other thought emanating from last week s post is the difference between changes in home values and the changes in home equity  The blue line in the graph below shows how owner s equity loss is significantly more than what the home price indices are saying  As  if  the housing recovery plays out  the increase in home equity values will be a multiple of the change in home prices  Yes  it will take some time for homeowners to feel  and believe  their home equity is increasing    Other Economic News this Week    The Econintersect economic forecast for  shows continues to show moderate growth  Overall  trend lines seem to be stable even with the fireworks in Europe  and emotionally cannot help thinking this is the calm before the storm  There are no recession flags showing in any of the indicators Econintersect follows which have been shown to be

and the bottom line for them is that a recession is a certainty  The size and depth is unknown but  was already underway  A positive result is this pronouncement has caused much debate in economic cyberspace    The ECRI WLI index value is tip toeing in negative territory   but this week is again  less bad   The index is indicating the economy six month from today will be slightly worse than it is today  As shown on the graph below  this is not the first time since the end of the Great Recession that the WLI has been in negative territory  Initial unemployment claims decreased from 374 000

196769,418285,MCD,Has McDonalds Become Too Pricey to Buy or Hold ,opinion,We are strong believers in making buy  sell or hold investing decisions predicated on the fundamentals behind the business that the common stock represents   On the other hand  we also acknowledge the undeniable reality that  Mr  Market  does not always price a company according to its intrinsic value based on earnings and cash flows   However  we would further argue that  Mr  Market s  shenanigans are more apt to apply over the shorter run than they are the over the longer run   To summarize  earnings determine market price in the long run  but investor psychology can play havoc with sound fundamental values over shorter periods of time With this article we re going to take an in depth look at McDonald s Corp   MCD  based on its fundamental value by the numbers   There are two primary reasons for writing this particular article at this particular time  both of which were instigated by reader comments and suggestions   First of all  we ve seen a running debate regarding whether McDonald s  MCD  is fairly valued or overvalued at today s valuation levels   Second  we ve been challenged to write articles that were depicting full value or overvaluation because we have typically only written articles on undervalued selections  We believe that because McDonald s had such a strong run in calendar year 2011  that many people believe that it now must be overvalued after rising so much McDonald s 2011 performance   Low  72 14   High  101 00We believe that most investors are at a disadvantage because they typically are left with making their investment decisions based on price movement alone   As we can see from the price only graph on McDonalds below  stock price rose very strongly throughout calendar year 2011  with only the month of September showing any negative movement  see red circle   Therefore  after an approximately 30  increase in value  many investors automatically assume that the company has become overvalued  On the other hand  as we will soon demonstrate  there is a difference between fairly valued  fully valued and overvalued Moreover  there can also be a significant difference between modestly overvalued versus dangerously overvalued  We believe these valuation distinctions are critical ones for investors to make   Understanding these differences will have a significant impact on the risk return relationship   As we will demonstrate  it is possible to buy a stock when it s fully valued or even modestly overvalued and still be able to generate strong overall performance on your investment   This point will be functionally related to the growth and more precisely  the rate of growth that the business behind the stock is capable of generating In other words  a company with powerful and or explosive growth can overcome the investor mistake of paying a little more than fundamentals would suggest  We will attempt to show that when the investor does this  pay a little more than they should  they take on more risk for the eventual return they achieve   However  if they do this with the right business  the rewards can still be handsome enough to compensate them for the extra risk   Conversely  we will also attempt to clearly illustrate that a smarter purchase is made when valuation is fair  or even better  low  Furthermore  investing at or below fair value enhances future returns while simultaneously lowering risk McDonald s   Fundamentally Speaking by the NumbersSince McDonald s is one of the most widely recognized brands on the entire planet  it hardly needs any introduction   Therefore  we will refrain from any descriptive dissertation on the company or its business   It s most likely that most readers will have had a direct experience with McDonald s at one point or the other from visiting one of their restaurants  Instead  our objective will be to examine the fundamental relationship and correlation between McDonald s the business  and McDonald s the common stock In order to accomplish this  we are going to run McDonald s  MCD  through its paces utilizing the dynamic fundamentals analyzer software tool   We re going to examine McDonald s Corp  over various time frames from long to short in order to measure several important relationships and metrics   First  we are going to evaluate McDonald s  historical operating earnings history and determine whether the company s earnings growth is accelerating or decelerating  In other words  has McDonald s  recent earnings growth been better or worse than its past earnings growth Furthermore  we want to discover how  Mr  Market  has traditionally treated McDonald s  business results by how it has traditionally priced their common stock  And very importantly  we want to evaluate how McDonald s  current stock price measures up relative to the historical norm  But most importantly of all  we re going to examine what the future holds for McDonald s  shareholders given today s current price and valuation McDonald s Corp   A 20 year History of its Earnings Price RelationshipWith our first graph we examine McDonald s  earnings and price relationship since the beginning of calendar year 1993   The orange line plots McDonald s  earnings per share each year and applies a fair value PE of 15 to its above average earnings growth rate of 11 5   Then we correlate monthly closing stock prices  the black line  to the orange earnings justified valuation line which draws a picture of how the market has historically valued McDonald s  shares relative to their earnings   The dark blue line represents a calculated normal PE ratio which indicates that the market has traditionally priced McDonald s  shares at a premium to their intrinsic value We have marked this graph with several arrows indicating variations in valuation   For the time frame 1998 to 1999 we marked the graph with an arrow marked OV for overvaluation   This is followed by an arrow marked UV for undervaluation for January 2003   Then we offer two arrows marked FV for fully valued at October 2003 and the other at May 2007   Then our final arrow marked IV for intrinsic value points to February 27  2009 when McDonald s  stock price was touching the orange line representing True Worth  valuation What we are demonstrating with this exercise is how you can visually see that overvaluation resulted in poor short to intermediate term performance for long term McDonald s  shareholders   However  even when McDonald s  shares were significantly overvalued  1999   true long term shareholders were still rewarded with capital appreciation if they still own the stock today   However  they would have had to endure several years of losses before the stock price began to rise again  On the other hand  they would have received an increase in dividend income every year even during the times when stock prices were falling The graphic also illustrates that those investors with the presence of mind and courage to buy McDonald s  stock once the price had fallen below the orange earnings justified valuation line were rewarded with excellent long term returns  and thanks to low valuation  achieved them at below average risk  Moreover  we can also see that investors that paid full value  the arrows marked FV  also achieved good returns over the long run  And finally  if McDonald s  shares were bought at intrinsic value  long term shareholder returns were strong The long term  19 plus year  historical earnings and price correlated graph on McDonald s  MCD  teaches us an important and final lesson on valuation  Notice on the above graph that McDonald s  stock price was touching the blue normal PE ratio line on the first day of the graph  and likewise is touching it at the closing price on January 30  2012   Consequently  earnings growth of 11 5  translates into an almost identical capital appreciation  Closing Annualized ROR  of 11 6  Furthermore  in addition to the approximately   712 705 of capital appreciation   100 000 initially invested grew to  809 751 45   McDonald s  shareholders received total cash dividends in excess of  117 000 that ballooned their total return to over 12 4  per annum  These numbers significantly exceed the numbers produced passively from the S P 500 index Examining the Consistency of McDonald s  Earnings Growth RecordNext we are going to look at several earnings and dividends only graphs starting with 20 years of history and then followed by subsequently shorter time frames   The purpose of this exercise is twofold   First of all  we want to illustrate how consistently McDonald s has performed as an operating business over time  And second  to show how McDonald s  earnings growth rate has remarkably accelerated in more recent times  which include the great recession of 2008   With our first chart we once again see that McDonald s grew earnings at 11 5  since 1993 With the next chart we cut five years off the time frame and measure McDonald s  earnings growth from 1998 to present   Here we discover a slight deceleration in McDonald s  earnings growth rate from 11 5  to 11 1    However  this time period 2001 2003 includes a recession  and represents the three worst performing years in McDonald s  history since calendar year 1993   Nevertheless  11 1  earnings growth remained very consistent  all things considered  with their long term historical average Things really get interesting when we look at McDonalds  earnings achievement over the 10 years  9 plus  since 2003  their last poor earnings year   Here we discover that McDonalds  earnings growth rate has accelerated to an average of 15 8  since calendar year 2003  Later  we will show the impact this had on shareholder performance  especially when considering that this was also a time when McDonalds  shares were undervalued With our next earnings and dividends only graph we look at the last five years  note the graph says six years because we include 2012  which of course has only gone on for one month   Here we discover that McDonalds has continued to generate an above average earnings growth rate right through and including the great recession of calendar years 2008 2009  Based on this graph  we re comfortable stating that McDonalds appears to be a very recession resistant business  see yellow shaded area on bottom the graph  Re examining McDonalds  10 year Earnings and Price RelationshipWith our next graph we reintroduce monthly closing stock prices to our 10 year earnings and dividend only graph on McDonalds   Here we discover that McDonalds  share price was undervalued at the beginning of calendar year 2003 and currently trades at the highest valuations it has over this 10 year period  9 years plus one month    However  we also see a very highly correlated long term relationship where price follows earnings   Notice how every time the price deviates from the orange earnings justified valuation line over or under  it inevitably and usually in short order  returns to fair value Furthermore  thanks to this blue chip company s consistent and above average earnings growth rate  there really is no bad time to invest in McDonalds  stock on this graph  Even if you bought McDonalds  stock when the price was above the dark blue normal PE ratio line  the investor would have still made money over the longer term   Of course  it s also clearly evident that the best time to invest in McDonalds is when price sits below the orange line  Clearly  when valuations are lower  so is risk  and better yet  the longer term rate of return is greater also A final take away from this graph is that on a historical basis since calendar year 2003  McDonalds  stock is clearly trading at a higher than normal valuation  On the other hand  the current valuation is not so high that it would destroy any potential for future returns   Instead  today s moderate overvaluation would in theory only reduce returns to a less than optimal level   Furthermore  based on historical price action  it would also seem logical to assume that the patient investor would have the opportunity  in the not too distant future  to buy McDonalds when valuations would be better aligned with earnings  At least  this has always happened before  as the graph so vividly depicts The performance results associated with the above graph illustrates how powerful and rewarding it can be to invest in a great stock where its price is undervalued   McDonalds grew earnings at the above average rate of 15 8  since calendar year 2003   However  beginning undervaluation accelerated shareholder returns to over 22  per annum based on capital appreciation  and to just under 24  per annum when cumulative dividends are added in  however not reinvested  Our final historical graph simply shows that although McDonalds  current blended PE ratio of 18 7 is slightly higher than normal  it is not excessively high   We can see from the below graph that from 1997 through 2002  McDonalds  PE ratio was much higher at a range between PEs of 24 to 26 times earnings McDonalds Looking to the FutureAfter examining McDonalds  history over several different time frames we learn that this company has a very consistent record of growing earnings at double digit rates   Moreover  we also learned that  Mr  Market  has shown a penchant of pricing McDonalds  shares within reasonable variations of its earnings achievements   However  it s now time to look to the future in order to answer the question posed by the title of this article of whether or not McDonalds is too rich to buy or hold at today s prices So utilizing our Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator  let s start out by looking at our default estimates based on the current consensus of 19 analysts reporting to Capital IQ   Here we discover two things that we believe are important   First of all  the consensus of leading analysts expect McDonalds  earnings to only grow at a below historical average rate of 10  per annum over the next five years Moreover  the consensus for calendar year 2012 is for earnings to only grow at 9   see blue circle  before moving on to the average 5 year growth estimate of 10   Based on McDonalds  past history we feel it s logical to assume that there might at least be a moderately negative bias to current estimates  This seems even stranger when you consider that on January 24  2012  McDonalds reported fourth quarter calendar year 2011 earnings growth of approximately 15   and the same number for all of calendar year 2011  note that our graphs are only showing 2011 earnings growth of 14  and marked with an E for estimate  the official data has not yet filtered through the database  Assuming that consensus estimates are correct  it would appear that McDonalds  shares are currently moderately overvalued  share price more than two years ahead of earnings   red line    The four lighter colored orange lines  two above and two below the darker orange line  represent what we like to call the value corridor   Notice that the lines are all parallel to each other and sloped at the estimated growth rate of 10    Also  the appropriate PE ratios that apply to each of the lines are listed on the scale to the right of the graph  Therefore  the calculated five year estimated total return of 8 4  per annum  assumes that McDonalds does in fact grow earnings at the consensus rate of 10   and that the market appropriately capitalizes that growth at a PE of 15 However  when you consider that McDonalds has grown earnings at 15 7  since calendar year 2007  and that their earnings growth in 2011 was also 15   the consensus estimate of only 10  seems low   Therefore  utilizing the override feature of the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator  we will recalculate our expectations for McDonalds  five year estimated future growth using their 15 7  historical average  In other words  we are asking  what if  McDonalds continues to grow earnings as it has in the past When we redraw the chart using these numbers  we discover that McDonalds may still currently be fully valued where its price is now sitting near the top of the value corridor  the top light orange line   However  we believe it would be a stretch to call it overvalued at today s price levels   Considering  that if McDonalds was to continue achieving its historical growth  then the potential for a total annual return of approximately 15  or better becomes very real  The following Earnings Yield Estimator table expresses the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator in numerical form   This table calculates McDonalds  annual earnings and annual dividends based on estimating their future earnings growth rate at the same rate of their historical achievement  For a clear perspective of valuation  these estimated earnings and dividend values are compared to what can be earned on a theoretically riskless 10 year Treasury  In other words  if the stock is trading at any type of fair value  then it should obviously be able to generate total cumulative earnings and dividends that are far in excess of what a theoretically riskless investment in a Treasury bond would generate ConclusionsUnfortunately  most investors are forced to rely on charts based solely on stock price in order to determine whether the stock is a good buy  sell or hold   Consequently  it s very easy to become misled by either a rapidly rising or rapidly falling stock price   We believe that the only way to really have a clear vision of the appropriateness of investing in any given stock is when price and fundamentals can be viewed simultaneously When you examine the 20 year earnings  fundamentals  and price correlated graph on McDonalds  the relationship between fundamentals and stock price can be vividly seen  Therefore  more appropriate buy  sell or hold decisions can be made based on a sound foundation of fundamentals   This is not to imply that perfect decisions can be made  but we believe it is clear that when price and fundamentals are viewed in concert with each other  a more learned perspective is attained When applying these principles to McDonalds  current valuation  it appears that McDonalds  stock is currently fully priced  but once again  we would stop short of calling it overpriced   Although we would not purchase McDonalds  stock at today s prices  we only make that decision based on the belief that sometime in the near future we might be given the opportunity to invest in this blue chip at a better valuation   This opinion is founded upon the principles of valuing earnings  and the long term history of how the market has specifically valued

196770,418286,MCD,Why Wall Street Should Stop Whining,opinion,Everybody on Wall Street is talking about the new piece by New York magazine s Gabriel Sherman  entitled The article argues that Barack Obama killed everything that was joyful about the banking industry through his suffocating Dodd Frank reform bill  which forced banks to strip themselves of  the pistons that powered their profits  leverage and proprietary trading   Having to say goodbye to excess borrowing and casino gambling  the argument goes  has cut into banking profits  leading to extreme decisions like Morgan Stanley s recent dictum capping cash bonuses at  125 000  In response to that  Sherman quotes an unnamed banker   After tax  that s like  what   75 000   an investment banker at a rival firm said as he contemplated Morgan Stanley s decision  He ran the numbers  modeling the implications   I m not married and I take the subway and I watch what I spend very carefully  But my girlfriend likes to eat good food  It all adds up really quick  A taxi here  another taxi there  I just bought an apartment  so now I have a big old mortgage bill  Quelle horreur  And who s to blame  According to Sherman s interview subjects  it has nothing to do with the economy having been blown up several times over by these very bonus deprived bankers  or with the fact that all conceivable public bailout money has essentially already been sucked up and converted into bonuses by that same crowd No  it instead apparently has everything to do with the Dodd Frank bill  and specifically the Volcker rule banning proprietary trading  which incidentally hasn t gone into effect yet He quotes Dick Bove  the noted analyst who last year downgraded Goldman Sachs  Bove s quote on the bonus sadness  The government has strangled the financial system   banking analyst Dick Bove told me recently   We ve basically castrated these companies  They can t borrow as much as they used to borrow  When I read things like this I m simultaneously amazed by two things  The first is the unbelievable tone deafness of people who would complain out loud  during a time when millions of people around the country are literally losing their homes  that their bonuses   not their total compensation  mind you  but just their cash bonuses  paid in addition to their salaries and their stock packages   are barely enough to cover the mortgage payments for their new condos  the taxis they take when walking is too burdensome  and their girlfriends with expensive tastes The second thing that amazes me is that Sherman is buying all this  I don t know this reporter at all  and I m happy to concede that he probably hangs out with more Wall Street people than I do  But I m still in touch with plenty of people in the business  and I have yet to have any investment bankers crying on my shoulder about how the Dodd Frank bill is forcing them into generic breakfast cereals Now  I m sure if you put it to them the right way    Hey  Mr  Habitually Overpaid Banker  do you think Barack Obama and the Dodd Frank bill are ruining your bonus season     you ll get a good percentage of people who ll take that cheese and cough out the desired quote   But in reality  Please  Wall Street people complain a lot  but in the last six months  the grave impact of Dodd Frank on bonuses hasn t even been within ten miles of the things these people are really panicked about  The comments I ve heard have been more like   My asshole has been puckered completely shut for four months in a row over this Europe business   or   If the ECB doesn t come up with a Greek bailout package  I m going to have to sell my children for dog food  Bonuses are indeed down this year  especially when compared with the bonuses of recent years  but let s be clear about why  It has nothing to do with Dodd Frank  We can posit three other factors 1  Banks have unfortunately had to give up the practice of simply printing trillions of dollars out of thin air by selling off worthless mortgages for huge profits and or making millions of synthetic copies of those same worthless mortgage assets 2  After twice being saved from the execution chamber by Ben Bernanke s Quantitative Easing programs  which printed trillions of new dollars and injected them straight into Wall Street s arm  Wall Street was rocked this summer when Helicopter Ben decided to temporarily forestall QE3 3  Europe  a slightly more than minor factor in the global financial picture  is imploding  causing mass hoarding of assets all over the world  severely impacting the business of investment banks everywhere Now  Sherman barely even mentions Europe in his article  which is interesting  because the banks on whose behalf he wails so loudly in this piece have mostly all pointed to Europe as more or less the sole reason for their reduced revenues of late Take for instance Lloyd Blankfein and Goldman  Sachs  Lloyd has the most famous reduced bonus on Wall Street     it was  12 6 million last year  as his bank  Goldman    Goldman s  6 1 billion in revenues was down 30  off last year s fourth quarter  To what does the big Lloyd attribute this sad development  This past year was dominated by global macro economic concerns which significantly affected our clients  risk tolerance and willingness to transact   Blankfein said   While our results declined as a consequence  I am pleased that the firm retained its industry leading positions across our global client franchise while prudently managing risk  capital and expenses  As economies and markets improve   and we see encouraging signs of this   Goldman Sachs is very well positioned to perform for our clients and our shareholders  Translation  Europe is such a mess right now that all our biggest clients are sitting on their money instead of letting us steal it from them  However  once Europe rebounds  as we expect it to  we will be well positioned to start stealing from them again Goldman s numbers offer a hilarious counterpoint to Sherman s piece  The bank s earnings in total for last year were  4 4 billion  down some 65  off of last year s numbers  Its revenues for the year were down 26   Despite these bummerific numbers  Goldman reduced bonuses and compensation by only 21   down to  a mere   12 2 billion  If the era of outsized bonuses is over  how come the biggest banks aren t even cutting them to match revenues  much less profits  One could even interpret Goldman s numbers as a major increase in the size of the bonus pool  relative to earnings But what about other banks  Well  Citigroup also saw a drop in revenues for the year  although its net income actually went up  from  10 6 billion to  11 3 billion   But what was most concerning was the bank s crappy fourth quarter  when it suffered an 11  drop in earnings So where did CEO Vikram Pandit lay the blame for the lost revenue  Dodd Frank  Reduced leverage  Uh  no  He blamed Europe  too  Clearly  the macro environment has impacted the capital markets and we will continue to right size our businesses to match the environment   Pandit said How about JP Morgan Chase  The bank s CEO  Jamie Dimon  was breathlessly quoted in the Sherman piece  and in fact had this to say to Sherman about the culture change  Certain products are gone forever   Dimon tells Sherman   Fancy derivatives are mostly gone  Prop trading is gone  There s less leverage everywhere  So it s prop trading and derivatives that s the problem  That s not what Wall Street analysts said  when Chase posted a 23  drop in earnings in the fourth quarter  While Dimon in a Q A last month did go off on the potential problems the Volcker rule might inspire in the future  he was careful to note that those problems are still very much future problems   I m going to put Volcker aside  okay  because that really hasn t been written yet   Instead  virtually every headline about Chase s fourth quarter earnings drop pegged Euro troubles   JPMorgan Chase  JPM  ended a long run of profit gains when it logged a steep drop in fourth quarter earnings Friday  as weakness in Europe contributed to a decline in investment banking revenue     The Telegraph commented thusly   JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon struck a positive note on the outlook for the US economy even as Europe s debt crisis dragged down the bank s quarterly profits  And Dimon himself seemed to go along with his counterparts at Goldman and Citi in blaming macro troubles for the recent drop  talking about issues with the  current environment  The bank s third quarter profit fell 4  as its businesses were hit hard by Europe s financial woes and the fragile recovery in the United States  All things considered  we believe the firm s returns were reasonable given the current environment   said Jamie Dimon  JP Morgan s chairman and chief executive When I look at the revenue and bonus numbers on Wall Street this year  I see a number of companies that  despite being functionally insolvent in reality and dependent upon a combination of corrupt accounting and cheap cash from the Fed to survive  are still paying out enormous amounts of money in compensation In fact  when one considers the lost billions and trillions from the end of the mortgage bubble scam and the expiration of the quantitative easing program  it s pretty incredible  one might even call it an inspirational testament to the industry s dedication to the cause of high compensation  that bonuses are even in the same ballpark as they used to be And all of this is just looking at things from a bottom line  Wall Street centric point of view  Looking at the question from the point of view of an ordinary human being  however  Sherman s thesis is even more nuts  He s written a sort of investment banking version of Jimmy Carter s  malaise  speech  complaining about a lost era of easy money  when in fact there are two damning realities he s ignored 1  He s wrong  See the above argument about Europe  QE  etc 2  Even if he wasn t wrong  which he is  his reaction to the  news  that Wall Street s outsized bonuses are dropping is all wrong  If it were true  it would be good news  not bad news Since 2008  the rest of America has suffered a severe economic correction  Ordinary people everywhere long ago had to learn to cope with the equivalent of a lower bonus season  When the crash hit  regular people could not make up the difference through bailouts or zero interest loans from the Fed or leveraged up synthetic derivative schemes  They just had to deal with the fact that the economy sucked   and they adjusted This ought to have been true also on Wall Street  but in a curious development that is somehow not addressed in Sherman s piece  the denizens of the financial services industry managed to maintain their extravagant lifestyle standards in the middle of a historic global economic crash that  incidentally  they themselves caused After suffering one truly bad year   2008  in which the securities industry collectively lost over  42 billion   Wall Street immediately rebounded to post record revenues in 2009  despite the fact that the economy at large did nothing of the sort  The numbers were so huge on Wall Street compared to the rest of the world that Goldman slashed its 4th quarter bonuses  just so that the final bonus comp number   16 2 billion  down from what would have been  21 billion  didn t look so garish to the rest of broke America What Sherman now argues is that Dodd Frank has so completely hindered Wall Street s ability to magically invent profits through borrowing and gambling that  unlike those wonderful days in 2009  its fortunes are now reduced to rising and falling   heaven forbid   along with the rest of the economy  Things are so bad  his interview subjects argue  that one is now more likely to make big money going into an actual business that makes an actual product  If you re a smart Ph D  from MIT  you d never go to Wall Street now   says a hedge fund executive   You d go to Silicon Valley  There s at least a prospect for a huge gain  You d have the potential to be the next Mark Zuckerberg  Once upon a time  Sherman argues  banking was boring   In the quaint old days  Wall Street tended to earn its profits rather boringly by loaning money  advising mergers  and supervising bond issues and IPOs   he writes  But then  in the eighties  the business became  turbocharged  when new ways to create leverage were introduced  A sudden surge in credit turned this staid business into the realm of super compensated superheroes Credit was the engine that powered the explosion in bank profits  From junk bonds in the eighties to the emerging markets crisis in the nineties to the subprime mania of the aughts  Wall Street developed new ways to produce  package  and sell debt to willing investors  The alphabet soup of complex vehicles that defined the 2008 crash   CLO  CDO  CDS   had all been developed to sell more credit But all of this leverage led to problems  Sherman grudgingly concedes  and those problems led to reforms  and now Wall Street is being threatened with a return to those  quaint  days of loaning money and supervising bond issues and such Such a return is being demanded by the 99 percenters  much loathed by Sherman s interview subjects and portrayed as a bunch of ignoramuses who don t understand where their bread is buttered  In New York especially  it s the regular people  he argues  who benefitted from all that crazy leverage  Why  without ginormous leverage generated bonuses  New York would be   Philadelphia Consciously or not  as a city  New York made a bargain  It would tolerate the one percent s excessive pay as long as the rising tax base funded the schools  subways  and parks for the 99 percent   Without Wall Street  New York becomes Philadelphia  is how a friend of mine in finance explains it Sherman then goes further In this view  deleveraging Wall Street means killing the goose Look  the financial services industry should be boring  It should be quaint  Let s take the municipal debt business  For ages  it was a simple  dull  low margin sort of industry  in which banks arranged municipal bond issues and made small but dependable profits as cities and towns financed improvements and construction projects That system worked seamlessly for decades  until people like Sherman s interview subjects suddenly decided to make the business exciting  You know what happens when you make municipal debt exciting  Jefferson County  Alabama happens  Or  on a macro level  Greece happens When making a few points on mere bond issues stops being enough  and you have to cook up crazy swap schemes and indices to bet against those schemes  ingenious scams allowing politicians to borrow billions of dollars that they will never in a million years be able to pay back  you might end up getting a few parks  schools  and subways in New York But what you get everywhere else is a giant clusterfuck that costs the rest of us years and even more billions of tax dollars to remedy This is what the protests are all about   it s anger that Wall Street has been profiting from an imaginary economy that leaves bankers overpaid  but creates damage everywhere else  Sherman doesn t get this  He seems to subscribe to the well worn straw man position that protesters are simply upset that bankers and financiers make a lot of money  Take for example his view on John Paulson  the hedge fund titan who was involved in Goldman s infamous Abacus deal In October  a thousand protesters stood outside John Paulson s Upper East Side townhouse and offered the hedge fund billionaire a mock  5 billion check  the amount he earned from his 2010 investments  Later that day  Paulson released a statement attacking the protesters and their movement    The truth was  Paulson was furious that the protesters had singled him out  Last year  he lost billions of dollars on bad bets on gold and the banking sector  One of his funds posted a 52 percent loss   The ironic thing is John lost a lot of money this year   a person close to Paulson told me   The fact that John got roped into this debate highlights their misunderstanding  Hey  asshole  nobody misunderstands anything about John Paulson  They re not mad that he made billions the year before  and they re not happy that he lost money this year  They re mad that the way he made his money in previous years   which involved putting together a born to lose portfolio of toxic mortgage bonds and then using Goldman Sachs to dump them on a pair of European banks  who in turn had no idea that Paulson was betting against them At least part of this transaction was illegal  so ruled the SEC  anyway   and all of it looks pretty damned underhanded  And if the benefit to society from this sort of work is the tax money New York City received from the proceeds of this fleecing  well  we re willing to go without those taxes  thank you very much Listening to Wall Street whine about how it is misunderstood is nothing new  It s been going on for years  often in that same mag   But if Sherman s piece heralds a new era of Wall Street complaining about how it is not only misunderstood but undercompensated  you ll have to excuse me while I spend the next month or so vomiting into my shoes The financial services industry went from having a 19 percent share of America s corporate profits decades ago to having a 41 percent share in recent years  That doesn t mean bankers ever represented anywhere near 41 percent of America s labor value  It just means they ve managed to make themselves horrifically overpaid relative to their counterparts in the rest of the economy A banker s job is to be a prudent and dependable steward of other peoples  money   being worthy of our trust in that area is the entire justification for their traditionally high compensation Yet these people have failed so spectacularly at that job in the last fifteen years that they re lucky that God himself didn t come down to earth at bonus time this year  angrily boot their asses out of those new condos  and command those Zagat reading girlfriends of theirs to start getting acquainted with the McDonalds value meal lineup  They should be glad they re still getting anything at all  not whining to New York
