The court unanimously tossed a previous ruling by the Fifth U S  Circuit Court of Appeals that had favored the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service  finding the lower court gave the government too much leeway 
The U S  government identified Louisiana land partly owned by WY as meeting the criteria for the frog s habitat under the federal Endangered Species Act 
But Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the appeals court s broad definition of what can be defined as  critical habitat  under the Act was incorrect  citing limits on the scope of government authority to make such determinations 
Roberts also said the lower court must consider the decision that the potential economic costs to WY were not  disproportionate  to the conservation benefits

call over to Devin Stockfish Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Beth  Good morning  everyone and thank you for joining us today  This morning Weyerhaeuser reported a full year net loss of  76 million  or  0 10 per diluted share  driven by a previously reported  0 47 non cash pension settlement charge  Excluding special items  our full year 2019 earnings totaled  285 million  or  0 39 per share For the fourth quarter  we reported a GAAP loss of  14 million  or  0 02 per diluted share  Excluding net charges of  37 million for special items  we earned  23 million  or  0 03 per diluted share for the quarter  Throughout 2019  all of our businesses executed well  despite significant headwinds from sluggish housing activity in the first half of the year  persistently challenged commodity prices and continued global trade uncertainty I m extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2019  which included achieving record low  controllable manufacturing costs in our lumber  and oriented strand board operations  capturing over  100 million of operational excellence improvements  delivering the highest EBITDA ever from our Real Estate Energy and Natural Resources business to delivering a 61  premium to timber value from real estate sales  strategically optimizing portions of our Northern Timberlands portfolio for total proceeds of nearly  450 million  reducing our pension obligations by  1 5 billion  and returning over  1 billion of cash to shareholders Before I dive into our fourth quarter business results  let me set the stage with some brief remarks on the housing market  The improved pace of US housing activity that emerged during the third quarter continued steadily through year end  Building activity in December was particularly strong  For the year  US housing starts totaled  1 29 million  a 3  improvement compared with the year ago Looking forward  economic fundamentals support continued growth in US housing activity  Real wages and household incomes are increasing  The unemployment rate is at a 50 year low  Household formations are at levels well above the historical average  Mortgage rates remained extremely favorable at 3 6   Homebuilder sentiment is at the highest level since 1999  The inventory of new and existing homes for sale is low  and builders continue to shift more product to serve the significant demand for affordable housing  However  notwithstanding these positive demand fundamentals  we do expect the upside on housing will continue to be governed by many of the same supply side challenges that we faced for a number of years  These include labor availability  lot availability and regulatory burdens that make it more difficult to bring affordable housing to market As we enter 2020  unadjusted housing starts have exceeded 1 3 million on a run rate basis for eight of the last nine months  a sign that supply side infrastructure can support this level of increased activity  Our outlook is for continued modest growth in US housing  For 2020  we anticipate just over 1 3 million starts  with the improvement driven primarily by additional single family activity Turning now to our fourth quarter business results  I ll begin the discussion with Timberlands Charts 5 through 7  Timberlands contributed  85 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items  and  158 million to adjusted EBITDA  Western Timberlands EBITDA increased  14 million compared with the third quarter  Average sales realizations for domestic and Japanese export logs increased  and road and forestry expenses were seasonally lower  In the West  fourth quarter weather was milder than normal  and log supply remained above average due to favorable logging conditions  Domestic demand remained steady through the quarter  as Western lumber pricing improved and mills took limited holiday downtime In our export markets  our average log sales realizations to Japan increased slightly compared with the third quarter  while log sales volumes were slightly lower  Although Japanese housing starts have moderated somewhat following the recent increase in the consumption tax  the effect on our key post and beam end market has been minimal  Post and beam starts were down only 1 5  year to date through November  and demand for our logs remained solid  In addition  a reduction in Canadian log exports to Japan is driving some Japanese saw millers to seek additional US log supply In China  the market for US logs weakened in the fourth quarter  as abundant competition from salvaged European spruce logs continued to pressure pricing downward  To total log inventories at Chinese ports  increased 6  during the quarter and ended the year at a relatively balanced 3 7 million cubic meters  However  the share of European spruce has continued to grow  Through November  European logs comprised about 17  of China s year to date softwood log imports  compared with only 3  in 2018 Our fourth quarter China export realizations decreased compared with the third quarter and sales volumes declined  Although demand for our China export logs continues to hold up fairly well  we are choosing the flex volume to the domestic market to capture higher margin opportunities  Compared with the year ago quarter  our total Western log export revenue decreased significantly due to lower sales realizations and volumes in China and Japan Moving to the South  Southern Timberlands EBITDA decreased  6 million compared with the third quarter  Southern log supply is tightened briefly in October due to wet weather  but normalized quickly thereafter with more favorable operating conditions  Mill inventories remained well supplied through the fourth quarter and our average log realizations decreased 1   Fee harvest volumes declined 3  compared with the third quarter  although we had hoped to fully catch up on thinning activity postponed during the unusually wet conditions in early 2019  We were unable to complete all of the activity during the fourth quarter On the export side  we continue to operate our Southern log export business at minimal volumes due to the ongoing 25  Chinese tariff on Southern yellow pine logs  Comparing overall Southern Timberlands fourth quarter results with the year ago quarter  EBITDA decreased by  4 million due to lower fee harvest volumes and higher road costs  This was partially offset by higher average Southern sawlog realizations  Northern Timberlands EBITDA decreased  1 million compared with the third quarter and  3 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2018  Fee harvest volumes decreased due to the sale of our Michigan Timberlands  which closed in November  Average realizations decreased slightly Real Estate Energy and Natural Resources Charts 8 and 9  Real Estate and ENR contributed  22 million to fourth quarter earnings and  37 million to adjusted EBITDA  For the full year  the segment generated  274 million of EBITDA  an increase of  10 million from 2018  Fourth quarter EBITDA was  23 million lower than the third quarter and  53 million lower than the year ago period  due to the timing of real estate sales  Construction materials and energy royalties also decreased slightly As expected  the number of acres sold in the fourth quarter decreased significantly compared with the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2018  During 2019  our real estate sales activity was heavily weighted toward the first half of the year  whereas in 2018  most of our sales occurred in the third and fourth quarters  Average price per acre was comparable to the third quarter in the year ago quarter  An average land basis as a percentage of real estate sales was lower due to transaction mix Wood Products  Charts 10 and 11  Wood Products contributed  60 million to fourth quarter earnings and  110 million to adjusted EBITDA  I m very pleased with our fourth quarter Wood Products performance  As our teams continue to display an unwavering focus on achieving operational excellence and an industry leading cost structure  Our results include meaningful operating performance records in each of our four Wood Products businesses For both the fourth quarter and full year 2019  our lumber and OSB businesses delivered the lowest controllable unit manufacturing costs in our history  Engineered wood products reduce controllable spending by over  11 million on a full year basis  and distribution delivered its highest fourth quarter EBITDA ever  Compared with fourth quarter 2018  Wood Products EBITDA increased  44 million or over 65   despite flat lumber realizations and significantly lower pricing for OSB  Compared with the third quarter  EBITDA decreased  13 million  as seasonally lower sales volumes were partially offset by record fourth quarter cost performance in lumber and oriented strand board EBITDA for lumber decreased  6 million compared with the third quarter  Seasonally lower sales volumes and slightly higher cost for Western and Canadian logs were partially offset by lower controllable manufacturing costs  Although  lumber prices continue to trade in a narrow range during the fourth quarter pricing for many products did recover slightly  as stronger housing activity generated incremental demand and channel inventories remained generally low On average  the framing lumber composite increased 3  in the fourth quarter compared with the third  Our average lumber realizations were comparable to the third quarter  Our production mix is more heavily weighted to wide with Southern yellow pine which saw a 9  decrease in published pricing  Our lumber  sales volumes decreased 4  compared with the third quarter and our production volume decreased slightly as we took some additional downtime for maintenance and capital projects Fourth quarter EBITDA includes  4 million of charges for countervailing and antidumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber  Compared with the year ago quarter  lumber EBITDA improved by  37 million  due to lower unit manufacturing costs  lower Western log cost  and modestly higher sales volumes  OSB EBITDA improved  6 million compared with the third quarter  Slightly improved realizations and slightly lower unit manufacturing cost and fiber cost more than offset a 2  decrease in sales volumes  Fourth quarter OSB pricing generally mirrored that of lumber  The benchmark OSB composite price increased 6  compared with the third quarter  Our average realizations increased 1  as the length of our order files creates a lag between published and realized pricing Comparing our fourth quarter results to the year ago quarter  OSB EBITDA decreased by  12 million  Average sales realizations for OSB decreased by 14   but this was significantly offset by lower unit manufacturing costs  higher sales volumes and slightly lower fiber costs  Engineered Wood Products EBITDA decreased  14 million compared with the third quarter  Sales volumes for both solid section and I Joists decreased seasonally  and dealers and builders sought to minimize the year end inventories  Although  our overall operating rate decreased  unit manufacturing costs improved slightly  Average sales realizations for I Joists increased by 1   average realizations for solid section products decreased by 1   due to seasonal mix Compared with the year ago quarter  EBITDA improved by  15 million due primarily to lower fiber and unit manufacturing costs  Distribution EBITDA totaled  8 million for the fourth quarter  This is  2 million lower than the third quarter as seasonally lower sales volumes were partially offset by lower warehouse and delivery costs  Compared with the year ago quarter  EBITDA increased by  6 million due to higher sales volumes  This improvement is partially attributable to an operational excellence initiative to upgrade the businesses product mix I d like to turn now to operational excellence  As a company  we achieved over  100 million of operational excellence improvements in 2019  I m very proud of the hard work  creativity and cross business collaboration that drove these results  Timberland s did a remarkable job in capturing  48 million of improvements  primarily from initiatives to further optimize silviculture  forestry and road activities  reduce costs  and improve log merchandising and marketing to maximize the revenue from every log we harvest Wood Products captured  52 million of improvements and has now achieved black at the bottom  as we defined it six years ago  Our 2019 improvements in Wood Products came from initiatives in three primary areas  reducing unit manufacturing cost for lumber and oriented strand board  improving product mix in lumber and distribution  and increasing log recovery across our mill system Beyond each businesses individual efforts  we also captured value through initiatives to generate cross business opex  Historically  our opex focus has been on improved performance within the business segment  But we have also begun to identify opportunities to drive integrated opex by increasing collaboration between our Timberlands and Wood Products Operations  The most obvious is further optimizing deliveries of our own logs to our own mills  This year through cross business collaboration  we delivered  7 million of opex that improve the margin of both segments Our operational excellence program has delivered well over  0 5 billion of companywide margin improvement since 2014  This is an incredible achievement  But over time  this level of success also means the traditional margin improvement opportunities of this magnitude become harder to capture  So we are taking a fresh look at opex and what it means for our company  As we enter 2020  we are evolving  how we define and measure operational excellence at Weyerhaeuser  Operational excellence has been and will continue to be focused on disciplined cost management and margin improvements  But we are also expanding opex to include activities to drive future value and improve efficiencies across businesses and functions Our opex 2 0 as we are calling it  will include four main components to drive continued improvements across our company  First is margin improvement  These are the familiar opex initiatives focused on improving margin by capturing value at both the top and bottom line  Second is future value  These initiatives recognize activities that drive improved value in the future  A good example is working to execute on our targeted thinning  reforestation and fertilization programs at the highest levels of quality and completeness  We know this improves the value of our Timberlands over time Third is cost avoidance  This category is aimed at avoiding future cost or cost increases  Examples might include reducing employee turnover and optimize procurement initiatives  And fourth is efficiency  These initiatives will focus on improvements that enable higher value use of our resources  Examples would include things such as automating manual work or simplifying business processes Together  these four categories expand the breadth of opex to include every business and function across our company  I m really excited about the opportunities that opex 2 0 creates and the potential  it has to further drive our working together culture  In 2020  we re targeting  50 million to  70 million of additional opex improvements from these areas  And I look forward to sharing more about our key initiatives as the year progresses I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Devin and good morning  Key outlook items for the first quarter and the full year 2020 are presented on Charts 14 and 15 of the earnings slides  In our Timberlands business  we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the fourth quarter Aand our Western Timberland s operations  demand remained stable throughout the fourth quarter  Mills took advantage of steady product takeaway into January  Log supply is adequate and log inventories remain at reasonable levels  We expect our first quarter domestic log sales volumes will be higher than the fourth quarter The seasonally improved demand  we expect average sales realizations will be modestly higher  Western road costs will be lower compared to the fourth quarter  as our road work activity slows as we progressed through the winter months  We expect our first quarter Japanese export log sales volumes will increase compared to the fourth quarter and average log sales realizations will be comparable  Demand for our logs remains solid with additional support from continued disruption of the supply competing logs coming out of Western Canada Our Chinese export log sales volumes will decline in the first quarter and average log sales realizations are expected to be modestly lower in the fourth quarter on softer demand due to the Lunar New Year and continued competition from salvage European spruce logs  In the South  we anticipate our first quarter fee harvest volumes will be seasonally lower and average log sales realizations are expected to be similar to fourth quarter levels In the North  first quarter harvest volumes will be lower following the November close of the sale of our Michigan Timberland s  Fourth quarter special items include a  48 million pre tax gain related to that transaction  In December  we announced an agreement to sell our Montana Timberlands for  145 million and recorded an  80 million pre tax non cash impairment charge in connection with the agreement  which is also included as a special item in our fourth quarter results  The Montana transaction is expected to close in the second quarter and those assets are now listed on our balance sheet as held for sale Turning to the full year 2020  we expect total company harvest volume to be slightly over 36 million tons  We expect our Southern harvest volumes will be comparable to 2019  now harvest volume in the West will be down slightly  In the North  our harvest volumes will approximately be 40  lower than 2019  due to the divestitures of our Michigan and Montana Timberlands  Collectively  our Michigan and Montana properties do not generate a meaningful EBITDA contribution to our overall Timberland segment In our Real Estate  Energy and Natural Resources segment  we continue to see strong interest in real estate across our markets and the Pacific Northwest is particularly active  For the full year 2020  we expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately  255 million  This guidance incorporates the effects of fewer available real estate acres following the divestitures of Montana and Michigan  We expect the cadence of our 2020 real estate activity be similar to 2019  We anticipate land basis as a percentage of real estate sales will be between 55  and 65  for the year  For the first quarter  we expect adjusted EBITDA for the segment will be nearly comparable to the year ago quarter  while earnings will be approximately  15 million lower  We expect first quarter land basis as a percentage of real estate sales  we near the high end of the full year guidance range Across our Wood Products business  our customers expects optimism for the year ahead  Buyers continue to purchase for specific needs and channel inventories are moderate  We anticipate sales volumes for lumber and oriented strand board will be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter  For engineered wood products  we expect seasonally improved operating rates and lower per unit manufacturing costs in the first quarter  We expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA for Wood Products segment will be slightly higher than the fourth quarter before any benefit from improvement in average sales realizations For lumber  first quarter to date average sales realizations are  20 higher than the fourth quarter average and current realizations are  25 above the fourth quarter average  Oriented strand board first quarter to date and current average sales realizations are comparable with the fourth quarter average  As a reminder  for lumber every  10 change in realizations is approximately  11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis  For OSB  every  10 change in realizations is approximately  8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis Chart 12 outlines the major components of our fourth quarter unallocated items  Unallocated corporate function and variable compensation expense increased compared to the third quarter due to seasonally higher spending and a year to date adjustment for incentive compensation  Fourth quarter results also include a small non cash expense from elimination of profit in inventory and LIFO  compared with an income from this item in the third quarter Special items in fourth quarter consists of  6 million non cash settlement charge related to transfers of Canadian pension assets and liabilities  In our pension and post retirement plans in 2019  we made significant progress against the series of actions we announced in 2018  to reduce the liabilities associated with those plans  while maintaining benefits security for our plan participants  In the last 18 months  we ve reduced our future obligations by over  2 billion The year end 2019 funded status for our pension and post retirement plans decreased by approximately  200 million compared to 2018  as a result of a reduction in discount rates  Discount rates declined by approximately 100 basis points for the US plans and 60 basis points for the Canadian plans  Into 2019  we did not make any cash contributions to the US qualified pension plan and we are not required to make any cash contributions in 2020  Cash paid for all other pension and post retirement plans in 2019 was  45 million  Required cash payments for these plans will be approximately  30 million for 2020  Excluding pension settlement charges  our non cash  non operating pension  and post retirement expense was  61 million in 2019  We expect to record approximately  40 million of expense in 2020  The decrease is a reduction    is a result of the reduction at discount rates Turning to our key financial items  which is summarized on Chart 13  We entered 2019 with a cash balance of  139 million  Cash from operations during the fourth quarter was  292 million  For the full year 2019  cash from operations was  966 million  Our capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled  143 million and for the full year 2019 were  384 million  Looking ahead to 2020  we anticipate total capex will be approximately  360 million  a  120 million for Timberlands  inclusive of reforestation costs   235 million for Wood products and approximately  5 million for corporate IT system upgrades Investing cash flows for the fourth quarter also included  297 million of net proceeds from the sale of our Michigan Timberlands  You ll also recall that in the third quarter 2019  we paid  302 million to extinguish the debt of a variable interest entity that was established  as part of a timber installment sale in the early 2000  Earlier this month  we received  362 million of cash from the maturity of the related financial instrument  This is the last of these variable interest entities Moving on to financing  We ended the quarter with approximately  6 4 billion of total debt outstanding  This included  230 million balance on our line of credit  which was used to bridge the temporary cash outflow associated with the variable interest entity debt maturity  We have no debt maturities until 2021  As you may have seen in the 8 K that we filed earlier this week  we refinanced our  1 5 billion revolving line of credit to capture more attractive pricing  The new credit facility has a five year term that will expire in 2025  In the fourth quarter  interest expense was  89 million  bringing our full year expense to  366 million  excluding special items  We expect interest expense will be  345 million for the full year 2020 I ll close my comments with taxes  Excluding special items  in the fourth quarter  we recorded  2 million of income tax expense  For the full year 2019  our effective tax rate before special items was a benefit of 13   For first quarter and full year 2020  we expect a tax expense of 10  to 15  based on the forecasted mix of earnings for our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary Turning to cash taxes  we received  2 million net tax refund for the full year 2019  inclusive of a  43 million federal tax refund in the fourth quarter  As previously discussed  we have filed a claim for a  90 million refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution  That claim remains in process Now I ll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Russell  One year ago  in my first earnings call as CEO  I talked about four near term priorities to drive value for shareholders  I m pleased with our execution to date and our focus on generating superior and sustainable value will continue in 2020 and beyond  The first priority I highlighted was driving opex with a focus on cost and reliability  I m incredibly proud of our work in opex in 2019 and I m excited about what lies ahead in opex 2 0  Second was continuing to drive lasting culture change  We remain focused on the key behaviors to drive success including accountability and urgency and increasing our focus on innovation across the company Third was people development  In 2019  we continued our intense focus on people development and worked to increasingly build our bench of future leaders and key personnel across the organization  And fourth was disciplined capital allocation  We re committed to our balanced capital allocation philosophy of returning cash to shareholders  investing in our businesses  and maintaining an appropriate capital structure  In 2019  we continued to deliver on each of these capital allocation priorities  We returned over  1 billion of cash to shareholders  We invested over  380 million in disciplined capital expenditures to sustain and further improve our businesses  and we took steps to maintain an appropriate capital structure and support our investment grade credit ratings by reducing our future pension liabilities Entering 2020  I m encouraged that the US housing market continues to show signs of stronger activity  Although pricing for many of our commodity products remains soft  We re optimistic that we will see continued improvement as we head into the 2020 building season  Going forward  I m excited about the opportunities in front of us and we remain focused on driving superior long term value for shareholders by improving performance through operational excellence  fostering a winning an innovative culture that positions us to capitalize on a range of market conditions  and demonstrating disciplined capital allocation And with that  I d like to open the floor for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question will come from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs Derrick Laton    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey  Good morning  This is Derrick Laton sitting in for Brian Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Derrick Laton    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks for taking my questions  Yeah  If we could just go back for a second Devin to the comments that you had mentioned around lumber and OSB  I think you ve mentioned a little bit of a lag coming through on some of the OSB pricing  Can we expect that even holding everything equal to accelerate a little bit  as we go through the first quarter  just based on some of the gains that we saw exiting 4Q Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  We saw pricing come up a little bit in 4Q  There was a little bit of a dip now  it started to come back up  So as Russell mentioned quarter to date  our OSB realizations are flat relative to the fourth quarter  That being said  certainly  I think the market sentiment is that the housing activity is going to continue to improve  We re seeing a lot of optimism out there and so  we would anticipate that as we get closer to the 2020 building season and that gets in full swing  We re going to see some uplift on OSB pricing as we get into the quarter Derrick Laton    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  Thank you  And then just on the lumber side  Russell  like  you called out is going to be about  20 higher on average I think current price is about  25 above the fourth quarter average  It s actually a little bit better than I would have expected  Just looking at the composite  is that a function of a little bit of a lag as well coming through the income statement or is that more just a function of some of the mix shift within the product rates that you guys produce Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  That would be more attributable to the mix shift of what we produce in our lumber operations Derrick Laton    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  I think  that s it from me  Thanks  guys Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal Mark Wilde    Bank of Montreal    AnalystGood morning  Devin  Good morning  Russell Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Mark Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Mark Mark Wilde    Bank of Montreal    AnalystDevin  I wondered  is it possible to get some sense for where you see land sales per year over the next three to five years that we exclude kind of Northern Timberlands Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Mark  This is Russell  So  as we noted  we re going to bring down the real estate EBITDA a little bit from this year from 2019  There s really two things that are happening in there  The first is  on the energy natural resources side  we had a couple of one time type transactions  We had a small asset sale  and then  we had some recoveries on a royalty audit  And then we re also factoring in less HBU sales coming out of that Montana and Michigan properties  The Michigan properties are sold  Montana  we re expecting to close in the second quarter of this year  And so that gives us that  255 million number for 2020  Kind of on a run rate basis  I think that  250 million to  255 million is a reasonable number for the run rate for that business  As we stated in the past  our goal is to structure that total AVO program and the pipeline  so that we have a sustainable business over time  so Mark Wilde    Bank of Montreal    AnalystOkay  And then just as a follow on  I d like to just kind of step back and think about sort of leveraging your franchise  with the global focus on sustainability and carbon capture only going up  Any thoughts on ways to kind of both leverage your expertise  but also the strong kind of social and environmental reputation that Weyerhaeuser has Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Absolutely  Mark  I would tell you that s top of mind for us  As you know  there has been a lot of momentum around wood based building for one  but also as we see more and more companies talking about becoming carbon neutral or carbon negative  Our view is practically speaking  that s going to be very hard to do without looking to the forest and our ability to sequester carbon  And so I think that is getting a lot of discussion  a lot of talk in the industry It s something that we re very focused on  Candidly  it s in the early stages of figuring out what the mechanics for that market are going to look like  There is a private market piece to that  there is a regulatory piece to that  but we re staying very focused on it  Clearly  I feel pretty comfortable in saying no organization in the history of America has planted more trees than Weyerhaeuser Company  so that is an area where we have deep expertise and I think there may be a role for us to play  So we re keeping a very close watch on that and we ll look for an opportunity to participate in a profitable ways that    as that develops Mark Wilde    Bank of Montreal    AnalystWould that include kind of structures beyond just outright ownership of Timberland Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerI think  we re at a stage right now Mark  where we re really looking at all different kinds of opportunities  So I think at this juncture  I wouldn t foreclose any of those options Mark Wilde    Bank of Montreal    AnalystOkay  very good  I ll turn it over Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Mark OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James Collin Mings    Raymond James    AnalystThanks  Good morning  everyone Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Collin Collin Mings    Raymond James    AnalystFirst  for me  just can you elaborate on your full year outlook for the export markets and harvest plans in the West  How much of the downtick in harvest this year represents just a continued normalization of volume versus a response to some of the headwinds that you alluded to in the prepared remarks about the European sourced wood and other things impacting the Asian markets Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Let me start with the Western harvest levels now  really to understand what s going on in the West  you have to go back to our Longview Timber acquisition and you recall that when we did that deal  one of the benefits of that transaction was that they had a significant amount over matured timber in their portfolio  And so for several years after that acquisition  we were intentionally bringing that harvest level    harvest age down  which increased our harvest levels in the West  Over the last couple of years  we ve really been on the tail end of that  And so as we roll into 2020 that volume that we re anticipating in the West  which is down around 3  versus 2019  That s what I would expect all else being equal to be the harvest levels for the next several years before it starts coming up again  And so that s really the answer on the harvest  Now frankly  you can flex up or flex down a little bit depending on market conditions and we do that from time to time  but the 2020 harvest schedule really is kind of that normalized harvest level in the West for the next several years Speaking to the export markets  I ll start with China  Really  last year  for most of the year  even though there was more European salvage wood coming into the market  I would say  for the first three quarters  it wasn t having a material impact on our export volumes to that China market out of the Northwest  We really did see in the fourth quarter that European salvage wood started to have an impact in the China market  and we really started to see that impact our pricing certainly as we got deeper into the fourth quarter  As we think about the magnitude of that European salvage wood going into the market and you combine that with what is traditionally a pretty slow time of the year with the Lunar New Year holiday in that market  And you also have the dynamic of the Corona virus  And so I would expect the China market for us out of the Pacific Northwest is going to be choppy for a little while The Japan market frankly remained solid for us  You ve seen housing starts dip down just a little bit  but the key market for us  as I mentioned earlier is that post and beam market  And that s held up pretty well and you combine that with some of the challenges from the Canadian log exports  We re still seeing good volume and sales activity into the Japan market this year Collin Mings    Raymond James    AnalystThank you for all the detail there  Devin  Just switching gears to kind of opex 2 0  Can you maybe just elaborate a little bit on where you re targeting the  50 million to  70 million  just across the four different buckets you outlined  Specifically how much would maybe fall into that margin bucket and that efficiency bucket Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think we re still in the early stages of rolling this out to the organization  But what I would say is going into the year  I would still anticipate the majority of that is going to come from that margin bucket  The future value efficiency and cost avoidance are new pieces of that program  And so we do think that that will pick up steam as we roll it out to the organization  But I would say sitting here right now most of that  50 million to  70 million for year one is going to come out of the margin bucket Collin Mings    Raymond James    AnalystOkay  And then switching to Russell  Can you just maybe touch a little bit more on the AVO process and where that stands  again recognizing that is fluid  but there was obviously a number of large sales in 2019  Are there any other large transactions that you re going to be pursuing and kind of the foreseeable future or you feel like a lot of the heavy lifting as far as the non core asset sales is complete for    at least for now Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo I ll talk to the AVO  and I ll talk to kind of your second question on large transactions  The AVO process as you re aware  that s really an evergreen process  So we re constantly evaluating our Timberlands to determine if we are the best owner of that particular tract  or if we can capture a higher value by selling it through our AVO process  So as we ve noted  we have about    at the beginning of the year  we had 1 6 million acres identified in the AVO process that we would take to market over the next 10 to 15 years  As I stated earlier  our goal is to have a sustainable business over time So as far as large transactions  I m not going to comment on our    on kind of our future expectations related to large transactions  but I ll reiterate  even on the AVO process  we still look even on a broader basis across the portfolio and make sure that the Timberlands that we own are returning the highest value and we get a good return on assets  And so  as we demonstrated in the past  we have sold out of markets that are not strategic to us for the long term  But I think as we look at our portfolio today we have no immediate plans Collin Mings    Raymond James    AnalystThank you  both  I ll turn it over Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Mark Weintraub    Seaport    AnalystThank you  Two follow ups  really  The first    thank you for the information on the Western harvest  By the way  that s completely consistent with presentation you did it back in December 2016  where you show exactly as you laid out  That same presentation  it shows that the Southern harvest would likely be increasing during that  17 through  26 time horizon  And then I realize maybe there are some sales of acreage etc   perhaps  But what s the outlook for the Southern harvest relative to the levels we saw in  19 and what you seem to be suggesting for 2020 Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Mark  And those are always fluid through the real estate programs  you get puts and takes here and there  We are not in a position right now  I think to give public guidance on the long term other than to say in 2020 for the South  we re looking at comparable  We do have a little bit heavier mix to fiber for 2020  but it s going to be pretty consistent within the range that we have in 2020 Mark Weintraub    Seaport    AnalystAnd maybe it s not a fair question on this    on a spot moment  But is the type    is there any reason why the general direction you would have been expecting a couple of years ago wouldn t still be applicable today Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think over time  certainly  as we have new generations of seedlings come ready for harvest  you d expect the volumes to go up over time  So  directionally I don t think anything has changed  The timing of it  you have a little bit of up and down on any particular a year or two basis  but directionally over time  I don t think anything s changed Mark Weintraub    Seaport    AnalystOkay  And on the European spruce salvage wood  any intelligence at this point as to how long this issue is likely to be with us Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So  I ll tell you what I do know and then what I don t know and I ll start with what we think we know  which is  unlike what we saw with the mountain pine beetle in British Columbia  the spruce beetle in Europe seems to leave that wood salvageable for a much lower period  And I think the general consensus that s building is  one to three years on the stump is really as long as it s viable after you see that damage  The question that s harder to answer frankly is  when is the infestation going to abate And so  I don t know that we have a definitive view or if anyone has a definitive view on when that damage spruce beetle wood is going to stop growing across Europe  And so  I do think our view is we ve seen the geographies where you have that impacted wood acting speedily to try to get out in front of it and salvage as much of that timber as they can  but as a practical matter  there are limits on how much you can do that  So  it s hard to say how long it s going to last when you really start seeing the spruce beetle die off  I think  it will be a limited time period after that when you should see the volume start to slow down Mark Weintraub    Seaport    AnalystAnd so  is it fair to surmise  recognizing lots of uncertainty here  that it s probably going to be with us for a couple of years  but then at some point in time  you end up having less wood coming from Europe than even prior to the infestation beginning  is that how to think about it Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerThat s correct  And that s how we re viewing it  We re going to    I think this is going to be with us for a year or two  but  as you say  it s important to remember when that volume goes away  it s going to have to be filled in from somewhere else  And so  when you have that significant amount of wood that goes out of the system  it is going to change kind of the global supply chains for log supply Mark Weintraub    Seaport    AnalystThank you Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerYep  thanks OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D A  Davidson Steve Chercover    D A  Davidson    AnalystThanks  Good morning  everyone Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Steve Chercover    D A  Davidson    AnalystSo  first question  on your website Montana is included in the Western US acreage  but the volume is evidently coming out of the Northern fee harvest  so is that because the log prices in Montana are closer to Northeast values Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSteve  when we actually put together the regions  at the time of the merger  we had put we had put that Montana property in that Northern region  And so  we ve always reported that Montana property in the Northern region and then Washington and Oregon in the Western region  It is a different product  a little different pricing  so that s just how we set it up at the time of the merger Steve Chercover    D A  Davidson    AnalystOkay  So  from a financial standpoint both of the    all that land is Northern  So  I wanted to get a sense on the impact then of    the financial impact on the sales  would it be fair to say that given the aggregate sales price of  445 million  the EBITDA was around  20 million  Is that   Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  I think in the last call what we had mentioned is full year 2018 was about  19 million and you ll see full year 2019 at about  15 million  so we would expect that Montana and Michigan to be about half of that number Steve Chercover    D A  Davidson    AnalystOkay  Thanks for that  And just one other quick one  Can you elaborate what you mean by innovation  Is it new product development in wood products or is it along the lines of log optimizations by end market Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I d say the majority of that is operational innovation  So  that s things like leveraging technology within the mills or out in the woods to drive down log and haul cost  to optimize how we build roads  to mechanized things in the mills  That s the majority of it at this point  We do    in our Wood Products business  we do product innovation as well  but when we talk about the majority of the innovation work that we ve done here over the last year or two has really been more around operational innovation Steve Chercover    D A  Davidson    AnalystGot it  Okay  Thank you  both Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets Paul Quinn    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystYeah  Thanks very much  Good morning  guys Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Paul Quinn    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHey  Just had a question around capex and thanks for the detailed break down into the buckets  but that  235 million you re spending on Wood Products maybe you could highlight some of the bigger project  And is there any volume gains that you expect to get over time on some of these projects going forward Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  With the  235 million  which is down about  15 million from 2019 and partially that s just a reflection of the fact that as we finish up on the Dierks and Millport capital projects were    which were much larger in scale  We just have a larger number of smaller activity in the capex bucket across Wood Products  And so  I don t have anything  significant to highlight of the Millport or Dierks magnitude  It s really just a lot of smaller capex projects that are really focused on driving down cost  improving reliability  and really driving efficiencies in the mill set  You ll get some incremental around the margins volume pick up with some of those  but  the volume increase really is the primary focus of our capital programs at present Paul Quinn    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  Thanks for that  And then  just maybe I    just trying to understand what s going on in Timberland transactions  I haven t seen that many transactions  We ve had interest rates go up in  18 and then come down  19 and  20  I suspect that had some kind of effect on valuations  maybe you could just help me understand what s going on in the market Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  This is Russell  On 2019  based on kind of our listing of all the transactions  we re expecting to hit about  1 8 billion and we really didn t see any big deals like we saw in 2018  We saw probably four deals in 2019 over  100 million and then  remainder were small and medium deals  So about 3 million acres looks like it s going to trade in 2019  so that s about 2   2 5  of the investable market  That seems kind of on par with what we ve seen over the last few years  I think  as we look into 2020  I would expect we would break that  2 billion transaction value number  And when you take the Poke deal  and then the recent announcement we made on the Montana deal  you are at about  800 million  and so  it s pretty strong start of the year given we re in January As far as timber values  I would say they remained strong even with the soft product pricing in 2019  We really didn t see big value swings in the timberland values and I think that reflects more of the longer term nature that the investors have in this space and companies have in this space  So  we re still seeing a strong flow of capital to good deals and the right deals and quality Timberlands remain in high demand  And as we ve said in the past  we re in a pretty advantage position  We have Timberlands in every major wood basket in the United States and we have the opportunity to see every transaction and so  We re active  but we re also very disciplined in our acquisition strategy Paul Quinn    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThanks for the help  Good luck Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes in the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Chip Dillon    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystHi  Good morning  Thanks for all the details  As you look at the long term future  Japan s population obviously is shrinking and obviously there are other parts of Asia where demand could certainly get better for your timber  How do you think about those long term trends  I mean  have you done some work on where you think five  10 years from now you ll see both Japan and other Asian markets  especially as it really has a big impact on your Western Timberland profitability Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Absolutely  we do spend a lot of time doing analytics around that  With respect to Japan  you re absolutely right  The demographics are such that the population is declining and that is clearly going to have an impact on housing over time  I think  couple things that may mitigate the impact on us however or again  our focus is primarily that post and beam market and I think that is going to hold share and pick up share of overall housing starts in Japan over time  And so  I think the impact on us will be less than on kind of the stick frame The second thing  I would say is  just like in the United States and Europe  Japan is looking for opportunities to do more commercial and multi story buildings out of wood  And so  I think there s an opportunity to pick up share on that front as well to mitigate some of the impacts from population decline on housing  But you re right  in a broader sense  Japan s population is not growing  There are other economies across Asia where we do see growing populations  And so whether you re thinking China or India or some of the other Southeast Asian markets that are experiencing growth  we ve spent a lifetime on the ground in all of those markets  We have in China in particular  a pretty strong customer base  And so  one of our focus areas is to continue to grow market in China and ultimately other markets for some of those higher end Douglas fir products  and we think over time  we ll make good progress on that OperatorYour next question will come from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens  Inc Mark Connelly    Stephens  Inc     AnalystThank you  If we assume that the labor issues in construction persists  do you think we re going to start seeing builders more aggressively embrace either prefab components or some other labor reduction or is there enough other issues like lot availability that they just don t have enough incentive to change the way they operate yet Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I do you think that you re starting to see some of the builders  particularly the larger builders embrace panelization  off site construction activities  And I do think that trend will continue  There are limits on how high that can go  but I do think we ve reached a point where the labor constraints have caused many of the builders to really start to look for other options to mitigate that challenge  So  I do you think you re going to see that grow  The labor availability I think still remains one of the biggest challenges for the builders in both  just meeting the construction needs  but also with the affordability pace  And so  I do think they re going to continue to look for ways to mitigate those labor challenges Mark Connelly    Stephens  Inc     AnalystSo  is there an opportunity for Weyerhaeuser in that to get involved in more of that process Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerI think in the near term  the biggest opportunity for us is to stay close to those in customers and the builders and various folks throughout the channel that are doing that work  I think  our biggest opportunity short term is just to be a key supplier making sure we understand  what the needs are in those panelized construction activities and be a good solid partner for them  I don t anticipate us getting into panelized manufacturing here in the near term  Longer term  obviously  we ll continue to watch the market and if our view changes on the ability to create value in that space  we wouldn t necessarily rule that out  but I don t think that s a short term priority for us Mark Connelly    Stephens  Inc     AnalystOkay  That makes a lot of sense  Just one other question  with all the supply distortions and issues we had in the South last year  do you think private landowners are caught up on the land they wanted to sell or is there still a backlog there Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  This is Russell  Pardon me Mark Connelly    Stephens  Inc     AnalystSorry  I said land  I meant stumpage Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerOn the stumpage side  I would say that probably the markets were a little slower last year as far as getting contractors and broker dealers out onto those non industrial private lands  I think that s what you re referring to Mark Connelly    Stephens  Inc     AnalystYes Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo  we don t have a real clean gauge on what those volumes are  but I would expect that  that will still be an area of focus for the non industrial privates probably coming into this year and maybe the following years Mark Connelly    Stephens  Inc     AnalystOkay  very helpful  Thank you OperatorOur last question will come from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America John Babcock    Bank of America    AnalystHi  Good morning  This is actually John Babcock on for George  Just wanted to thank you for taking my questions  Just starting out  I was wondering  if you could talk about which products are likely to see the incremental benefit from kind of this new opex set up  And also  if you could kind of give some weighting as to  which product lines that might be helpful too Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think just at a high level  we would anticipate it s kind of going to be evenly split between Wood Products and Timberlands  I think one of the differences that we re looking at from opex 2 0 is  we re really looking to expand it and how we measure it beyond just the businesses defined opportunities even at a functional level  increase the level of cross business opex that we re trying to drive  So that may change how the buckets are allocated a little bit around the margins  but going in  we would anticipate that would be kind of half and half Wood Products and Timberlands John Babcock    Bank of America    AnalystThank you  And then  can you review the key point as to  why the Montana Timberland sales made sense from both the strategic and valuation standpoint Russell S  Hagen    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  This is Russell  There s two things I guess  I would point out on that transaction  The first is  over the last number years  we ve been very active in capturing value on those lands  We ve done conservation sales  higher and better use sales  We ve also done some timber transactions  So  we really have a lot of opportunities to understand the market and kind of with the future value that land would be to us So  the second is  when we go through our evaluation process  it s very detailed and robust  So  we look at a number of things when coming to evaluation on a particular property and we look at the markets  we look at stocking levels  age class  growing cycles  PC mix  cost inputs  Those are all taken into consideration when we assess the value  but also when we assessed fit for our broader portfolio strategy  So based on our experience in these markets and in our expectations and what we ve achieved as far as capturing value on the portfolio today  we are very comfortable with how that sale fits into our broader strategy and we re very pleased with the price we re receiving for the Timberlands John Babcock    Bank of America    AnalystYeah  Thank you  That s all I have Devin W  Stockfish    President and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  Well  I believe that was the final question  So  thank you to everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your continued interest in

178233,399749,WY,Factors Likely To Shape Weyerhaeuser s  WY  Q4 Earnings,opinion,Weyerhaeuser Company   NYSE WY   is slated to report fourth quarter 2019 results on Jan 31  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20  but revenues beat the same by 0 4   On a year over year basis  earnings of 8 cents per share were significantly down from the year ago figure of 28 cents due to volatility in various markets served  Net sales of  1 671 million also decreased 12 5  from a year ago  thanks to lower contribution from two major segments   Timberlands and Wood Products Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter s earnings has increased 16 7  to 7 cents per share over the past 30 days  However  this indicates a 30  increase from the year ago earnings of 10 cents per share  The consensus mark for revenues is  1 52 billion  suggesting a 6 9  year over year improvement Weyerhaeuser Company Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to NoteWeyerhaeuser s fourth quarter earnings and sales are expected to have decreased owing to lower oriented strand board  OSB  and lumber prices  That said  rebounding housing market indicators like new and existing home sales  building permits  as well as housing starts are expected to have showed strength in the fourth quarter  supposedly offsetting the above mentioned headwinds  Improving housing dynamics should have helped Weyerhaeuser to perform well across the entire mix of businesses including lumber  OSB and timber For the Wood Products segment  accounting for 72 1  of total net sales   the company expects earnings  before special items  and adjusted EBITDA to be down sequentially but up on a year over year basis  Weyerhaeuser expects seasonally lower sales volumes across most product categories  as building activity typically declines in the fourth quarter owing to weather related woes  Meanwhile  higher Western log costs are likely to have been offset by a modest improvement in operating expenses For the fourth quarter  the company expects sequentially comparable earnings but marginally lower adjusted EBITDA at the Timberland segment  In Western Timberland operations  it expects domestic log sales volumes to decline modestly in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis  Wet operating conditions reduced log supply late in the third quarter and inventories tightened  It anticipates domestic log sales realizations to improve modestly in the fourth quarter as a result of steady domestic demand and continued seasonal reduction in supply from non industrial landowners  Western road and unit logging costs are expected to have declined from the third quarter In the South  the company expects average log sales realizations to be slightly lower than the third quarter and fee harvest volumes to decline  In the North  it expects fourth quarter EBITDA to decline sequentially due to seasonally lower fee harvest volumes and a partial quarter of Michigan results  Notably  in November  the company sold 555 000 acres of Michigan Timberlands for  300 million For the Real Estate Energy and Natural Resources segment  it anticipates sequentially lower earnings and adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter Overall  focus on operational excellence in timberlands   which entails merchandising for value  harvest and transportation efficiency  and flexing harvest to capture seasonal and short term opportunities   is expected to have benefited the company in the quarter to some extent  In Wood Products  its OpEx initiatives focus on reducing controllable manufacturing costs  thereby increasing high value product mix and improving log recovery across operations  The real estate business is on track to meet or exceed its targeted 30  premium to timber value Weyerhaeuser has manufacturing operations in Canada  Therefore  any changes in the U S  dollar s strength relative to the Canadian dollar  euro and yen  as well as strength of the euro relative to the yen are expected to have reflected on its results  The company s exposure to raw material price fluctuations and challenging market conditions are also likely to have dented profits in the to be reported quarter What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings

Boise Cascade and Weyerhaeuser are sporting Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that BCC has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
BCC currently has a forward P E ratio of 16 43  while WY has a forward P E of 48 09  We also note that BCC has a PEG ratio of 2 08  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  WY currently has a PEG ratio of 9 62 
Another notable valuation metric for BCC is its P B ratio of 1 73  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  WY has a P B of 2 33 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to BCC s Value grade of A and WY s Value grade of D 
BCC stands above WY thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that BCC is the superior value option right now ",2019-10-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bcc-vs-wy-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200469919,200469919

earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Recently  the company reported weaker than expected third quarter 2019 results  The top and bottom lines lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 2  and 55 6   and declined 18 2  and 90 4  year over year  respectively  Lower OSB prices  down 35   and volumes  down 14   negatively impacted its performance Also  gross profit and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations deteriorated significantly from the year ago period  Notably  adjusted EBITDA margin contracted to 8 1  from 26 2  a year ago  The decline was mainly caused by increased raw material costs  lower volumes in EWP and the Dawson Creek mill conversion Higher Costs   Expenses  Louisiana Pacific has been witnessing higher raw material costs  primarily for wood fiber and resins  Volatility in governmental  economic or industry conditions influences its wood fiber prices  Resin product costs are influenced by changes in the price and availability of raw materials that are used to produce resins like petroleum  Tariff related concerns are adding to the woes Additionally  increased marketing investments associated with accelerating repair and remodel channel penetration  along with new product introductions have been denting its performance over the last few quarters Lower OSB Pricing   Volume  Louisiana Pacific has a high degree of product concentration around OSB  Currently  it accounts for nearly 33  of total revenues  Notably  the highly concentrated nature of business makes it susceptible to price volatility Since 2018  the company has been experiencing pricing pressure in the OSB segment  In the first nine months of 2019  its adjusted earnings declined more than 90  from the year ago level due to lower OSB pricing across North American operations  and higher costs and expenses  The segment s adjusted EBITDA was negative  1 million against  123 million reported a year ago Decline in EWP Segment Sales Poses Risk  Softer demand in all product lines due to market weakness is a risk for Louisiana Pacific s prospects  EWP sales declined 4 5  year over year in the third quarter due to lower demand and a decline in selling prices on increased pricing pressure  Also  adjusted EBITDA fell 40  in the quarter Volatile Market  Demand for the company s products has a strongly dependency on the housing industry  New home

178296,399812,WY,Earnings Preview  Weyerhaeuser  WY  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Weyerhaeuser  WY  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 26  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This timber and paper products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 11 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  69 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 76 billion  down 5 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8 33  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Weyerhaeuser 
For Weyerhaeuser  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  11 76  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Weyerhaeuser will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Weyerhaeuser would post earnings of  0 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 10  delivering a surprise of  9 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Weyerhaeuser doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-weyerhaeuser-wy-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200408759,200408759

Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
UFPI currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 93  while WY has a forward P E of 34 72  We also note that UFPI has a PEG ratio of 2 39  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  WY currently has a PEG ratio of 6 94

board  domestic and export logs  as well as lower volumes Both the company s segments generated lower net sales during the quarter  Net sales in the Timberlands segment declined 12  from a year ago while that of the Wood Products unit fell 17 4   The downside was primarily due to lower Western log sales realizations and volumes For second quarter 2019  the company projects sequentially lower

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Weyerhaeuser 
For Weyerhaeuser  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  30  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Weyerhaeuser will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Weyerhaeuser would post earnings of  0 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 11  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Of course each of these firms has business hurdles to overcome  Let s dig in to dividend stock bargain bin 
Weyerhaeuser Company  NYSE WY   Dividend Yield  5 3 
REITs have held up pretty well over the past half year or so  which makes timber real estate play Weyerhaeuser s  WY  performance since July stick out like a sore  black and blue thumb 
Weyerhaeuser  WY  Has Been Taken to the Woodshed
The primary tailwind on Weyerhaeuser  The Fed 
In short  the Federal Reserve s ramping up of interest rates finally started to weigh on the housing market in a big way  which in turn finally popped a bubble in lumber prices that had been keeping WY aloft 

Source  MacroTrends net
There are a few things to like about Weyerhaeuser  Timber is a very niche REIT realm  providing some serious diversification  and the company has been a beacon of dividend growth  upping its annual payout every year since converting into a real estate investment trust in 2010  And prior to its lumber related plunge last year  it had outperformed the Vanguard REIT ETF  NYSE VNQ  by 135  to 86  on a total return basis over the past decade 
But is WY a value 
While lumber prices appear to be stabilizing  they re still doing so at levels considerably lower than their 2018 highs  Moreover slower rate hikes from the Federal Reserve will take a little pressure off the housing market  But the data is still grim  November housing starts  the last available data thanks to the temporary government shutdown  showed single family starts at a 1   year low  Third party gauges for December activity  namely permits  also were in a downtrend 
The dividend is a potential problem  though  Weyerhaeuser did improve the payout again last year  in August  by 6 3   But the company paid out  995 million in dividends against  748 million in profits last year  and its projected annual payout of  1 36 per share in 2019 is far more than analysts  expectations for 83 cents in profits 
This could be a short term bump in the road  but the path out isn t clear yet  That  combined with the dividend situation  makes WY look less like a value  and more like a high yield value trap 
Tailored Brands  NYSE TLRD   Dividend Yield  5 6 
Tailored Brands  TLRD  isn t a familiar name outside the investing space  but most people will know its two primary brands  Men s Wearhouse and Jos  A  Bank  The men s suit stores engaged in a nasty bout of M A maneuvering starting in October 2013 before eventually completing a merger in June 2014  Men s Wearhouse switched to a holding company structure in January 2016  adopting the Tailored Brands moniker in 2016 
Shares have been bludgeoned over the past year  losing roughly two thirds of their value since May 2018  Some of the biggest hits included disappointing same store sales growth in June  a report in December that Men s Wearhouse traffic was sliding  thanks to several factors  including increased competition from the likes of Bonobos  and another report in January in which the company lowered its fourth quarter guidance on weakness at Jos  A  Bank 
What s to like about this apparent train wreck 
For one  the yield on TLRD is now well north of 5   which is on the very high end of its range since the merger  But despite the company s woes  it will pay out just 32  of its expected full year earnings   2 28 per share  in dividends  In short  the payout is extremely safe for a company that has been trounced so hard 
Another Yield Spike for Tailored Brands  TLRD 
At the same time  TLRD is making strides on paying out its debt  The stock also is a deep value at these levels  trading at just five times future earnings estimates  And despite its woes  analysts still see the Tailored Brands averaging high single digit profit growth over the next half decade 
But cheap stocks can get even cheaper 
Tailored Brands warned significantly on comps  but said it wasn t sure why they had weakened so much  They re so much of an outlier compared to past quarters  in fact  that this could just be a blip on the radar  If so  TLRD could be a dividend and value double play  But if this is a glimpse into a shift in consumer tastes  Tailored Brands will be forced between a rock  falling sales  and a hard place  returning to deep discounts  slicing margins  
Altria  NYSE MO   Dividend Yield  6 6 
I ve warned about the long term difficulties facing cigarette maker Altria  MO  for some time   namely  that the U S  is in a never ending crackdown on cigarettes  threatening the company s core business  Shares have indeed been caught in a downward trend since 2017  but reality really started to catch up with Altria in Q4 2018  as shares plunged far deeper than the broader market  Now MO sits about 15  lower than where it was the last time I cautioned my readers on the stock 
But maybe  just maybe  there s a contrarian play here 
Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  seems to think so  Analyst Bonnie Herzog  who rates the stock  Outperform  and has a  65 price target that implies 33  upside from here  doesn t see any end to Altria s decline in cigarette sales  But she does think vaping might be the company s savior  pointing to the company s  13 billion  35  stake in e cigarette maker Juul  announced in December  The money quote 
 One of the key points that continues to be misunderstood  in our view  is that while MO s cigarette volumes will likely decelerate faster   the incrementality from MO s stake in JUUL   strong U S  share margin growth and huge upside internationally   is underestimated since we predict MO s equity income from JUUL will more than offset MO s shrinking cigarette volume pool  
And like Tailored Brands  Altria is at least showing big value and income numbers  Its yield has plumped up to north of 6   and its forward P E of 11 is well  well below the market average 
Altria s  MO  Yield Hasn t Been This High Since the Turn of the Decade
Credit where credit is due  Altria isn t sitting around praying that cigarette sales will magically recover  The investment in Juul was a pricey risk  but one the company needs to take if it wants to stave away irrelevance as its core product deteriorates into a pile of legislative ash 
That said  Juul isn t immune from the same pressures  The company faces class action lawsuits in Philadelphia and New York federal courts over the company s marketing tactics and over its disclosure of nicotine levels  Juul also temporarily halted sales of most of its flavored nicotine pods in November in hopes of getting out in front of aggressive federal regulators worried about spiking e cigarette use 
If this sounds familiar  it should  This is the same treatment cigarettes have gotten for years   and why Altria still could be in trouble long term despite its creative wheeling and dealing

178356,399872,WY,Grab These 7 Stocks As Housing Starts Rebound In May,opinion,Housing starts made a comeback in May 2018  after falling 3 7  in April  reaching the highest level since 2007  However  housing permits fell further in May  following a decline of 1 8  in April Per the latest jointly released report from the U S  Census Bureau and the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  housing starts increased 5  to 1 35 million units  seasonally adjusted annual rate  in May from the previous month  The figure also improved 20 3  on a year over year basis What Led to the Surge in Starts Single family and multi family starts surged in May  Single family homes starts  which are of higher importance  rose 3 9  from the prior month and improved 18 3  year over year  Multi family starts increased 11 3  from the prior month and rose 27 4  from the prior year Specifically  a 62 2  rise in new residential construction activity in Midwest boosted overall housing starts  However  construction slumped in the Northeast  South and West regions What Does the Drop in Permits Signify Residential building permits  an indicator of upcoming construction activity  dropped 4 6  in May to an annualized rate of 1 3 million units from April  Single family home permits dipped 2 2  and the same for construction of multi family homes declined 8 5    This signifies that construction activity can mellow down in the upcoming months to some extent Nevertheless  on a year over year basis  permits rose 8  with single family homes increasing 7 7  and multi family homes increasing 9 1    Housing Industry s Current PositionRecently  a rise in interest rate last week dented investors  optimism in the housing space  The rise in interest rates came at a time when home prices are increasing  thanks to supply constraints and increased raw materials costs  Builders are unnerved by higher aluminum and steel costs due to the newly imposed tariffs  This along with increased lumber prices from an import tariff is denting builders  margins  compelling them to hike prices  Further  troubles like labor shortage  limited land availability and apprehension of two more hikes in 2018 along with three in 2019 continue to make things difficult Evidently  homebuilder sentiment slid in June from the previous month  to the lowest level this year and below its six month average of 70  According to Associated Builders and Contractors  construction material prices increased 2 2  in May from the prior month  representing the largest monthly increase since May 2008  On a year over year basis  the price of construction materials rose 8 8  Should You Buy Housing Stocks Now Though myriad problems have been denting the homebuilding industry of late  evident from the 18 8  year to date decline against a 3 5  rise of the broader index  the larger picture is convincingly strong Consumer demand is robust considering the solid economic scenario  backed by low unemployment and solid wage growth  The solid economic growth is expected to continue with Federal Reserve expecting economic growth of 2 8  for 2018  highlighting an increase of 0 1 percentage point from the estimates issued in March 2018  Fed also expects the rate of unemployment rate at 3 6  in 2018  down from the previous expectation of 3 8  Top Choices from Top IndustriesAs the solid momentum is expected to continue in the rest of 2018  investors can bet on these stocks from the broader construction sector  Apart from homebuilding  we bring stocks from other building product industries as well  An increase in home construction will invariably lead to higher demand for building products We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a solid Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  along with

178371,399887,WY,Why You Should Consider Investing In EMCOR  EME  Right Now,opinion,EMCOR Group  Inc    NYSE EME   has been enjoying solid momentum in non residential construction demand  along with strong project execution  which has shored up its earnings in recent quarters  In fact  the company has consistently grown its earnings faster than revenues through efficient cost control measures  over the past couple of years  This has resulted in margin expansion and improving profitability over time We believe the company has several growth drivers in place and enjoys a robust foothold in its served markets  which will likely help it maintain the growth momentum in the times to come Investors also seem to think the same  as they have favored this stock in recent times  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company has outperformed the  over the past year  having appreciated 12 1  compared to the industry s scanty gain of 3 9  Let s discuss some of these growth drivers and also shed light on some of the risks that the company is vulnerable to EMCOR s revenue growth has been driven by sound performance from the combined U S  Construction segments  along with solid contribution from the recent acquisitions  In fact  the company posted record gross profit  operating income and net income from continuing operations levels in the recently reported quarterly results  The company s earnings beat estimates by a whopping 32 9  and rose an impressive 28 2  year over year Particularly  the U S  Mechanical construction segment has been witnessing robust execution  In the third quarter results  this segment witnessed revenue growth of 7 3   The U S  Construction segment sustained its robust momentum and grew 5 9  year over year  while the U S  Building Services business rose 5 1  year over year Encouraged by its accretive acquisitions and increasing traction in the U S  construction space  EMCOR s management had raised its earnings guidance for 2017 to a range of  3 70  3 80  up from previous projections of  3 40  3 60  Further  EMCOR s acquisition strategies have been lending momentum to the company s operations as well  Over time  these buyouts have fortified EMCOR s market leading position in electrical construction and services  and expanded its capabilities in the energy and industrial sectors We are highly optimistic about EMCOR s recent acquisition of Ardent  which will solidify the company s position in electrical construction and services  and expand its capabilities in the energy and industrial sectors  particularly in the gulf coast  western and mid continent regions  The company anticipates the Ardent buyout to be accretive to its 2017 earnings by at least 10 cents per share  This will likely provide a robust boost to the company s numbers Furthermore  the executive order signed by Trump last month to accelerate approvals of permits for highways  bridges and other major building efforts  as part of his proposal to spend  1 trillion to fix aging U S  infrastructure  will provide a boost to EMCOR s operations However  the company has been facing headwinds in its U S  Industrial Services segment  which has been hit by Hurricane Harvey and continues to be vulnerable to the volatility in oil and gas prices  Harvey resulted in lower field service activities as it impacted EMCOR s customers  facilities in the Texas Louisiana Gulf Coast region  It also led to the previously scheduled maintenance turnaround work being delayed or deferred  The impact of the disruption caused by the tropical storm will likely be seen in the coming couple of quarters as well However  we believe the company s diversified business structure  along with its concerted efforts to explore beyond traditional shop related operations for tapping other profitable areas like food processing and power  will drive long term growth Other Stocks to ConsiderSome top ranked stocks in the broader space are MasTec  Inc    NYSE MTZ    Weyerhaeuser Company   NYSE WY   and Sterling Construction Company Inc   NASDAQ STRL    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  MasTec generated four outstanding beats over the trailing four quarters  for an impressive average positive surprise of 28 1  Weyerhaeuser has beaten estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters  and generated an average positive surprise of 7 2  during the same period Sterling Construction has a striking earnings surprise history for the same time frame  having beaten estimates thrice for an average beat of 65 2  Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to

178375,399891,WY,Here s Why You Should Hold On To Weyerhaeuser  WY  Stock Now,opinion,We issued an updated research report on Weyerhaeuser Company   NYSE WY   on Jan 2  Strengthening timber  land and forest products business as well as the company s efforts to improve operational efficiency and provide healthy return to shareholders adds to its advantages  However  the growth momentum might get restricted by headwinds rising from international exposure  global uncertainties and rising costs and debts Weyerhaeuser currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Its market capitalization is approximately  26 6 billion Below we briefly discuss the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds Factors Favoring WeyerhaeuserStrategic Initiatives Drive Growth Opportunities  Over time  Weyerhaeuser has undertaken some strategic decisions to help it concentrate on its core timber  land and forest products business  In this regard  divestment of liquid packaging board business  printing papers company  North Pacific Paper Company  and Cellulose Fibers pulp mills in 2016 are worth mentioning  Also  the company continued with its efforts in 2017  having divested its timberlands and manufacturing operations in Uruguay to a consortium led by BTG Pactual s Timberland Investment Group in September  Also  the company sold its 21  equity interest in Twin Creeks Timber in October In addition  Weyerhaeuser s merger with Plum Creek Timber has enabled it to leverage benefits from the gradually improving housing market in the United States  Housing starts in the country are expected to be roughly 1 2 million in 2017 Attractive Shareholders  Return  Weyerhaeuser has a sound track record of rewarding its shareholders through lucrative dividend payments  Notably  the company paid dividends of  699 million in the first nine months of 2017  of which roughly  233 million was distributed in the third quarter  In November  the company gifted its shareholders a 3 2  hike in the quarterly dividend rate We believe such disbursements are reflective of its strong cash position and capital allocation policy  In the long run  the company aims to achieve dividend payout of up to 75  of funds available for distribution Operational Excellence   Impressive Guidance  We believe that Weyerhaeuser s ongoing operational initiatives are anticipated to support its results in 2017  results not yet released   It aims to reap a benefit of  40  50 million in the Timberlands segment  driven by these initiatives  Benefits of  55  75 million are expected in the Wood Products segment  including improvement of  20  25 million in oriented strand board   20  25 million in lumber   10  15 million in engineered wood products and  5  10 million in distribution Weyerhaeuser anticipates sequentially higher earnings and adjusted earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization from the Timberland segment  Likewise  results in the Real Estate  Energy and Natural Resources segments are predicted to improve sequentially  Also  the company anticipates spending approximately  300 million as capital expenditure for the Wood Products segment while  135 million has been allocated for the Timberlands segment Factors Working Against WeyerhaeuserPoor Share Price Performance   Valuation  In the last three months  Weyerhaeuser s shares have yielded 3 3  return  underperforming 5 6  growth of the  Also  on a P E  TTM  basis  Weyerhaeuser looks overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 36x and 28 9x in the last three month period  This makes us cautious on the stock Increasing Costs and Huge Debt Levels  Weyerhaeuser is suffering from the risks of escalated costs and expenses  In the first nine months of 2017  the company s cost of sales increased 7 6  year over year  We believe  if unchecked  rising costs and expenses can hurt its margins in the quarters ahead Also  a high debt level can lead to heightened financial obligations  posing serious threats to the company s financial health  Exiting the third quarter  its long term debt was approximately  5 9 billion Challenges Arising From Global Uncertainties  Weyerhaeuser s businesses are highly dependent on the housing market in the United States  Lower level of housing activities and difficult financial conditions in the home country as well as other countries where the company operates will adversely hurt its sales  earnings and cash flow In addition  business expansion in foreign nations has exposed Weyerhaeuser to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies and geo political issues Earnings Estimates   Stocks to ConsiderWeyerhaeuser s earnings estimates for 2017  results not yet released  and 2018 improved in the last 60 days

178401,399917,WY,My Post Hurricane Loss  Your Profit  Buy WOOD,opinion,"My wife and I built a home in the Lower Florida Keys in 2010  Miss Irma decided to do a foot stomp on our place a week ago  And then  after the hurricane ended  spawned a little tornado that slammed something through the side of the house that looks like a 105 round went through it  Irma also denuded every deciduous tree of all its leaves and sent a salt water storm surge over everything not built on reinforced concrete pillars  Then she stormed out  leaving mold and decay in the fetid September heat of tropical Florida  All in all  a very unruly young lady 
We will rebuild  of course  and our home will be better and stronger for it  It will take time  savings and something else  timber  Lots and lots of timber  Also lots of paper packaging for the batt insulation that is now drenched and matted 
Even before this terrible catalyst for more wood and paper products  I was a fan of the iShares Global Timber and Forestry ETF  NASDAQ WOOD   It had already moved from  54 to 66 this year based upon the world s appetite for timber and the Internet shopping giants  need for cardboard and paper products  As the developing world develops  wood will be one of the primary resources that allows it to do so  As a renewable resource  wood has no equal 
In addition  the turn from brick and mortar retail to the convenience of Internet shopping means exponentially higher use of cardboard and other paper products 
The additional catalyst I see right now is the rebuilding that will take place in the US after the dreadful fires out West and hurricanes Harvey and Irma in Texas and the Southeast 
The devastation is horrific but the human spirit is indomitable  We will all rebuild  Sad as it is to consider  this means an actual boost to the economy  The headlines always speak of the cost of a hurricane as if that were the end of the story  In fact there is another side  People will replace appliances  carpeting and broken windows  They will buy a different car or boat if they can afford to  And they will buy timber  Lots of timber  whether it was lost to fire  tornado  flooding or the wind and flood damage from hurricanes 
WOOD is basically a play on the world s premier renewable resource  In many places in this world  timber cuts are not being replanted  Here in North America  the forest management companies understand just how insanely stupid it is to destroy something that needs only water  soil  sunshine and time to renew itself   and then not replant  No timber company in their right mind would clear cut land these days  A timber harvest can be a continuous harvest forever if done in an intelligent manner  We are already a major player in the export lumber business and it will only get bigger 
I would venture to say that between natural gas exports and timber exports the economies of the US as well as that of our northern neighbor have a  prop  under our economic well being that will last well into this and possibly the next century  When those foolish nations that clear cut their forests without re seeding need wood to build with  they will turn to those who have engaged in intelligent forest management  The beneficiaries will be the US and Canada as well as some Scandinavian and other European countries with a few strong companies in some South American and Asian nations as well 
Even absent a catalyst like this  the foreign holdings  particularly in emerging markets  will grow and develop as their national economies grow  And the packaging companies in WOOD will grow as our online shopping grows  The extra impetus of Americans and our Mexican and Caribbean neighbors rebuilding our homes and our lives makes a collection of fine companies such as those comprising the WOOD ETF even more timely 
The biggest purchaser of wood  wood chips  fiber  etc   China  You want to make an omelette  you need to break some eggs  You need to build a nation  you need some wood and wood products 
You could  of course  buy a particular company like one of the Canadian or US giants  For instance  we have recommended and owned in the past  Weyerhaeuser  NYSE WY   the huge forest products and paper company  I last owned it when housing starts were moving toward record highs  I also found   find it amusing that the much ballyhooed  paperless society  spawned by the Computer Age failed to materialize aren t we using more now than ever before 
In addition  companies like Weyerhaeuser and its top competitors are now using technology to deliver the same product with higher margins  stressing R D  and bringing down the number of vendors used  This brings down reject rates and machine downtime  lowers service calls  and capitalizes on their known strengths and deep pockets in research and development 
If I were only looking at the catalyst of the recent fires and hurricanes  I might consider buying one of the American firms like WY  But while that may be an immediate catalyst I tend to seek long term demographic and economically successful opportunities  For that reason I have selected an ETF that is global in scope  though its greatest concentration of assets is North American 
The largest holdings in WOOD include Canada s West Fraser Timber  TO WFT   Rayonier  NYSE RYN   big in Florida   Weyerhaeuser  and Potlatch  NASDAQ PCH   The biggest part of the portfolio is North American but there is a healthy helping of companies in Europe and  to a lesser degree  Latin America and Asia 

This isn t a difficult business to understand  Cut timber  Replace cut timber  Do it on an every day basis so there are always trees growing into adulthood as others are reaching  senior  status  Protect from insects and disease  Learn more about the best soils and the optimum spacing for proper sunshine 
I like easy to understand businesses  And I especially like the idea of getting back  in the form of dividends and capital gains  some of the money I now must spend on all that timber and insulation I will have to buy

178421,399937,WY,Chicago Bridge   Iron  CBI  Hit By Weak Spending  Legal Woes,opinion,Engineering  procurement and construction behemoth  Chicago Bridge   Iron Company N V    NYSE CBI   started 2017 on a happy note  The company was upbeat about President Trump s  Rebuilding America  program  The stock  which was considered a direct beneficiary of Trump s infrastructure policies  gained substantially in the three months post election  However  the optimism proved short lived and the stock soon began to lose ground Over the past six months  Chicago Bridge   Iron s shares have plunged 57 3   far wider than the average loss of 12 2  recorded by the Zacks classified  industry  Last month  the company came up with drab first quarter 2017 results  wherein its earnings of 24 cents lagged estimates by a whopping 75  In addition  the downward guidance revision from  4 00  4 60 per share to  3 50  4 00 per share has miffed investors  Given its array of problems  we believe that Chicago Bridge   Iron investors are in for an even bumpier ride  Let s delve deeper into factors plaguing the company Capital Investments Drying UpLike most other companies operating in the energy domain  particularly oil and gas sector   volatility in commodity pricing continues to be a major drag for Chicago Bridge   Iron s profitability  Over the past few quarters  the company witnessed a precipitous decline in capital investments  severely marring its financials  In general  the hydrocarbon refining  petrochemical and natural gas industries have historically exhibited cyclical trends that expose them to risks related to general downturns in the domestic and international economies  During first quarter 2017  decreased activity on large cost reimbursable LNG projects in Asia Pacific region  the winding down of several E C projects and the timing of progress on projects in Fabrication Services group dragged revenues The Westinghouse WoesThe long running Westinghouse dispute is acting as a major headwind  In early 2016  Chicago Bridge   Iron had divested its nuclear construction projects under its subsidiary Stone   Webster  to Westinghouse  The main agenda was to get the Vogtle and VC Summer power plant projects back on schedule  Presently  the firms are involved in a  2 billion dispute over the nuclear power plant cost overruns  which finally led Westinghouse to file for bankruptcy earlier this year While Westinghouse claims that Chicago Bridge   Iron owes it a sum of  2 billion  the latter argues that Westinghouse owes it  428 million  It goes without saying that a lot is at stake for the Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  company  The timing and outcome of the ruling will be a crucial factor in determining future its profitability Estimates Revised DownThe analysts are showing no favor toward the company at present  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year 2017 earnings continues to decline  reflecting decidedly bearish analyst sentiment  Chicago Bridge   Iron has seen six downward estimate revisions compared with none upward over the past couple of months  This has led the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 to move down from  4 15 to  3 41  underlining a decline of 17 8  Bottom LineTaking into consideration the lackluster guidance  downward estimate revisions and reduced federal investments  Chicago Bridge and Iron s will continue to slump hard on the bourse  at least in the short term  Amid prolonged sluggishness in the end markets and intensifying legal bickering  it is hard to tell if the company can stage a comeback anytime soon Top PicksSome top picks in the broader sector include TopBuild Corp    NYSE BLD    EMCOR Group  Inc    NYSE EME   and Weyerhaeuser Co    NYSE WY    While TopBuild sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong

178425,399941,WY,Chicago Bridge   Iron Wins Westinghouse Dispute  Stock Soars,opinion,Delaware Supreme Court ruled in favor of Chicago Bridge   Iron Company N V    NYSE CBI   this Tuesday  in relation to a  2 billion lawsuit connected to Westinghouse Electric Co  s 2015 acquisition of Chicago Bridge   Iron s Shaw nuclear construction business Chicago Bridge   Iron s shares skyrocketed after the court s favorable verdict  soaring 39  in the last trading session   likely their biggest one day percentage gain ever  The ruling effectively took a  2 billion overhang off Chicago Bridge   Iron  which reported revenues of  2 36 billion for first quarter 2017 Westinghouse is the nuclear construction arm of Japan s Toshiba Corp  Westinghouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March this year due to the cost overruns and delays in the business The Story Behind the LawsuitIn 2015  Chicago Bridge   Iron sold its Shaw Group nuclear construction business to Westinghouse  Westinghouse bought Shaw business for nothing up front  however agreed to assume liabilities associated with the nuclear plant projects that Shaw was constructing in partnership with Westinghouse in South Carolina and Georgia After the deal closed  Westinghouse noted that there were certain losses that CBI should have included in the project  as well as a non cash accounting adjustment associated with Chicago Bridge   Iron s purchase of Stone   Webster when it acquired Shaw Group years earlier  Disputing Chicago Bridge   Iron s historical accounting figures  Westinghouse demanded  2 15 billion as compensation from the former  Chicago Bridge   Iron  on the other hand  considered this demand as an attempt to change the deal and said that Westinghouse owed it almost  428 million The latest Delaware Supreme Court ruling discarded Westinghouse s accounting claim and with it  the bulk of Westinghouse s justification for seeking an adjustment to the price An independent auditor has been appointed to review post closing adjustments to the deal price What it Means for CBIChicago Bridge   Iron maintained that realistically  only around  70 million is in dispute  and it would likely be set off against its  428 million claim against Westinghouse  Consequently  it s entirely probable that Chicago Bridge   Iron may end up owing nothing and that Westinghouse may  because of its bankruptcy  not pay anything either Without any doubt  the verdict has reduced the risk for Chicago Bridge   Iron  eliminating almost all liability associated with its Westinghouse litigation The lawsuit had weighed heavily on the company s stock  which was down roughly 54  year to date before yesterday s rally  Concerns about recent net losses and qualms about project delays also had investors on edge  In fact  even after taking yesterday s jump into account  the share price has declined 41 5  over the past one year  against the Zacks categorized  industry s average gain of 15  Volatile commodity pricing and prolonged softness in the energy markets have proven to be major concerns for Chicago Bridge   Iron  Over the past few quarters  the company suffered a precipitous decline in capital investments  severely marring its financials  Reduced activity on the company s large cost reimbursable LNG projects in the Asia Pacific region and winding down of several other E C projects are other factors that have been denting the company s growth These headwinds were reflected harshly in the company s latest quarterly numbers  with earnings missing estimates by a colossal 75  and revenues dropping 11  year over year  The Westinghouse lawsuit remained a formidable risk to future profits  considering the huge amount it involved We presently have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  on the company Chicago Bridge   Iron Company N V  Price and Consensus   Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the broader sector include TopBuild Corp     NYSE BLD     Armstrong World
