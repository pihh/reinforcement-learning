191937,413453,CVX,India s Reliance says purchases of Venezuelan oil have been approved by the U S ,news,"NEW DELHI  Reuters    India s refining firm  Reliance Industries   NS RELI  on Thursday said its purchases of Venezuelan crude have been reported and approved by the U S  government after American officials warned oil firms about their activity in Venezuela a day earlier 
The United States on Wednesday said oil companies  including Reliance  Russia s Rosneft  MM ROSN   Spain s Repsol  MC REP  and U S  based  Chevron  Corp  N CVX   need to tread cautiously in their activities in Venezuela  in an attempt to ramp up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro 
 We are in frequent communications with U S  government officials regarding Venezuela and continuously keep them apprised of our actions   a Reliance representative said in an email to Reuters 
Washington imposed sanctions early last year on state run oil firm PDVSA in an effort to oust Maduro  whose re election in 2018 was viewed as a sham by most Western Hemisphere nations  The White House on Wednesday hosted opposition leader Juan Guaido  whom Maduro calls a  puppet  of the United States 
Wednesday s comments from a senior U S  administration official about possible sanctions against Rosneft and other energy companies with ties to PDVSA caught some oil executives in Venezuela by surprise 
President Donald Trump s government imposed its first round of sanctions on PDVSA a year ago  depriving the company of its main market  the United States 
The August measures that followed targeted non U S  companies buying Venezuelan oil  but those  secondary sanctions  have not been enforced  As a result  Venezuela is still exporting roughly 1 million barrels of crude and fuel per day 
Repsol declined to comment  Rosneft  Chevron and PDVSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
Reliance  among PDVSA s largest customers  in October resumed direct purchases of Venezuelan crude after a four month pause  helping the state run company reduce mounting inventories of unsold oil  Reliance said at that time that it was supplying PDVSA with fuel permitted under sanctions in exchange for the Venezuelan oil 
Reliance s representative added that the firm does not operate as an intermediary for sales of Venezuelan oil to third parties   All Venezuelan crude sourced by Reliance is for processing in Reliance s refineries only  ",2020-02-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/indias-reliance-says-purchases-of-venezuelan-oil-have-been-approved-by-the-us-2078180,2078180

191943,413459,CVX,Chevron CEO  Ignore Short Term Factors  Focus on Supply and Demand,news,"Oil and the companies that drill for it are both deeply out of favor today 
There s a host of reasons  including a supply demand imbalance caused by increasing U S  onshore energy production  Only investors are increasingly focused on near term events like the attack on Saudi oil facilities and geopolitical moves by countries like the U S  and Iran  The CEO of oil giant Chevron  NYSE CVX  is looking past temporary issues like these  and so should you  Here s why 
What really matters
In an interview with CNBC in January of 2020  Chevron CEO Michael Wirth was asked about the increasing tensions between the U S  and Iran  He quickly pointed to an attack on Saudi Arabian oil assets in late 2019 that took key production assets off line  The news led to a swift rise in the price of oil  but prices quickly settled back down  He predicted that the same would happen again with Iran  because the oil market is  pretty well supplied   He was correct    oil prices initially rose  but then pretty quickly fell again 

When asked if headline grabbing news events like these change the way Chevron looks at the industry  Wirth was very clear  They are a reminder of the risks that oil companies face  but 

We look at a long term view  really  on supply and demand  And we don t overlay these shorter term phenomena into our thinking about price    

He s not alone  During Exxon s  NYSE XOM  fourth quarter conference call  CEO Darren Woods discussed his choice to keep investing in production growth despite currently low oil prices by explaining to investors that 

We know demand will continue to grow driven by rising population  economic growth  and higher standards of living  We know that excess capacity will shrink  typically faster than people think  and margins will rise  Then  new capacity will be needed  These are the classic price cycles of capital intensive commodity industries    

The supply demand outlook
Right now energy markets are well supplied  as Chevron s Wirth noted  In fact  the big issue is really too much supply  which is helping to keep oil and natural gas prices low 
This is largely because of the rapid growth in production in the U S  onshore market  The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimates that U S  crude oil production reached a new record in 2019  And it projects that production will increase again in 2020 and 2021  The United States is now the largest oil producer in the world  according to the EIA      
That s the bad news  The good news is that smaller and financially weak drillers in the U S  onshore space are struggling  Many are going bankrupt  As Exxon s Woods highlighted  that s just normal for the industry 
In fact  it s pretty normal for all commodity based industries  Companies get overzealous when prices are high  and then there s a shakeout when supply ramps up and prices  inevitably  fall  That s what helps keep supply and demand in balance  Even OPEC is helping out this time around  with calls for its members to cut production in an attempt to support oil and natural gas prices    

XOM data by YCharts
So supply is basically doing what the oil industry expects  but what about demand 
In a world that s increasingly focused on ESG investing and halting global warming  this could be a big problem  This is true over the very long term  but carbon fuels today are an integral part of the global energy pie and can t be easily or quickly displaced  Oil  for example  took roughly 100 years to replace coal as the dominant global energy source  Oil will eventually be replaced  but for now the world still needs oil and gas 
The International Energy Agency  IEA  recently provided its world energy outlook for 2020  Based on the currently stated global warming goals of countries around the world  it expects oil demand to grow until 2025 and then pretty much plateau until 2040  Demand for natural gas  meanwhile  continues to grow fairly strongly all the way out to 2040 
Simply put  oil and natural gas aren t going away  A growing global population  notably in developing markets  and increasing global prosperity are key drivers here  Sure  the world could get more serious about global warming  which would reduce demand  but so far few countries have actually managed to live up to their stated goals  If that trend continues  the IEA s projections might even prove too negative    
There s another factor to consider here  as well  Oil and natural gas are depleting assets  So once a barrel is pulled from the ground  it is gone for good  And oil wells don t produce forever  with production from some wells  notably U S  shale  starting to slow down within just a couple of years 
Oil companies essentially have to keep looking for and drilling for new oil  or there won t be enough of the fuels to supply the market    which explains why Chevron and Exxon both continue to spend billions of dollars a year drilling for new oil 
Listen to these CEOs
These are the big picture supply demand dynamics that oil companies are watching  Yes  oil is a volatile commodity prone to swift price swings based on current events  But CEOs like Wirth and Woods can t run their businesses by zigging and zagging with the price of oil  They have to make long term plans based on what they believe will be the industry s long term drivers 
If you are watching oil stocks  you should follow their lead ",2020-02-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ptdhr,2080745
191944,413460,CVX,Chevron Boosts Venezuela Oil Output While U S  Is Eyeing New Sanctions,news," Bloomberg      Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  has ramped up output at a key Venezuela oil project to levels not seen in almost a year  offering a thorny reminder of how U S  sanctions are failing to deliver a knockout of Nicolas Maduro s regime 
The U S  is eyeing tougher sanctions that could target Russian producer Rosneft PJSC and potentially affect Chevron s waiver at a time when tensions between the two countries are escalating anew  Maduro  meanwhile  is considering giving foreign producers operational control at some fields to bring in added cash and  perhaps  to nudge other U S  oil companies to lobby for their own access to Venezuela s huge oil reserves 
 The likely goal is to make it so attractive  companies start to lobby harder in the U S    said Raul Gallegos  a Bogota  Colombia based director at Control Risks  an international consulting firm 
Chevron s waiver  which expires in April  has benefited both countries  mitigating the collapse in Venezuela s production and hindering further expansion by Russia and China  At the same time  it allows Chevron to remain the lone U S  player in a country with an estimated 302 8 billion barrels of oil reserves and a dysfunctional state oil company that s seen output fall by 74  since 2009 to about 792 000 barrels a day  according to the latest OPEC report 
Other U S  oil companies  meanwhile  say they re locked out   This is an America Last policy   said Ali Rahman  director of Delaware registered Erepla Services LLC  in an interview   The sanctions hurt American business interests    other than the select few granted licenses    more than anyone else  
In 2018  Erepla entered into a potentially lucrative contract with state controlled Petroleos de Venezuela SA to provide oilfield and marketing services to three fields  Soon after  the Trump administration tightened its sanctions  putting operations on hold  It sought a waiver similar to Chevron s  Rahman said  but never got a sign off 
The debate comes as Chevron has helped restore production at the Petropiar upgrader it runs as a joint project with PDVSA  according to people familiar with the operation  The upgrader turns the area s tar like oil into refinery ready Hamaca crude for export 
After being closed for parts of 2019  the site is now producing about 130 000 barrels a day of crude  the people said  asking not to be identified because the information is private  On paper  PDVSA controls Petropiar as majority owner  but Chevron has kept the oil flowing and helped repair the industrial facilities needed to refine the tar into marketable crude  the people said 
Ray Fohr  a Chevron spokesman  said the San Ramon  California based oil major is focused on its  base business  in Venezuela and is in full compliance with the law  He said PDVSA directs work processes in the area where the upgrader is located   including decisions made regarding the use of light oil and plant stops and restarts  
Overall  Chevron had a production decline in 2019 compared with 2018  he said   If Chevron is forced to leave Venezuela   he wrote   non U S  companies will fill the void and oil production will continue   He declined to address specifics on the upgrader 
The waiver debate is complex  according to Control Risks  Gallegos  the author of a book on Venezuela s oil industry   If you do away with waivers  it doesn t immediately mean oil production goes down and Maduro is out   he said in an interview   The primary concern of the U S  is the interests of oil companies  and access to the resource  ",2020-02-11,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chevron-boosts-venezuela-oil-output-while-us-is-eyeing-new-sanctions-2081261,2081261
191952,413468,CVX,Iowa s anger over Trump s ethanol policy gives Democrats opening,news,"By Stephanie Kelly NEW YORK  Reuters    In a speech last month to farmers in Texas  President Donald Trump won applause as he talked up recent U S  trade agreements  When he tried to boast of his administration s ethanol policy  however  he was met with silence  Iowa swung sharply to Trump s Republicans in the 2016 presidential election  but Democrats hope anger over a relaxation of rules mandating use of ethanol by U S  refineries could put the corn producing state in the win column this year   Get the latest from the Iowa caucuses    I think they haven t solved the farmers  problems in terms of ensuring farmers will have a consistent market for the ethanol that they produce   said Wayne Moyer  a political science professor at Grinnell College in Grinnell  Iowa   It s a sore spot   Federal rules require refineries to blend 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuels like ethanol  which is made primarily from corn  into the nation s fuel pool every year  Refiners have long sought waivers exempting them from these rules  while corn growers argue they are crucial to sustain ethanol demand  Over the past two years  the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  has granted more than 30 waivers to refineries  including facilities owned by  Exxon Mobil   NYSE XOM  and  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX   stoking the ire of farmers and spurring numerous meetings in which the White House has tried to placate growers  anger  In addition  farmers bore the brunt of the retaliatory tariffs on soybeans and other products imposed by China during an 18 month trade war with the United States  As the world s second largest economy stopped buying U S  agricultural goods  American farmers had to adapt to a smaller export market  While many farmers were willing to make that sacrifice to target what they saw as China s uncompetitive behavior  they were less obliging when it came to giving up demand for their products in what they saw as a concession to the oil industry    If we saw some other wrong turn by the EPA     then I think we re going to have to take a hard look at the political situation   said Mark Marquis  chief executive officer of Illinois based ethanol producer Marquis Energy  Iowa sells more corn and produces more ethanol than any other U S  state  according to federal data  Ethanol supports about 40 000 jobs in Iowa  according to the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association   Some Democrats  including former Vice President Joe Biden  and Pete Buttigieg  the former mayor of South Bend  Indiana  have highlighted the issue heading into the Iowa nominating contest on Monday  the first leg in the race to determine who will face Trump in the Nov  3 election   President Trump has lied to Iowa farmers at every turn  He promised to  unleash ethanol  but instead all he s done is secretly unleash Big Oil from its renewable fuel obligations   Biden tweeted in August  Iowa could be crucial in this year s presidential election  In the 2018 mid term elections  two Republicans lost their re election bids to the U S  House of Representatives  giving Democrats a majority of the four congressional districts   The president is going to be challenged by farmers over the next nine months on whether or not he s ethanol friendly   U S  Senator Chuck Grassley  a Republican from Iowa who advocates for use of biofuels  said in a call with reporters in January   GRAPHIC  Iowa s ethanol  corn production     HIT AT THE KNEECAPS  In August  the EPA granted 31 refinery exemptions  sparking outrage from the biofuels industry  There have been around 20 ethanol plant shutdowns since November 2018  equal to about 1 2 billion gallons of annual capacity  though some have reopened  The oil industry says the waivers do not destroy ethanol demand  U S  Representative Abby Finkenauer  a first term Democrat from Iowa who defeated a Republican incumbent in 2018  has endorsed Biden s presidential campaign  saying he understands the industry s importance in the state and would stabilize renewable fuel policies    What we have seen specifically from Trump and his administration has been going back on words after hands have been shook   she said   The tariffs affected the beans and the ethanol has affected the corn  We re getting hit at the kneecaps   said Trent Hatlen  who farms 1 000 acres of corn and soybeans in Rembrandt  Iowa  He said he is likely to support Biden on Monday   The White House  in a statement  touted its promotion of American ethanol  including the approval of E15  a higher ethanol blend of gasoline  for year round use  which had been previously prohibited  The signing of trade agreements  particularly the Phase 1 deal between the United States and China and the United States Mexico Canada Agreement  has boosted Trump s standing among farmers  Among those polled in late December who said they or an immediate family member were working in agriculture  49  approved of the way Trump is handling U S  farming  up from 43  in September  while 40  disapproved  a Reuters Ipsos poll showed  That support may withstand Democrats  efforts to target Iowa

191953,413469,CVX,Trinidad cancels gas deal over U S  sanctions on state run Venezuelan company,news,"By Linda Hutchinson Jafar and Luc Cohen
PORT OF SPAIN  Trinidad CARACAS  Reuters    Trinidad and Tobago has canceled an agreement with Venezuela for the joint development of a natural gas field straddling their maritime border because of U S  sanctions on Venezuela s state energy company PDVSA 
The Caribbean island nation is a major exporter of liquefied natural gas  LNG   but its own offshore natural gas output has been declining in recent years 
That has raised the possibility of using gas from neighboring Venezuela  which has large untapped offshore gas reserves  to feed LNG plants in Trinidad 
Trinidad and Tobago s prime minister  Keith Rowley  said on Monday during an energy conference in Port of Spain that the two countries will now independently develop the 10 04 trillion cubic feet Loran Manatee shallow water field 
 Progress in the development of the unitized Loran Manatee field has been impeded by the sanctions imposed by the U S  government  which inhibits U S  companies from doing business with Venezuelan oil company PDVSA   Rowley said 
Under the agreement signed between the two countries in 2013  73 75  of the joint field belongs to Venezuela and the rest to Trinidad and Tobago 
U S  oil major  Chevron  Corp  N CVX  holds a 60  interest in the Loran field  with the remainder held by PDVSA  while Shell  LON RDSa  Trinidad and Tobago  holds a 100  interest in the Manatee field 
PDVSA  the Venezuelan oil ministry  Chevron and Shell did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Washington slapped sanctions on PDVSA last year in a bid to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro  He has overseen an economic collapse and is accused by the United States and others of corruption and human rights violations 
PDVSA s output has declined  but exports have increased in recent months and Maduro remains in power 
Rowley said gas production from the Manatee field could start by 2024 or 2025 at rates ranging from 270 to 400 million standard cubic feet per day 
He said the decision to independently develop their fields also has implications for the development of other cross border fields  the Mankin Cocuina and the Kapok Doradoh

191968,413484,CVX,Investing to boost crude output rewards oil majors with glut  slim profits,news,"By Ron Bousso and Jennifer Hiller
 Reuters    The world s largest oil companies invested billions of dollars to boost crude production and their success has turned around and bit them    and their shareholders 
Oil majors  Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM    Chevron  Corp  N CVX  and Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  all reported earnings on Thursday and Friday that showed key units significantly underperformed  particularly refining and chemicals  Investor discontent with weak returns  previously concentrated on smaller shale companies or oil services firms  has worked its way up to the majors 
In the last six months  the broad S P 500 is up 10 4   while Chevron shares have lost 8   Shell is down 10   and Exxon has lost 12  
The world s oil and gas giants have been hit by falling oil and natural gas prices  weaker margins in chemicals and refining due to sagging demand  and growing investor discontent with their response to a warming planet 
To keep investors onboard  oil majors are cutting costs and selling billions of dollars worth of assets around the world to focus on new developments and the most profitable businesses 
The global economic slowdown in recent months  amplified by the coronavirus outbreak  has further strained their income  pressuring stock performance 
 This quarter is disappointing  These companies need to focus on cutting more cost  selling their most unproductive assets  and returning excess cash to shareholders   said Kevin Holt  Houston based manager of Invesco s Comstock Fund  which has about  20 billion under management   They have to do a better job  
On Friday Exxon said quarterly profit fell 5  and Chevron reported a  6 6 billion loss on a  10 billion impairment charge  On Thursday  Shell said fourth quarter profits were cut in half  and its shares fell to near a three year low 
Booming output in the United States and other places such as Brazil has sharply boosted world crude production in the last few years  The shale boom has pushed U S  output alone past 13 million barrels per day  with natural gas output also at a record and poised to keep growing 
The lower profits and weaker cash generation follow years of deep cost cuts and asset sales following the 2014 oil price crash which led to a strong recovery and boards committing to boost shareholder returns 
But weak oil prices have left many companies out of pocket  Shell this week slowed the pace of share buybacks as its debt ballooned  Exxon and Chevron responded to the shale boom by laying out ambitious spending plans  and all three have run into a global chemicals glut  the effects of the U S China trade war  and weakening margins in fuels 
The pain has been felt most in the chemical segment  where companies have invested heavily in recent years  betting on growing Asian demand 
Shell reported a 65  drop in chemical earnings in 2019 from a year earlier  while oil product sales declined by 3   Exxon s chemicals division saw an 81  decline in earnings in 2019 
Chemicals demand  in some cases is actually disappearing   Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said on Thursday   Asia is the toughest because that is where the demand destruction is mostly

Exxon s FY 2019 profit of  14 3B fell 31  from  20 8B in the previous year   and the company s third lowest this century   while capital spending climbed 20  to  31B from nearly  26B in 2018 and revenues slid 9  to  265B last year from  290B the year before 
Chevron recorded its steepest loss in a decade after writing down the value of North American natural gas fields and returns plunged from overseas refining and oil production 
Exxon CEO Darren Woods told today s earnings conference call that while the industry faces  extremely challenging market conditions   his company would not cut its spending because it is focused on long term supply and demand   We believe strongly that investing in the trough of this cycle has some real advantages  
Unlike Chevron  which has responded to Wall Street s calls for austerity  Exxon is  marching to its own drum   Adams Funds chief executive Mark Stoeckle tells WSJ 
Woods has pledged to raise Exxon s production from the typical  4M bbl day to 5M bbl day by increasing annual spending  4B  6B to top  30B and focusing on a handful of key projects such as Guyana and the Permian Basin 
 Even though it appears the market has said  we don t want you to outspend  we want you to do dividends  we want you to do buybacks   Exxon is saying  we take a longer view than anybody  if you don t like it  then sell the stock   Stoeckle said   exactly what is happening today ",2020-01-31,Seeking Alpha,https://invst.ly/ppk-i,2073377

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood morning  ladies and gentlemen  My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference facilitator today  Welcome to Chevron s Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call  Operator Instructions I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation  Mr  Wayne Borduin  Please go ahead Wayne Borduin    General Manager of Investor RelationsThank you  Jonathan Welcome to Chevron s fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast  Our Chairman and CEO  Mike Wirth  and CFO  Pierre Breber are on the call with me  We ll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron s website  Before we get started  please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates  projections  and other forward looking statements  Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2 Now  I ll turn it over to Mike Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  Thanks  Wayne Last March  I laid out Chevron s strategy to win in any environment  focused on four elements that differentiate Chevron from its competitors  an advantaged portfolio  a resilience to price downside  the commitments to capital discipline  and a superior capacity to return cash to shareholders And as we ve done in the past  we delivered again in 2019  We generated over  27 billion in cash flow from operations  We executed our  20 billion capital program  We grew our annual production to a record high  We continued to high grade our portfolio and we further strengthened our industry leading balance sheet  As a result  earlier this week  we increased the dividend by more than 8   and we expect to sustain the increased share buyback rate of  5 billion per year going forward  And we did this  despite the cost increase at TCO and the fourth quarter impairments  which Pierre will cover in just a minute 2019 performance delivered on all four of our financial priorities  which I ll cover on the next slide  These priorities don t change  They ve been the same for a long time  For two years in a row  we simultaneously increased our dividend  increased share repurchases  grew production and reduced debt  Not everyone can say this You can see the sources and uses of cash on the slide  including the  13 billion returned to shareholders  nearly the same amount as our cash capex  2019 was a good year and we intend to do even better  During our Analyst Day in March  we ll lay out our plans to further improve performance in order to continue to deliver superior returns to shareholders With that  I ll turn the call over to Pierre  who will discuss our 2019 financial results  Pierre Pierre R  Breber    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Mike Turning to Slide 5  Fourth quarter results included a net  9 2 billion charge in special items and a foreign exchange loss of  256 million  Excluding special items and FX  earnings were  2 8 billion or  1 49 per share  A reconciliation of non GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation Cash flow from operations was  5 7 billion  This is lower than the prior quarter  in part due to higher taxes on repatriated cash  including the cash impact for the  430 million tax charge that was accrued in the third quarter  Total capital spending was  21 billion  This includes around  800 million of inorganic spend which we don t budget  primarily relating to the purchase of the Pasadena refinery and acquisition costs for exploration leases and additional working interest in El Trapial  Return on capital employed was about 7   when adjusted for special items and FX  We re committed to improving returns on capital and we ll share more about our plans to do so at our Analyst Day in March Importantly  our strong free cash flow enabled us to pay over  2 billion in dividends and repurchase an additional  1 25 billion in shares in the quarter  As Mike mentioned earlier  for the full year  we returned  13 billion in dividends and share buybacks to our shareholders  And we end the year with a stronger balance sheet and the lowest debt ratio among our peers Turning to Slide 6  In the fourth quarter  we recorded over  10 billion in impairments and write offs  These were triggered in December by our decision to reduce funding to various gas related opportunities  and to lower our long term oil and gas price outlook  Line item detail is available in the appendix  While we re disappointed by these charges  we re confident that we re making the right decisions to prioritize our capital on our most advantaged highest return assets  These charges were partially offset by  1 2 billion gain from our U K  asset sale Turning to Slide 7  Excluding the impact of special items and FX  earnings decreased  3 6 billion in 2019  compared to the prior year  Upstream earnings declined  primarily due to lower commodity prices  partially offset by higher liftings  Downstream earnings also were down  due to lower refining chemical margins  together with lower volumes  primarily to the Southern Africa divestment  The other segment charge  adjusted for special items and FX  was modestly higher  but in line with full year guidance of  2 4 billion On Slide 8  2019 production was a record 3 06 million barrels per day  an increase of over 100 000 barrels a day or more than 4  from 2018  Excluding the impact of 2019 asset sales  production grew by 5 4   right in the middle of our 4  to 7  guidance range  Shale and tight production primarily in the Permian and the ramp up of Wheatstone and other major capital projects increased production by 235 000 barrels per day  This growth was partially offset by base decline and the impact of asset sales  primarily in Denmark and the UK Turning to Slide 9  and our reserve replacements  In 2019  our one year reserve replacement ratio was 44   Our decision to reduce capital funding to Appalachia natural gas resulted in a negative revision of about  400 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves  And asset sales reduced reserves by another 100 million BOE  Adjusting for these two items  reserve replacement was around 90  Annual reserve replacements are lumpy by their nature  Five year reserve replacement ratios are more meaningful and ours is 106   highlighting our continued focus and sustainability to replace the proved reserves that we produce over the longer term Moving to Slide 10  Slide 10 highlights some recent commercial developments  First  we acquired an additional 15  working interest in the El Trapial field in Argentina  giving us 100  ownership of the conventional production and the unconventional potential in this block We also recently announced an agreement to acquire terminals and retail sites in Australia  allowing us to further integrate our refinery production in Asia with the strong retail network  after the deal closes  Late last year  we also signed agreements to sell our interest in our upstream assets in Azerbaijan and Colombia  both transactions are expected to close in the first half of this year And a few weeks ago  we joined the Hydrogen Council  building on our knowledge and experience with Hydrogen and our commitment to explore ever cleaner energy solutions for the future With that  I ll turn it back to Mike Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Thanks  Pierre  On Slide 11  we are maintaining our commitment to capital discipline  And in 2020 our capital budget will be flat for the third consecutive year  The stacked bar depicts our organic C E budget of  20 billion  which includes more than  6 billion in expenditures by affiliates  primarily TCO  CPChem and GS Caltex In the 2020 budget  approximately  5 billion is allocated to our upstream base business   4 billion to FGP WPMP  another  4 billion to Permian development   3 billion for downstream and chemicals and the remainder goes to other MCPs exploration and other projects  Chevron s capital program is unlike our peers  Our spend profile has low execution risk and is focused primarily on short cycle  high return investments that are expected to sustain and grow the enterprise for many years to come Slide 12  shows our production outlook for this year  assuming a  60 Brent price  We expect production to be up to 3  higher than last year  excluding the impact of any 2020 asset sales  Our projected growth is largely driven by the Permian  partially offset by ordinary base declines and the effects of prior year asset sales  The range reflects key areas of uncertainty in our business as noted on the slide  After another year of record production in 2019  we expect a fourth consecutive year of production growth  excluding the impact of potential 2020 asset sales Moving to Slide 13  I ll share a few closing thoughts  As I ve mentioned before  we intend to win in any environment  We re not making excuses for tough commodity prices or margins  As a result of our advantaged portfolio  capital discipline  low execution risk and financial strength  we re well positioned for 2020 and committed to maintain organic capital spending at  20 billion and return significant cash to shareholders through our dividends and buybacks More detailed guidance related to the first quarter and full year is in the appendix With that  I ll turn it back over to Wayne Wayne Borduin    General Manager of Investor RelationsThanks  Mike  I d like to remind everyone that we have our annual Security Analyst Meeting in New York in early March  where we will share more about our business performance  long term strategies and five year outlook  We re looking forward to seeing you there  For those not attending in person  it will also be available via live webcast That concludes our prepared remarks  We re now ready to take your questions  Keep in mind that we do have a full queue  so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow up  if necessary  We ll do our best to get all of your questions answered Jonathan  please open the lines Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions Our first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs  Your question please Neil Mehta    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey  thank you very much  guys  The first question and this might be one for you  Pierre  cash flow in the quarter    earnings looked good  cash flow a little light  It did seem like there were some one timers in there  So  can you just spend some time  talking about what some of those one time items are  And how should we think about that rolling off as we go into the next quarter Pierre R  Breber    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Thanks  Neil  So  yeah  cash flow was a little light  Perhaps in the third quarter  we did provide guidance that we expected to pay the taxes on the repatriated cash  So  if you recall  in the third quarter  we accrued in our P L for that tax effect on repatriating cash  But the cash taxes weren t actually paid until the fourth quarter  when in fact  you saw the cash move  So  you saw cash balances go down from over  10 billion to less than  6 billion at year end And then  the second item I would say was lower affiliate dividends  So  we had lower dividends from our chemicals affiliates  Chevron Phillips Chemical Company and no TCO dividend in 2019  So  at times in years past     we received a dividend from TCO in the fourth quarter and we didn t have that last year Neil Mehta    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  And the follow up is just on production guidance  up to 3  and there are a number of variables that you called out there  But can you talk a little bit more about how you think about volumes in 2020  What are some of the pluses and minuses that we should be focused on  And how should we should think about    thinking about some of the timing of those elements recognizing that you re solving for value over volumes Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Neil  I ll take that one We ve had  as I mentioned  three years of production growth  7   I think  two years ago  4 5   last year  5 5   without asset sales  We continued to be on a good  strong program in our upstream that s delivering volume growth  and as we said  up to 3  this year  The Permian is the biggest piece of that  And you can see over the course of 2019  what we delivered  what I would call full factory production mode right now in the Permian  And so  that machine continues to click along very well  Jay will talk more about that  including not only kind of the near term view  but lay out  I think  a little bit of a longer term view for you in March We ve got contributions from other shale and tight  where we continued to invest in both Canada and Argentina  And those are beginning to contribute  not at the same magnitude as the Permian  but certainly  strong growth  Gorgon and Wheatstone through improved reliability  and addressing constraints in optimization within the LNG plants  So  we ve got growth coming across a number of those  And as you note there  we ve got some uncertainties on the PZ  It looks as if we will begin production there    here at some point over the next few months  There s still some details being worked out on that  but that starts to come back in  Hard to say how things go in Venezuela  really difficult to say right now And then  the other one  of course  is non operative joint ventures  And we certainly have some expectations for activity there  how that trends with funding levels  decisions by partners  etc  a little hard to predict  But look  we expect to grow production again this year  as I said  setting aside if we do anything else with asset sales in the portfolio  And fundamentally  the underlying drivers that we laid out last March  where we set a 3  to 4  compound annual growth rate over the next five years  Those drivers remain intact Neil Mehta    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAll right  Thanks  Mike Wayne Borduin    General Manager of Investor RelationsThanks  Neil OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan  Your question please Phil Gresh    JPMorgan    AnalystYes  hi  good morning The first question here  Others    some of your peers seem to be signaling a retrenchment in buybacks  need to protect balance sheets  Obviously  you ve talked about the strength of your balance sheet and willingness to continue the  5 billion buyback here in 2020  despite the big increase in the dividend earlier this week  So  as you look at that  I mean  is there any reasonable scenario  where you would think it would not make sense to do the buyback from a macro perspective  Or is this something that I know  a year ago  when you put this in place  the idea was it would stay there through most reasonable cycle  So  just your latest thoughts on that  Thank you Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Phil  it s Mike  No change in our expectations there  We ve indicated    we increased the buyback last year  If you look at our cash flow  you can see that we certainly can afford this  As Pierre mentioned  debt came down again last year  And we have the capacity to see this through cycles  which is what our intent is  And no change to that guidance at all Pierre R  Breber    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And if I can just build off that and address Neil s question on fourth quarter cash flow  Phil  if you look at full year cash flow  it was very strong  Again  we paid a higher 6  dividend per share in 2019  covered that  We fully funded our capital program and grew production  as Mike said  over 4   And we paid down more than  7 billion of debt  And in 2019  we bought back  4 billion of shares  So  we re exiting the year  confident in our ability to generate future cash  That was expressed with a 8 4  dividend increase and again  this expectation of sustaining the buybacks through the cycle Phil Gresh    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks Mike  second question  just to follow up would be  it sounds like you ve been doubling down here on cost reduction efforts and it s been a big focus for you recently  So  it would be helpful if you could talk about what s been happening lately on that front  Do you see this as something that would be material to investors in terms of Chevron s ability to reduce costs in the upstream and or at the downstream businesses in a way that we could see  Thanks Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Phil  So  I may sound like a broken record on this  but in a capital intensive business  capital discipline always matters  and in a commodity business  cost discipline always matters  We ve done a good job in taking costs out of our business over the last several years in response to the downturn  we saw earlier last decade  You can never assume that you re done  when it comes to seeking efficiency and driving to an even more efficient cost structure  And so  that is certainly my expectation  as we re going to continue to look for ways to do that We ve taken costs down  At the same time  production has grown significantly over the last number of years  And so  unit costs have come down dramatically  And my expectation is we re going to continue to look for ways to reduce both absolute costs and unit cost over time  In March  we ll lay out a little more specifically  what some of our ambitions are in this  and the kinds of things you could    can expect to see Wayne Borduin    General Manager of Investor RelationsThanks  Phil Phil Gresh    JPMorgan    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies  Your question please Jason Gammel    Jefferies    AnalystYes  Thanks very much  gentlemen  Another solid year in terms of execution in the Permian  I was hoping that you could address  whether you still see the Permian as on target for being able to be essentially free cash flow positive  The capital budget ticked up a small amount for 2020  And I know commodity prices have some influence there  But if you could just talk about what you re seeing Pierre R  Breber    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Jason  The short answer to that is  yes  we do  We fully expect to be cash flow positive in the Permian this year  We exited the fourth quarter with very strong production  if you look at the growth  Q3 to Q4  And across all the metrics  we continue to see improved performance  We re getting more feet drilled per rig every year  Lateral lengths are increasing  EURs continue to go up  Development costs continue to come down  And we are becoming more efficient from both the capital and an operating cost standpoint  You put all that together with the royalty barrels and the benefit of the fee acreage that we hold  And the picture in the Permian looks as strong as it ever has  I mean  it just gets better Jason Gammel    Jefferies    AnalystGreat  And then just as a follow up and this may be something that you prefer to largely defer to March  But a lot of your European peers are putting a fairly significant amount of capital into businesses that they call low carbon  which generally look to be relatively low rate of return type of investments  Can you talk about  within Chevron  how you would think about lowering the overall carbon footprint of your portfolio  And whether these are the types of investments that make sense for you Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo  let me start with lowering our carbon footprint and then I ll come to investments  Jason  We absolutely are committed to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations  Last year  we announced two metrics tied to methane emissions and flaring that are driving significant changes in what we do  We have adopted two additional metrics  which I expect to also be included in compensation related to carbon intensity of oil production and gas production We are doing a lot of work around marginal abatement cost curves across our entire portfolio to look at the intersection of technology  investment and opportunity  to reduce our carbon footprint  We re integrating renewables into our business in a much greater way with green power purchase agreements  feeding bio feedstocks in our refineries as soon as this year and co developing renewable natural gas projects with dairy farmers  for instance  And then  the final thing is we are investing in technologies  looking for things that can scale up  that can provide solutions to these challenges  And this includes not only things like carbon capture from ambient air  but other things to try to decarbonize the more difficult sectors  where energy intensity is high Last thing I ll say is  just to remind you that we operate the largest on purpose carbon capture and storage project on the planet at Gorgon  And we have two of the trains running right now  The third will start up this year  That will  at full capacity  be sequestering 3 5 million to 4 million tons per year  So  we re absolutely committed to finding ways to address the climate issue When it comes to investments  it can be challenging because the returns  as you say  historically have not been competitive with some of the other things that we invest in our portfolio  We re looking for ways to improve that and find things that we can invest in  that would offer attractive returns for investors  also be good for the environment and  importantly  can scale  And this is a big challenge and we need things that we can do at scale  And so  we continue to be committed to that Wayne Borduin    General Manager of Investor RelationsThanks  Jason OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays  Your question please Jeanine Wai    Barclays    AnalystHi  good morning everyone Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Jeanine Jeanine Wai    Barclays    AnalystHi  I think just following up on that question  last month  Mike  you were quoted by saying that companies wait until changes forced upon them fail  And we are just wondering  are those comments specifically related to the gas writedowns and Chevron s longer term view on natural gas versus liquids  Or was it more broadly speaking to Chevron s strategy related to the energy transition or else just something else Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerProbably  the final  the something else  and it really is  we need to continue to adapt  And our company has been around for more than 140 years  and we have reinvented ourselves many times over that period of time  We live in a world today with 7 5 billion people  20 years from now  there will be more than 9 billion people on the planet  There s an expectation for a reduction in the impact of what we do  And at the same time  we need to support affordable  reliable access to energy for a growing population and growing standard of living Now  we also have technology tools that are available today that we ve never seen before  And so  what we need to do is continue to evolve our culture  our applications of technology  our cost structure  our competitiveness and our discipline  to be part of that equation for many  many decades into the future  And so  my comments really are a message to our employees that we need to change  we need to evolve  And it addresses all of the things that we ve talked about  it addresses a more efficient and lower carbon intensity in our operations  but it also calls for us to find ways to adopt new technologies and change the way we work in response to them Jeanine Wai    Barclays    AnalystOkay  that s very helpful  Thank you My second question is on the Gulf of Mexico and potential upside to medium term growth there  especially post 2023  So  with tiebacks to existing infrastructure there being very attractive from a rate of return perspective in that portfolio  can you talk about any technology that you re working on that could potentially extend tieback ranges  And then  any update you might have on estimated resource that we can be excited about in terms of exploiting through existing facilities or infrastructure  given the continued focus on free cash flow Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So  we ve sanctioned projects at the end of the year  which is a greenfield project with Anchor at a much lower cost structure  both capital cost and operating cost  than we ve seen before  So  I think when we find projects  where that s the right answer  you ll continue to see us do that  And we ve got a lot of exploration acreage out there and a good track record over time on exploration  But the concept of tiebacks  I think  is one that we need to continue to invest more in We had a discovery last year with Hess as the operator called Esox  a low cost  high return tieback  which actually will turn a 2019 discovery into 2020 first oil  It s about five miles away from Tubular Bells  And we ve been working on technology to extend subsea tiebacks and this includes longer distance pumping of fluids  compression and movement of liquids  and the ability to avoid formation of hydrates and other things on the sea floor  pushing the range of tiebacks from the neighborhood of 30 miles out closer to 50 miles  And that really expands the opportunity set for us to use existing infrastructure to improve production  We re working on multi phase subsea pumps and in a number of these technologies  And so  I think  as we go forward  what you will see is an increased blend of tiebacks and use of existing infrastructure  as well as the occasional large greenfield project that comes in And in things like Anchor  for instance  you ve got an initial phase of development  And once that s in  that enables what I just described  which is these additional follow on phases of development  which are much more economic  And I think technology just moves in one direction  and it really builds on my prior comments that we need to look for ways to use technology standardization and other approaches to make the deepwater even more economic  A lot of progress has been made on that and I m optimistic we ll see more in the future Jeanine Wai    Barclays    AnalystGreat  Very interesting  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo  Your question please Roger Read    Wells Fargo    AnalystYeah  Thank you and good morning  Guess  if we could  I ve got kind of one that s maybe on the risk side question and one that s on the upside question  So  with the good news first You highlighted some of the things that are at risk to 2020 production  But recent talk has been about restarting the Neutral Zone  You have a position there  And then  I was curious where else we could see some upside in the portfolio in 2020  I mean  should we be thinking Permian or should we focus on some other portion of the operations Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Roger  So  on the partition zone  after several years of being shut down  there s been progress with an agreement between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait  That memorandum of understanding has now been ratified by the Royal Court in the Kingdom and the parliament in Kuwait  and we re moving on to some administrative actions required to implement that All of that suggests that we should resume work in the PZ this year  It s been shut in  since May of 2015  And so  we will be careful to ensure that any start up and resumption of activity is safe that we really focus on equipment integrity  And so  it will be a careful restart and a gradual ramp  And so  I think  in terms of production  this year  we re likely to see a start up at some point and then some work before we begin a gradual ramp So  what that nets to is not a lot of impact this year  but it could be some positive upside  I think we ll see more of the ramp completed in 2021  We eventually will have to get some new rigs in there to begin drilling additional wells  And so     but it should be on a trend line over the next 18 months or so  back toward something that looks like we saw before we shut down In terms of other upside  the Permian has kind of continually surprised us to the upside  even as we raised expectations in the past  And so certainly  that is a possibility  I mentioned the other shale and tight  and those also continue to really show strong improvement in terms of performance  And so  I think those are some other areas  where we could see production upside Roger Read    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  And then  for my bucket of cold water on you  we ve seen global natural gas prices take quite a hit  Obviously  fairly mild winter across Northern hemisphere hasn t helped  But part of it  is your own LNG facilities and everyone else continues to run better than expected  We re seeing some start to run above nameplate capacity And so  as we think about gas in 2020  do you feel that if we look at North American forward curves  that s probably a pretty good indicator of the year ahead  Or is there a reason for optimism in one place or greater pessimism in another  just sort of curious how that would fit into your outlook Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Overall  Roger  I think the market is  as you say  pretty tempered on gas pricing  And we have had a relatively mild winter  both in North America and in Asia  and forward markets reflect that  inventory levels reflect that  We re not banking on a recovery in gas prices  We ve got an under    we re underweight gas  as a percentage of our portfolio  versus others  And I ll remind you  we ve got pretty good term contracting on our LNG with oil linked pricing across a lot of our portfolio there So  from a relative weighting standpoint  we may not be quite as exposed  So  maybe it was a bucket of cool water rather than ice water that you dumped on me there  But yeah  the markets are setting up  I think  to be pretty flattish  And that s why we ve got to focus on self help and things like cost  as I discussed earlier Wayne Borduin    General Manager of Investor RelationsThanks  Roger Roger Read    Wells Fargo    AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI  Your question please Doug Terreson    Evercore ISI    AnalystGood morning  everybody Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Doug Doug Terreson    Evercore ISI    AnalystMike  so in integrated oil  returns on capital have converged between the companies during the past decade or so  which suggests that competitive advantages may be converging too  And on this point  while you guys had this mantra of disciplined  return driven capital allocation  and that s clearly the appropriate approach  at least in my view My question is whether you think that historical advantages and project management  multinational experience and logical superiority to cost of capital  maybe leaving something out  are still strong and defendable for Chevron  And if so  are there examples that underscore the strength of the advantages that you guys have And on the other hand  are there areas of historical competitive advantage that you sense are being eroded and where you ll need to redeploy capital away from in the future Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell  there s a lot in there  Doug  Number one  you re right  I think we have seen this convergence of returns  in part  by the last cycle we came through  and high prices  we had a high cost structure  we had a lot of investment across the industry  And we are now living in a world of more abundant supply  and prices and returns reflect that with the capital sitting on the books of everybody I do believe the advantages that have historically been associated with companies like ours are still strong  And the project at Tengiz  while we wish that the execution was going better than it is and disappointed in the cost and schedule update  there are not many companies in the world that can do a project like that at all  And so  I think there are strong advantages  there are sour gas handling capabilities  Our heavy oil expertise continues to be a value  And as we get back to work in the PZ  we will be doing things there that very few other companies can do  And as I mentioned earlier  we ve been hanging in in Venezuela  which has tremendous potential  And our capability there to help  over time  develop that resource in a responsible way is something that is differentiated  So  I think there are some historic capabilities that are differentiators The other thing I would point to is portfolio  And certainly  as we ve talked about many times  I won t belabor it  but our position in the Permian  both from a size standpoint  a quality standpoint  are the relative lack of royalty  given the fact that s fee acreage  and our experience with factory drilling  which is a capability that not everybody has  And we continue to see the benefits of that year after year is another point of differentiation  So  I still do believe there are areas that we do differentiate Pierre R  Breber    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And if I could build up Mike s answer there  look  we get    and I said in my prepared remarks that our returns are too low  and we re committed to improving them  and we ll share more at our Analyst Day  But I ll also talk about cash flow  We talked about our strong cash flow in 2019  call it    whichever macro environment you want to call it  weak or whatever  but we re able to do all those things  increase the dividend  fund the capital program  grow production  reduce debt and sustain the buyback program  At our last Analyst Day  we showed that over the next five years  we re going to grow cash from ops  We said we re going to keep capital essentially flat  that means we re going to grow free cash flow And so  I think one of the things that s not fully understood is that the capital efficiency of our program going forward is different than we ve seen in the past  So  we re able to grow and sustain cash flows at lower capital than almost any time in the past  and certainly better than our peers  And that s what enables us to do the kind of dividend increase that we announced a couple of days ago  sustain a buyback program and still grow the enterprise for the long term Doug Terreson    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  good points  Thanks guys Wayne Borduin    General Manager of Investor RelationsThanks  Doug OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotiabank  Your question please Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystHey guys  good morning Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Paul Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystYou did an impairment charge  which is quite large  and obviously  that means the decision made at the time  some of the permit that did not work out  so what have we learned from this process or this impairment  And how your future M A or project accession    the process has changed Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Paul  Two of the big drivers of that charge were our Marcellus position  which is essentially mostly dry gas  we ve got a little bit of Utica  but mostly dry gas  And also  the Kitimat LNG project  which is Canadian gas that is quite a ways away from the Kitimat site  And both of those at the time those transactions were entered into we and the world  had a different view on natural gas I think the Permian and unconventionals have really been a game changer  If you look at the prolific gas production in the United States today  the market conditions that we were talking about earlier with Roger  and we didn t see those things at the time  And so I do think there s a lesson about testing M A ideas against scenarios that are not the    then prevailing view on forward markets We did that with the Anadarko transaction last year  And there s a reason that we like Anadarko from a synergy standpoint  there s a reason we saw a certain value level that we would be willing to transact at  And there s the reason we wouldn t go beyond that  And that s because commodity markets are hard to predict  and we certainly looked at cases that would have stressed an acquisition  because we might experience a different market environment than the one that we premised  maybe our central analysis on And so Yogi Berra said  the predictions  I think it s Yogi Berra  predictions are hard  especially when they re about the future  That s certainly true  It s not lost on us  And I would say that s the big lesson from these two is  if you re going into the future with  or into a deal with a pretty strong view on commodity price  make sure you take a look at what happens if you re wrong and whether or not you d be happy with it in the scenario where you are wrong Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystOn my second question  I think Pierre already addressed someone  I mean  return on capital employed  Last year  you earned 7  at a  64 Brent price  which is lower than the S P market return  I think  And for most of the investors  they probably think  60   65 Brent is as much as they re willing to give companies in the long term assumption  So talking about an improvement  can you give us some idea that where  given the big portfolio you have  I mean  where did you see the biggest opportunity you may be able to really drive up that return  I mean  we re looking at some of the projects  whether it s Tengiz  the future growth project or the Anchor  we don t see those projects would be able to improve your overall return at all Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah Paul  look there s no silver bullet on improving returns in a flat commodity price environment  You roll up your sleeves and you get to work on all the little things that cumulatively can drive returns higher  And that s costs  that s margins  that s value chain optimization  it s reliability  it s technology  There s a whole host of levers that you have to be working on  This is what we do in the downstream business every day  And what we ve done in the downstream business for decades is  you assume margins are going to be worse in the future than they are today  and you ve got to find a way to get more efficient and productive with your operations in every little thing that you do  and that s what we need to do  I m not satisfied with returns at the level that they are  We re not going to wait for prices to be the answer here  We simply have to    we have to get after it  And you ll hear more about this in March  We ll talk more about our plans to improve returns then But there s not a magic wand here  This is good old fashioned hard work  and it s things that we know how to do  We just have to get after it Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystThank you Pierre R  Breber    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  and let me just add in addition to the cost and margin and value chain and all those efforts  The Permian investments are very accretive to our book returns  We showed in the second quarter that  even in a growing asset  and we are investing and growing in the Permian  that returns are heading to 20  and north of that  So we do have investments that are accretive to the portfolio  I just said earlier  we have some really  capital efficiency that enables us to sustain and grow the enterprise at lower capital levels than we have in the past  So when you take the capital efficiency  plus all    everything Mike talked about  we intend to increase our returns over time Paul Cheng    Scotiabank    AnalystThank you Wayne Borduin    General Manager of Investor RelationsThanks  Paul OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen  Your question please Jason Gabelman    Cowen    AnalystYeah  thanks for taking my question  I guess this follows what Paul just said  Specifically on Anchor  it seemed like capex for the project was a bit high  And I was wondering if you could talk about returns  You ve kind of danced around it  but maybe talk about returns specifically for that project  and is that kind of one of the more competitive projects in your project queue  And I have a follow up  Thanks Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Jason  If I go back to an earlier period of time  our development costs for deepwater projects were north of  30 a barrel  Anchor is actually south of  20 a barrel  and that includes some investment for new technology that we have to prove out here  because we re dealing with deeper reservoir  higher reservoir pressures  20 000 pounds technology  a little bit of additional export pipeline  which is unique to this project as well Operating costs have come down from the high teens per barrel down into the range close to  10 a barrel  So we ve seen significant improvements in drilling and completions performance  And all of those things come together to bring the cost down  I m not going to give you a specific return number because  frankly  we run these things at different prices and different assumptions around recovery  So we look at a range of potential outcomes  but I will tell you  it is competitive in our portfolio  it sets us up for additional follow on development that will  I think improve returns  And the technology development unlocks a resource type that we believe holds a lot of potential as we go forward  And so I don t think we re done  in terms of driving these costs down  And in the deepwater  we re going to continue to look to make these projects even more economic Jason Gabelman    Cowen    AnalystWhen  when you say unlocks a new resource type  is it kind of a high pressure  high temperature  more further   Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerCorrect Jason Gabelman    Cowen    AnalystYeah  OK  Got it  Thanks  And then  there s not a lot of visibility to your project queue beyond 2025  there s a couple of Gulf of Mexico projects for Permian and TCO  and that s kind of all you ve given us  I wonder if you plan on providing more visibility to some of your projects that you have options around  And then kind of attached to that  do you see an opportunity to step in to some international projects  maybe with companies that are looking to farm down stakes  Thanks Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  so we will in March  lay out a longer view to give you some more transparency  I know that s a question that a number of people have been asking  The one thing that I would suggest is  we went through a period of time over the last decade  where I think we conditioned ourselves and our investors to believe that the only path to the future was by doing these great  big projects and stacking up lots and lots of them  because that s what we were doing at the time We have a very different portfolio today  We have large tranches of production that are pretty flat and facility limited in Australia LNG  in Kazakhstan  our unconventionals begin to behave this way as you build up the scale there  And so at the margin  we are continuing to look for the right projects and highly economic projects and as Pierre said  those that are accretive to returns  But we re not nearly as reliant on those alone to sustain and grow cash flows into the future  We just have a much more resilient  durable  long lived portfolio  And so grinding away on enormous unconventional positions may not be quite as glamorous as doing the big projects in terms of giving you a lot of things to talk about  But it really drives strong financial outcomes  And it s durable  I think longer than most people believe  And so we ll talk about that more in March  We ll talk about other opportunities we have in terms of captured opportunities that people may not be paying much attention to  we ll talk more about our exploration prospects  And the question on farm ins  that s always something we evaluate  And if the right opportunities present themselves  we look at those Wayne Borduin    General Manager of Investor RelationsThanks  Jason Jason Gabelman    Cowen    AnalystGreat  Thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC  Your question please Biraj Borkhataria    RBC    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my questions  The first one is actually just on the base decline  if I look at the figures on Slide 8 and take the base from there  it looks like the base decline was less than 1  in 2019  And I guess  that excludes shales  but I m just trying to get a sense of whether that figure is relevant  And if there s anything funding in the 2019 number that is not applicable going forward  Just some comments around that would be helpful Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  our base portfolio is large and there s a lot of different assets in there  There are some things that now are in the base that are things like Jack St  Malo and Perdido  and so as we ve got some of these deepwater projects that are no longer new projects  Some of the new investments in there to do next phases of development and the like  give you some growth that offsets some of the underlying decline  But it also comes back to this point I was just making to Jason  and a larger percent of our portfolio now is facility limited  not reservoir limited And so this metal model that reservoir dynamics drive our overall production  the shape of our production profile is one  I think  that needs to be calibrated appropriately to a larger and larger portion that does not behave that way  So that results in more stable  predictable production  There s modest investment required to sustain that  be it facility investment or some new wells  But you look at that  you look at the brownfield opportunities we have  and the ways we re using technology to arrest declines and base decline is just less in our portfolio than it was a decade ago  And that s not a short term phenomenon  that s a structural change in how our production looks Biraj Borkhataria    RBC    AnalystThat s helpful  Thank you Wayne Borduin    General Manager of Investor RelationsThanks  Biraj  Do you have a follow up Biraj Borkhataria    RBC    AnalystYeah  the second question  just on a slightly different tact  but as you guys are seeing in California  I wanted to ask about renewable fuels given the favorable regulation there  So what we are seeing is a number of the U S  refiners announced expansion projects and renewable diesel  in particular  I was wondering if that s something you re interested in  What you think about the economics  And then if it s attractive to you  what s holding you back from investing in that space Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we ve been selling renewable fuels in California for the better part of the last two decades  a lot of blending  We ve been looking at manufacturing  but we really have chosen not to go into the ethanol business  On renewable diesel  we ve got close relationships with suppliers of renewable diesel  And we are  I mentioned earlier in a response to a question  we are making modifications at California refining facilities in order to co feed biofeedstocks  in order to produce renewable diesel So our view is rather than going into new projects and greenfield developments  we ve got existing infrastructure in Kit  that we have now proven the way to safely and reliably introduce biofeedstocks and co feeds  So it s a more economic way to do it  It takes advantage of existing capital investment  And so we re working on that  So we are and we ll continue to be growing in the biofuels value chain Wayne Borduin    General Manager of Investor RelationsThanks  Biraj Biraj Borkhataria    RBC    AnalystThank you very much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Doug Leggate    Bank of America    AnalystThanks  Good morning  everyone  Thank you for taking my questions  Mike and the guys  happy new year to all of you  I    Mike  I wonder if I could just    we ve had some concerns about this particular issue for a second  and it s part of the Permian  I d like to just get your perspective on it  I realize what you re seeing about returns and the benefit of royalty interest and mineral interest and so on  But by 2023  this is going to be 25  of the company  And when I think about the underlying decline rates on the skew toward NGLs and gas  given the state of U S  gas market  help me understand why the increase of the  putting that much of your portfolio in high decline assets and skewing toward U S  gas  is incrementally positive for the overall cash flow capacity of the company Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Doug  so look it s  an individual well is a high decline asset  The Permian Basin  as you get hundreds and then thousands of wells on production  and you have infrastructure built  the ability to keep that infrastructure full and have it be a very flat production profile at modest incremental investment relative to the production that you re producing is profound  Jay  will explain this more in March when we come to New York  But it is a factory  and running a factory  you ve got certain costs and certain investments in the factory and then you push out to the product of the factory  and that s how to think about the Permian The commodity mix  look it s 75  liquids  We re 50  oil in our portfolio  right now 25  NGLs  25  gas  As the volumes continue to grow  we get a lot of oil production and we take a long view on markets  Pierre mentioned earlier that returns on investment there are greater than 20  and growing  And so look  if we ve got something  somebody mentioned earlier  your current returns are at 7   those need to improve  well if you ve got opportunities to invest in things that are north of 20   that s the way to start to lever up returns And so look  we look at commodity prices on at all  We optimize it  we re moving commodities to markets near and far to add value to that  But these are high return  long lived positions  and it is a competitive advantage Doug Leggate    Bank of America    AnalystI look forward to what Jay has got to say in March  But just to be clear  those returns are full cycle  including infrastructure and all the plant build out and so on Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd fully loaded with costs  including corporate costs Doug Leggate    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  thank you  My follow up Mike  is more philosophical  I guess  for the broader energy space  All    we all seem to be here    it seems like there has been a kind of an awakening  if you like  the ESG issues just in this last past six months  and particularly this year  More headlines this morning about pension funds just divesting out of fossil fuels altogether  I m just curious  how in your position  obviously  as an advocate of the industry  how do you anticipate challenging those kind of questions over fossil fuel is bad  everything else good  kind of thing  How does Chevron compete for the incremental investment dollar  And it s an answer I m looking for some help with because  obviously  it s a challenge for all of us in this business right now Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  well first of all  we believe in ESG  We have been a responsible operator across ES G for a long  long  long time  And we invest enormously in that  The E is getting a lot of attention right now  and look  over the history of our industry  we have    we and others have reduced the environmental impact of our operations time and time and time again  We are doing it again today And we have the scale  the technical capability  the financial capability to be a big part of addressing this challenge  And nobody  no one country  no one industry is going to be the one that solves everything  but collectively  we will respond to the challenge The world needs more energy  The world needs more affordable energy  And people in developing economies deserve the opportunity to see their lives improve  and affordable  reliable and ever cleaner energy is essential to improving the quality of life on the planet  which is better today  than it has ever been at any point in history and will be better in the future And we intend to be a part of that solution  We acknowledge that the climate is changing  We acknowledge that human activity and fossil fuels  all contribute to that  And we acknowledge that we will be part of addressing that as we go forward  And so we are investing time  people  money  technology in being part of that solution  And look  I m an optimist  We re    there s a lot of pessimism that you can hear out there  And as you say  over maybe the last six months  that drumbeat is even louder  but we saw big challenges in the past  And I m optimistic that we will be successful again Wayne Borduin    General Manager of Investor RelationsThanks  Doug Pierre R  Breber    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIf you could remember   Doug Leggate    Bank of America    AnalystThanks guys  Appreciate it OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citibank  Your question please Alastair Syme    Citibank    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my questions  With the impairment  I guess  you re signaling something about LNG  So the question is  are you happy to tack away completely from LNG  I mean  you ve been one of the biggest global investors in the last decade and you clearly created a lot of competency within the organization  So are you happy to do nothing in effect Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerNo  we re happy to do things that are competitive and economic  Alastair  And look  we re a big player in LNG  The world will    demand for LNG will grow over time and you have to take a long view on these things  Commodity markets get into positions where they get overbuilt  demand grows in a linear fashion  supply comes on in stair steps And so we re in a position right now where the near term market fundamentals are a bit tough  But long term  like petrochemicals  like refining  you need to be in low cost positions that are highly competitive where you ve got scale  technology  operating efficiency  And so those are the kinds of things we re looking for  And we ll continue to evaluate opportunities to add to our LNG portfolio Our assessment on the Kitimat project has given all the other developments out there in the world that  that one was going to be tough to compete versus our alternatives  And so it s a hard decision to come to  but it doesn t condemn the asset class for us  as an investment proposition  we just want to find the very best projects Alastair Syme    Citibank    AnalystOkay  thank you  But my follow up  I just wanted to get an update on where you re at in TCO  specifically  any discussions you re having with the government  I m not sure whether the government has been sort of informed on the cost overruns and where that leaves it Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  so the discussions are ongoing  The government is obviously a key stakeholder in this  And so our people in country have been engaged  Jay Johnson will be there next week  and both visiting the site and meeting with people from the government  And so when you go through one of these things  there s a whole series of engagements  and we re in the process on that Pierre R  Breber    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  the only thing I d add to that  Alastair  is that  unlike other agreements in Kazakhstan  our contracts  tax and royalty  right  it s not a production sharing contract  So on production sharing contracts  as the government reimburses the concessionaires for their costs  which is not the case for tax and royalty  So of course  they re an important stakeholder  but it is a fundamentally different contractual structure Alastair Syme    Citibank    AnalystPerfect  thank you Wayne Borduin    General Manager of Investor RelationsThanks  Alastair OperatorThank you  And our final question comes from the line of Jamaal Dardar from Tudor Pickering  Your question please Jamaal Dardar    Tudor Pickering    AnalystGood morning  guys  Just wanted to touch on the outsized dividend growth that we saw versus previous years here  So just curious on the thought process there  and as you continue to shed assets and large MCPs roll off  and capital intensity is lowered  just wondering how repeatable outsized dividend growth could be over the long term Michael K  Wirth    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo if you look back at our dividend history  and we were looking back at it not long ago  whether you re looking over multiple decades or over the last decade  we ve grown it at kind of a compound annual growth rate of about 6   And so there s a little bit to the upside of that  but we ve been lower than that here in recent years  And we are well positioned  Pierre talked about our strong cash flow and the capital efficiency that we have now in our portfolio to sustain and grow cash flows with a much lower level of capital investment than  I think people had become accustomed to over the prior period We would not have increased the dividend  if we weren t absolutely confident that it s sustainable in perpetuity  And just as we said  we intend to sustain our buybacks through the cycle  We intend to sustain strong dividend distributions  Our number one financial priority  I ll remind you  is to sustain and grow the dividend  And so this was a signal of confidence in our portfolio  It s a signal of confidence that we can sustain strong cash generation even in a commodity price environment like the one we ve been in  and the one we continue to be in  And we will talk about this more in March  But we have a very  very strong position to generate cash out of our portfolio  very efficient capital profile going forward  Further efficiencies coming on the cost side  and we re very confident in the capacity that we have Decisions are made by the Board  I can t get ahead of the Board on what they may do in the future  But I ll tell you  the Board shares the confidence we have in our cash generating capacity Jamaal Dardar    Tudor Pickering    AnalystThanks  And then just a quick one on buybacks  You mentioned the sustainable nature is difficult for us to model the impact of the PSC roll off  but it seems like very temporarily  there could be  at strip pricing time periods where in order to satisfy the full buyback  maybe you lean into the balance sheet there  Just wanted to verify the comfort there  obviously given where you sit  as best in class on your debt ratio Pierre R  Breber    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  thanks Jamaal  No  if we have to lean on the balance sheet for some point in time  that s OK  right  We ve said we want to sustain it through the cycle  we ve never said the buyback has to be funded every single quarter from free cash flow  So that s not our expectation  We have the strongest balance sheet in the industry  Our net debt ratio is 13   Gross debt is 16   We have the capability to take on some debt  I ve talked about  We don t have a target debt range  but certainly  I d be comfortable higher than we are right now  But if we re outside of    if we re a little bit low  that s OK  That s how the math works  So if we generate cash at surplus to our top three priorities  which is to pay the dividend  invest in the business and have a strong balance sheet  and we ll return that in the form of share buybacks But we also want to keep that ratable and sustainable  So we just don t want to ramp up buybacks  because we want to be able to essentially dollar cost average and do it through the cycle  So the short answer is  yes  There ll be times we ll lean on our balance sheet  Our balance sheet has that capability  and our intent is to sustain the buyback through the cycle Jamaal Dardar    Tudor Pickering    AnalystAll right  Thanks  everyone Wayne Borduin    General Manager of Investor RelationsThanks  Jamaal  Well with that  I d like to thank everyone for your time today  We do appreciate your interest in Chevron and

191972,413488,CVX,Ouch  Why Chevron Posted a  6 Billion Loss in Q4 2019,news,"Big oil has been in big trouble this earnings season  and oil major Chevron  NYSE CVX  hasn t been immune  The company reported an eye popping  6 6 billion loss in the fourth quarter on Jan  31  While that wasn t entirely unexpected  for reasons I ll outline below   a top line miss sent shares tumbling following the release  
Silver linings were few and far between in the earnings report  Here s what investors should know  

By the numbers

Data source  Chevron earnings releases  YOY   Year over year 
Let s not sugarcoat this  It was Chevron s largest ever quarterly loss  The reason the market hasn t reacted more strongly is that the company projected the bad news in December  when it announced that it was reallocating capital away from lower margin projects toward projects from which it expected higher rates of return  Most of these were related to natural gas  in particular the company s Appalachian shale assets  At the time  it projected resulting impairment charges of  10 billion to  11 billion  Appalachian shale assets made up  6 5 billion of the final result of  10 4 billion 
It s worth noting that  absent the impairment charge and a  1 2 billion asset sale  the company would have posted a  2 6 billion profit  the same as it posted in Q3 2019  Chevron hasn t announced its plans for these assets yet  but selling them is on the table  which means that it could see some residual benefit in a future quarter 
Aside from steadily increasing earnings in the small U S  downstream segment  Chevron had a rough quarter across the board 

What else happened in the quarter

Overall production was essentially flat year over year  at 3 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day  BOE d   with increases in U S  oil and gas production offsetting declines in international production  Although a very small part of the company s overall production  U S  natural gas liquids showed the highest production growth  up 39 9  to 284 000 Boe d  That s good for Chevron  as natural gas liquids command a higher price than dry natural gas  that is  gas in a gaseous state  
The company continued to pay down debt and ended 2019 with  27 billion in debt on its balance sheet  for a debt ratio of 16   Total debt has fallen by 21 7  since the end of 2018 
Chevron acquired an additional 15  working interest in the El Trapial field in Argentina  It also acquired Australian fuel retailer Puma Energy  for  288 million  It announced deals to sell its stake in Azerbaijan s Azeri field for  1 6 billion to Hungarian company MOL  and to completely divest its Colombian natural gas assets to a subsidiary of Colombian state run energy company Ecopetrol 
The company increased its quarterly dividend by  0 10 per share  8 4   for Q1 2020  to  1 29 share  At current prices  that yields about 4 5 

What management had to say
When earnings are bad  you can expect a big oil CEO to focus on cash flow  and that s just what Chevron s CEO Michael Wirth did in a statement 

Cash flow from operations remained strong in 2019  allowing the company to deliver on all our financial priorities  We paid  9 billion in dividends  repurchased  4 billion of shares  funded our capital program and successfully captured several inorganic investment opportunities  all while reducing debt by more than  7 billion  Earlier this week  we announced a quarterly dividend increase of  0 10 per share  reinforcing our commitment to growing shareholder returns      For the first time in the company s history  annual production exceeded 3 million barrels per day of oil equivalent 

Better luck next time
With oil prices down sharply so far in 2020  thanks to global oversupply and concerns about how the emerging coronavirus outbreak might affect the world economy  the near term outlook isn t great for most oil companies  However  Chevron may be the rare oil company for which Q1 2020 s earnings are almost certain to outperform Q4 2019 s  though given its Q4 results  that s not saying very much   
We re likely to see continued near term volatility in the sector as a number of factors play out on the global stage  But Chevron    even when posting its largest quarterly loss in history    has proven that it s perfectly capable of churning out plenty of cash and covering its dividend  While investors may not want to buy in just yet  given the current market environment  Chevron is certainly a company for dividend investors to keep on their watch lists ",2020-02-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqf54,2074419
191983,413499,CVX,Oil Prices Drop Again  Set for Weakest Month Since May on Virus Hit,news,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing com   Oil prices continued to fall Friday  with the underlying sentiment remaining weak as China s industrial base braced for extreme measures to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus 
By 9 20 AM ET  1420 GMT   U S  crude futures were 0 6  lower at  51 81 a barrel  U K  Brent  the global crude benchmark  was down 1  at  56 76 a barrel 
Prices have dropped around 15  in January  the biggest fall since May 
The official total of deaths from this virus has topped 200  with almost 10 000 people affected across the whole breadth of the country 
This has prompted Chinese authorities to shut down transport systems  lock down many cities and close many of its industries   all of which should result in a hefty hit to the country s demand for oil  China is the largest importer of oil in the world 
This doesn t look like ending anytime soon  with Beijing asking Friday its factories to remain mothballed until Feb  10  
Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  estimated that all these measures taken by the Chinese authorities will result in GDP growth in the country falling to 5 5  this year  0 4  below its previous 5 9  estimate 
 Fears of weaker demand have weighed on refinery margins  and continued weakness could see some refineries cut run rates in China   said analyst at ING  in a research note   If we were to see this  it would likely be the independent refiners who are first to cut  given their focus on the domestic market  
The weakness in the oil price has prompted talk that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will move up its March meeting  in order to discuss measures to prop up the market  
Saudi Arabia  the biggest member of OPEC  is said to be keen on a get together to discuss even deeper cuts to production than those already made  but Russia  the most important player in a broader coalition known as OPEC   is said to be less keen  
 Further downward pressure on prices may speed up the decision on whether to have the meeting in February or not   added ING

oil and gas stocks have performed horribly Friday will bring key energy earnings reports from Chevron Corp   NYSE  CVX  and Exxon Mobil Corp   NYSE  XOM  before the opening bell  These reports may create positive or negative waves throughout the sector  Note that crude oil prices have fallen for most of January  and the  52 and  51 per barrel of West Texas Intermediate support levels are now in very close focus Chevron s consensus estimates from Refinitiv call for  1 43 in earnings per share and  39 25 billion in revenue  Its shares closed at  111 85 last week and most recently traded near  109 50  after hitting a 52 week low Thursday morning  The new 52 week range is  109 06 to  127 34  The consensus analyst target was  136 29 last week and was last seen at  135 83 div connatix margin bottom  1 5em   div connatix img  margin  unset  Chevron frequently has been deemed a more cautious player than rival Exxon when it comes to capital spending and reserves  Of course  that is up for debate  but Chevron s lower 4 3  dividend implies that the market is not demanding quite as much from Chevron The consensus estimates for Exxon are earning of  0 47 per share on revenue of  65 18 billion  Shares ended last week at  66 32  but the stock was under  64 on Thursday  with a new 52 week range of  63 43 to  83 49  Exxon s dividend yield is nearly 5 4   now that its shares are so low Last year was just a continuation of the brutality against the energy majors  and many smaller oil and gas players have curtailed operations in hopes of avoiding the market s disappearing act under bankruptcy or reorganization  Exxon has not seen such low share prices since 2010  while Chevron is within a few percentage points of a two year low Chevron and Exxon are closer in market cap levels than in the past due to Exxon s poor performance  Chevron has a  207 billion market cap  versus  270 billion for Exxon Where things become extra tricky is how these oil giants will  or will not  be able to meet their dividend expectations going forward   In fact  this is likely to become a key debate among investors who are still willing to invest in oil and gas  Exxon s earnings estimates are  2 42 per share in 2019 and  3 54 for 2020  while the annualized dividend is  4 38 per share  Chevron has a  4 76 per share annualized dividend  and its earnings estimates are  6 27 per share in 2019 and  6 81 in 2020  Most investors do not take much comfort when the common stock dividends they have counted on for years are suddenly lowered or are at risk of being so Before simply endorsing oil and gas earnings estimates  note that many parts must be considered  As earning face pressure  asset sales and other dispositions can help support a dividend  That just cannot last indefinitely  however Many forecasts for the price of oil heading into 2020 were better than they have fared in January  The Saudi Aramco initial public offering in 2019 was large enough  despite a very small free float of shares  that the foreign giant is effectively more than four times larger than Exxon and Chevron combined The most recent short interest reporting showed that short sellers are sticking with their negative bets against oil and gas majors  That is even as the shares have continued to fall  Exxon and Chevron were both huge disappointments compared with the Dow and S P 500 in 2019  Both stocks showed total returns year to date of  8  or so coming into Thursday Also at issue is that the investing community is shunning oil and other fossil fuels at an ever greater rate each year  The rise of ESG  environmental  social and governance  is leaving oil and gas in the shadows  Many top firms are even offering alternatives that allow traditional investing models to entirely  or almost entirely  screen out anything tied to fossil fuels  And some pensions and endowments have entirely boycotted companies tied to oil and gas in their investment portfolios Many value investors have touted the great underperformance of the oil and gas leaders for quite some time  While the valuations may be cheap  what happens if an ever larger portion of all equity investors refuse to invest in oil and gas stocks at any price  If social directives prevail over historical patterns  where ultimately a sector becomes so cheap it has to be owned  then it would mean that many investors will refuse to own the stocks at five times earnings just as vehemently as they would at eight or 10 times Another curveball that should work in favor of oil and gas giants  but isn t yet  is that there are still many drivers  aside from Tesla owners  who just don t want to drive electric vehicles Merrill Lynch has tried to remain positive on a few oil and gas leaders  and it seems hard to imagine how it will stick with a  100 price objective for Exxon in almost any circumstance at this point  Its price objective on Chevron is a more modest  125 Exxon Mobil stock was down 0 5  at  63 80 in midday trading on Thursday  and Chevron stock was down 0 3  at  110 00

Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  Plc slowed the pace of share buybacks as profit missed expectations  underscoring the pressure on Big Oil due to slumping natural gas prices and weaker refining 
The results set a gloomy tone for what is expected to be a broadly weaker set of quarterly results for the industry  The final months of last year saw gas trade at historic lows  while slowing economic growth shrank margins from making fuel and chemicals 
The Anglo Dutch company first warned investors last quarter that it might not achieve its target of buying back  25 billion shares by the end of 2020  It reiterated that warning on Thursday and said the next tranche of share repurchases won t exceed  1 billion  compared with  2 75 billion in the prior quarter 
 We remain committed to prudent capital discipline   Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said   Our intention to complete the  25 billion share buyback program is unchanged  but the pace remains subject to macro conditions and further debt reduction  
Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was  2 93 billion  down 48  from a year earlier and falling short of the average analyst estimate of  3 15 billion 
Shell s American peers  Exxon Mobil  Corp  NYSE XOM   and  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  are due to report results on Friday  Exxon has already warned that earnings will be weaker than expected  while Chevron has flagged up a write down of as much as  11 billion

192011,413527,CVX,StockBeat  Shell Hits the Buyback Brakes After Big Shale Writedown,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com    Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  shares tumbled to their lowest in nearly three years on Thursday after the company unveiled a wretched set of figures for the fourth quarter of 2019  hit by falling operating margins and big writedowns on investments in North American shale gas and elsewhere 
The hit was so severe that the Anglo Dutch giant said it would slow the pace of share buybacks to only  1 billion in the current quarter  from an average of  2 5 billion a quarter over the last 18 months  
In the three months to December  it had bought  2 8 billion  but that had only been made possible by allowing the debt reduction target to slip  Gearing  the ratio of debt to equity  rose to 29 3  from 27 9  three months earlier   drifting further away from its medium term target of 25  
Gearing  of course  depends on the value of the company s equity as well as its debt  and that was hit by some painful writedowns  notably  1 65 billion mainly related to U S  shale gas assets  The company joins an ever growing list of majors forced to admitted their bet on shale has turned sour    Chevron    NYSE CVX     BP    LON BP  and Equinor   OL EQNR  have all already taken similar hits  unable to escape the glut caused by associated gas coming out of new oil fields in the Permian and other shale basins 
Other impairments  notably in Australia and Singapore  took the total value of writedowns in the quarter to  2 94 billion  although the company was also able to soften the blow by booking some non cash gains on derivatives and deferred tax positions 
It would be nice to think that Shell  LON RDSa  will be able to move on after putting the writedowns behind it  Unfortunately  that looks like wishful thinking  Margins in refining and marketing  and in chemicals  all weakened against a backdrop of soft Chinese demand in the fourth quarter  and the increasingly obvious impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy leaves little scope for an improvement any time soon 
The risk is that the coronavirus  having infected the Chinese economy  will force Shell  LON RDSa  to choose between higher leverage or suspending buybacks altogether  In an extreme case  it may even be forced to resort to a scrip dividend again to avoid any further rise in debt levels  a tactic it last used to keep shareholders happy for a couple of years after the BG Group acquisition  The only safe bet would seem to be that the dividend    one of the most important for European pension funds    will continue to be paid at its current level in one form or another  At a yield of 6 86   that is no small consolation to long term investors 
Shell  LON RDSa  CEO Ben van Beurden said on Thursday that the company s intentions to complete the  25 billion program remains unchanged  But that language is intentionally and justifiably vague  With Brent now trading below  60 a barrel and with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies seemingly not in any hurry to make any further cuts to their own production  to promise anything more would be folly ",2020-01-30,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-shell-hits-the-buyback-brakes-after-big-shale-writedown-2071439,2071439
192020,413536,CVX,No  100 oil  for a long time   Chevron CEO says,news,"Oil prices may not reach  100 bbl  for a long time  thanks to the boom in U S  shale production  Chevron  CVX  0 2   CEO Michael Wirth tells CNBC from the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland 
 We ve moved from a period of time where there was a belief we were approaching peak oil  and now we re in an era of abundance   Wirth says

Responding to a central theme at the World Economic Forum of sustainable investing  including how society can transition to cleaner  sources of fuel  Wirth says  we need everything   The energy system has  always been in transition    always moved to a more reliable  affordable and cleaner state   and that will never end  ",2020-01-23,Seeking Alpha,https://invst.ly/pm02c,2066337
192021,413537,CVX,Chevron  Oil Still Has a Great Future,news,"Integrated oil giant Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  isn t ignoring the environmental impact of oil and natural gas    it realizes that global warming is a very real issue  But it also has to operate in the world as it exists today  And that means Chevron still needs to produce these carbon fuels  something it expects to be doing for many years to come  Here s why 
It s not that simple
If you are a die hard environmentalist or even a steadfast ESG investor  you might be OK with the oil industry facing hard times  After all  oil companies like Chevron produce dirty fuels that make global warming worse  But talk to the CEOs of companies like ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  and Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDS B  and you get a slightly different story  Recently Chevron s CEO  Michael Wirth  offered his thoughts on the matter 

In an interview with CNBC  Wirth was asked specifically about the future of oil  leading him to explain 

There s a long future in a growth environment and there s a long future even in an environment that begins to plateau for good economic investment to continue to provide the affordable  reliable  and ever cleaner energy the world will need 

This isn t that much different from what Exxon and Shell have been saying  Exxon  for example  is so confident in the future of oil and natural gas that it has been doubling down on its exploration efforts  Shell has been hedging its bets by dipping its toes into the electricity space  but CEO Ben van Beurden recently explained in a Reuters interview   Despite what a lot of activists say  it is entirely legitimate to invest in oil and gas because the world demands it  
With the world increasingly concerned about global warming  how can these CEOs still be so positive  The answer is simpler than you might think 
Seeing the world realistically
First off  oil giants aren t ignorant to the issue of global warming  As noted  Shell is investing in the electricity space  Exxon is experimenting with algae produced fuel as a way to help the world reduce carbon emissions  And most of the oil giants are following along with Chevron  which is working on ways to reduce the emissions it produces while drilling for oil and natural gas  In fact  it has set environmental goals that target flaring  burning off excess natural gas   methane emissions  and using renewables to power its drilling efforts  among other things  To even skeptics  oil majors are making a token effort to be good environmental stewards 
While some might think ceasing to produce oil and natural gas altogether would be the best way to achieve that  it just isn t pragmatic  For example  the International Energy Agency  IEA  states that  based on existing policy intentions and targets  oil demand isn t likely to peak until at least 2040  To be fair  growth won t be robust  with the IEA predicting that between the mid 2020s and 2040 demand growth  slows to a crawl   But demand will keep rising even if the world puts in place all of its current environmental plans  
Only that s not exactly how things are shaping up  since many countries around the world are actually falling short of their environmental goals and commitments  So unless countries get really serious about carbon reduction  the future for oil is likely to be pretty robust 
The story is even better for natural gas  which is being used as a transition fuel in the utility sector because it burns more cleanly than coal  That said  the IEA s estimates have missed the mark in the past  underestimating renewable power s growth rates  It is currently offering up another scenario in which oil and natural gas don t do nearly as well  But that scenario requires exceeding the environmental goals that exist today  Based on current success rates  this seems unlikely  
There are two big problems  The first is that the infrastructure to support oil and natural gas is in place  pervasive  and huge  You can t just replace oil and natural gas overnight  It takes time  money  and effort  and it is likely to be a multi decade endeavor  At the same time  the world s population continues to grow  largely driven by emerging markets   meaning there will be more need for energy  One form of energy is unlikely to be able to support all of the world s energy needs  meaning that even carbon based fuels will still have an important place at the table   While clean energy will likely displace oil and natural gas over time  the chance of a wholesale shift in the next couple of decades seems remote given the current set of circumstances 

CVX data by YCharts
But demand is just half the story  The other side of the equation is supply  Oil and natural gas are depleting assets  Once a barrel is pulled from the ground  it is gone forever  If all of the energy companies in the world stopped looking for new oil and natural gas to replace what they are currently producing  future production would plummet  This is why a driller s replacement rate is so important  as it shows how well a company is  replacing  what it produces  between 2013 and 2017 Chevron s replacement rate was a bit over 100   one of the best rates of its closest peers  
The big takeaway here  however  is that oil and natural gas companies need to keep drilling in order to produce the energy the world continues to demand  So the drilling business can t simply end    companies like Chevron need to keep doing what they do or the world would fall woefully short of oil and natural gas  So  at least for now  Chevron s core exploration business is supported by both supply and demand issues  While there s no way to tell what the future will bring  Chevron s Wirth appears spot on when he says there s a  long future  ahead for oil and natural gas    and the companies that produce it 
Look past the headlines
It can be hard for long term investors to get beyond Wall Street s whims  Today ESG investing is a headline grabbing investment approach that doesn t look kindly on oil and natural gas companies like Chevron  even though they remain vital cogs in the global economic machine  With a roughly 4  dividend yield  decades of annual dividend increases  and a strong balance sheet  Chevron is a solid option for dividend focused investors that are willing to take a contrarian view  The core of that view  meanwhile  is something that all of the major energy CEOs are trying to explain    and it s pretty simple  Carbon fuels aren t dead yet ",2020-01-24,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pmg6-,2067237

192049,413565,CVX,Shell Keeps Spending Constrained Amid Concern About Buybacks,news," Bloomberg     Royal Dutch Shell  AS RDSa  expects capital expenditure to be near the lower end of the  24 billion to  29 billion range in 2019  as the company keeps a lid on spending amid concern about its ability to sustain hefty shareholder returns 
The statement on fourth quarter earnings published on Friday comes after Shell s previous set of bumper profits was overshadowed by a warning about the pace of share buybacks  It s only the second time the company has issued such guidance  which was a response to criticism about the unpredictability of its financial results 
Shell also indicated that post tax impairment charges in the final three months of the year would be between  1 7 billion and  2 3 billion  based on the macroeconomic outlook  These so called  identified items  totaled  1 3 billion in the third quarter 
Last week    Chevron   Corp  NYSE CVX  said it expects to write down as much as  11 billion for assets including shale gas holdings in the U S  Natural Gas prices in the country are on course for the lowest annual average in two decades  forcing producers to consider revaluing what many of the fields are worth 
Shell warned in October that the worsening economy could slow the pace of returns to shareholders  prompting a negative reaction from investors despite the company comfortably beating even the highest analyst profit estimate for the third quarter  Friday s statement also gave a relatively downbeat assessment of the market 
 Trading and optimization performance is expected to be average  in the company s integrated gas unit  according to the statement  In the marketing business  margins are expected to be lower due to seasonal trends  and weaker compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to crude price movements  
The company s B shares slipped 0 7  to 2 257 pence as of 8 14 a m  in London 
Upstream production will range from 2 775 million to 2 825 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the fourth quarter  Shell said  Integrated gas output will be between 920 000 and 970 000 barrels of oil equivalent a day  with gas liquefaction volumes of 8 8 million to 9 4 million tons

1  Brexit bill to pass  as U K  appoints Bailey as next BoE head
After multiple rejections  the U K  House of Commons will in all probability finally approve legislation governing the U K  s withdrawal from the European Union 
The Withdrawal Agreement bill has been redrafted by Boris Johnson s government to expunge previous references it made to protecting workers  rights  a compromise it had made when it still needed the votes of Labour Party MPs to pass  The bill must still pass the House of Lords and receive Royal Assent before entering into law 
Elsewhere  the government also approved Andrew Bailey to take over from Mark Carney as Governor of the Bank of England in March next year  Bailey is a BOE lifer who currently heads the Financial Conduct Authority and who in the past has also been the institution s chief banking supervisor

President Donald Trump called for  an immediate trial  after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to say when she would send the articles of impeachment to the Senate  the next administrative step that must happen before the upper house votes on whether to remove Trump from office 
Any delay to the trial  which was notionally slated for January  would be intended to give Congressional Democrats time to put pressure on the Republican controlled Senate to allow for witnesses such as National Security Advisor John Bolton to be called  So far  that pressure does not look like it is likely to succeed

192051,413567,CVX,Saudi Arabia  Kuwait Agree to Resume Oil Output at Shared Fields,news," Bloomberg     Saudi Arabia and Kuwait agreed to resume oil production in a shared border region more than four years after halting output 
The agreement allows  the resumption of oil production from the joint fields   the Saudi energy ministry said on Twitter  The oil fields at the so called neutral zone can produce as much as 500 000 barrels a day    more than each of OPEC s three smallest members pumped last month 
A resumption is unlikely to add oil to the market because Saudi Arabia and Kuwait both adhere to production limits that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries extended into March  Even so  the agreement to re start the fields could weigh on market sentiments amid concerns about faltering growth in world demand and rising supply from the U S  and other producers 
The neutral zone  spanning more then 5 700 square kilometers  2 200 square miles   was created by a 1922 treaty between Kuwait and the fledgling Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  In the 1970s  the two Gulf Arab monarchies agreed to divide the area and incorporate each half into their respective territory while still sharing and jointly managing the zone s petroleum wealth  The region contains two main oil fields  the onshore Wafra and offshore Khafji 
The area hasn t produced anything since 2015  when Khafji was shut down after a spat between the neighbors  Wafra stopped pumping in 2014  The disagreement began over the Wafra field  which  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  operates  Saudi Arabia extended the original 60 year concession of the field  giving the U S  company rights there until 2039  Kuwait was furious over the announcement and claims Riyadh never consulted it about the extension 
Chevron  through its subsidiary Saudi Arabian Chevron Inc   remains committed to the neutral zone and is ensuring that production can resume whenever a decision is taken  Sally Jones  a company spokeswoman  said on Sunday 
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have held a number of private meetings since 2015  at one point coming close to signing an agreement before pulling back at the last minute over wording in the final documents regarding contentious sovereignty issues  They entered a fresh phase of talks earlier this year 
The fields are particularly important because U S  sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have tightened the supply of heavy  high sulfur crude    precisely the kind of oil that the neutral zone produces  U S  diplomats had been pressing both sides to reach an agreement ",2019-12-24,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/saudi-arabia-kuwait-agree-to-resume-oil-output-at-shared-fields-2047769,2047769

For a more reliable indicator of the market outlook for oil and gas companies  investors may be better advised to look at Chevron s  NYSE CVX   10 billion write down of its assets after the close on Tuesday  Most of that was caused by its Marcellus and Utica shale gas assets  which have been hit by a sustained glut in production in the region  It also wrote down the value of its Kitimat LNG project in Canada and its Big Foot oil project in the Gulf of Mexico

192064,413580,CVX,Cause of Philadelphia fire sounds alarm over aging U S  refineries,news,"By Laila Kearney
PHILADELPHIA  Reuters    How did a piece of piping installed when Richard Nixon was U S  president go without once being checked before leading to a fire that devastated the East Coast s largest and oldest oil refinery 
That s a question safety experts and activists are putting to regulators after the devastating fire at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions  PES  refinery in June  worried more disasters are waiting to happen in an industry reliant on old equipment 
Last year  U S  refiners processed nearly 17 million barrels of crude oil every day  the most in the country s history as it cashes in on a boom in shale oil 
But many have decades old infrastructure  risking outages that could cost the industry billions 
The PES refinery is one of nearly 30 in the United States that are more than a century old  while a Reuters review of over 100 operating U S  refineries that process more than 10 000 barrels of crude oil a day showed they are on average 80 years old   GRAPHIC  Aging U S  refineries   
Refineries frequently update their systems and replace old parts  but the PES fire  along with incidents in Washington state and California earlier this decade  stemmed from equipment installed in the 1970s that had been allowed to run to failure  according to U S  Chemical Safety Board  CSB  reports 
The suspected cause of the PES explosion has raised fears about future incidents because of the leeway given to refiners for inspecting parts  and because some older equipment is exempt from more stringent standards for newly installed parts 
 A lot of these refineries around the U S  are quite old now   said former CSB managing director Daniel Horowitz  who left the agency last year   That doesn t mean that every single piece of equipment dates back to the founding  but they are old and eventually all sorts of components can fail  
The June 21 Philadelphia blaze was linked to corroded piping that had not been checked since it was installed in 1973  according to the CSB s initial findings  The fire is still under investigation by the CSB and other public agencies 
It caused a fuel leak and explosions that sent toxic hydrofluoric acid  HF  into the air and hurled debris the size of a tractor trailer across a nearby river  the CSB s report said 
Shortly after the fire  PES filed for bankruptcy protection 
Failing  decades old equipment also sparked a 2010 Tesoro refinery explosion in Anacortes  Washington  that killed seven people  and a  Chevron   NYSE CVX  refinery blast in Richmond  California  two years later  according to past CSB reports 
In all three cases  the failed equipment contained metal components or designs that were no longer up to industry standards  but their use did not necessarily violate regulations  Regulators offer exemptions for older components  and do not require all pieces of plant machinery to be checked 
 That s a huge problem in this sector  that a lot of codes allow grandfathered equipment to be used even if later standards would have prohibited it   said Horowitz 
The CSB report spurred a letter from top law enforcement official in 13 states  including Pennsylvania  to the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   arguing against a proposed rollback of regulations aimed at preventing accidents involving chemicals such as HF 
GRANDFATHERED IN
Regulators overseeing U S  oil refinery safety  primarily the U S  Occupational Safety and Health Administration  OSHA  and the EPA  and code setting industry groups allow some refinery components to keep being used even if they don t meet newer standards 
The EPA and OSHA were not available for comment 
The ruptured PES pipe contained levels of nickel and copper that were permitted when installed  but not under recommendations made two decades later by the American Society for Testing and Materials  now called ASTM International  that still stand  according to the CSB  That pipe elbow corroded at a faster rate than other pieces of the system 
Oil industry group the American Petroleum Institute  API  has about 175 recommended codes that act as the refinery industry s standards  The API inspection standards for HF alkylation units used in about one third of U S  refineries do not call for every piping component to be inspected 
API spokesman Scott Lauermann said that its standard for HF units was recognized as the safest way to operate those units  having been recommended by the CSB 
PES said it monitored other parts of the piping system according to industry standards  including an examination of a metal elbow near the one that ruptured  and the testing did not show high levels of corrosion 
 PES would not have expected the piping to corrode at different rates because the elbows were installed at the same time and the construction specifications indicated that they were the same materials of construction   PES vice president of strategy and business development Mark Brandon said via email   
The CSB findings added to existing concerns by workers about maintenance at the PES refinery  which was already struggling financially  and in January cut back the scope of a planned large scale maintenance project days before it was scheduled to begin 
PES business agents and managers told union officials and major contractors the work would require between 1 500 and 1 800 contract workers  but that was slashed to just 300 contractors  according to five sources familiar with the plan  while pipes and other materials delivered to the plant were never used 
A VACUUM
Maintaining and inspecting equipment at refineries is required by the OSHA and EPA  but those agencies don t tell refineries how or when to inspect  Those details are filled in by industry standards that may not have the enforcement of law 
The CSB found that prior to the California and Washington fires  as well as the  BP   LON BP  Texas City blast in 2005 that killed 15  internal and external instructions for keeping plants operating safely were either ignored or not followed correctly 
That regulatory approach makes rules difficult to enforce and allows problems at refineries to go undiscovered  said Jeff Ruch of environmental advocacy group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility 
In the aftermath of the Washington explosion  a judge dismissed  2 4 million in fines against Tesoro because the state could not prove the refinery failed to comply with enforceable rules for inspection and maintenance of equipment 
 In terms of  are we making sure in some sort of holistic way that these refineries are safe  there s nothing there   said Ruch   There s sort of a vacuum  ",2019-11-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/cause-of-philadelphia-fire-sounds-alarm-over-aging-us-refineries-2013060,2013060

192068,413584,CVX,6 Things You Should Know From Chevron s  CVX  Q4 Earnings,opinion,"Integrated oil major Chevron   NYSE CVX   reported both quarterly and full year results on Friday  The company notched up a  earnings beat in the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by strong production from the Permian Basin 
Despite the outperformance  Chevron shares lost almost 4  on that day as the San Ramon  CA based firm s weak reserve replacement ratio and downstream weakness left investors feeling jittery  The broad energy market negativity and the sharp decline in oil prices on fears that the coronavirus outbreak in China would have a severe impact on the commodity s demand  also took its toll 
While it is true Chevron recorded weak performance across most business lines relative to the past year  it s true for all the supermajors  Moreover  larger rivals ExxonMobil   NYSE XOM   and Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   both reported profits that fell short of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates 
Chevron s share price hit a new 52 week low of  105 40 during the trading session on Feb 3  The stock now trades at  110 28  as of Feb 6  2020   only a few dollars over its lowest point in a year  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 is a profit of  7 07 per share  This puts Chevron at 15 6X forward earnings  This is a large discount to its 5 year median earnings multiple of 23 34X  In other words  the recent sell off presents investors an opportunity to buy Chevron shares at a bargain price 
Not surprisingly  the stock is still a huge draw among investors and is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   We take a closer look at the results to gain further insight  Here are some key things you need to know from Chevron s earnings update 
It operates in two segments  Upstream and Downstream  Confirming its integrated structure  the company generated 51  of its 2019 earnings from its upstream unit and 49  from its downstream unit  Chevron currently produces oil and natural gas at a 61 39 ratio 
Profit Sinks  as Upstream Earnings Plunge  Chevron suffered a massive decline in its full year EPS  from  7 74 to  1 54  In particular  the company reported  2 6 billion of earnings from its upstream business  compared with  13 3 billion in the previous year  The steep dive was on account of lower oil and gas prices  plus one time items  In the fourth quarter  the company took a  10 billion hit from non cash impairment charges on certain oil and gas assets 
Moreover  Chevron s downstream operation earnings decreased from  3 8 billion in 2018 to  2 5 billion in 2019  largely due to weak margins 
Impressive Production Growth  Led by Permian  Meanwhile  Chevron s worldwide production averaged a record 3 058 MBOE d in 2019  reflecting an increase of 4 4  from 2 930 MBOE d a year ago  In addition  the company expects to grow its output by 3  this year and at a 3 4  CAGR from 2018 until 2023 
This production growth will primarily come from Chevron s showpiece Permian Basin assets  where it has substantial holdings of 2 2 million net acres  The company realized production increase of 154 MBOE d in 2019 with Chevron targeting output of 900 000 barrels per day in 2023  During the fourth quarter  volumes from the world s hottest shale play jumped by 36  to 514 MBOE d 
Chevron s well economics in the Permian also continues to show improvement as the company has been able to achieve a 40  reduction in its development and production costs since 2015  Thanks to its successful cost control initiatives  the company has lowered its break even price for oil to an industry leading  51 per barrel 
Maintains Dividend Streak  Chevron maintained its dividend growth streak  marking the 33rd consecutive year of payout hike  The company hiked its dividend by 10 cents per share  giving investors a reason to cheer  Chevron declared a dividend of  1 29 per share  payable on Mar 10 to its shareholders as of Feb 18 
Apart from Chevron  European majors BP plc   NYSE BP   and TOTAL S A    NYSE TOT   also raised their payouts
Lower Free Cash Flow but Dividend Safety Intact  Chevron s free cash flow has gone down last year  In 2019  the company generated  27 3 billion of cash from operating activities   30 6 billion in 2018  while shelling out  14 1 billion on capital expenditures   13 8 billion in 2018  for free cash flow of  13 2 billion  a record  16 8 billion in 2018   During the same period  Chevron paid out  9 billion as cash dividends to its shareholders  In other words  despite the lower free cash flow  the company s dividend appears safe for the foreseeable future 
Using  5 16 as the dividends to be received in the next 12 months  after taking into consideration the recent hike  and based on 1 9 billion diluted shares outstanding  the total payout comes to nearly  10 billion annually  lower than the free cash flow 
Debt Down  Chevron s total debt is currently  27 billion  down from  34 5 billion a year ago  Importantly  the company s year end debt ratio was 16   improving from 18  at year end 2018 
Reserve Replacement Weakens  Over the past few years  oil and gas supermajors have struggled to replace reserves as new energy resources become less accessible  Given their large asset bases  achieving growth in the production of oil and natural gas has been a challenge for many years  In this context  Chevron s 2019 oil reserve replacement ratio  RRR  of just 44  is indicative of the company s inability to add proved reserves to its reserve base to the amount of oil and gas produced

192070,413586,CVX,Retirees Should Know These 3 Facts About Required Minimum Distributions   February 10  2020,opinion,"Failing to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the deadline results in a big tax code penalty  50   That s right  If you were supposed to take out a minimum of  4 000 and  oops   did not do so  you have the privilege of writing the IRS a check for  2 000  It s important to remember that the rules related to RMDs changed on January 1  2020
In case you re like most investors  you re probably trying to build a financial portfolio that is solid enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is known as the  accumulation phase   In this stage  your objective is to carefully invest by selecting stocks with long term potential for your retirement nest egg  For example  you might choose Chevron  CVX   which is a current top ranked dividend stock 
But there is a second phase of retirement planning that gets less attention  even though it s the more enjoyable part  It s the  distribution phase   which simply means spending the assets you ve worked so hard to accumulate 
Making plans for the distribution stage involves deciding where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll travel  your proposed leisure activities  and more decisions that will affect your spending during your golden years 
In addition to these considerations  it is essential to take into account the RMD that applies to most retirement accounts  Basically  this is an IRS requirement that you withdraw a certain amount from your qualified retirement accounts once you reach age 72 
What is the point of this mandatory withdrawal by the IRS  Not surprisingly  it s to be sure that the government gets their tax money  Without the RMD requirement  individuals could live off other income and never pay tax on retirement account gains  That cash could be left to family or friends as an inheritance and the IRS would not receive taxes from it 
Key Facts to Know About RMDs
Which types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts like IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I have to start taking distributions  For most accounts  you must take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you reach age 72  If you retire after that age  you must take your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you retire 
For each year after your required starting date  you must take your RMD by December 31  Note that you don t need to take an RMD on a Roth IRA since you covered taxes before contributing  Other varieties of Roth accounts require RMDs  But  there are approaches to avoid them   for instance  you can roll your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA 
What will happen if I neglect to take my RMD  If you don t take an RMD  or don t take a large enough distribution  you are liable for a 50  tax on the amount that was not withdrawn in time 
How much money do I have to withdraw  To calculate a specific RMD  you must divide your prior year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor based on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the math  Ann is 71 and will take her first RMD in the year following the year she turns 72  Her IRA balance toward the end of the preceding year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is the amount Ann is required to withdraw for her first RMD

192083,413599,CVX,BP Jumps 4  On Dividend Increase  Despite Falling Profits,opinion,"BP  NYSE BP  shares are pushing higher in early trade after the oil major raised its dividend despite profits declining 
Results
Q4 earnings  26  to  2 6 billion vs  2 08 billion
FY profits  21   10 billion vs  12 7 billion 2018
Dividend  2 4  to 10 50 cents per share
Fourth quarter earning declined  26  from 2018 s  3 5 billion  however  still comfortably exceeded analysts  forecasts 
Falling energy prices
Higher production has failed to offset lower oil and gas prices  The average oil price across 2018 was  71 per barrel  whereas in 2019 this was down at  64 per barrel  an almost 10  difference   even with a 3  increase in production  there is no escaping that squeeze 
The results come following disappointing numbers from Shell  LON RDSa    Exxon Mobil   NYSE XOM  and  Chevron   NYSE CVX  as falling energy prices and reducing chemical industry margins hit the sector hard 
The price of oil has been under pressure already at the start of this year and could slip lower with the coronavirus outbreak potentially having a significant impact on demand for oil  Crude oil prices dived 15  across January and are already down 1 5  in February 
Divestment
BP is in the process of a  10 billion divestment programme  to end 2020  The programme aims to reconfigure BP s portfolio of assets in order to strengthen the balance sheet following the BHP shale assets deal  Q4 Divestment totalled  800 million  in addition to  600 million from sale of 49  stake in Australian retail property portfolio 
BP impressed by saying that it was ahead of target and plans an additional  5 billion by mid 2021 
Debt
Since the BHP deal BP s debt levels have come increasingly under the spotlight  gearing has fallen from 32  in Q3 to 31  in Q4 and is expected to move to mid 20  in 2020  There had been concerns that the higher debt levels could dampen prospects of cash being returned to investors  However  this fear doesn t appear to be materialising  
Bob Dudley Steps Down
These were the last results with Bob Dudley at the helm  he leaves after 10 years a chief executive  Bernard Looney  head of exploration and production will take over  The timing seems fitting as BP looks to steers its course towards for sustainable forms of energy in a rapidly changing landscape 
Chart thoughts
BP has jumped 4  higher in early trade on Tuesday  However BP continues trading below its 200  100 on 50 sma on a bearish daily chart   
A break above resistance around 483 5p  29th Jan high  50 sma  could negate the current bearish trend  Resistance is then at 500p  high 20th Jan  and 521p  5th Nov high  







Support can be seen at around 460p a level which provided support mid December  before 452p  yesterday s low ",2020-02-04,Fiona Cincotta,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bp-jumps-4-on-dividend-increase-despite-falling-profits-200504265,200504265

192100,413616,CVX,Chevron  CVX  Q4 Earnings Beat Thanks To Permian Strength,opinion,"Chevron Corporation   NYSE CVX   reported adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share of  1 49  above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 47  The beat was driven by strong production from the Permian Basin 
However  the bottom line was below the year earlier quarter s earnings of  2 06 per share due to lower oil and natural gas price realizations 
The company  which recently raised its quarterly dividend from  1 19 to  1 29  generated revenue of  36 4 billion  The sales figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  39 8 billion and was down 14 2  year over year

Segment Performance
Upstream  Chevron s production of crude oil and natural gas remained essentially unchanged from the year earlier level at 3 078 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day MBOE d  61 5  liquids    the fifth successive quarter where volumes exceeded 3 million barrels per day 
Contribution from the shale assets in the prolific Permian Basin were offset by normal field declines  turnarounds and the impact of asset dispositions  The fourth quarter average production from the showpiece Permian Basin was 514 MBOE d  up 36  year over year   
The U S  output rose 16 3  year over year to 998 MBOE d but the company s international operations  accounting for 68  of the total  fell 6 5  to 2 080 MBOE d  For the full year 2019  Chevron s worldwide production averaged a record 3 058 MBOE d  reflecting an increase of 4 4  from 2 930 MBOE d a year ago 
Despite flat production volumes  Chevron s upstream segment incurred a massive loss of  6 7 billion  compared with the year ago profit of  3 3 billion  Apart from asset impairment charges  the nosedive to a loss could be blamed on significantly lower oil and gas realizations 
Downstream  Chevron s downstream segment achieved earnings of  672 million  21 8  lower than the profit of  859 million last year  The decline primarily underlined a fall in international refined products sales margins and planned turnaround activities 
Cash Flows  Capital Expenditure
America s No  2 energy producer behind ExxonMobil   NYSE XOM   delivered a soft cash flow performance this quarter   an important gauge for the oil and gas industry   with  5 6 billion in cash flow from operations  down from  9 1 billion a year ago  The decrease in cash flow could be attributed to falling lower price realizations in the upstream business 
The company s cash flow for the full year 2019 was  27 3 billion  down 10 8  from 2018 
In the fourth quarter  Chevron paid  2 3 billion in dividends and repurchased  1 1 billion worth of shares  For the full year 2019  the company shelled out  9 billion in dividends  and bought back  4 billion of its shares 
The Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company spent just over  6 billion in capital expenditures during the quarter  edging up from the year ago period s  5 8 billion  More than 83  of the total outlays pertained to upstream projects  In 2019  capital spending amounted to  21 billion

Its the bottom line or the  1 year chg    and note from November 1  2019 forward what it continues to tell readers 
The issue is that it fell or was steadily revised lower for 2019  which is a year that saw the S P 500 rise 31 8  
Could 2019 s robust equity returns have been a function of an easier Fed  
If rates are on hold for the rest of 2020 or at least until the Presidential election  at the very least we can see some y y growth returning to forward earnings 
Note how the forward estimate  first bullet point  increased sequentially again  That s a good sign 
Summary   Conclusion   In two weeks Q4  19 earnings are unofficially over with Walmart s report  and if we look at 2020 by quarter  the growth in S P 500 earnings is really expected to come in Q3 and Q4 of 2020  Q1 and Q2 of 2020 are seeing their expected SP 500 EPS growth rates getting pared considerably  while the back end of 2020 is holding up 
To follow up with readers on  of a few weeks ago  the expected Energy sector growth rates of 30  for Q3 and Q4  20 are still intact at 30  as of this weekend s This Week in Earnings  BUT  the data is as of Thursday night  January 30th  2020 and  Chevron   NYSE CVX  and Exxon  NYSE XOM  both reported their Q4  19 earnings Friday morning  January 31  and the stocks were down 3 8  and 4  on Friday  January 31 
Crude oil was down 15  in January  20  Let s see of those  back half  of 2020 expected 30  growth rates hold up in the next week or two

assets  This is likely to have boosted its fourth quarter 2019 results and offset lower margins from chemicals and refining businesses  Regarding the upstream business  ExxonMobil s Permian holdings and assets in Guyana are likely to have ensured steady production growth  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter output is pegged at 4 044 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day  MBOE d   indicating an increase of 1  from the year ago reported figure Chevron  Another U S  oil and gas biggie  Chevron  will also be reporting on Friday  with the Zacks Consensus Estimate pointing toward a considerable decline in earnings  A year ago  EPS came in at  2 06 and for the fourth quarter of 2019  earnings are forecasted to be  1 44  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings moved 4  south over the past 7 days  As far as earnings surprises are concerned  this San Ramon  CA based Chevron boasts an excellent record  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four reports  the average beat being 14 78   Revenues  meanwhile  are expected at  38 8 billion   down 8 4  year over year Chevron has already informed that it is set to write down billions of dollars  worth of assets during the fourth quarter  Management projects an estimated  10  11 billion write down for the period  majorly from the Appalachian natural gas assets due to the commodity s price plunge  Meanwhile  shale assets in the prolific Permian Basin will help the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company ramp up its domestic volumes  As a proof of this  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter U S  production is pegged at 958 MBOE d  indicating an increase of 11 7  from the year ago reported figure  However  Chevron s downstream unit will bear the brunt of heavy refinery turnarounds You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here Royal Dutch Shell  This European major is scheduled to report fourth quarter earnings on Thursday  The Zacks

192108,413624,CVX,Energy Stock Earnings Line up For Jan 31  CVX  XOM   IMO,opinion,The ongoing fourth quarter earnings season for the  sector witnesses a host of companies gearing up for releasing results by this weekend  Notably  extreme volatility in oil and natural gas prices might affect the industry players  fortunes this time around Before going into the details of the upcoming reports  let s take a look at the factors that are likely to have impacted the sector participants  quarterly performances Q4 Commodity Pricing ScenarioSo  how does the oil and gas price compare with the year ago valuations Per the U S  Energy Information Administration  WTI price at the opening of fourth quarter 2018 was  75 30 per barrel and exited the period at a moderate  45 41  Meanwhile  in 2019  prices were trending at  53 62 a barrel with the advent of the fourth quarter and shot to  61 06 at the end of December  reflecting an upside over a year s time in the fundamentals However  the scenario is not that rosy on the natural gas front In fourth quarter 2018  natural gas prices were  3 09 per MMBtu  Million British thermal unit  at the very outset and dipped slowly to  2 94 per MMBtu ending the December quarter of 2019 at Talking of last year s price band  the fuel was seen trading even lower at  2 28 per MMBtu beginning the month of October and struggled throughout the fourth quarter to close at  2 18 per MMBtu The divergent graph of oil and natural gas prices noticed in the fourth quarter toughens the analysts  task to conclusively predict the earnings direction for the period  Let s get a glimpse of the situation to date Picture So FarAs is the norm  oil services companies   providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells   kicked off the fourth quarter earnings season for U S  energy firms  Both sector giants Schlumberger   NYSE SLB   and Halliburton   NYSE HAL   delivered better than expected earnings  attributable to a robust international market activity  The two energy bigwigs delivered some impressive end of year numbers However  for the energy companies having already reported  total earnings are down 9 1  from the same period last year on 3 8  lower revenues with 50  positive earnings surprises and 66 7  revenue estimate beats Outlook The overall guidance for fourth quarter energy earnings looks rather bleak  The latest  indicates a plunge of 47 1  in the energy sector s fourth quarter 2019 earnings from the year ago reported figure  At the same time  the top line is likely to have declined 3  Key Releases on Jan 31Against this backdrop  let s take a glance at how three energy players are placed ahead of their respective fourth quarter results  slated for release on Jan 31  before the opening bell First  we have Chevron   NYSE CVX    which is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world  based on proved reserves Our research shows that companies with the perfect combination of a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  have high chances of beating estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  You can see  In the last reported quarter  this integrated oil and gas entity s earnings topped the consensus mark by 8 16  on the back of strong output gains  However  the bottom line fell from the year ago quarter amid lower year over year oil prices As far as positive surprises are concerned  this San Ramon  CA based U S  energy major s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters  the average being 14 78  Chevron Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Chevron is likely to deliver a positive surprise for fourth quarter as it has the favorable combination of the key ingredients of an Earnings ESP of  0 80  and a Zacks Rank  2 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  1 47 on revenues of  39 85 billion   Read more   Another U S  oil major is ExxonMobil   NYSE XOM    The company s earnings trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  the average positive surprise being 7 45  Exxon Mobil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the company this reporting cycle to be reported as it has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  3 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings of 44 cents has been revised downward in the past seven days  The projected figure suggests a slump of 70 86  from the year ago reported figure  The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at  69 10 billion  indicating a drop of 3 88  from the prior year reported figure    Read more   Lastly  there is Imperial Oil Limited   NYSE IMO    This subsidiary of ExxonMobil is one of the largest integrated oil companies of Canada  mainly engaged in oil and gas production  petroleum products refining and marketing  and chemical business  It reported third quarter earnings per share of 42 cents  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents  This underperformance is due to weaker contribution from the upstream and downstream segments As far as surprise record is concerned  the company s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters  the average negative surprise being 0 69  Imperial Oil Limited Price and EPS Surprise   Our proven model does not conclusively predict a beat for the company this earnings season as it has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank of 2 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings of 27 cents has been revised downward in the past 7 days  The expected figure  however  implies a 67 07  decrease from the year ago reported number of 82 cents  The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at  6 67 billion  hinting at a rise of 11 73  from the prior year reported figure   Read more   Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit

cost of supplies basis  excluding items   the market s preferred measure  of 74 cents  below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents and the year ago profit of  1 38  The underperformance mainly stemmed from lower oil and gas prices The Hague based Shell reported revenues of  85 1 billion  which were 19  below the fourth quarter 2018 sales of  104 6 billion Meanwhile  Shell will repurchase  1 billion worth of shares up to Apr 27 in the seventh installment of its three year  25 billion buyback program Royal Dutch Shell PLC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Operational PerformanceUpstream  Upstream segment recorded a profit of  778 million  excluding items  during the quarter  down 59  from the  1 9 billion  adjusted  achieved in the year ago period  This primarily reflects the impact of unfavorable deferred tax adjustments  lower oil and gas prices  increase in redevelopment and the decommissioning costs  plus write off of wells in Albania Shell s upstream volumes averaged 2 813 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day MBOE d  63  liquids   essentially unchanged from the year ago period as ramp ups of existing operations was offset by asset sales and normal field declines

Gas unit reported adjusted income of  2 billion  down 16  from the  2 4 billion in October December quarter of 2018  Results were primarily impacted by lower commodity prices and higher operating

was approximately 29 3   up from 20 3  a year ago  The deterioration in the group s debt ratio was partly due to the adoption of IFRS 16 accounting standard   You can see  During the quarter under

operations slumped 53  from the year earlier level  Meanwhile  the group raked in  5 4 billion in free cash flow during the fourth quarter  down from  16 7 billion a year ago  Moreover  it was not

192115,413631,CVX,Former Chevron exec seeks  500 million for post sanctions Venezuela,news,"By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON  Reuters    The former chief of  Chevron   NYSE CVX  Corp s Latin American operations is moving to raise  500 million from big financial firms to invest in Venezuela once U S  sanctions are eventually lifted  confident that political change will come and that foreign investment will be needed to boost sagging oil output 
Amos Global Energy LLC  an oil and gas firm started by former Chevron executive Ali Moshiri  begins a road show to raise funding next month  seeking five big investors to put in  100 million each  Amos Global  which includes Moshiri and two co founders  also is researching Venezuela public debt holders for another fund that would be even larger 
 We are trying to be the first to enter Venezuela when sanctions are lifted   he told Reuters in an interview on Monday  Amos Global s goal is to line up investors and manage the assets 
The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela s state run oil firm  PDVSA  in January  seeking to starve the country of oil revenue and oust President Nicolas Maduro  Many Western nations regard last year s Venezuelan election as fraudulent  while Maduro has denounced opposition leader Juan Guaido as a U S  puppet seeking to foment a coup 
Venezuela has the world s largest reserves of oil  which accounts for the bulk of the country s export revenue  but production has tumbled 
Moshiri said he understands the difficulty of raising funds when Venezuela s sovereign bonds are in default  but believes he will be able to win investors  The plan will combine a low management fee  input from investors through seats on the board  and allowing them to leave the fund after two years with a 2  penalty if sanctions remain 
Moshiri  who retired from Chevron in 2017 after nearly four decades with the oil major  oversaw exploration and production in Latin America and Africa  He launched Amos Global Energy soon afterward with Noel Avocato  a former Chevron executive  and Chris Hasty  a former banker with  Citigroup   NYSE C   Lloyds  LON LLOY  Bank and  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  
The company also is hunting for assets in Mexico and Argentina  both places where energy investments have stalled this year  Moshiri insists opportunities exist there and in Colombia  but concedes they require patience given the hurdles to foreign investment 
He is looking to farm into an existing project or take over assets in Mexico s Chicontepec Basin  an onshore field northeast of Mexico City that he compares to the U S  Eagle Ford shale field  The company has a financial partner he will not name that he said is ready to put up  500 million if Amos Global finds the right projects 
 If there s no deal  good  we re going to continue to do our research and provide consulting   Moshiri said   You learn about business by being patient  ",2019-10-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/former-chevron-exec-seeks-500-million-for-postsanctions-venezuela-2000671,2000671

this month  ExxonMobil expects a gain of  3 4  3 6 billion from the divestment of Norwegian assets  This is likely to have boosted its fourth quarter 2019 results and offset lower margins from chemicals and refining businesses  Regarding the upstream business  ExxonMobil s Permian holdings and assets in Guyana are likely to have ensured steady production growth  Consequently  the Zacks

192130,413646,CVX,Thailand welcomes Chevron s resumption of talks to resolve energy dispute,news,"By Patpicha Tanakasempipat
BANGKOK  Reuters    Thailand s energy minister on Sunday welcomed a decision by U S  energy company  Chevron   NYSE CVX  to continue negotiations rather than seek arbitration to resolve a dispute over who should pay for removing offshore oil and gas platforms 
Thailand wants Chevron to pay the full decommissioning costs  estimated by a local newspaper at around  2 5 billion  for infrastructure at the Erawan gas field  which it is due to hand over to Thai state oil firm PTT Exploration and Production Pcl in April 2022 when its concessions expire 
Reuters first reported last week that the U S  company had  temporarily suspended  a plan to seek arbitration in order to allow more time for talks with Thailand s energy ministry  but that arbitration was still a possibility  within weeks  if talks do not succeed 
Thailand s energy minister Sontirat Sontijirawong said on Sunday the Chevron s decision was a good sign that the two parties could work together to resolve the dispute and ensure a smooth handover of the gas field 
 Chevron s decision to hold off the arbitration process to continue negotiations is welcomed   energy minister Sontirat Sontijirawong said 
 I also believe that we will arrive at the best agreements while prioritizing Thailand s interests   he added 
The dispute arose in 2016 when Thailand retroactively enforced a new energy ministry regulation requiring gas field operators to pay the costs of decommissioning all assets they have installed even if they no longer operate them 
Chevron argues that under the terms of its initial contracts from 1971 it is only liable for infrastructure that is no longer deemed usable before it hands over the field to another operator 
The new law would require Chevron to pay the future costs of decommissioning all the infrastructure it has installed at the Erawan field  including still usable assets it will transfer to PTTEP free of charge 
The dispute has implications for other international energy companies such as France s Total and Japan s Mitsui   Co  which also have stakes in offshore energy concessions in the Gulf of Thailand 
Outside of the oil and gas industry  other foreign investors in Thailand were also concerned about the retroactive use of laws  and what precedent the case might set for the sanctity of their contracts ",2019-09-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/thailand-welcomes-chevrons-resumption-of-talks-to-resolve-energy-dispute-1988507,1988507

State run PDVSA and its joint ventures last month exported almost 845 000 barrels per day  bpd  of crude and refined products versus 770 000 bpd in August  the second lowest monthly figure this year  according to the data 
Higher shipments to political ally Cuba and the release of cargoes that had been stalled in Venezuela for months due to an earlier round of sanctions contributed to the latest increase

Russia s state run oil company Rosneft  MM ROSN  reduced its uptake of Venezuelan crude to about 360 000 bpd compared with more than 500 000 bpd in August  the data showed  as Rosneft chartered vessels with Venezuelan oil have sat for weeks off the coast of countries including India and Malaysia 
Crude stocks ended the month at around 38 8 million barrels  almost 3 million more than at the end of August  according to data intelligence firm Kpler  Venezuela s oil storage capacity is about 65 million barrels  but many tanks are inactive due to lack of maintenance 
CHINA  EUROPE AND CUBA
Vessels bound for China accounted for 32  of September exports  or 270 000 bpd  Europe was the second most favored destination with 19   and Cuba rose to third with 17   or almost 143 000 bpd  more than double the volume it took in previous months 
PDVSA increased exports to Cuba last month to help ease acute fuel shortages that sparked long waits at gas stations and for public transport   nL2N26G138 
The United States has been seeking to increase pressure on Maduro s administration to try to dislodge him from power after a 2018 re election that was widely considered a sham 
At least five crude cargoes on tankers chartered by U S   Chevron  Corp  N CVX  that had remained stuck in Venezuelan waters since late January were returned last month to PDVSA  Some of the vessels loaded again with exports bound for Europe  the Refinitiv data showed 
Venezuela last month imported 161 000 bpd of refined products for its own consumption and to re export  down from August s 210 000 bpd even though the country s own fuel output fell due to frequent refinery outages  Rosneft and Spain s Repsol  MC REP  were the main suppliers of the imported fuel  according to the data ",2019-10-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/venezuelan-oil-exports-rise-but-not-enough-to-drain-stocks-1990753,1990753

192142,413658,CVX,Oil Down on Stockpile Build  Saudi Worries Limit Losses,news,"Investing com   Oil prices fell on Wednesday after the first U S  inventory build in four weeks  but losses were kept in check on news that the United States was seeking to build a coalition of European and Arab partners to deter Iran after an attack on Saudi Arabia 
Crude prices also fell after President Donald Trump said he ordered the Treasury Department to  substantially increase  sanctions on Iran  showing he was still not inclined to call for a military strike against Tehran 
U S  West Texas Intermediate crude settled down  1 23  or 2   at  58 11 per barrel 
U K  Brent crude fell 36 cents  or 0 6   to  64 21 
WTI and Brent have been on a wild ride this week  surging nearly 15  each on Monday before tumbling about 6  or more in the next session  The volatility came as traders tried to come to grips with Saturday s aerial hit on Saudi Arabia s Abqaiq crude processing complex and Khurais oil field  which cut the kingdom s output by half and daily world oil supply by 5  
Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman assured the world on Tuesday the kingdom s energy industry was barely affected and that its production would be higher than pre attack levels by November 
Even so  U S  State Secretary Mike Pompeo on Wednesday described the attack as  an act of war  against the world s top oil exporter  Reuters reported 
Yemen based Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack  but the White House and Saudi officials have accused Iran instead  Tehran has flatly denied the accusation 
 This is an attack of a scale we ve just not seen before   Pompeo told reporters traveling with him before landing in the Saudi city of Jeddah for talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman 
 We also know that these are systems that the Iranians have not deployed anyplace else  that they have not deployed outside of the country  to the best of our knowledge   he said 
It is not known how successful the United States will be in building a coalition of European and Arab partners  as Pompeo suggested  Most European governments are trying to salvage a global nuclear pact they and the United States had with Iran  before Trump tore that pact up and put sanctions on Tehran s oil  resulting in hostilities since then by the Islamic Republic 
Earlier  the U S  Energy Information Administration said that oil inventories rose by 1 06 million barrels for the week ended Sept  13  compared with expectations for a drawdown of 2 5 million barrels 
Gasoline inventories rose by 780 000 barrels versus forecasts for a drop of 540 000 barrels  Distillate stockpiles increased by 440 000 barrels  compared with forecasts for a rise of 535 000 barrels 
 We have the first across the board rise in U S  inventories in four weeks   Investing com analyst Barani Krishnan said   Coming on the heels of the Saudi oil crisis  it raises the specter of all out production from here on as every producer  from Aramco to   Chevron    NYSE CVX  and beyond  is going to ramp up on the excuse that supply might fall short anyway

192149,413665,CVX,Bolton s Exit Shifts Outlook for Oil Market Roiled by Sanctions,news," Bloomberg     The firing of U S  National Security Advisor John Bolton is giving oil markets some supply comfort  with initial expectations that U S  foreign policy toward Iran and Venezuela will be less hawkish 
Brent crude oil prices fell more than 2  after President Donald J  Trump announced via Twitter that he d fired Bolton  widely held as one of his more hawkish foreign policy voices  Oil production in Iran has dropped by 40  and in Venezuela by 48  since Bolton took office in April 2018 
Trump withdrew from a nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers in the month following Bolton s appointment  That decision squeezed the OPEC producer s oil exports as its leading customers shunned purchases to avoid being subject to U S  sanctions once they were reimposed in November last year 
The U S  withdrawal also caused tensions within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  which is pursuing output curbs to prop up prices  Iran has accused fellow members including Saudi Arabia of seeking to usurp market share while its exports are under pressure  The administration has repeatedly stated its intention to reduce oil exports from Iran to zero  Earlier this year  after Bolton complained about sanctions waivers granted by the U S  to some Iranian customers  the Trump administration declined to extend the exemptions 
 The Bolton news is bearish as Bolton is a known hawk on Iran and the market is assuming that opens the door for talks with Iran   said Phil Flynn  senior market analyst at Price Futures Group Inc  Oil prices recovered a bit from the initial drop  trading almost unchanged at  62 68 at 2 p m  in New York 
At a White House news conference following the Bolton announcement  Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said they remain committed to the  maximum pressure  campaign against Iran and that they are in lockstep with Trump on the issue 
Bolton was also seen as a vocal opponent of extending waivers for U S  companies that continue to do business in Venezuela  as the administration tightens financial pressure on President Nicolas Maduro  Last month  the U S  extended waivers for  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  and several drillers doing work in that nation  where oil output has fallen from a high of 3 7 million barrels a day in 1970 to 742 000 now  The 90 day waivers currently in place are due to expire on Oct  25 
 It s possible but not likely that Bolton s departure could open the door for another extension   said David Goldwyn  a Washington based energy consultant and former U S  State Department special envoy under the Obama administration   I would probably give it a 40  chance  
A spokesman for Chevron had no immediate comment on Bolton s departure 
Not everyone believes this move will change the equation for Venezuelan waivers 
 I think the present position that the waiver s going to end in two months is probably the position that will be maintained   Russ Dallen  managing partner at consultant Caracas Capital  said in a phone interview from Miami   The wheels are grinding that way  But it s just going to depend on who steps up to handle that position now  ",2019-09-10,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/boltons-exit-shifts-outlook-for-oil-market-roiled-by-sanctions-1974882,1974882

Graduating with a geology degree from what later would become Oklahoma State University  Pickens worked for Phillips Petroleum for about three years before borrowing  2 500 and going out on his own  He and two investors formed an oil and gas firm called Petroleum Exploration Inc  The firm would later became Mesa Petroleum  which at one time  was one of the world s largest independent oil companies  with assets of more than  2 billion in 1980  according to the Texas State Historical Association  In 1996  Pickens  announced his retirement from Mesa  The move came after a long battle with dissident shareholders  who were angry at the company s mounting debts  Critics say he held bitter grudges against those he thought had crossed him  In the late 1980s  Pickens shook up corporate Japan when he tried to take over Koito Manufacturing Co Ltd  a Tokyo based automotive parts maker  He became the biggest single shareowner in the firm with a holding of 20 2   about 1  more than Toyota Motor Corp  After butting heads with corporate management and investors for some two years over the raid  a rare occurrence in Japan  he sold back his holdings  Pickens also made waves

Wednesday s Analyst Blog  Here s Why Energy M A Is Expected to Remain Healthy in 2020Mergers and acquisitions  M A  activity among upstream energy companies surged to a five year high of  96 billion in 2019  thanks to mega deals such as Occidental Petroleum s buyout of Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC  While a number of companies struck deals to increase scale and stay competitive  some transactions were driven by the need of diversification across geographical coverage Here is an overview of the four major proposed exploration and production energy deals from 2019 1     Occidental AnadarkoIn early August  Occidental completed a  57 billion  including debt  mega merger deal with Texas based upstream company Anadarko Petroleum after it prevailed in a bidding war with supermajor Chevron  At stake was Anadarko s 250 000 net acres in the fastest growing oil producing region in the world   the Permian basin spread over west Texas and New Mexico  Occidental s motive was to become the largest crude producer in the Permian Basin  where it owned maximum acreage  around 2 5 million acres  followed by Chevron  2 2 million acres  Per Occidental  the combined company boasts a production capacity of 1 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and is expected to be accretive to free cash flow within a year of the acquisition  It is also on track to generate  3 5 billion of free cash flow through  2 billion of annual cost synergies and  1 5 billion of annual capital reductions 2     BP Hilcorp EnergyIn August  BP plc  that it has signed an accord with privately held Hilcorp Energy Co  to divest all its assets in Alaska for  5 6 billion  With the deal s anticipated closure this year  subject to approvals from the state and federal bodies  the British energy giant will exit Alaskan operations after 60 long years   Precisely  the assets to be divested entails BP s entire upstream and midstream operations in Alaska  This includes the British energy giant s stake in the Prudhoe Bay   the largest oil field in North America   and the Trans Alaska Pipeline System   spreading over 800 miles and transporting oil to the Port of Valdez 3     Callon Petroleum Carrizo Oil   GasThe deal frenzy continued to sweep the U S  oil industry  bringing about a wave of consolidation in the prolific shale plays  Another energy company to join the bandwagon was Callon Petroleum Co   which  in July  announced the acquisition of Carrizo Oil   Gas  Inc  in a  3 2 billion deal  including debt   in a bid to bolster its Permian presence After months of opposition from some large shareholders  the transaction was eventually completed late last year on a revised buyout price and conditions The combined company is expected to have around 200 000 net acres in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford

and lead to significant cost reduction You can see  4     WPX Energy Felix EnergyMergers in the upstream space continued throughout the year when WPX Energy  in December that it intends to acquire Delaware Basin based Felix Energy for  2 5 billion  The purchase consideration comprises  900 million in cash and  1 6 billion in WPX Energy shares  This acquisition is in sync with the company s intention to further increase oil production  Felix Energy has nearly 1 500 gross undeveloped locations in the eastern portion of the basin  with expected production of around 60 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  Out of the total production  70  will be oil  The parties anticipate closing the transaction early in second quarter 2020 Expect More Oil Patch M A in 2020Upstream companies are currently under pressure from investors  who are no longer supporting drilling programs and expansions in the absence of strong cash flows  Investors want these companies to reduce costs  improve internal efficiencies  raise share repurchases and increase returns One of the ways to tide over the low returns and weak cash flows is consolidation  In fact  mergers are viewed as a means to build scale and minimize overhead costs  thereby creating a stronger company with improving efficiencies and financial performance As it is  a prolonged period of low oil prices has led to  survival of the fittest   Larger companies   especially those with cash to spend   are set to take advantage of this opportunity and buy quality assets at cheap valuations  The most vulnerable companies are the ones with increasing levels of debt and distresses assets Finally  with WTI crude  the domestic benchmark  bouncing back above  60 per barrel on multiple tailwinds  the investor hunger for M A deals is likely to remain strong  The flurry of such activities in recent times suggest that stronger companies are lining up to buy the weaker ones The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All Last year  it generated  24 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  77 6 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should

192153,413669,CVX,Oil prices fall but set for big weekly gain as trade dispute rhetoric eases,news,"By Noah Browning LONDON  Reuters    Oil gave back some of its recent gains on Friday  but was still headed for the biggest weekly increase since early July  boosted by a decline in U S stocks  a looming hurricane in Florida and an easing of Sino U S  trade rhetoric  Brent crude  LCOc1  was down by 15 cents  or 0 25   at  60 93 a barrel  by 0935 GMT  but was heading for a gain of more than 2  for the week  U S  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures  CLc1  fell 56 cents  or 0 99   to  56 15 a barrel  The contract is set for a gain of nearly 4  this week  Worries about a slowdown in economic growth and the impact on oil demand due to the trade war between the world s two biggest oil consumers kept a lid on price gains this week  even as falling inventories indicate a balancing market   Upside momentum should not be taken for granted  Recession fears are casting a shadow on sentiment and oil prices should keep dancing to the tune of the U S  China trade saga   said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM  On Thursday  the United States and China gave signs that they will resume trade talks  discussing the next round of in person negotiations in September ahead of a looming deadline for additional U S  tariffs   The calm is somewhat deceptive as financial markets are still making up their mind on the question of slowdown or downturn   said Norbert Ruecker of Swiss bank Julius Baer   Both growth and oil demand are set to remain lackluster and thus supplies look ample well into 2020   The approach of Hurricane Dorian toward Florida earlier raised fears that offshore U S  crude producers may suspend output if the storm passes into the Gulf of Mexico over the weekend  Dorian is heading toward landfall on the Atlantic coast of Florida over the weekend and may enter into the eastern Gulf of Mexico next week  It is forecast to strengthen and become more powerful on Sunday  the National Hurricane Center said   Chevron  Corp s  N CVX  356 440 barrel per day Pascagoula  Mississippi  oil refinery is closely monitoring the progress of Hurricane Dorian  a company spokesman said on Thursday  Last month  Hurricane Barry prompted offshore oil companies to shut as much as 74  of production  lifting U S  crude prices  before it weakened to a tropical storm  Government data on Wednesday showed U S  crude stocks dropped last week by 10 million barrels to their lowest since October as imports slowed  while gasoline and distillate stocks each fell by over 2 million barrels   But the EIA data also showed that U S  production rebounded to a weekly record of 12 5 million barrels per day  suggesting there is still plenty of supply available

192154,413670,CVX,Venezuela s Oil Woes Deepen as Chinese Contractor Halts Work,news," Bloomberg     A Chinese oil contractor halted work on an expansion project in Venezuela because it hasn t been paid  underscoring the difficulties for the Nicolas Maduro regime even at energy ventures backed by allies 
China Huanqiu Contracting and Engineering Corporation  an affiliate of government run China National Petroleum Corp   notified the Sinovensa joint venture it has suspended work to expand a crude blending facility by 57  to 165 000 barrels a day  according to a document seen by Bloomberg and a person familiar with the matter 
That s in contrast to comments from state controlled Petroleos de Venezuela SA last month announcing a second expansion to take output to 230 000 barrels a day at the project  which is jointly owned by PDVSA and CNPC    China s biggest energy company 
PDVSA declined to comment  A representative at the press office of CNPC didn t answer two calls  or immediately reply to text messages seeking comment 
The halt is another blow for Venezuela  which is increasingly reliant on Russian and Chinese oil companies to prop up an industry struggling against an economic blockade by Donald Trump s administration   Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  and four U S  oilfield service companies will stop work in the Latin American nation at the end of October unless sanctions waivers are extended  potentially affecting nearly half the drilling rigs operating in the country 
A project manager at HQC    as the Chinese contractor is known    said in a notification to Sinovensa it was owed more than  52 million in invoices dating back to 2018  and that it was suspending activities from Sept  3  The JV is a key project in Venezuela s Orinoco region that boasts the largest oil reserves on the planet and currently accounts for about half of the country s remaining production ",2019-09-06,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/venezuelas-oil-woes-deepen-as-chinese-contractor-halts-work-1971884,1971884
192158,413674,CVX,3 Oil Majors To Own When Crude Markets Are Showing Strength,opinion,"As conflict between the U S  and Iran  one of the world s top oil producers  remains a possibility  oil stocks are finally beginning to look attractive again  Oil prices spiked this week on fears that a serious rupture between the two powers will disrupt oil supplies from the Middle East  causing price inflation 
Oil extended its dramatic surge above  70 a barrel on Monday before paring some gains as the fallout after the U S  assassination of one of the Islamic Republic s most powerful generals continued  The U S  State Department warned of a  heightened risk  of missile attacks near military bases and energy facilities in Saudi Arabia 
U S  President Donald Trump repeated his threat of further attacks if Iran retaliated  Crude was last this high when Saudi production facilities were attacked in September  knocking out about 5  of global output 
As we have pointed out before  investing in a few large cap oil stocks should be a part of investors long term strategy to benefit from scenarios like the one currently evolving  That strategy didn t offer much appeal to investors last year when the large cap U S  energy stocks underperformed the broader market 
The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLE   which holds large cap U S  energy stocks  hardly budged during the past year  even as the S P 500 surged more than 25   But investing in oil stocks is a long term bet 
For investors in oil stocks  the choice to make remains very simple irrespective of the recent surge in oil prices  buy stocks of companies that are showing good financial discipline  that have the ability to generate healthy cash flows in both good and bad times and that pay higher dividends 
This approach makes even more sense given the drastic change in the dynamics of energy markets  The Middle East  for example  is losing its status as the biggest oil producer  The shale revolution has made the U S  the world s biggest producer of oil and natural gas 
Oil Supply Disruptions
In 2019 the U S  became a net exporter of crude for the first full month in at least 70 years  Production was at a record 12 9 million barrels per day at the end of November  more than Iraq  Iran  Kuwait and United Arab Emirates combined  according to Bloomberg 
If the current hostility worsens  there is a good possibility that oil might trade in a much higher range than that forecast by analysts last year  This would open up many short term opportunities for investors to make money  especially in the drillers whose balance sheets are in distress and who need prices to go much higher to break even 
But we don t find that short term approach very appealing  especially because several top analysts are skeptical about a sustained rally in oil prices  The cost of black gold may fall in the coming weeks if there is no major supply disruption as a result of the U S  Iran conflict  analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note  adding that there is limited evidence of an acceleration in global growth that could support higher prices 
In our view  buying dividend paying integrated energy producers  such as  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX   is a much better way to play oil strength  Chevron was the top performing Big Oil stock in 2019 after hiking its share buyback program 25  and dividend by 6   CEO Mike Wirth is pursuing a strategy where he is unwilling to spend big and is instead focusing more on returning capital to investors  With an annual dividend yield of 4   the producer pays  1 19 a share quarterly payout 
For those with a slightly higher appetite for taking risks and earning a dividend yield as high as 6   Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa  is your best bet  The energy giant has been leading the sector in shifting from oil into lower carbon natural gas and electricity production  It s also undertaking a  25 billion share buyback plan  which could keep its stock well supported  The producer pays  0 42 a share quarterly payout 
The London based  BP PLC   NYSE BP  is another strong name when it comes to earning higher dividends  Its current yield is 6 45   translating into a quarterly payout of  0 615 a share  That disbursement has risen just 5  since 2014  showing the cash constraints this oil giant has faced since then 
One of the main reasons BP remains cash starved is the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico  The company is still paying for that disaster and will continue to do so for a few more years  But if oil prices continue to surge  the energy giant will be in a more robust cash position than previously forecast 
Bottom Line
Investing in reliable global energy stocks that offer higher yields and stable cash flows is a much better strategy than buying volatile oil stocks whose fate is closely tied with the short term direction of oil markets ",2020-01-07,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-oil-majors-to-own-when-crude-markets-are-showing-strength-200496783,200496783

192163,413679,CVX,Cold  hard euros  Venezuela turns to European cash after U S  sanctions,news,"By Corina Pons and Mayela Armas
CARACAS  Reuters    From supermarket checkouts in the capital Caracas to electronics stores in the central city of Maracay  Venezuelans struggling with hyperinflation and a deep economic crisis are turning to a new form of payment  euros in cash 
Runaway inflation that has made even large piles of the local bolivar currency worthless   combined with the socialist government s relaxation of restrictions on the use of foreign currency   has encouraged Venezuelans to turn to dollar bills for everyday transactions in the past year 
But in the past four months  euros have also started proliferating in markets and stores in the South American country 
With the stock of dollars in circulation still far greater than euros  Venezuelan merchants tend to quote items at the same price in the European and U S  currency   ignoring the euro s higher value on international markets 
 That s just how it works here   said Oscar Ramirez  an electronics trader at the City Market shopping center in eastern Caracas  Sabana Grande neighborhood  who was quoting phones at the same price in both currencies 
The increased use of euros follows the United States imposing a series of sanctions on the OPEC nation s oil industry 
With the U S  financial system closed to state oil company PDVSA  as Washington tries to cripple the finances of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro s administration  the company has asked clients to make payments for crude exports in euros 
And with international companies increasingly hesitant to pay using traceable bank transfers for fear of being hit with U S  sanctions themselves  PDVSA has collected payment for at least two shipments of exported crude in euros cash via intermediaries  according to three oil industry sources  who asked to remain anonymous 
Reuters could not independently confirm details of PDVSA s euro transactions  Neither Venezuela s Information Ministry nor PDVSA responded to requests for comment 
The U S  dollar has traditionally been the currency used for oil deals globally  But with Washington cracking down on several major oil producing countries   including Venezuela  Russia and Iran   producers are making an effort to conduct business in other currencies 
Russian state oil company Rosneft  for example  has notified customers that future tender contracts for oil products will be denominated in euros rather than dollars 
PDVSA PAYING CONTRACTS IN EUROS CASH
The oil industry sources said that PDVSA has used euros in cash to pay suppliers and contractors in transactions that previously took place via Venezuelan bank accounts   explaining the broader circulation of European banknotes throughout the economy 
A source from a Venezuelan construction company that has done work for PDVSA  who asked to remain anonymous  said the construction company had accepted payment in euros in cash because it was the only way to charge the state firm 
The source said the construction company   which had previously been paid by PDVSA via Venezuelan bank accounts   then used the euros in cash to pay for lubricants and machine replacement parts from local suppliers 
Other branches of the Venezuelan state are also using euros  According to a source familiar with the deal  Venezuela s Social Security Institute   which supplies the public healthcare network with medicine   paid a vaccine provider in euros in cash in July  The institute did not respond to a request for comment 
LAWMAKERS CONCERNED
While the use of euros in cash in Venezuela is not illegal  opposition lawmakers are concerned that cash could be used to hide illicit money flows that would be easily traceable if payments were made electronically  said Chaim Bucaran  an opposition congressman 
 Organizations have paid for imports  medicines and food in euros   said Carlos Paparoni  another opposition lawmaker  adding that the National Assembly s finance commission was planning an investigation into the origins and uses of cash euros in Venezuela 
He said the committee had detected some private airplanes bringing in euros in cash to Venezuela  He did not provide further details and Reuters was not independently able to verify that information 
One of the oil industry sources said several companies that had accepted payment in euros in cash had been providing services to PDVSA for less than a year 
He added that the practice was limited to fields PDVSA operated on its own  rather than its joint ventures with foreign companies like U S  oil major  Chevron   N CVX  and China National Petroleum Corp  CNPC  
Chevron declined to comment  CNPC did not respond to requests for comment 
The sources declined to name the companies receiving payment in euros  but said most were small 
PDVSA has offered to pay larger  more established suppliers in euros via bank transfer  according to two of the oil industry sources  though it is not clear whether the companies accepted 
The oil industry is not the only source of the euros  The central bank has received euros in cash for the sale of some of its gold reserves  a source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters in January 
The central bank this year began giving Venezuelan financial institutions foreign exchange in cash rather than via transfer  five finance sector sources said this year ",2019-08-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/cold-hard-euros-venezuela-turns-to-european-cash-after-us-sanctions-1962109,1962109
192164,413680,CVX,California rare earths miner races to refine amid U S  China trade row,news,"By Ernest Scheyder
 Reuters    The owner of the only U S  rare earths mine is going on a hiring spree as it looks to significantly boost production  part of a strategy to build out American refining capability after China raised tariffs on the minerals amid an escalating trade war 
By next year  MP Materials aims to be the first U S  company to refine rare earths since 2015 when Molycorp Inc  the former owner of California s Mountain Pass mine  went bankrupt  executives said 
The mine has relied on China for rare earth processing  fueling national security concerns  China is the world s largest processor and producer of the 17 specialized minerals used to build weapons  consumer electronics and a range of other goods  There are no known substitutes 
GRAPHIC  Rare Earth Production   
In June  China more than doubled tariffs on U S  rare earths imports for refining to 25 percent  On Friday  Beijing said it would add an additional 10 percent on top of that tariff rate starting next month  the latest tit for tat exchange in a protracted dispute between the world s top two economies 
The Trump administration has labeled rare earths critical for national defense and ordered the Pentagon to support domestic production 
 What China has recognized is that this is a strategic industry   said James Litinsky  co chairman of MP Materials 
The company plans to boost its headcount by next year to about 400  up from about 200  and is already producing 68 percent more rare earth concentrate than under Molycorp 
But that concentrate   more than 50 000 tonnes per year   is today shipped to China for processing 
To resume refining in California  privately held MP Materials is spending  200 million to restart mothballed equipment at the mine and build a large roasting oven 
 The tariffs are very painful  but we remain profitable   Litinsky said 
After processing  rare earths need to be turned into rare earth magnets  found in precision guided missiles  smart bombs and military jets  But China controls the rare earths magnet industry  too 
Litinsky and peers are betting that by bringing rare earths refining back to the United States  it will encourage other investors to build magnets and other related parts in the country as well 
The mine originally opened in 1948 and has gone through a series of owners  including  Chevron  Corp  N CVX   before Molycorp went bankrupt 
MP Materials also plans to re open the Mountain Pass chlor alkali facility  which was built by Molycorp  Litinsky said 
The facility will recycle wastewater and produce hydrochloric acid and caustic soda to use in the rare earths separation process  saving the facility the added cost of buying the chemicals on the open market 
The company s new roaster will bake rare earth ore at high temperatures to effectively leach out the high value minerals 
 SMART PLAY  CHINA 
It s not clear if the group will be able to re start the processing equipment by next year or instead will face delays common in construction projects 
 Call me cynical  but history just shows if you look back on metals projects  most don t start when they were slated to come online   said Mark Seddon  an Argus metals analyst 
Once the refining equipment does switch online  the goal is to use that material on site to make more than 5 000 tonnes per year of neodymium and praseodymium  NdPr   two of the 17 types of rare earths that are used to make magnets 
Friday s tariff news means that MP Materials will need to find more customers outside of China once it restarts its California processor  pitting it against Australia s  Lynas Corp   AX LYC   the largest rare earths miner and processor outside of China 
Lynas CEO Amanda Lacaze has vowed not to cede her company s market share outside of China 
 This will put MP Materials in direct competition with Lynas  Smart play  China   said Ryan Castilloux  managing director with Adamas Intelligence 
MP Materials is majority controlled by Chicago hedge fund JHL Capital Group and New York s QVT Financial LP  with China s Shenghe Resources Holding Co  SS 600392  holding a 9 9 percent stake 
The group bought the mine out of bankruptcy in 2017 for  20 5 million  a far cry from billions that Molycorp had invested in the facility over the years 
Litinsky says that despite the Shenghe stake  China has no control over Mountain Pass or where its products will go

192168,413684,CVX,Can Chevron  CVX  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Chevron  CVX   which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   International industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This oil company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 19 31  
For the most recent quarter  Chevron was expected to post earnings of  1 47 per share  but it reported  1 59 per share instead  representing a surprise of 8 16   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 74 per share  while it actually produced  2 27 per share  a surprise of 30 46  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Chevron  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Chevron currently has an Earnings ESP of  4 84   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 31  2020 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-chevron-cvx-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200496330,200496330

192180,413696,CVX,Trump Imposes New Curbs on Venezuela in Bid to Pressure Maduro,news," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump imposed further sanctions on Venezuela  freezing the government s assets in the U S  and adding immigration restrictions in a move aimed at stepping up pressure on the regime of Nicolas Maduro 
Property belonging to the Venezuelan government  may not be transferred  paid  exported  withdrawn  or otherwise dealt in   Trump said in an executive order released late Monday by the White House  The U S  will also block entry into the U S  by any Venezuelan citizen determined to have assisted or acted on Maduro s behalf 
Together  the moves put Venezuela on the same footing as countries like North Korea and Iran that the U S  has sought to isolate from the rest of the world  and threaten nearly any company or person who deals with the country with exile from the international financial system 
While the new order is sweeping in scope  it s unclear whether the new measures will have a significant impact since the vast majority of the Venezuelan government s income derives from oil and gold     two areas where Maduro s regime already faces heavy sanctions 
A spokesman for the White House National Security Council didn t respond to a request for comment about whether companies like  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX     which was just granted a three month waiver allowing it to continue producing oil and gas in the country    would be impacted by Trump s latest move 
The order follows months of unsuccessful efforts to pressure Maduro into leaving office  Those include the U S  recognition of Juan Guaido  the leader of Venezuela s national assembly  as the country s legitimate leader  and the imposition of sanctions on more than 100 Venezuelan individuals and entities including the state run oil company  Petroleos de Venezuela SA 
Last week  Trump told reporters he was considering a blockade or quarantine of Venezuela  And White House officials have warned that Maduro had only a short window to voluntarily leave power or face stricter measures 
Trump s move comes as his national security adviser  John Bolton  is set to appear at a conference Tuesday in Lima of nations that have recognized Guido as Venezuela s rightful leader  U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross  who s also expected to attend the conference in Peru  last week outlined plans to rebuild Venezuela s financial institutions and infrastructure 
 Venezuela will continue to deteriorate until the internationally recognized government of Juan Guaido implements needed economic  political and social reforms   Ross said in a speech to Latin American business executives in Brasilia 
More than 50 countries including the U S  have recognized Guaido as Venezuela s interim president following Maduro s 2018 re election  which was tainted by high voter abstention and claims of fraud 
The threat of sanctions from the U S  will likely deter many individuals and companies from doing business with the Venezuelan government going forward  Yet it s unclear whether countries with closer relations with Caracas    including China and Russia    will follow suit  potentially dulling the full impact of the new measures on the Venezuelan government 
Francisco Rodriguez  Torino Capital chief economist  said the order essentially formalized a  a de facto ban on transactions between U S  persons and the Venezuelan government   Most Venezuelan assets outside the country  he said  had already been seized by Guaido s allies 
Still  he said  the order could make financial institutions even more wary of doing business in Venezuela and stir concerns about secondary sections with implications for the energy market 
 If the U S  effectively levies the threat of secondary sanctions on oil sales to India  that could lead Venezuela to lose one of its two most important remaining oil markets   Rodriguez said 
The new restrictions announced Monday contain some humanitarian exemptions  The measures will permit transactions that provide the Venezuelan people with  articles such as food  clothing  and medicine intended to be used to relieve human suffering   according to the executive order 
Earlier Monday  Bolton said Maduro s government is feeling the pressure of U S  sanctions  and expressed optimism about prospects for a change in government that will make way for new elections  The U S  is opposed to elections while Maduro remains in power  he said ",2019-08-06,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/trump-imposes-new-curbs-on-venezuela-in-bid-to-pressure-maduro-1946533,1946533
192181,413697,CVX,U S  ready to target other countries for supporting Venezuela s Maduro,news,"By Mitra Taj
LIMA  Reuters    U S  national security adviser John Bolton on Tuesday said Washington was ready to impose sanctions on any international company doing business with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro  a sharp escalation of U S  pressure on the leftist leader 
Bolton  addressing a summit on Venezuela in the Peruvian capital Lima  emphasized that tougher international action was needed to speed up a transition of power in the country  where more than four million Venezuelans have fled economic collapse 
 We are sending a signal to third parties that want to do business with the Maduro regime  proceed with extreme caution   Bolton said 
His speech came a day after U S  President Donald Trump signed an executive order that freezes the assets of the Venezuelan government and bans any transactions with it  an act that could ensnare its dealings with Russia and China as well as with Western companies 
Bolton  one of the Trump administration s most influential hawks on Venezuela  told reporters the move forces companies around the world to choose whether to risk access to the United States and its financial system for business with Maduro 
Asked by a reporter how Venezuela would respond to the executive order  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said   I m going to paraphrase Donald Trump     All options are on the table  
Venezuela s U N  Ambassador Samuel Moncada asked U N  Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the Security Council on Tuesday to intervene 
 This is an act of war by the United States   Moncada told reporters   Venezuela is not a threat to anyone and the United States is fabricating this aggression just to take the oil  
The 15 member U N  Security Council will be unable to take any action as the United States is one of the body s five veto powers  along with Russia  China  Britain and France 
It was the first U S  asset freeze against an entire government in the Western Hemisphere in more than 30 years  But it was also a reminder that successive rounds of U S  sanctions have so far failed to peel away the crucial support of Venezuela s military for Maduro  who took office in 2013 following the death of his political mentor President Hugo Chavez 
Continuing the state controls started under Chavez  Maduro has overseen one of the worst economic collapses in recent world history  leaving his nation of 30 million people with severe shortages of food and medicine despite sitting on the world s largest oil reserves 
In private  Bolton had told Peruvian officials the measure would have the effect of about tripling current sanctions related to Venezuela  a Peruvian government source said  speaking on condition of anonymity 
The executive order stopped short  however  of a full U S  trade embargo of the kind imposed on Cuba  experts said  by excluding Venezuela s still sizeable private sector 
The order maintains some exemptions for companies that do business with state oil company PDVSA  PDVSA UL   and licenses published on Tuesday reiterated that companies like  Chevron   NYSE CVX  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  can continue to do business with PDVSA in Venezuela through Oct  25 
Some experts said the move could lead to pushback from other countries  and would require a lot of time and money to prove foreign companies are undermining sanctions 
 How much is the U S  government willing to spend in diplomatic capital in economic costs in the United States  in order to further its Venezuela policy  said David Murray of the Washington based firm Financial Integrity Network  an expert on sanctions compliance 
RUSSIA   ECONOMIC TERROR 
Most Western and Latin American democracies accuse Maduro of rigging elections last year and are calling for him to step down so the country can hold a fresh presidential ballot 
The summit  organized by Peru  a regional leader on demanding democratic reforms in Venezuela  had aimed to build support for new elections with Maduro s allies  Yet Russia  China  Cuba  Turkey  Bolivia and Iran all boycotted the summit 
Russia s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that Washington s asset freeze was illegal and amounted to  economic terror   the RIA news agency reported 
The order also could inflame the U S  China trade war if it hits Beijing hard  with Venezuela owing China oil deliveries as repayment for loans through 2021  said Fernando Cutz  a former top aide to Trump on the National Security Council 
Bolton warned Russia against doubling down on its support for Caracas  and urged China to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country s legitimate leader if it wanted to recoup debt owed by Caracas  since a new government in Venezuela might not want to honor agreements made with countries that helped Maduro hang onto power 
Bolton said Washington had taken steps to ensure the sanctions did not hurt Guaido and his allies  nor prevent access to humanitarian goods 
Trump s Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also spoke to the Lima summit  promising U S  support and cooperation to help Venezuela rebuild its oil sector  institutions and economy once Maduro leaves office  without giving details 




The plan has a goal of reversing Venezuela s decline in oil production within a year  and calls for a long term deal with the International Monetary Fund  Ross said ",2019-08-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/bolton-says-time-to-act-against-venezuelas-maduro-after-us-freezes-assets-1946833,1946833
192182,413698,CVX,Chevron Says Future Venezuela Events May Have Significant Impact,news," Bloomberg     The last major U S  oil producer in Venezuela is warning that developments in the crisis torn South American nation could hurt its earnings 
 Future events related to the company s activities in Venezuela may result in significant impacts on the company s results of operation in future periods    Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  said Wednesday in its latest 10 Q filing with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission 
The language has evolved from the company s previous quarterly filing  when it said developments in the country could lead to  increased business disruption and volatility in the associated financial results  
Chevron puts the carrying value of its investments in the country at about  2 7 billion  It recognized  21 million in losses from its share of net income from Venezuelan equity affiliates in the first half of the year 
Last month the company won a reprieve from the U S  government sanctions  securing a 90 day waiver from the U S  Treasury Department that allows it to continue operating in Venezuela  as did four American oil service companies   But most other government agencies involved in the deliberations opposed any extension  and it s unclear whether Chevron will get another waiver once the current one expires 
Chevron said last week that second quarter net production of synthetic oil from its Venezuela affiliate was zero  compared with 24 000 barrels a day a year earlier  Net oil equivalent production in Venezuela during the quarter averaged 34 000 barrels  according to Wednesday s filing ",2019-08-07,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/chevron-says-future-venezuela-events-may-have-significant-impact-1948204,1948204

192192,413708,CVX,The Energy Report  Conflicting Factors Moving Oil Prices,opinion,"Crazy  conflicting factors are moving oil prices  It seemed yesterday that all the oil market cared about was the prospects of a U S  tariff delay on China  Oil does not care about the impeachment fraud nor did it care that the Democrats finally got off their chairs to approve the USMCA  Don t call it the new NAFTA please  They did not care that The Energy Information Administration  Short Term Energy Outlook  raised oil demand  and yet once again  lowered U S  oil production expectations  Then you have the Saudi IPO show as well as reports that   Chevron   NYSE CVX  is taking a 10 billion dollar charge on shale fields that have lost true value   
Oil traders want to know whether they can expect a tariff waiver on China  Traders know that China s already record oil demand growth will go even higher if those tariffs get delayed  Oil rallied on reports out of China that seemed to suggest that a delay would happen  but White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow was not so sure 
Larry  as we all know  has a way with words  Oil sold off after Kudlow put cold water on those reports   The reality is those tariffs are still on the table  the Dec  15 tariffs  and the president has indicated if the short strokes remaining in negotiations do not pan out to his liking than those tariffs could go back into place  So  they could not  but they also could  There is no definitive decision on that yet  Kudlow said  
Oil prices also have to grapple with strange supply data form the American Petroleum Institute  API  on a short term basis  Traders will have to weigh that against a comprehensive longer term outlook from the Energy Information Administration  EIA  in their December  Short Term Energy Outlook   along with their release of the official weekly petroleum status report 
The API once again was a head scratcher  The API reported a surprise 1 41 million barrel crude oil increase even though they reported that supply in the Cushing Oklahoma delivery point fell by a substantial 3 53 million barrels   At the same time  the API reported that everyone walked to work  Ok  they maybe stayed home because of snowstorms  Whatever  they reported a very large  massive if you will  4 92 million barrel increase in gasoline supply  That makes five gasoline builds in a row  Even distillates showed an impressive bearish increase of 3 324 million barrels  Still  the supply of distillates is well below the five year average 
The EIA in their Short Term Energy Outlook continued its tradition of lowering U S  oil production forecasts  They also raised demand forecasts  as well   They acknowledge that the dropping rig counts are part of it  The EIA expects U S  crude oil production to average 13 2 million b d in 2020  an increase of 0 9 million b d from the 2019 level  Expected 2020 growth is slower than 2018 growth of 1 6 million b d and 2019 growth of 1 3 million b d  Slowing crude oil production growth results from a decline in drilling rigs over the past year that EIA expects to continue into 2020  Despite the decline in rigs  EIA forecasts production will continue to grow as rig efficiency and well level productivity increase  offsetting the decline in the number of rigs 
They also said that EIA data shows that the United States exported 90 000 b d more total crude oil and petroleum products in September than it imported  This is the first month recorded in U S  data that the United States exported more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported  U S  imports and exports records of crude oil and petroleum products started on an annual basis in 1949 and on a monthly basis in 1973  EIA expects total crude oil and petroleum net exports to average 570 000 b d in 2020 compared with average net imports of 490 000 b d in 2019 
Beginning on January 1  2020  the International Maritime Organization  IMO  is set to enact Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships  MARPOL Convention   which lowers the maximum sulfur content of marine fuel oil used in ocean going vessels from 3 5  of weight to 0 5   EIA expects that starting in the fourth quarter of 2019  this regulation will encourage global refiners to increase refinery runs and maximize upgrading of high sulfur heavy fuel oil into low sulfur distillate fuel to create compliant bunker fuels  EIA forecasts that U S  refinery runs will rise by 3  from 2019 to a record level of 17 5 million b d in 2020  resulting in refinery utilization rates that average 93  in 2020 
EIA expects one of the most significant effects of the regulation to be on diesel wholesale margins  which rise from an average of 45 cents per gallon  gal  in 2019 to a forecasted peak of 61 cents gal in the first quarter of 2020 and an average of 57 cents gal in 2020 
The launch on the Saudi IPO is so far  so good  Shares of  Saudi Aramco   SE 2222  increased by the 10  daily limit of the Riyadh exchange  giving it a valuation of  1 88 trillion as local money rushes to buy shares  Foreign investors  with exception of UAE and Kuwait  had been completely absent  I wonder how it will fair in the real world 
The Wall Street Journal reports that Chevron Corp is writing down the value of its assets by more than  10 billion  a concession that in an age of oil and gas overabundance  some will not be profitable anytime soon 
In the largest energy industry write down in years  Chevron  CVX  said Tuesday that it was cutting the value of a number of properties  notably its U S  shale holdings in Appalachia  by a combined  10 billion to  11 billion   Chevron   NYSE CVX  is also restructuring its operations to focus on fewer prospects in the face of persistently low natural gas prices  and will explore sales of some assets  The second largest U S  oil company lowered its forecast for future commodity prices and said that as a result  it was reducing the value of production from one of its offshore oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico  called Big Foot  It also lowered the value of a planned facility to export liquefied natural gas from Canada 
Chevron Corp Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview that the company had performed well in a difficult market but wanted to focus on its most promising future prospects  including an expansion of shale oil drilling in Texas   We have to make the tough choices to high grade our portfolio and invest in the highest return projects in the world we see ahead of us  and that s a different world than the one that lies behind us   Mr  Wirth said  Chevron s shares closed up less than a percentage point at  117 90 prior to the announcement Tuesday 
The sobering reappraisal by one of the world s largest and best performing oil companies is likely to ripple through the oil and gas industry  forcing others to publicly reassess the value of their holdings in the face of a global supply glut and growing investor concerns about the long term future of fossil fuels 
Particular pressure is falling on shale producers  especially those focused on natural gas in places like Pennsylvania  which are struggling with historically low U S  prices caused by oversupply ",2019-12-11,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-conflicting-factors-moving-oil-prices-200491768,200491768
192193,413709,CVX,Chevron s Cutbacks A Sign Of The Times For Natural Gas Longs,opinion,"The midweek announcement by  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX  sliced like a scythe across the heart of the natural gas industry  underscoring the idiom   It is what it is  
With shale fields turning out more gas than ever each day and burn rates for heating proving dismal from December weather that still felt at times like September  Chevron ripped into the soul of those still betting on a turnaround in gas prices 
Announcing one of the largest energy industry write downs in years  Chevron said it will reduce funding to various gas related opportunities  including Appalachian shale  Kitimat LNG  to save some  10 billion to  11 billion  It will also lower the value of a planned facility to export liquefied natural gas from Canada 
Chevron Dumps NatGas Assets For Shale Oil
Chevron Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth said the decision will make  the best use of our capital   investing in our most advantaged assets   Natural gas won t be one of those assets for sure 
Despite Wirth s remarks prophesying deeper gloom for the gas business  the front month natural gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange s Henry Hub didn t really have a meltdown Wednesday   
The January gas delivery contract on Henry Hub settled nearly flat  at  2 26 per million metric British thermal units after a 3 cent  or 1 4   rally the previous session  Just on Friday  January gas fell to a near four month low of  2 15 per mmBtu 
Gas Market Takes News In Stride Amid Bets For Higher Draw
Wednesday s market was supported on the lower end by expectations that last week s relatively colder weather and higher burn rates of gas for heating could have resulted in a drawdown of 76 billion cubic feet from gas storage 
That s the bet on the storage data due from the Energy Information Administration at 10 30 AM ET today and if correct  it would be four times more than 19 billion cubic feet draw from the previous week 
The heavier drawdown likely came as last week s temperatures were closer to normal for this time of year  
HDDs Hit 155 Last Week   Near Normal 
According to weather models  there where 155 heating degree days  HDDs  versus a 30 year average of 162 HDDs for the period  HDDs measure the number of degrees a day s average temperature is below 65 Fahrenheit  18 Celsius  and are used to estimate demand to heat homes and businesses 
Drawdown expectations aside  the lack of a market selloff on the Chevron story on Wednesday might be due to some gas longs thinking the company s cutbacks might be good after all in bringing gas production down in the longer run  Good riddance  as some would say  
Yet  as Phil Flynn  analyst at Chicago s Price Futures Group brokerage noted  Chevron s decision was  a sobering reappraisal by one of the world s largest and best performing oil companies  of the state of the natural gas business  The decision could be  forcing others to publicly reassess the value of their holdings in the face of a global supply glut  in gas  Flynn noted 
And while Wirth made it clear that the company was doubling down on its shale oil investments   that s where the savings from gas will go   Chevron s decision will send larger ripples across the energy industry   growing investor concerns about the long term future of fossil fuels   Flynn cautioned 
NatGas Is The Weakest Link Now In Energy Space
For now though  natural gas is the weakest link across the energy investing space with weeks of unseasonably mild weather leaving gas in storage at an estimated 3 515 trillion cubic feet   some 20  higher than year ago levels  
U S  gas production has been at a roaring record this year  averaging over 92 billion cubic feet per day  up 10  growth from 2018 
Dan Myers  analyst at Houston based gas risk consultancy Gelber   Associates  stresses that this week s modest dips in gas prices after Friday s selloff  is still not exactly a vote of bullishness for the heart of winter  
Mixed Weather Readings Complicating Market Positioning
Compounding the weakness in gas now were contrasting reads on the weather  rarely have analysts been at so much of disagreement over when it will blow hot or cold  resulting in confusion for investors  traders and their headline reading algorithms 
Myers says he expects December s variable weather patterns to roll on with warmer temperatures this weekend  before the onset of cooler weather models in a 11 15 day period 
He adds 

 A blast of cold  stormy weather into the East has boosted heating demand and sent spot prices at Transco Zone 6 NY and other Northeastern hubs spiking down 50  for daily gas flows  


 However  this short term increase and whatever support it brought to futures will be short lived as demand eases after tomorrow before another cold shot early next week  

But Dominick Chirichella of the Energy Management Institute in New York instead expects most of the United States to be unseasonably warm for the second half of December   a factor that he says which will have a negative impact on gas driven heating demand  
Adds Chirichella 
 If the actual temperatures are in sync with the latest forecasts  supply will remain ample as inventory withdrawals will be below normal for this time of the year  ",2019-12-12,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chevrons-cutbacks-a-sign-of-the-times-for-natural-gas-longs-200492021,200492021

192195,413711,CVX,Enterprise Products in deal with Chevron to develop crude oil port,news," Reuters     Enterprise Products Partners LP   N EPD  signed long term agreements with a  Chevron  Corp  N CVX  unit to develop its Sea Port Oil Terminal in the Gulf of Mexico  the companies said in a statement on Tuesday 
Enterprise s offshore crude oil terminal is one of at least eight projects proposed off the Texas and Louisiana coasts to export oil from the region s shale fields 
It would compete with projects proposed by commodities trader Trafigura Ltd  private equity firm  Carlyle Group   O CG   and pipeline operators Magellan Midstream Partners  N MMP   Tallgrass Energy LP  N TGE   and Phillips 66  N PSX  
The companies hope to take advantage of rising shale production from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico  especially when another 2 3 million barrels per day of shale is expected to land at the U S  Gulf Coast in the next year as new pipelines begin operation 
Enterprise signed the deals with Chevron U S A  Inc  CUSA  and it aims to build the export terminal at a site about 40 miles  64 km  off the coast of Houston and connect it to its existing crude pipelines  Up to two very large crude carriers  VLCCs  could moor at the site and load up to 2 million barrels per day 
The facility would connect to an onshore tank farm able to hold up to 4 8 million barrels of crude oil  according to its federal permit application 
The company said construction of the project is subject to the required approvals and licenses from the federal Maritime Administration  which is currently reviewing the application

192204,413720,CVX,Big Oil s Struggles Likely To Continue In 2020 After A Dead 2019,opinion,"2019 was without doubt a dead year for some of the largest oil and gas producers  Their share prices struggled to break out of a sluggish cycle  triggered by oversupply and concerns about potential recession as the U S  and China became embroiled in a bitter trade war 
The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLE   which holds large cap U S  energy stocks  has massively underperformed the S P 500 Index this year  rising just one percent when the benchmark rose close to 25  
Unfortunately  the outlook for oil and gas companies remains as uncertain in 2020 as it was last year  The sharp rise of U S  shale oil and gas  coupled with some signs of an economic slowdown in the world s major oil consuming nations and the continuing U S  China trade dispute  have dampened the chances of a sharp recovery in oil prices 
This scenario  if it continues to play out in 2020  means investing in oil stocks won t be a bet worth taking as the risks to further downward pressure on oil prices will remain elevated  For investors in oil stocks  the choice to make remains very simple  continue to buy stocks which pay higher dividends and where companies are showing the financial discipline to ride through a sustained weakness in oil prices 
This approach certainly makes sense  especially when the U S  Federal Reserve is firmly on the sidelines and ready to cut interest rates if the economy warrants such a move  One bright spot for oil bulls that some analysts are highlighting is that U S  crude has surprisingly traded between a  50  60 a barrel range in the past six months and is on pace for its best year since 2016 
A Sweet Spot
For them  this range represents a sweet spot for both producers and consumers where the large integrated oil firms can generate strong cash flows  without pinching consumers too hard 
Net bets on higher U S  crude prices by hedge funds and other speculative investors rose to their highest level in two months during the week ended Nov  26  according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data  The ratio of bullish bets to bets on lower prices is nearly 6 1  well below April s peaks but still much higher than it was in mid October 
Amid these conflicting signs about the oil market s supply and demand  we continue to recommend buying dividend paying energy stocks  The intergrated energy producers  such as  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX  have shown many times that they can sustain a prolonged downturn much better and can still support their dividends 
Chevron was the best performing Big Oil stock in 2019 after hiking its share buyback program 25  and dividend by 6   CEO Mike Wirth is pursuing a strategy where he is unwilling to spend big  and is instead focusing more on returning capital to investors  With an annual dividend yield of 4   the producer pays  1 19 a share quarterly payout 
For those with a slightly higher appetite for taking risks and earning a dividend yield as high as 7   Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa  is your best bet  The energy giant has been leading the sector in shifting from oil into lower carbon natural gas and electricity production  It s also undertaking a  25 billion share buyback plan  which could keep its stock well supported  The producer pays  0 94 a share quarterly payout 
Bottom Line
Investors may not see a firm recovery in global oil prices in 2020  a situation that could keep share prices of oil companies depressed  Still  investing in stocks that offer higher yields and stable cash flows makes sense if you are a long term investor  focusing on the dividend income ",2019-12-05,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-oils-struggles-likely-to-continue-in-2020-after-a-dead-2019-200490179,200490179

192207,413723,CVX,Venezuela s Guaido pledges to protect Chevron assets if Trump does not renew license,news,"By Luc Cohen
CARACAS  Reuters    Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido said on Tuesday he would seek to protect  Chevron  Corp s  N CVX  assets in the country if the United States does not renew a license allowing the company to operate despite sanctions on the OPEC nation s oil sector 
The Trump administration slapped sanctions on state oil company PDVSA  PDVSA UL  in January as part of a bid to cut off cash flow to socialist President Nicolas Maduro and pressure him to leave power  A license allowing Chevron to keep operating its four joint ventures with PDVSA expires on July 27 
Guaido  the head of the opposition controlled National Assembly  in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival presidency  arguing Maduro s 2018 re election was illegitimate 
In a decree published by his office  he said a possible decision not to extend the license  constitutes an event of force majeure  that could nonetheless  allow the illegitimate regime of Nicolas Maduro to take control of or expropriate the company s assets  
Once the sanctions are lifted  an event that presumably would not happen unless Maduro left power   we will adopt all the measures that will allow Chevron Corporation and its affiliates in Venezuela to restart activities   the decree said 
Guaido has been recognized as the rightful leader by most Western countries including the United States  but he would have no ability to enforce the decree while Maduro remains in power 
The move comes as industry observers have speculated that Maduro could transfer control of Chevron s assets  which include the Petropiar joint venture and crude upgrader in the extra heavy Orinoco oil belt  to state owned companies from Russia or China  which have continued to recognize Maduro 
Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela s oil or information ministries immediately responded to a request for comment  In a statement  Chevron declined to comment and said it was focused on ensuring its employees  safety and  to conduct business in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  
Venezuelan authorities have not commented directly on what they would do if Chevron s license is not extended  But in April  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza praised Russia s presence in the Orinoco belt and said that  companies that leave the oil belt will be substituted by companies of equal quality from Venezuela s allies  
Earlier this month  White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said a possible renewal of the license was  under discussion  
Chevron s minority stakes in the Petropiar and Petroindependencia joint ventures in the Orinoco belt  as well as the Petroboscan and Petroindependiente joint ventures in western Venezuela  yielded net crude production of 44 000 barrels per day  bpd  for the company in 2018

192208,413724,CVX,Trump administration renews Chevron license in Venezuela for three months,news,"By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Trump administration on Friday renewed  Chevron  Corp s  N CVX  license for three months to drill for oil in Venezuela despite sanctions  a compromise between officials seeking maximum pressure to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro and those favoring a longer renewal for the company   The Treasury Department renewed the license through Oct  25 for Chevron  the last U S  oil company operating in OPEC member Venezuela   In January  the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela s state run oil company PDVSA in an effort to oust Maduro  But it issued Chevron  which has been in Venezuela for nearly 100 years  a six month license to operate   Washington supports opposition leader Juan Guaido  head of the National Assembly  The sanctions on PDVSA have cost Maduro s government billions of dollars in oil assets   A senior Trump administration official said most U S  agencies had argued against any renewal of the license  and the Treasury Department had pressed for a full six month renewal   Ultimately what came about was a compromise position   amid concerns from President Donald Trump about staying tough on Maduro  the official said  Chevron has four joint ventures with PDVSA that produce the equivalent of about 200 000 barrels per day of oil  and its stake in the ventures recently produced about 40 000 bpd  Chevron has about 8 000 employees  contractors and direct suppliers involved in the ventures   Our operations in Venezuela continue in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations   Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said in a release   NO CRUTCH FOR MADURO The Treasury Department also renewed licenses for three months for oil field service companies  Halliburton Co   N HAL   Schlumberger  N SLB   GE s Baker Hughes  N BHGE  and Weatherford International   All have largely halted operations in Venezuela because of the instability   Tweaking the language from the original license  the department said the renewals were granted for  maintenance of operations  in Venezuela  showing companies were not allowed to expand their local operations   We want to make sure we re giving them an opportunity to maintain a foothold but we don t want them to become Maduro s crutch   the senior official said  The three month period signals that any further extensions after late October will be harder for companies to come by  the official said   An analyst said U S  presidential politics could make it harder to get renewals going forward   As we got closer to the 2020 presidential election  I see the Trump administration wanting to get tougher   said Joe McMonigle  senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye in Washington and an Energy Department official under former President George W  Bush  Some administration officials believe having a U S  company in Venezuela would be an asset after any ouster of Maduro  a beachhead to aid recovery of Venezuela s oil dependent economy  Other officials  including national security adviser John Bolton favored letting Chevron s license expire in hopes it would dent energy production and tighten the noose on Maduro s leadership  A U S  State Department spokesman said Washington  will continue to take appropriate action against Maduro and those aligned with him

192221,413737,CVX,Chevron Seeks All Electric Canada LNG Plant to Cut Emissions,news," Bloomberg      Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  is seeking approval to modify its plans for a liquefied natural gas export facility on Canada s Pacific Coast to an all electric design that it says will result in the lowest greenhouse gas emissions per ton of LNG of any large project in the world 
Chevron and its partner Woodside Petroleum Ltd  earlier this year had announced they d applied to expand the capacity of their LNG project in Kitimat  British Columbia  by as much as 80  to 18 million metric tons a year 
That triggered a new federal screening of the project that s expected to  commence shortly   according to a July 8 letter filed by Chevron to the provincial environmental assessment office  As part of the fresh round of approvals sought  the project is proposing to become an  all electric plant  powered by hydroelectricity  allowing expanded capacity without the corresponding increase in emissions of a traditional LNG facility  the letter said 
LNG is created by cooling gas to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit  minus 127 degrees Celsius  in an energy intensive process typically powered by burning natural gas  Kitimat LNG instead proposes electric motor drives totaling 700 megawatts to run all liquefaction  utility compressors  pumps and fans with hydro power bought from the provincial utility  according to its revised project description dated July 8  It will have backup diesel power generators on site for emergencies 
The proposed plant  will achieve the lowest emissions intensity of any large scale LNG facility in the world   according to the project description  Kitimat LNG will produce less than 0 1 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent for every ton of LNG compared with a global average of more than 0 3 ton of CO2 equivalent  according to the document 
All electric LNG plants are still uncommon  according to Alex Munton  principal analyst for Americas LNG at Wood Mackenzie in Houston  The only large scale  electric drive LNG plant under construction in North America is Freeport LNG in Texas  he said 
Kitimat LNG s decision to go with an electric design may increase the project s costs   If you re installing turbines that are gas fired and your fuel is very low cost gas    and the outlook for Canadian gas prices if very low long term    then it s difficult to beat that using electricity   said Munton   But clearly there s a consideration around carbon taxation and how that affects the economics   The carbon tax on LNG projects in British Columbia will rise to C 50   38  a ton by 2021 from C 40 at present 
Chevron and Woodside expect to make a final investment decision in 2022 to 2023 with production starting by 2029  according to the project description  The revised proposal may trigger the need for a federal environmental assessment  according to the document

192229,413745,CVX,White House Discusses Extending Chevron s Venezuela Waiver,news," Bloomberg     The White House is discussing a renewal of  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX   s license to operate in Venezuela despite sanctions on the country  said President Donald Trump s top economic adviser  Larry Kudlow 
 It is under discussion   Kudlow told reporters at the White House on Tuesday   Chevron has done a great job  They have a long and illustrious tradition as you may know in Venezuela  
Chevron is the only remaining U S  oil major in Venezuela and wants to extend a waiver that is due to expire on July 27 to continue its joint venture with state owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA 
The U S  has refused to recognize Nicolas Maduro as the country s president after an election last year  Financial sanctions have become its main tool for depriving the Venezuelan leader of cash and pressuring the military to turn against him  Oil purchases from Venezuela have become complicated since the U S  expanded its sanctions regimen to include any business done with PDVSA  as the national oil company is known  Other companies  including Spain s Repsol  MC REP  SA and Italy s Eni SpA  continue to do business with Venezuela 
Chevron only got about 42 000 barrels of oil a day from its Venezuelan affiliate in 2018  roughly 1  of the company s global output  but the country is home to the world s largest oil reserves and is a potential bounty for oil companies if Maduro were to leave office

The fire isn t under control yet  according to two officials at the local fire authority  who declined to be identified in line with policy  Residents and businesses in the area have been asked to stay indoors until further notice  the City of Philadelphia office of emergency management said in a tweet PES Philadelphia couldn t immediately comment when reached by phone 
The PES complex  which comprises the Point Breeze and Girard Point plants  can handle a total of 335 000 barrels of crude a day  making it one of the biggest refineries on the U S  East Coast and the main supplier of fuel to the New York Harbor market  The Point Breeze section was already undergoing repairs following a fire in a pump that occurred earlier this month 
The refinery s importance in supplying fuels to the U S  East Coast is a concern given that any interruption would come at a time of peak summer demand for gasoline  Nationwide gasoline demand hit a record last week  nudging closer to 10 million barrels a day  according to government statistics released Wednesday 
Stockpiles of gasoline in the central Atlantic region  including the states of New York  New Jersey and Pennsylvania  stand at 32 4 million barrels  just below their five year average for this time of year  Gasoline futures for July delivery rose as much as 3 5  to  1 8482 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 6 37 a m  U S  Eastern time

192234,413750,CVX,Chevron Joins Qatar to Build Mideast s Biggest Ethylene Plant,news," Bloomberg      Chevron  Phillips Chemical Co   NYSE CVX  will help gas rich Qatar build the Middle East s largest plant for production of ethylene  a key ingredient in plastics 
Qatar Petroleum chose Chevron Phillips Chemical as its partner in a joint venture to produce as much as 1 9 million tons a year of ethylene  Saad Sherida Al Kaabi  QP s chief executive officer  said in Doha  The venture will process the chemical from ethane  a natural gas liquid  pumped at Qatar s giant North Field 
The venture will cost billions of dollars  though a more precise estimate must await the completion of engineering studies  Al Kaabi said  State run QP raised the production target from an initial plan for 1 6 million tons a year 
 We saw better results than expected from the North Field  and we were able to have more ethane available for extraction   Al Kaabi said Monday  referring to Qatar s portion of the offshore reservoir it shares with Iran  So  QP increased the venture s ethylene target  he said   We like them big in Qatar  
Qatar  the world s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas  is boosting output at home and picking up assets abroad  This latest push into chemicals reverses its previous pullback from the industry  when it ended plans to build two projects valued at  12 5 billion after oil prices collapsed in 2014 
Biggest Cracker
The joint venture will be the biggest facility in the Middle East for processing ethane    or  cracking  it  in industry parlance    into ethylene  Al Kaabi said  It will also produce high density polyethylene  Chevron Phillips Chemical CEO Mark Lashier said  QP will own 70  of the project  with the Texas based company holding the rest 
Petrochemicals are the building blocks of our daily stuff  from sports shoes to computer keyboards  created when oil and natural gas molecules are split  or cracked  to produce ethylene  propylene and other chemicals  Ethylene is used to make polyethylene  the most commonly used plastic 
Energy producers view these compounds increasingly as crucial to unlocking more profit from each barrel of crude they pump  and demand for these chemicals is growing faster than for oil and gas 
With oil at  65 a barrel  crude producers can earn  15 a barrel by refining their output and an extra  30 on top of that by converting it into petrochemicals  Abdulwahab Al Sadoun  secretary general of the Gulf Petrochemicals   Chemicals Association  told Bloomberg last year 
Qatar  a sheikhdom in the Persian Gulf  plans to boost LNG capacity from 77 million tons to 110 million tons by 2024  which will lift its total domestic production of oil and gas to 6 5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day from 4 8 million currently  It has already made a  final decision  to proceed with the LNG expansion  said Al Kaabi  who also serves as the country s minister of state for energy affairs 
Expansion at the North Field is going according to plan  and Qatar will award engineering  procurement and construction contracts for onshore facilities this year  Al Kaabi said  Qatar is still to decide whether to produce LNG by itself or with partners 
Its offshore Barzan gas project should start producing by the end of 2019  he said  Barzan  which is intended to supply the local market  has been delayed for years 
Qatar s gas ambitions aren t confined to the giant offshore field it shares with Iran  The country is going global  pledging  20 billion for U S  gas and LNG  and picking up stakes in projects and exploration licenses in Mozambique  Argentina  Mexico and Cyprus ",2019-06-24,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chevron-joins-qatar-to-build-mideasts-biggest-ethylene-plant-1905522,1905522
192235,413751,CVX,OPEC Member Fans Out to Australia and Canada in Global Gas Push,news," Bloomberg     Kuwait plans to boost production from Canadian shale deposits by two thirds and increase output of natural gas in Australia as the OPEC member ramps up efforts to find and develop overseas deposits of the fuel 
The international upstream arm of state owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp  sees output of almost 20 000 barrels of oil equivalent a day at its Canadian shale gas project by year end  up from 12 000 currently  Sheikh Nawaf Saud Al Sabah  acting chief executive officer  said in an interview in Kuwait City 
 It will rise to about 60 000 or so once we fully develop it  which will be in the mid 2020s   he said   We re just beginning to understand its potential  
In Australia  the company known as Kufpec won exploration rights to three new blocks in February and April  It s producing almost 40 000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in that country and aims to raise output and produce more liquefied natural gas for export  Al Sabah said  without specifying targets 
Kuwait has long planned to increase its global capacity to produce gas as well as oil  The Persian Gulf nation currently can pump as much as 3 million barrels a day of crude from its wholly owned fields  and KPC targets a daily capacity of 4 million by next year  As a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  however  Kuwait has pledged to cap its oil output as the group seeks to balance the market and prop up crude 
Like many energy producers  Kuwait sees gas as crucial to future growth  Gas use is seen rising faster than demand for oil and coal as policies shift toward lower carbon emissions  The amount of new gas production capacity investments this year could set a record  according to consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd 
In Alberta  Canada  Kufpec plans with its joint venture partner  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  to start developing the Waskahigan and East Kaybob areas  drilling the first of more than 370 wells over 10 years  The areas are part of the Kaybob Duvernay project producing shale gas and natural gas liquids 
 We continue to look for gas prospects in Australia   Al Sabah said  Kufpec partnered with Woodside Petroleum Ltd  at one of its blocks there  and Al Sabah s company is exporting gas via Woodside s Wheatstone LNG facility  Kufpec sells half its production from there under long term agreements 
Buyers  Market
 The other half is sold with a break clause that allows us to take those molecules to Kuwait if and when we need it   he said   Right now the LNG market is essentially a buyers  market  so it doesn t make sense for us to break a long term contract  just to sell to KPC when it can get competitive pricing elsewhere  he said 
LNG producers have feared that a massive build out of new export projects  which began a decade ago  will outpace consumption growth and leave cargoes looking for homes  Spot prices have already tumbled since last fall and are at a steep discount to LNG sold on long term  oil linked contracts 
Kufpec  known formally as Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co   may supply KPC when the global market tightens  possibly by the mid 2020s  Al Sabah said 
More from the interview 

The company has total assets of 3 4 billion dinars   11 2 billion  and is well funded right now for its current plans
 We need one or two more strategic acquisitions over the next couple of years to close our strategic gap 
Kufpec currently pumps 120 000 barrels a day of oil equivalent and plans to reach 150 000 by 2020

192236,413752,CVX,Icahn steps up fight with Occidental over deal  wants board seats,news,By Svea Herbst Bayliss and Arundhati Sarkar  Reuters    Billionaire investor Carl Icahn on Wednesday ratcheted up his fight with Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY  over its pending purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC  by calling for a special shareholder meeting where he hopes to win board seats  In a regulatory filing  Icahn said he planned to oust and replace four Occidental directors and change the company s charter through a stockholder consent solicitation to prevent it from ever engineering a similar takeover again  Responding to the filing  Occidental said it will review the latest materials filed by Icahn  and looks forward to addressing them in ongoing conversations with shareholders  Icahn  one of industry s most powerful activist investors  cast himself as one of the deal s most fervent critics by charging that Occidental s  38 billion bid for Anadarko was too expensive and could endanger Occidental s future if oil prices sink  The deal has been approved by the U S  Federal Trade Commission and is expected to close in the second half of the year  Icahn s move on Wednesday put fresh pressure on Occidental s management and Chief Executive Vicki Hollub at a critical time and has sparked speculation that Occidental may try to settle with him   It is important to add new directors to Occidental s Board of Directors to oversee future extraordinary transactions like the Anadarko transaction and to ensure that they are not consummated without stockholder approval when appropriate   Icahn said in a statement to shareholders on Wednesday  Icahn owned a  1 6 billion stake in Occidental as of May 30   While the move was notable  it hardly came as a surprise as Icahn had been hinting for weeks that he might push for a special meeting where other shareholders would be able to express their frustration with management  In May he sued Occidental in Delaware court  and earlier this week he went out of his way to criticize the Occidental Anadarko deal while discussing the merger of major casino operators Caesars Entertainment Corp and Eldorado Resorts Inc   The recent Occidental Petroleum fiasco is a great example of how CEOs and boards will go to great lengths  including  betting the company  to serve their own agendas   Icahn said in a statement about the Caesars Eldorado merger   If their bet is successful  they and possibly their shareholders win  but if it is unsuccessful  only the shareholders lose   While Icahn has said publicly that the Occidental Anadarko deal likely would not be derailed  his filing illustrates how he wants to make sure that nothing similar happens again  He said Occidental lacks effective corporate governance and that its directors made mistakes in how and at what cost they pursued the acquisition of Anadarko  according to the filing  Icahn is calling on the board to set a record date to determine which shareholders could petition to hold a special meeting  The oil and gas producer s bid for Anadarko topped one by  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX  and includes a  10 billion financing deal with Warren Buffett s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc    NYSE BRKa  The merger of the two U S  shale producers would increase Occidental s debt to around  40 billion  Icahn  in his lawsuit filed in Delaware Court of Chancery in May  sought access to the oil producer s financial records and details of negotiations ,2019-06-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/investor-icahn-steps-up-fight-to-replace-four-occidental-directors-1908738,1908738

On Friday oil prices soared on U S  China trade talks  On Monday they sold off as those trade ideal talks seemed to turn into more talks  Today there is more concerns about a slowing global economy with weak import and export data out of China  which one might think would make China want to get done with the so called phase one of this complex U S  China deal  Instead more talks seem to be the talk and oil took another hard drop in overnight trading 
Demand fears are the reason  The International Energy Agency  IEA  cut its oil demand forecast again saying that demand will grow by 1 0 million barrels per day  mb d  in 2019 and 1 2 mb d in 2020  both downward revisions by 100 000 bpd from their last estimates  Of couse their demand predictions have not been good 
The market is probably pricing in another big build in U S  crude supply as refiners in the U S  are still deep in maintenance  Yet keep an eye on the products  especially distillates  that are falling way below normal  This is the weakest demand period of the year making it harder for on the oil market 
As bad as the market looks today  we are still higher than we were 5 days ago  In another words  oil is just one tweet from turning higher or turning back towards the low 
OPEC  of course  must be frustrated  With the attack on Saudi Arabia  the compliance rate to production cuts from OPEC plus Russia deal hit 200   OPEC s total production slumped by 1 318 million bpd from August to 28 491 million bpd in September  according to the secondary sources in OPEC s closely watched Monthly Oil Market Report  This comes a day after Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to a long term pact on oil cooperation and signals that OPEC and Russia may be planning a cut at the December OPEC meeting  OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said that OPEC and its allies are committed to maintaining oil market stability beyond 2020

192250,413766,CVX,Should Value Investors Consider Chevron  CVX  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Chevron Corporation   NYSE CVX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Chevron has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 45  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 84  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Chevron s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 11 93  This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Chevron has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 56  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates indicate that the company s share price will likely appreciate in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Chevron has a P S ratio of about 1 34  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  CVX is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Chevron currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Chevron a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Chevron might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D  This gives CVX a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending lower  The current year has seen zero estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower  while the next year estimate has seen one upward and three downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate has fallen by 4 9  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has decreased 7 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Chevron Corporation Price and Consensus    This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineChevron is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 6   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar  which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor ,2019-10-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-consider-chevron-cvx-stock-now-200472336,200472336

192254,413770,CVX,Chevron drops Anadarko takeover battle after Occidental raises bid,news,"By Jennifer Hiller HOUSTON  Reuters     Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX  abandoned its takeover bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC  on Thursday  outmaneuvered by Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY  Corp s higher   38 billion offer that included more than three times as much cash  With a financing assist from billionaire investor Warren Buffett  Occidental  which is one quarter the size of Chevron  is the likely victor in a contest that again proved the allure of U S  shale  Occidental has said it plans to shed most of Anadarko s non shale properties in a deal that would cement its position in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico  the top U S  shale field  Chevron declined to raise its initial offer after Occidental boosted the cash portion of its  76 per share bid and Anadarko s board deemed it a superior offer  Chevron  the No  2 U S  oil producer  received a  1 billion breakup fee  which it has said it will apply to a  5 billion share repurchase program  Chevron shares closed 3 1 percent higher on Thursday at  121 19 while shares of Occidental fell 6 4 percent to  56 33  the lowest in a decade  Anadarko shares fell 3 3 percent to  73 39  Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth said the company decided at a board meeting on Wednesday to walk away from the takeover battle  even though it could have matched or beaten Occidental s offer and saw Anadarko as a strategic fit   Make no mistake  We have the financial capacity to outbid Occidental  but we concluded that an increased offer would have eroded value to our shareholders  and it would have diminished returns on capital   Wirth said   The bar is high  We don t have a need to do anything  We are not desperate to do a deal   Chevron s decision demonstrated strong capital discipline  said Jennifer Rowland  analyst with Edward Jones   I am a bit surprised that they walked  but am pleased that they didn t get caught up in a bidding war with Oxy  who comes across as willing to fight to win at all costs   Rowland said   Anadarko was a unique fit for Chevron  so I don t expect them to go on a shopping spree in the Permian   Anadarko s major assets   in U S  shale  the Gulf of Mexico and an liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique   were seen as a logical fit for Chevron  but not something the company needed   Chevron has no objective need to acquire Anadarko   or  for that matter  engage in any other large scale  mergers and acquisitions    said Pavel Molchanov  an analyst with Raymond James  Analysts said they do not expect another bidder for Anadarko to emerge    The industry is trying to show investors more capital discipline and if another suitor comes in that would be significantly counter to most companies  strategies   analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note on Thursday   PERMIAN BASIN Investors have sold off shares of oil companies that increased spending on drilling instead of returning cash to shareholders  They have called for capital discipline  defined as increasing production by 4 percent a year and maintaining a 4 percent dividend  One result  The value of U S  oil and gas mergers and acquisitions fell to a 10 year low in the first quarter as investors sold shares of companies that spent more on drilling than on buybacks and dividends   The contest for Anadarko underscored the value of its assets in the Permian Basin  the vast shale field with oil and gas deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low cost drilling techniques  The region s soaring production has propelled U S  oil production to 12 million barrels per day  bpd   more than that of Russia or Saudi Arabia   Anadarko said on Thursday it had signed a definitive agreement with Occidental and expects the merger to be completed in the second half of the year  The deal still faces antitrust reviews  Chevron holds 2 3 million acres in the Permian Basin and has vast mineral ownership there  which reduces its royalty rate  It expects shale production from the basin to reach 600 000 bpd by the end of next year  and 900 000 bpd by the end of 2023  Occidental outmaneuvered Chevron by gaining cash and allies  It got a  10 billion investment from Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  Inc and struck a deal with French oil giant  Total  SA  PA TOTF  to take most of Anadarko s international assets  including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique  Total agreed to pay  8 8 billion for the assets once the merger goes ahead  Several Occidental investors oppose the deal  including its sixth largest shareholder  T  Rowe Price Group Inc  because they consider it too large a risk if oil prices falter  or if Occidental cannot produce the  3 5 billion a year in cost savings it has promised  Ratings agency Moody s Investors Service said on Wednesday it likely would downgrade Occidental if it prevailed in the takeover  noting the deal would add  46 billion of debt before any sale of assets  
Several investors also have criticized Occidental s decision this week to secure Anadarko s endorsement by excluding a shareholder vote on the deal ",2019-05-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chevron-says-not-to-raise-offer-for-anadarko-1862610,1862610
192255,413771,CVX,Occidental chief faces shareholders on cusp of takeover victory,news,"By Jennifer Hiller HOUSTON  Reuters    Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY  Chief Executive Vicki Hollub takes her case for buying Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC  to the company s shareholders on Friday  bolstered by rapid deal making that put her on the cusp of victory  Hollub  59  challenged larger rival  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX  with a long shot bid that some of her own investors say is risky because it saddles Occidental with about  46 billion in new debt  By deftly lining up allies and cash  she put together a strategy that on Thursday prompted Chevron to withdraw  The annual meeting will be the first chance for Occidental shareholders to present their views to managers  even if they do not get a say on the deal  The lack of a deal vote and the stock s drop to  56 33 a 10 year low on Thursday could lead to a messy victory party   Several big holders have criticized Hollub s decision to secure Anadarko by increasing the cash portion of the  76 per share offer to a point where a shareholder vote is no longer needed   But unless another suitor appears  the  38 billion  mostly cash deal would cement its status as the largest oil producer in the Permian Basin  the top U S  shale field  Occidental s global production would double to 1 4 million barrels of oil and gas per day  Hollub has promised to quickly shed most of Anadarko s non U S  oil properties to focus on shale  It also must absorb or sell Anadarko s U S  Gulf of Mexico offshore production   With Anadarko s nearly quarter million acres in the Permian Basin  Occidental would command 1 64 million acres of prime land in the Permian and gain access to growing shale fields in Colorado and Wyoming   The deal s financial and operating risks have soured some big Occidental holders  including T  Rowe Price and Matrix Asset Management    On paper  at  65 per barrel oil  the deal could be executed well  That sort of is turning a blind eye to the fact that they re in a cyclical industry   said David Katz  president of Matrix  Rating firm Moody s Investors Service said Wednesday it likely would downgrade Occidental if it prevails due to the added debt that will make it harder for the company to confront a downturn in oil prices   If you do this you have a strained balance sheet  period   said Christian Ledoux  investment chief at Occidental shareholder South Texas Money Management   T  Rowe Price  which holds about 21 1 million Occidental shares  said it will withhold votes for Occidental directors due to the lack of a shareholder vote on the deal  Hollub  who has sought to buy Anadarko for two years  proved her ability to sweep away hurdles by quickly pulling in powerful allies  She convinced Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  Inc s Warren Buffett to invest  10 billion in Occidental stock to help close the deal

192262,413778,CVX,Oil Prices Soar On Saudi Plant Attack  Winners   Losers,opinion,Oil prices are currently trading at their highest level since May  thanks to an attack on Saudi oil facility that led to a disruption in the global supply of crude  The coordinated drone strikes on key Saudi oil facilities have removed nearly 5  of global supplies  an attack that the United States blamed Iran for Needless to say  the affected location is the world s largest oil procession plant  In fact  Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that almost 5 7 million barrels a day of crude oil and gas have been affected Brent crude futures at one point of time climbed almost 20  to take the global oil benchmark just shy of  72 a barrel  U S  oil futures  by the way  were trading at more than  61 a barrel  highlighting a rise of nearly 10  Persistent attacks on Saudi s oil infrastructure  which historically has been a steady source of crude  is a new pattern that the oil market has to deal with  Lest we forget  oil prices edged up for the week ending Aug 16 amid a weekend attack on a Saudi oilfield by Yemeni separatists Yemen s Houthi group had been responsible for a drone attack on an oilfield in eastern Saudi Arabia  resulting in a fire at a gas plant  Saudi oilfield attack has  thus  added to West Asian turmoil  Needless to say  oil prices rallied after such an attack raised concerns about supply disruption Oil Jump  A Boon for These StocksWith state energy producer Saudi Aramco bearing the brunt of the attack  its rival oil producers mostly in China saw their shares climb north  China s biggest offshore oil producer  CNOOC s shares jumped 8 7  in Hong Kong  notching its best performance on the Hang Seng  Another Hang Seng component  PetroChina  Asia s largest oil and gas producer  witnessed its shares soar 7 4  Most importantly  rise in oil prices is a blessing in disguise for companies involved in hydraulic fracturing  Such companies were affected the most at the end of last year due to a drop in oil prices  This is because when oil is cheap  the cost structure of such corporations loses appeal and the incentive to pump dies But now  with oil prices increasing  fracking related service stocks  including U S  Silica Holdings   NYSE SLCA    are sure to make a comeback  The Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s expected earnings growth rate for the

Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Oil Prices Soar on Saudi Plant Attack  Winners and LosersOil prices are currently trading at their highest level since May  thanks to an attack on Saudi oil facility that led to a disruption in the global supply of crude  The coordinated drone strikes on key Saudi oil facilities have removed nearly 5  of global supplies  an attack that the United States blamed Iran for Needless to say  the affected location is the world s largest oil procession plant  In fact  Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that almost 5 7 million barrels a day of crude oil and gas have been affected Brent crude futures at one point of time climbed almost 20  to take the global oil benchmark just shy of  72 a barrel  U S  oil futures  by the way  were trading at more than  61 a barrel  highlighting a rise of nearly 10  Persistent attacks on Saudi s oil infrastructure  which historically has been a steady source of crude  is a new pattern that the oil market has to deal with  Lest we forget  oil prices edged up for the week ending Aug 16 amid a weekend attack on a Saudi oilfield by Yemeni separatists Yemen s Houthi group had been responsible for a drone attack on an oilfield in eastern Saudi Arabia  resulting in a fire at a gas plant  Saudi oilfield attack has  thus  added to West Asian turmoil  Needless to say  oil prices rallied after such an attack raised concerns about supply disruption Oil Jump  A Boon for These StocksWith state energy producer Saudi Aramco bearing the brunt of the attack  its rival oil producers mostly in China saw their shares climb north  China s biggest offshore oil producer  CNOOC s shares jumped 8 7  in Hong Kong  notching its best performance on the Hang Seng  Another Hang Seng component  PetroChina  Asia s largest oil and gas producer  witnessed its shares soar 7 4  Most importantly  rise in oil prices is a blessing in disguise for companies involved in hydraulic fracturing  Such companies were affected the most at the end of last year due to a drop in oil prices  This is because when oil is cheap  the cost structure of such corporations loses appeal and the incentive to

192264,413780,CVX,Anadarko Accepts Occidental Bid  Chevron May Now Respond,news," Bloomberg     Anadarko Petroleum Corp  s  NYSE APC  board has declared Occidental Petroleum Corp  s  NYSE OXY  sweetened  38 billion takeover  superior   giving  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  until May 10 to either boost its offer or walk away from the oil industry s biggest deal in at least four years 
The announcement by Anadarko  which had rebuffed several prior bids from Occidental  comes almost a month after it agreed to be purchased by Chevron for  33 billion  Chevron has so far refused to increase its offer  saying its proposal is a better long term option for Anadarko shareholders  If it decides not to raise the bid  Chevron can walk away with a  1 billion breakup fee 
The takeover of Anadarko has been a rare public fight for an oil industry that hasn t seen many bidding wars  Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub s recruitment of billionaire Warren Buffett and an  8 8 billion accord to offload African oil and gas fields to  Total  SA  PA TOTF  appeared to have been key milestones in winning the board s favor  Anadarko directors had previously chosen Chevron s offer even though it was substantially cheaper than that of Occidental  which  as a smaller company  would have to take on much more leverage to do the deal 
 We think Chevron is likely to make a counter offer  but it may not be high enough to win the bid   said Leo Mariani  an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets  Chevron  boosted by more valuable stock  will have to offer around  70 a share to be considered by Anadarko  costing it an extra  3 2 billion  he said 
The period for Chevron s response may be extended under the terms of the original agreement  Anadarko said in a statement after the market closed Monday  In a separate statement  Chevron acknowledged Anadarko s response and declined to make any further comment 
Anadarko was little changed at  75 50 at 8 50 a m  in pre market trading in New York  less than  1 below the value of Occidental s offer  Occidental was also little changed at  58 65  Chevron was 0 6 percent lower at  117 70 
Chevron CEO Mike Wirth has signaled he s willing to end his pursuit of a deal if the price gets so high that it imperils investor returns   We strongly believe that the combination of our two companies create superior long term value for shareholders of the combined company   Wirth said on an April 26 earnings conference call 
While buying Anadarko would expand the producer s presence in the Permian Basin  which is now the world s largest oil patch  there are other operators in the region that Chevron could acquire  Chevron also has existing ambitious growth plans for the Permian 
Houston based Occidental over the weekend pressed to alleviate any remaining concerns from Anadarko  It said Sunday that 78 percent of the deal will be paid in cash  up from 50 percent  and it got rid of the need for a shareholder vote  which had previously been cited as a sticking point for Anadarko s directors 
 We have long been convinced that a strategic combination with Anadarko represents a compelling opportunity for the shareholders of both Occidental and Anadarko   Occidental said in a statement after Anadarko accepted the suitor s offer 
At least one major Occidental investor has signaled that it s ready to break with the company s board of directors  T  Rowe Price Group Inc  told Reuters it intends to vote against the board after the company eliminated the need for shareholder approval in its revised bid 
 With the OXY deal looking safer for APC to accept  I d say this may force CVX to match the OXY bid or lose out on these terrific assets   said Bill Nygren  chief investment officer of Harris Associates LP  which manages  120 billion and owns about 3 percent of Anadarko

192265,413781,CVX,Anadarko Is Said to Seek Chevron Bid at Least Matching Rival,news," Bloomberg     Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC   is looking for a revised takeover offer from  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  that matches or exceeds the  38 billion proposal from Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY    according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the information isn t public 
The board on Monday deemed the Occidental takeover bid  superior  to a  33 billion proposal it accepted last month  That gives Chevron until May 10 to increase its bid  seek an extension or walk away from the industry s biggest deal in at least four years  The company has yet to say what action it will take and a spokesman didn t immediately respond to request for comment on Wednesday  Anadarko declined to comment 
 It would be foolish for Chevron to assume they could come underneath the Occidental bid   said Bill Nygren  chief investment officer of Harris Associates LP  which manages  120 billion and owns about 3  of Anadarko   We would fully expect the Anadarko board to accept the highest offer  and if that wasn t the outcome  we would be very vocal in our dissent  
Anadarko s board accepted the original Chevron bid even though it had the higher offer from Occidental on the table  The Woodlands  Texas based company was concerned about Occidental s ability to get shareholder approval for its offer and about the amount of cash versus stock  Occidental on May 5 issued a revised proposal that boosted the cash portion and removed the need for a shareholder vote 
Analysts have said there is room for Chevron to increase its bid  The company probably needs to raise it from  65 to  70 or  72 a share to stay in the running  but doesn t need to surpass Occidental s bid because its stock is a more valuable currency  Lysle Brinker  executive director of companies and transaction research at IHS Markit  said on Tuesday 
Anadarko would be the largest deal of Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth s 15 month tenure and be the biggest transaction in the oil industry in four years  A new offer from Chevron would also make the tussle for Anadarko one of the most contested takeovers in years for the U S  oil patch  where bidding wars are unusual 
The Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico is key to Anadarko s appeal  Chevron and Occidental both see acquiring the driller as a way to bulk up their positions in the region  where production has more than doubled since 2015 
Shares of Anadarko were untraded in the pre market as of 7 34 a m  in New York  Occidental dropped 0 7 percent to  59 80 and Chevron was little changed at  117 34 ",2019-05-09,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/anadarko-is-said-to-seek-chevron-bid-at-least-matching-rival-1862502,1862502

192270,413786,CVX,U S  And China Agree To Meet  Investors Go Risk On Again ,opinion,"Fall is a time of the year many absolutely adore  including me  The long  steamy  hot summer days start to temper off and the temperature becomes reasonable  almost even  I dare say  pleasant  It has not happened yet  but it certainly looks imminent  at least here in Las Vegas  With the arrival of fall  comes the beginning of a new school year  both on college campuses and in primary schools  Along with the big day for boys  girls  and quickly maturing young adults  comes an even more important time for sports enthusiasts  You guessed it  the riteful passage of college and professional football  and a little while later  the fall classic in Major League Baseball  known as the World Series   Hockey has become the sport to pay attention to here in Vegas  and so the NHL also must get a mention  Sporting enthusiasts have plenty of activity to pay attention to  so it seems those endless days of nothingness are long past  Similarly  let s turn to the capital markets as there is always something going on there  too 
The August jobs report came out yesterday morning and it was a touch soft  with the number being 130 000 as opposed to the estimate of 150k  Most economists see the economy cooling some  and the results certainly probably helped Fed Chairman Powell move towards cementing a twenty five basis point rate cut when the FOMC meets next week  With the ten year treasury note yielding a paltry 1 552   even after a nice rise last week  the bond market is priced for perfection  unless you are a trader  On a relative basis  the US fixed income market is attractive for its high yield  because all across the globe  negative yielding bonds dot the landscape  You may not get much for owning debt here  but you do get a positive coupon  though minimal  Many  including myself  see the negative yielding debt issue as a major problem for rational investing  Negative yields bring a ton of problems  but I ll let this  be more instructive as to why   comes from Jim Bianco  Bianco Research  
In addition to low rates here  one area which is getting little notice is fiscal discipline  or should I say  the lack of fiscal discipline  by our lovely politicians  For this year  the US government is estimated to run a trillion dollar budget deficit  A trillion is a thousand billion  A billion is a thousand million  Under this situation  should the US dollar be strong  Just as importantly  how sustainable is dollar strength  given the lack of spending limits  Interestingly  the Trump administration rightly argues the country actually needs a weaker dollar  There are many positions the current administration takes which I believe are correct  especially those that are energy and growth related  However  running trillion dollar deficits in a year  with no end in sight as far as addressing Social Security and Medicare escalation  is going to solve the strong dollar problem  Be careful what you wish for  Mr  Navarro 
In the energy world  the collapse of the stock prices of the shale producers leaves a new dynamic for investors  With oil trading in the  60 dollar per barrel range  Brent   shale exploration is not very profitable for most E P outfits  and many are loaded with debt  The new joke is the bankers are calling it Chapter 22  because many of these entities are now facing Chapter 11  but for a second time  The largest integrated oil outfits  the majors  stand ready to cherry pick prime opportunities  particularly in the attractive Permian  Some of this started when  Chevron   NYSE CVX  said no to Anadarko  and then Occidental  NYSE OXY  went ahead with that deal  and now the Occidental shares have been punished  along with the rest of the space  Elsewhere  the majors are noticing a slowdown in oil demand from China  clearly related to trade talks  On that front  optimism about a fresh round in October helped lift the market  It will be interesting to see what comes from those negotiations 
Elsewhere  Argentina s currency and equity market has been drubbed on the realization that the current  pro market leader  Mr  Macri  probably will lose his reelection bid in a few weeks  The IMF is scheduled to consider a fresh bid by Argentina to restructure a loan of  57 billion that matures in 2021  The ECB will meet next week to consider its interest rate policy  and is scheduled to reduce rates again  Lulu lemon reported a very strong quarter and investors lined up to hit the buy button  as well as do downward facing dog  but fashionably   Lululemon Athletica  Inc  NASDAQ LULU  was one that was in my wheelhouse and I missed it a few years ago  many multiples later  Cannot get them all  Finally  for those of you daring real estate investors  the Bahamas might be worth a look  A few years ago when Puerto Rico was thrashed by hurricanes  investors rushed in for prime purchases  which have paid off in that circumstance  Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas  and the loss of life and property is truly a sad situation  In time  a long time  the area will recover  No guarantees  but something to consider  Thanks for reading and enjoy your first weekend of football ",2019-09-08,Yale Bock,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-and-china-agree-to-meet-investors-go-risk-on-again-200462689,200462689

192272,413788,CVX,Occidental Seeks Edge Over Chevron Bid by Adding More Cash,news," Bloomberg     Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY   moved a step closer to sealing its proposed  38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC   after it sweetened its offer and agreed to sell assets owned by the target company 
Occidental increased the cash portion of its bid to 78 percent from 50 percent on Sunday  It also pledged to cover the  1 billion breakup fee Anadarko would have to pay for abandoning an already agreed to deal with  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX   and said Occidental shareholders won t be required to vote on the takeover 
The heftier buyout proposal came just hours after French energy giant  Total  SA  PA TOTF  agreed to buy operations in four African nations for  8 8 billion  contingent upon Occidental completing a takeover of Texas based Anadarko 
The Total agreement augments billionaire Warren Buffett s  10 billion commitment to Occidental  which has faced investor criticism for its unsolicited April 24 offer to best Chevron s takeover of Anadarko  While Occidental is a storied name in American oil and operates across three continents  it s just one fifth Chevron s market value and its pursuit of Anadarko was seen by some as quixotic 
Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub  who has been pursuing Anadarko for almost two years  has grown frustrated at the company s unwillingness to acquiesce to her advances 
 We remain perplexed at your apparent resistance to obtaining far more value for Anadarko shareholders which has been expressed clearly through our interactions over the last week   Hollub said in a letter to Anadarko s board dated Sunday 
Stunning Rebuff
Anadarko said in a statement that it will review the revised offer and reaffirmed its existing recommendation to shareholders to accept the Chevron deal 
The Total agreement may ameliorate concerns that Occidental would take on too much debt and shorten the amount of time the company would be out of the market for share buybacks  said Bill Nygren  chief investment officer of Harris Associates LP  which manages  120 billion and owns about 3 percent of Anadarko 
An Occidental Anadarko accord would be a stunning rebuff for Chevron CEO Mike Wirth just 15 months into his tenure at the head of the world s third largest oil explorer by market value  Sunday s emergence of Total as an Occidental ally pits two of the world s supermajor oil drillers on opposite sides of the industry s biggest takeover battle in years 
Gulfstream V
Hollub has pursued Anadarko amid on and off talks since late 2017  to no avail 
In an apparent acknowledgment that more was needed to get the deal across the line  Hollub flew to Omaha  Nebraska  on April 28 to visit Buffett  The legendary investor announced two days later he had agreed to pay  10 billion in exchange for a slug of Occidental preferred stock and warrants  contingent on a successful takeover of Anadarko 
 With the OXY deal looking safer for APC to accept  I d say this may force CVX to match the OXY bid or lose out on these terrific assets   Nygren said in an email  referring to the stock tickers of the suitors and target 
Icahn Arrives
At the heart of the tug of war over Anadarko is a fight for supremacy in the Permian Basin  the world s largest oil patch  Chevron announced an ambitious  multibillion dollar plan earlier this year to boost its fracking activities in the region  and buying Anadarko would turbo boost its Permian growth  For Occidental  the deal is about securing its position as the dominant producer in the basin 
Buying Anadarko would be the biggest oil industry deal in four years and mark an end to an era of austerity among explorers chastened by a decline in crude prices and chastized by investors for poor returns  The pressure on Occidental and Chevron shares in the past two weeks showed investors were worried the industry was returning to the old ways  when profligate spending and bold deals were de rigueur 
Indeed  the controversy stirred up by Occidental s bid appears to have attracted another interloper  Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn has built a small stake in the company  people familiar with the matter said on May 3 
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
 Carl Icahn s minor Occidental Petroleum stake may not be enough to reframe the debate over Anadarko  even as some shareholders remain skeptical of both the deal s impact and the costs Berkshire extracted to help finance it  We believe Icahn is making a push to sway the outcome  as he has a stake in the Permian  Occidental s prime motivator in pursuing Anadarko  Icahn inherited a position in Diamondback Energy  a midsized Permian E P firm  through its purchase of Energen  a holding he initially pushed to seek alternatives  If Icahn can derail Occidental s bid for Anadarko  the former would pursue a better fitting  more digestible E P target with a stronger concentration in the basin    Vincent G  Piazza  senior industry analyst  and Evan Lee  associate analystClick here to view the research
Occidental shares rose in after market trading on Friday after the news of Icahn s involvement  signaling that fresh doubt about the deal s prospects was a positive catalyst for investors  On Monday  following the Total accord and the revised takeover offer  they had erased those gains and were down 1 6 percent  Anadarko rose as much as 2 4 percent to  74 50  Chevron was unchanged 
Four Days
Anadarko doesn t just operate in the Permian  and both bidders face being saddled with unwanted assets    Chevron has also said it will sell off billions of dollars of operations post merger 
The Total deal means the French company will take on oil operations in Ghana  Algeria and South Africa  as well as a massive liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique  Total is already a major player in LNG while Occidental has no current involvement in that market and had already indicated that it was looking to sell the facility 
Investors now await a decision from the Anadarko board  Having previously rebuffed proposals from Occidental for more than a year  Anadarko agreed to start negotiations with the company even before the cash portion was lifted late Sunday  If Anadarko recommends a merger with Occidental  Chevron will have four days to make a counter offer or walk away

192282,413798,CVX,Occidental tweaks  38 billion Anadarko bid to remove shareholder vote,news,"By David French
 Reuters    Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY  increased the cash component of its  38 billion bid to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC  on Sunday  removing a requirement for any deal to receive the approval of Occidental s shareholders 
The move means Occidental shareholders who oppose the bid  including T Rowe Price  will not get an opportunity to vote it down  It adds more certainty to the offer for Anadarko  but also risks the ire of billionaire investor Carl Icahn  who sources have said has been amassing a stake in Occidental to challenge its Anadarko offer 
Occidental is trying to convince Anadarko to accept its offer and abandon the agreed  33 billion sale to  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX 
Anadarko confirmed that it received the revised bid from Occidental and said its board will review the proposal 
The merger agreement with Chevron remains in effect  Anadarko said and reaffirmed its existing recommendation of the deal with Chevron at this time 
Earlier on Sunday  France s  Total  SA  PA TOTF  said it has agreed with Occidental to buy the African assets of Anadarko for  8 8 billion  should the two U S  oil and gas companies clinch a deal to combine  This removes the risk of Occidental not being able to shed Anadarko assets it considers non core to the deal 
On Tuesday  Occidental also secured a  10 billion investment from Warren Buffet s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  Inc in support of its bid for Anadarko  The terms of that deal were seen as particularly favorable to Buffett by analysts and investors 
Occidental submitted a new  76 per share offer to Anadarko on Sunday structured as 78 percent cash and 22 percent stock  as opposed to an even cash stock split in its  76 per share offer previously 
This brought the number of Occidental shares required to fund the bid below the issuance threshold that would have triggered a vote on the deal by Occidental shareholders  Anadarko shareholders would still get to vote on the deal 
The bidding war for Anadarko underscores the value of its assets in the lucrative Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico  The vast shale field holds oil and gas deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low cost drilling techniques 
 The financial support of Berkshire Hathaway as well as the agreement we announced with Total allows us to delever our balance sheet while focusing our integration efforts on the assets that will provide the most value for us   Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement announcing the amended terms 
However  a request made on Thursday evening by Anadarko s counsel for three board seats in the merged entity had not been granted  Occidental added 
Should Occidental s bid be declared superior by Anadarko  Chevron will be given four days to match Occidental s offer  according to the terms of the contract between Chevron and Anadarko 
Should Anadarko abandon Chevron for Occidental  it will have to pay Chevron a  1 billion deal breakup fee 
The proposed sale of Anadarko s African assets to Total includes a 26 5 percent interest in a Mozambique liquefied natural gas project  which is moving closer to a final investment decision  and stakes in two offshore fields in Ghana 
Occidental said this does not impact the planned  2 billion of annual cost savings and  1 5 billion of annual capital reductions already outlined as part of its potential acquisition of Anadarko 
Total s previously outlined plan to increase its dividend by 10 percent and buy back 5 million shares by the end of 2020 will not be impacted by the deal  the French company said in a separate statement 
Chevron declined to comment on the Occidental move or say whether it will change its  65 a share bid 
Separately  Occidental said its first quarter adjusted profit fell 10 9 percent as lower prices for its crude hurt oil and gas revenue

192283,413799,CVX,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday  May 6 
1  Trump threatens to raise tariffs on China
U S  President Donald Trump increased pressure on China over the weekend  threatening to raise a 10  tariff on  200 billion in goods to 25  on Friday and adding that an additional  325 billion in goods could potentially be subject to tax 



 The trade deal with China continues  but too slowly  as they attempt to negotiate  No   Trump tweeted on Sunday 
The threat comes ahead of high level negotiations in Washington this week  Although The Wall Street initially reported that China was considering cancelling Vice Premier Liu He s trip  a spokesperson from the Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed that it was still planning to send a delegation  There was however a lack of clarity over whether the Vice Premier himself would still make the trip 
Trump has twice extended the previously announced tariff increase since reaching a trade truce with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Dec  1 and some analysts speculated that Sunday s threat is a tactic to increase pressure ahead of the next round of talks due to start Wednesday 
2  Dow set for 500 point slide on trade angst
Trump s tweet ignited a risk off move in financial markets on Monday with global equities down across the board 
The pan European Euro Stoxx 50 slid 2 1  while China s Shanghai Composite ended 5 6  lower  Japan s Nikkei 225 remained closed for a holiday U S  futures pointed to a sharp decline at Monday s open after ending on a high note last week thanks to a solid labor report that showed little sign of increasing inflationary pressures 
Dow futures tumbled 522 points  or 2 0  by 5 24 AM ET  9 24 GMT   while S P 500 futures sank 55 points  1 9   and Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 186 points  or 2 4  
In a session with no major U S  economic reports  the greenback was little changed against a basket of major rival currencies  However  the Chinese yuan dropped against the dollar while the Japanese yen received safe haven bids 
3  Oil prices tumble on trade tensions
Oil prices sank on Monday as Trump s tweets revived fears for the global economy and oil demand 
U S  crude oil futures fell 97 cents  or 1 6   to  60 97 by 5 27 AM ET  9 27 GMT   while Brent oil traded down 87 cents  or 1 2   to  69 98 
Traders fear that a full blown trade war between the world s two largest economies would cripple demand for oil  Prices had fallen last week after a surge in U S  crude stockpiles  suggesting that global supplies are still abundant

Amid ongoing sanctions against Iranian oil  the U S  announced Sunday that it was sending an aircraft carrier strike group and bombers to the Middle East because of  troubling and escalatory indications and warnings  related to the Islamic Republic 
Such moves often lead traders to build a geopolitical risk premium into crude prices  but that appears to be outweighed by trade related concerns today 
4  Occidental sweetens offer for Anadarko
Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY  upped the cash component of its  38 billion offer to acquire Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC   while removing a requirement for its own shareholders to vote on its bid 
Occidental restructured its  76 per share offer to be 78  cash and 22  stock  compared to the previous 50 50 split  Apart from making the offer more attractive to Anadarko s shareholders by reducing the risk associated with holding Occidental stock  the move lessens the number of shares that Occidental needs to sell to fund the transaction  removing the need for shareholder approval to launch the bid 
Anadarko responded by noting that previous agreement to be acquired by  Chevron   NYSE CVX  for  33 billion was still in effect and it continued to recommend that bid  although it was reviewing the new proposal 
5  Berkshire ups share repurchases as Buffett spotlights Jain and Abel
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  repurchased around  1 7 billion of its own shares in the first quarter  a sharp increase from 2018 total buybacks of  1 3 billion after the company relaxed its policy last year 
Buffett  known as the  Sage of Omaha  for his successful investment track record  used Saturday s 2019 Annual Shareholders Meeting to place the spotlight on his potential successors Ajit Jain  vice president of the investment firm s insurance operations  and Greg Abel  vice chairman of non insurance operations 
Buffett allowed both men to take the floor at the meeting and suggested that permitting Jain and Abel to answer more in questions in the future was  probably a pretty good idea  ",2019-05-06,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-monday-1857164,1857164

192286,413802,CVX,Energy   Precious Metals   Weekly Review and Calendar Ahead,news,"By Barani Krishnan
Investing com   It was a big week in oil  with West Texas Intermediate crude hitting  65 per barrel and Brent  75 before falling back sharply from those six month highs  Donald Trump was the reason for both the rise and fall  proving once again his ability to surprise the market with the unexpected 
The U S  president also tested the intelligence of energy traders by feeding them one of the most ludicrous tales in oil  and getting at least some to buy the story  Trump opened the week by announcing that he was ending all sanction waivers for importers of Iranian oil  That was the surprise  Then came the ludicrous bit  He claimed on Friday that he had  called  OPEC to lower domestic gasoline prices  which are up 27  on the year 
It s unclear how many traders genuinely believed Trump and how many just needed an excuse to cash out of a seven week rally  U S  pump prices are determined as much by fuel demand  stockpiles and refining margins as the crude provided by both OPEC and local drillers  In any case  Trump s story brought the runaway rally in oil to a screeching halt  handing bulls an unexpected 4  loss on the day and 2  setback on the week 
For the record  OPEC s Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo later denied having spoken with the president 
Also  the weekly reading on U S  oil rigs published on Friday showed a startling drop of 20 rigs that took the count to a 13 month low  If anything  it was testimony of Trump s inability to convince even domestic drillers to rally production to offset OPEC s huge output cuts this year 
And the market may not have woken up fully to the severity of a contamination issue in Russian oil that has now shut down 1 5 million barrels per day in delivery to refineries throughout Europe 
Even so  Friday s selloff was a signal that the upward momentum in oil could falter anytime  even with the  limited  restriction on Iranian oil now  we explain why below   separate U S  sanctions on Venezuela and a civil war in Libya  One negative for oil prices has been climbing U S  crude inventories
And for those who still believe in Goldman Sachs  forecasts    despite the Wall Street bank being more wrong than right these days on commodities    Brent prices have already topped out for this quarter at  75  That means the 40  gain that oil bulls are sitting on for this year may have maxed for now  and there are other buckets within commodities that could be offering better alpha 
Gold may be one of those areas  with the Fed expected to stick to its dovish script in the coming week s monthly policy meeting of the U S  central bank  Those long on the yellow metal are looking at recapturing  1 300 pricing despite being socked for most of last week by a strong dollar  To gold bugs  Friday s rebound particularly held promise it came after a vigorous quarterly reading for the U S  GDP that should rightly sparked a Wall Street rally 
Energy Review
To reiterate  it was a big week for oil  with the Trump cabinet ramping up effort to bring Iranian crude exports to zero and the Rouhani administration to its knees  Neither would happen  say analysts who point to Beijing s plans to continue buying oil from Tehran  and Iran s proven legacy of being immune to the dictates of various U S  presidents 
To many analysts it s still unimaginable that Trump  who needs low oil prices  would seek a virtual ban on Iranian supply amid the continued squeeze on global production by a very determined Saudi Arabia and ongoing outages in Venezuela and Libya  A year ago  the president seemed alright in accommodating some of the  evil  the Rouhani regime was capable of  with U S  midterm elections being just months away  But with the next presidential elections not until November 2020  and with a gleeful Saudi Arabia cheering from the sidelines at the prospect of its arch rival being choked off the market  dealing Iran the ultimate punishment seemed right in Trump s eyes 
Aside from Trump s disputable  call  to OPEC  the week was made more interesting by the Saudi Energy Minister s thoughtful reminder to the president that the U S  shouldn t count on the Kingdom to raise output immediately to make up for lost Iranian barrels  Khalid al Falih maintained that he would provide customers of Saudi oil with as much as supply as they needed  But none would of it would be made preemptively on the notion that the market was short on oil  because it simply wasn t  he added  It was shrewd Saudi speak for  show us the money and we ll show you the oil   At near  65 for WTI and  75 for Brent  Falih can afford to drag out production  And to an extent  he was right about the market being adequately supplied  with Orbital Insight  a Californian company using satellite trackers  reporting that global crude inventories were up more than 140 million barrels year on year 
The other dark horse for production is the organic chloride contamination apparently coming through the Russian Druzhba  Friendship  pipeline that suspended the delivery of an estimated 1 5 million barrels per day to European refineries  The Druzhba network is one of the world s largest and supplies refining plants in Germany  France and Italy while connecting smaller refineries throughout southeastern Europe  Seeking Alpha s energy writer Douglas Adams notes that cleanup could take weeks  even months  given the thousand of kilometers of pipeline that could possibly be involved 
In the energy corporate world  Occidental  NYSE OXY  s bid for Anadarko at  76 a share gave a heartburn to rival  Chevron   NYSE CVX  s  65 bid  Oxy s bid consisted of half cash and stock  while Chevron s was mostly stock  And that earlier bid was now worth even less  at around  62 a piece  with Chevron s stock decline in the past two weeks 
In natural gas  an inordinately large build of 92 billion cubic feet in last week s storage and prices under near three year lows raised questions on whether the fuel was cheap enough for U S  utilities to switch in droves from using coal

Precious Metals Review
After moving back and forth relentlessly on China and global economic concerns  gold started last week higher on the U S  Iran oil faceoff  which brought some old fashioned geopolitical tensions back into bullion 
From there  it was an uneven track for the yellow metal as the dollar made one high after another on resilient U S  data 
But the greenback s run also came to a halt by the end of the week after an overall strong U S  first quarter growth report was overshadowed by soft inflation data 
The core personal expenditures consumption price index figure  the Federal Reserve s preferred inflation gauge  increased at only a 1 3  rate versus 1 8  in the prior quarter  CNBC reported 
According to a Reuters poll  major central banks are done tightening policy as the global growth outlook has softened across developed and emerging economies  with scant prospects for a surge in inflation 
The soft global outlook could leave the Fed dovish again in its monthly policy meeting statement due on Wednesday  providing a boost for gold even when relatively strong U S  data should be beneficial for the dollar 
While gold has fallen more than 4  from a peak in February  bullion s recovery from last week s four month low painted a neutral picture on technical charts  Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said 
Goldman Sachs said central bank gold purchases have also been running strong  another factor that could underpin a return to  1 300 levels

192288,413804,CVX,Anadarko to negotiate sale to Occidental  superior  to Chevron deal,news,"By Arathy S Nair and David French  Reuters    Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC  said on Monday it would negotiate with Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY  over its  38 billion cash and stock bid  after determining it could get a better deal than its agreed  33 billion sale to  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  The development represents a breakthrough in Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub s two year effort to buy Anadarko  one of the top U S  oil and gas producers in the lucrative Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico  Anadarko announced a deal with Chevron on April 12 after snubbing a higher bid from Occidental  prompting Occidental to try to upend the Chevron deal   We hope Anadarko will proceed quickly to secure this superior transaction for its shareholders   an Occidental spokeswoman said  Anadarko said its board had unanimously decided that Occidental s offer could result in a  superior proposal  but added that its deal with Chevron remained in effect until it decided to cut a new deal with Occidental  Anadarko asked Chevron on Sunday if it wanted to raise its bid and Chevron declined  people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday  Chevron is reluctant to pay more for Anadarko and does not want to be drawn into a bidding war  the sources said  Chevron also wants to see if Occidental will manage to ink a deal for Anadarko  and whether Occidental shareholders will support it  one of the sources said   We believe our signed agreement with Anadarko provides the best value and the most certainty to Anadarko s shareholders   Chevron said in a statement on Monday  Chevron and Occidental are vying for one of the biggest prizes in the oil industry  Anadarko s nearly quarter million acre holdings in the core of the Permian Basin  the top U S  shale field  The two companies each control land adjacent to Anadarko s properties and expect a deal will add deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low cost drilling techniques  Occidental unveiled its bid for Anadarko last Wednesday  offering to pay for it half in cash and half with its own shares  Chevron s deal with Anadarko was structured as 25 percent cash and 75 percent stock  Occidental s stock was down 2 38 percent to  59 85  Anadarko shares were up 0 4 percent to  73 05  slightly below the value of Occidental s offer  OCCIDENTAL SHAREHOLDERS GET A SAY Under the terms of the merger agreement  Chevron has four days after being notified by Anadarko s board to respond with a counter offer  If Anadarko proceeds with a sale to Occidental  it will have to pay Chevron a  1 billion deal breakup fee  The acquisition of Anadarko would add nearly a quarter million acres to Occidental s holdings in the Permian shale basin  and double its global oil and gas production to 1 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day  A key hurdle that Occidental has to overcome in its negotiations with Anadarko is that its proposed deal is contingent on Occidental shareholders voting to approve it   These could make a deal more vulnerable to shareholder agitation  For example  activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP tried to shoot down Bristol Myers Co s  74 billion deal to acquire biotech  Celgene Corp   NASDAQ CELG  earlier this year by trying to convince Bristol Myers shareholders to vote it down  It was ultimately unsuccessful  A deal with Chevron offers more certainty to Anadarko in that regard  because Chevron shareholders will not be given a vote  Anadarko shareholders will be given a vote on the sale of the company  be it with Occidental or Chevron

192289,413805,CVX,Anadarko Board to Consider Occidental Bid ,news," Bloomberg     Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC   plans to resume talks about a potential  38 billion takeover by Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY    a move that threatens to scupper a previously agreed deal with  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX 
In a unanimous decision  Anadarko s board of directors determined the Occidental bid  could reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal   the company said in a statement Monday  It added that an earlier agreement to merge with Chevron remains in effect 
The move sets the stage for Chevron to come back with a sweetened offer  Under the terms of the companies  April 12 merger agreement  if Anadarko formally declares the Occidental offer to be superior  Chevron then has four days to make another proposal  While it has ample financial firepower to top Occidental s offer  it may opt instead to avoid an expensive bidding war  Taking the  1 billion break up fee that s part of their accord and walking away would be an acceptable outcome for Chevron  Jefferies LLC analysts Jason Gammel and Daniela Almeida said 
 Chevron CEO Mike Wirth s mantra is  costs matter    the analysts wrote in a note that came out just before the Anadarko statement   Chevron s primary rationale for the acquisition is return enhancement  which erodes as the cost increases  
Anadarko shares were unchanged as  72 80 at 8 14 a m  in early trading in New York  while Occidental dropped 1 2 percent  Chevron was little changed 
 We hope Anadarko will proceed quickly to securing this superior transaction for its shareholders   Occidental spokeswoman Melissa Schoeb said in a statement 
The tussle for Anadarko has transfixed the oil industry over the past two weeks  A takeout of the company would be the largest deal in the sector in at least four years  Chevron and Occidental are targeting the company to expand their presence in the Permian Basin  the world s largest oil patch 
Occidental went public April 24 with a bid to buy Anadarko for  76 per share in cash and stock  That compares with Chevron s agreement to buy The Woodlands  Texas based Anadarko for  65 a share 
Based on the current per share valuations of the bids  Occidental s proposal is about  7 billion higher than Chevron s  compared with a difference about  5 billion when the deal was first announced   We believe our signed agreement with Anadarko provides the best value and the most certainty to Anadarko s shareholders   Chevron said Monday in an emailed statement 
Investor Vote
That valuation gap has created pressure from investors  New York based investment firm D E  Shaw urged the company to run an open sale process  people familiar with the matter said last week 
Although Occidental s offer is higher  the company s smaller size and balance sheet compared with Chevron have raised uncertainty over its ability to complete a deal  Unlike Chevron  Occidental would also have to put the deal to a shareholder vote 
 We believe the market has already priced in a higher bid from Chevron   Jefferies  Gammel and Almeida said   We don t expect that a sweetened Chevron bid would need to meet Oxy s given the Anadarko board s evident preference for Chevron stock

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 30 46   A quarter ago  it was expected that this oil company would post earnings of  1 26 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 39  delivering a surprise of 10 32  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Chevron  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   International industry  posted revenues of  38 85 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 80   This compares to year ago revenues of  42 24 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Chevron shares have added about 11  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17 8  
What s Next for Chevron 
While Chevron has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Chevron was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

192295,413811,CVX,Chevron  CVX  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Chevron  CVX  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 2  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 80 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 1  
Revenues are expected to be  42 49 billion  up 0 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6 51  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Chevron 
For Chevron  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 21  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Chevron will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Chevron would post earnings of  1 26 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 39  delivering a surprise of  10 32  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Chevron doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chevron-cvx-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200445734,200445734

 Occidental believes its proposal is superior both financially and strategically for Anadarko s shareholders  creating a global energy leader with the scale and geographic diversification to drive growth and deliver compelling value and returns to the shareholders of both companies   the company said in a statement Wednesday

Investing com   After a first quarter blitzkrieg  oil bulls are eyeing another home run in April  coming within cents of reaching their  65 target for U S  crude last week before being stopped by fresh builds in U S  rigs and inventory  as well as questions about oil demand and the economy 
West Texas Intermediateand global oil benchmark Brent rose for a sixth straight week as Libya s civil war put a geopolitical premium on a market already squeezed by OPEC cuts and U S  sanctions on Venezuelan and Iranian oil  WTI is up 6  thus far for April while Brent has gained 5  after first quarter advances of about 30  for both 
Gold had a less illustrious week  The yellow metal initially soared above  1 300 on speculation that the Federal Reserve might succumb to pressure from President Donald Trump to lower interest rates  But it sunk back beneath that bullish level after minutes from Fed s monthly meeting showed central bankers might move toward a rate hike instead if the economy picked up 
Energy Review
The week started strongly for fund managers and other speculators long on oil as the worsening military conflict in Libya returned the OPEC member to the forefront of the market s attention after it had been obscured lately by the happenings in Iran and Venezuela 
Libya had  in fact  been on the news from the previous weekend after rebel general Khalifa Haftar  ordered his troops to march from his Benghazi domain on the east to the capital Tripoli in an attempt to unseat the U N  recognized administration there 
The North African country  which produces about 1 1 million barrels per day of oil  has been vulnerable since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gadaffi  Haftar s forces control more than 40  of Libya s oilfields and the key ports that export its crude 
By the time trading settled on Tuesday to await weekly supply demand data from the U S  Energy Information Administration  WTI had tacked on 3 5  gain for the week and hit a five month high of  64 79 
The EIA numbers  released the following day  showed crude inventories building to an eye watering 7 million barrels  more than three times what the market anticipated  But the EIA also reported a stunning draw of 8 million barrels in gasoline stockpiles  about four times what analysts had expected  Instead of plunging  WTI gained another 1  
Oil bulls did have their day of reckoning on Thursday though  The Paris based International Energy Agency  which looks after the interest of energy consumers in the West  suggested in its April report that the rise of more than  20 per barrel since January may be beyond what the economy could withstand 
Reuters also quoted an OPEC source as saying that global oil producers might decide to end their output cuts by July if the Libya  Venezuelan and Iranian supply crises wasn t resolved by then 
The combination of these dovish messages brought crude prices down by more than 1 5  in Thursday s settlement 
But by the next session  the market was up on Libyan tensions again as Haftar threatened to wipe out the country s oil exports although advances by his troops had weakened in recent days 
The market also shrugged off another weekly  albeit small  rise in the U S  oil rig count  settling the week up 1  on WTI and 2  for Brent

Precious Metals Review
Bullion  as well as gold futures  hit  1 300 as the week began on speculation that the Federal Reserve could hit the easing button for rates to placate Trump who blames anemic U S  growth on the central bank s four rate hikes last year 
Spot gold  reflective of trades in bullion  was down  1 20  or 0 1   at  1 291 52 an ounce by 1 50 PM ET  17 50 GMT  
Gold s gains extended on Tuesday after the U S  Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods  which aee meant to last at least three years or more  fell 1 6  in February 
By the time New York s precious metals markets settled on Wednesday before the Fed released its monthly meeting minutes  spot gold had gained almost 1 5  on the week and hit a near one month high of  1 310 65 
Much of that was rolled back in the next session in a negative belated reaction to the central bank s minutes that indicated the Fed may not be done with its tightening despite its pause now 
As the week ended  prices for bullion and gold futures diverged in a rare performance as investors tried to discern direction for the yellow metal amid conflicting data and fundamentals  Spot gold ended the week a touch lower and Comex futures marginally higher though both remained under  1 300

192304,413820,CVX,TOT Or CVX  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Oil and Gas   Integrated   International sector might want to consider either TOTAL S A   TOT  or Chevron  CVX   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
TOTAL S A  has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Chevron has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This means that TOT s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
TOT currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 38  while CVX has a forward P E of 16 62  We also note that TOT has a PEG ratio of 1 17  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  CVX currently has a PEG ratio of 3 68 
Another notable valuation metric for TOT is its P B ratio of 1 17  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  CVX has a P B of 1 53 
These metrics  and several others  help TOT earn a Value grade of B  while CVX has been given a Value grade of C 
TOT stands above CVX thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that TOT is the superior value option right now ",2019-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tot-or-cvx-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200438922,200438922

192317,413833,CVX,Exclusive  Venezuela s PDVSA braces for low output from crucial crude upgraders,news,"By Mircely Guanipa and Deisy Buitrago PUNTO FIJO CARACAS  Reuters    Venezuelan state owned oil company PDVSA expects its crucial crude upgraders to operate well below capacity this month  according to industry sources and documents seen by Reuters  as U S  sanctions and energy blackouts hit the OPEC nation s oil industry  Venezuela depends on the upgraders  which are mostly operated by joint ventures with foreign companies  to convert the extra heavy crude oil produced in the Orinoco Belt into exportable grades usable in overseas refineries  Together  they have a capacity of some 700 000 barrels per day   Prolonged power outages have been adding to problems blending and exporting crude  as PDVSA s main oil port  Jose  in northeastern Venezuela remained paralyzed  The Petropiar and Petromonagas upgraders  part owned by U S  oil major  Chevron   NYSE CVX  and Russian giant Rosneft respectively  have not fully restarted since a March 7 blackout  Petrocedeno  part owned by France s Total and Norway s Equinor  stopped working after a second blackout on March 25  as did PDVSA s fully owned Petrosanfelix   The upgraders are still halted   oil workers  union leader Jose Bodas said   According to an internal PDVSA document seen by Reuters this week  Petropiar and Petrocedeno are  in the process of restarting    Petromonagas is expected to undergo  cleaning and repair  this month after maintenance workers found two of its furnaces were obstructed by waste products  while a maintenance process at Petrosanfelix was halted  according to the document   The upgraders are not expected to increase processing   an internal PDVSA document detailing planning for the month of April reads   It said Petrosanfelix was unlikely to restart  while the remaining three would likely process crude at reduced rates  One industry source  speaking on the condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to speak publicly  said the blockages of Petromonagas  furnaces was likely to keep the upgrader out of commission for 20 days   The source said the company had canceled all its shipments of upgraded crude for April   Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela s oil ministry responded to a request for comment  Total declined to comment  while Chevron referred questions to Petropiar  which like all oil joint ventures in Venezuela is controlled by PDVSA  Rosneft and Equinor did not respond to requests for comment   EXPORTS TUMBLED IN FEBRUARY The blackouts have presented an additional obstacle for President Nicolas Maduro s efforts to halt a years long drop in oil output  Venezuela s main source of government revenue  The decline in production is expected to accelerate after the United States sanctioned PDVSA in late January  as part of its bid to oust Maduro from power  Exports fell about 40 percent in February in the immediate aftermath of the sanctions  but remained stable in March at slightly below 1 million barrels per day  bpd   To keep exports stable with limited upgrading capacity  PDVSA will need to import diluents   light crude or heavy naphtha   that can be blended directly with extra heavy oil from the Orinoco belt to make exportable grades   But the sanctions blocked U S  companies  previously the main suppliers of diluents to Venezuela  from selling the products to PDVSA   The Petrosinovensa blending facility  a joint venture of PDVSA and China s CNPC that produces Merey crude  was producing about 60 percent of the 132 000 bpd of upgraded crude it planned to produce  the PDVSA document showed   To avoid a further drop in exports  the country has recently turned to Rosneft for supply of diluents  according to the industry source and Refinitiv Eikon data

192323,413839,CVX,Cash Grab  3 Beaten Up Big Yield Contrarian Plays,opinion,"Seven percent dividends 
That s what my 18 favorite stocks and funds yield on average in my  No Withdrawal  Retirement Portfolio  And it s that very yield that gives the critically acclaimed portfolio its name  Investors collect so much income every month that they don t need to pull out their nest egg to make ends meet 
The regular dividend checks pay the regular bills 
That yield  by the way  was higher just a few months ago  but as prices go up  yields go down   and prices across the portfolio have been going up  up  up 
That s no happy accident that s a vital component to a successful retirement portfolio that many advisors and financial pundits too often miss  You still have to grow your money 
That s why we emphasize price upside via factors such as 
Dividend growth  Stock prices will literally chase dividends higher as investors see rapidly increasing income potential and buy in to get theirs 
Savvy stock and bond pickers  Targeting funds with expert management tends to lead to growth in net asset value  NAV   and the price of the fund itself typically heads higher in kind 
Value  Buying stocks at cheap P Es  real estate investment trusts  REITs  at cheap P FFOs and funds that trade at a discount to NAV gives these investments more room to run in the future  It s the core of contrarian investing  and it s often rewarded richly 
This is one of my favorite examples of an unloved  under the radar play that my subscribers pounced on for fantastic results  They banked a dividend hike  NAV growth  and the fund went from value priced to premium priced  The result  A 41  total return  including dividends  in just 15 months 
Contrarians Buy Low  Sell High

As I mentioned before  the market has been very kind to my 18 plays and to many different pockets of the market  Indeed  it s difficult to find contrarian plays when Wall Street has so much love for so many stocks 
Luckily for us  even bull markets make mistakes  A few stocks and funds out there are presenting contrarian setups and boast the kinds of sky high yields  between 6 3  and 8 0   that retirees can count on in their golden years 
Let s take a look 
Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY 
Dividend Yield  6 3 
Occidental Petroleum  OXY  is one of the most interesting out of favor bets on the market right now  because it s one being made by none other than the Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha himself  Warren Buffett 
Occidental  an integrated energy company that operates in the U S   Latin America and the Middle East  has dropped in half since 2011  In an effort to turn things around  Occidental crashed Chevron s CVX buyout bid of exploration firm Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC  with an offer of its own one that included a  10 billion investment from Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   BRK B  
An acquisitive energy company that yields 6  plus and has Uncle Warren s backing  What s not to love 
Well  for starters  Chevron s bid of  33 billion represented a 40  premium for Anadarko and Occidental topped it by  5 billion  Including debt  the deal is actually worth  50 billion  so it paid a very  very dear price for those assets  which included 1 47 billion barrels of oil equivalent  BOE  in proved reserves  On top of that  Occidental now owes Chevron  NYSE CVX  an extra  1 billion because Anadarko broke its deal to accept OXY s offer 
Also  Buffett  in typical Buffett fashion  secured himself a too sweet deal for his  10 billion investment  Namely  analysts believed Occidental could ve issued regular preferreds to investors at about 6   but the company will pay out 8  in preferred dividends to Buffett as part of the agreement 
And that s the clincher that makes me wary of OXY right now 
Buffett s bet on the Permian Basin wasn t a yield chase in Occidental s common shares it was a low risk wager on its preferreds  via a rich deal that no ordinary investor ever would have gotten  A  10 billion investment is no small thing  but it also wasn t a full confidence swing  either  Meanwhile  Occidental s debt profile has taken a turn for the worse  and there s even less room for OXY to continue its already glacial pace of dividend increases 
We can find safer  better sources of high yield 
Invesco Dynamic Credit Opportunities  VTA 
Dividend Yield  6 8 
Skilled management can be worth well than its expenses in any investment vehicle  But when you re dealing with an inaccessible alternative field such as bank loans  a steady guiding hand is downright necessary 
Enter Scott Baskind  Nuno Caetano and Philip Yarrow  the three managers overseeing Invesco Dynamic Credit Opportunities  NYSE VTA   which invests in floating or variable senior loans across numerous industries and geographic regions  This trio boasts a combined 47 years of tenure with Invesco  and more years of experience piled atop that 
That experience shows  The closed end fund has pummeled the iShares Barclays Aggregate Bond Fund  NYSE AGG  benchmark in almost every major time period  including a 10 year average annual return of 10 4  that dwarfs the Agg s 3 9  
VTA Triples AGG Over the Last 10 Years

The fund itself is about three quarters invested in first lien loans  13  in bonds  and small allocations to second lien loans  structured products and other debt  Almost all of it is below investment grade  though more than 70  of it is at least in the upper levels of junk  Moody s Ba and B ratings  And there is some international diversity  72  of the fund is American loans  but there s single digit exposure to the U K   Luxembourg  Sweden and France  too 
VTA commands a premium price  Its 3 5  in annual expenses is high even by CEF standards  But there simply aren t many funds that do what Invesco Dynamic Credit Opportunities does  and does so well  But you are getting a discount right now an 11  discount to the fund s net asset value  NAV   which means you re essentially paying 89 cents on the dollar for VTA s well selected holdings 
CBRE Clarion Global Real Estate Income Fund  IGR 
Dividend Yield  8 0 
Real estate investment trusts  REITs  are one of the most well known sources of high yield  But throw in a global twist and the income juicing properties of CEFs  and you have a recipe for truly substantial income 
Enter the CBRE Clarion Global Real Estate Income Fund  NYSE IGR  
CBRE s closed end fund  CEF  is a diversified way to get access to real estate  For one  it offers the implied geographic diversity  In addition to 42 2  exposure to U S  REIT common stocks  it also has high single digit exposure to continental Europe  Japan and Hong Kong  and smaller holdings in several other countries  But it also currently allocates about 19  of its assets to U S  REIT preferred stocks  which deliver high yield but do limit the fund s growth potential 
The good news is  this high yield vehicle is available for a 15  discount to its NAV a fantastic bargain for such a high headline yield 
The bad news is  IGR has a spotty performance record  Its five year average of 4 5  is just a hair below the indexed Vanguard Global ex U S  Real Estate ETF  VNQI   which also happens to have much cheaper annual fees 
It s good  But it s not a bulletproof high yield play 
How to  2008 Proof  Your Portfolio and Collect 8 4   Dividends
Stocks are yet again near all time highs  and all time frothy valuations   which means there s so much farther for stocks to fall should reality not match investors  sky high expectations 
You need more than just high yields  You need stocks that can protect and grow your portfolio the next time the market pulls a 2018   or heaven forbid  a 2008   style tantrum 
In fact  the late 2018 wipeout was precisely what prompted me to create my new 5 stock 8 4   Pullback Proof  portfolio 
The 5 stocks inside this unique portfolio shine in comparison to the three high yield plays we just examined  particularly in two vital ways 
They pay bigger dividends  As the name implies  these 5 buys pay a safe 7 5   on average today  And that s just the average  One of these unsung picks pays a rock steady 8 4  dividend 
They re even cheaper  This sets us up for bigger upside  particularly when the crowd finally clues in to the coming interest rate cut  I m calling for fast 7  to 15  price gains from these 5  steady Eddie  picks  in addition to their huge cash dividends 
The bottom line 
If you re worried about a 2008 repeat  these 5 stocks are for you  They re each set to let you pocket their outsized 7 5  dividends without fear that the underlying share price will crumble beneath your feet 
To see what I mean  consider pick No  2 of these 5 stocks  In 2018  a year most folks would rather forget  this battle tested REIT soared double digits 
Big Gains in a Market Slump

And that 13 5  gain doesn t even include this stock s rock solid 8  dividend  which lucky owners of this sturdy stock collected the entire time 
That s a classic pullback proof dividend in action  and you ll see this story played out again and again across this 5 stock  8 4  paying  mini portfolio

192324,413840,CVX,All the world a stage  Rising U S  oil clout on show in Houston,news,"By Ron Bousso and David Gaffen HOUSTON  Reuters    A glance at the attendee list at one of the world s largest energy industry events in Houston this week left little question about the growing influence of the United States over global oil politics  Present  top U S  diplomat Mike Pompeo  Absent  leading Saudi and Russian officials  and most OPEC nations  As the United States weans itself off foreign oil imports   thanks to booming domestic production   the complex web of politics and business interests that have shaped decades of Washington s energy diplomacy in the Middle East and beyond is changing  That shift was unmistakable in Houston this week  In his keynote address  Pompeo spoke of exploiting the power the United States is accruing through rising energy supply in  punishing bad actors   he laid out a vision of working with energy firms to isolate Iran and Venezuela  and he emphasized the need to protect oil supplies by countering China s moves to control the South China Sea  The Secretary of State delivered the half hour speech to a packed room of energy executives  while dozens more watched via jumbo screens at the adjacent convention center   It marked the type of reception usually reserved for the Saudis and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  When OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo addressed the conference a day earlier  the auditorium was half empty  The speech itself was a far cry from past addresses by OPEC heavyweights  Barkindo called for cooperation with the shale industry  which has helped drive U S  oil output to more than 12 million barrels per day  bpd   making the United States the world s largest producer   Graphic    Just two years ago  Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al Falih delivered a combative keynote speech warning U S  shale executives that OPEC would not carry  free riders  in its efforts to balance world oil supply and demand  It turned out to be an empty threat  and a reflection of how OPEC had struggled to deal with the surge in U S  energy production  POMPEO MEETS BIG OIL Beyond his keynote at the Houston conference   the first ever for a sitting Secretary of State at the gathering known as CERAWeek   Pompeo circulated among executives in closed door meetings  even  according to a source  hosting a group informally at Pappasito s Cantina  a Mexican restaurant in the Hilton Americas Hotel where the conference took place    I m not used to it  but I think it s great   said Vicki Hollub  chief executive of Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY   saying she was impressed by Pompeo and his team s outreach  Occidental has been one of the biggest winners from the surge of U S  shale exports   In one private meeting on Tuesday  Pompeo and his State Department energy adviser Frank Fannon sat down with big oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa    BP  plc  LON BP   Occidental and  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  At that meeting  first reported by Reuters  Pompeo talked about how the government and the world s top energy companies could work together to encourage U S  allies to buy more of its oil  according to two sources familiar with the discussion  He also asked for their cooperation on Iran  The Trump administration has imposed hefty sanctions on Iran and Venezuela  both OPEC members  with growing confidence that there is enough oil from the U S  and elsewhere to deal with any supply disruptions  So far  that bet has panned out   global oil prices are currently less than  70 a barrel  Coming into office  President Donald Trump promised to deregulate the energy industry and assert U S  oil independence   a sharp turn from an Obama administration that  while placing sanctions on Iran s oil exports  largely built its energy policy around renewables and reducing emissions   Aided by rising shale production and new technology that has made pumping U S  crude less costly  Trump has also been able to publicly lean on OPEC  frequently taking to Twitter to urge members to increase output to keep prices low   Under the Trump administration the U S  feels far more emboldened by our oil and gas production and the support and alliance they feel with Saudi Arabia   said Sarah Ladislaw  who leads energy policy analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies   Washington s growing influence  she added  has already started to shift oil politics among allies and adversaries across the world   Saudi Arabia and Russia in September  for instance  informed the U S  before speaking to OPEC allies when they reached an agreement to boost production ahead of the official restart of sanctions on Iran   L8N1WJ5M6  In addition to the Middle East  the Trump administration is hoping to use U S  exports of liquefied natural gas  LNG  to Europe to counter the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas from Russia  Germany in February said it would consider building two LNG terminals to import from the United States  bowing to U S  pressure to diversify supply after Trump termed Nord Stream 2 a  horrific  project that would make Berlin more reliant on Russia    We don t want our European allies hooked on Russian gas through the Nord Stream II project  any more than we ourselves want to be dependent on Venezuelan oil supplies   Pompeo told the conference  LESS OPEC  OPEC had its smallest representation for at least five years at the event  Saudi Arabia sent no senior speakers  though that was in part because state run Saudi Aramco held board meetings in Riyadh this week   OPEC is a less important player because the United States is the number one producer of oil  natural gas and refined products   said Mike Sommers  president of U S  industry group the American Petroleum Agency  at the conference  The U S  Department of Energy sent its largest contingent ever  it told Reuters  without giving a specific number   OPEC has responded to the growing influence of U S  production by forging an alliance with Russia and other non OPEC producers to curtail supplies from a wider swathe of the global energy industry   Graphic     The most relevant aspect of OPEC now is where it has reached beyond its organization  which is Russia  and whether that can be sustained or formalized   said Suzanne Maloney  deputy director of the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution  There have been mixed signals on that front  Russia s Igor Sechin  head of oil giant Rosneft  has expressed support for ending production cuts  believing OPEC s deal plays into shale s hands because it underpins prices   They  OPEC  know they cannot do it alone  To swing the pendulum from left to right in terms of production to make sure you get the price that you want  you still need other producers   said Saidu Muhammad  chief gas and power operating officer at Nigerian National Petroleum Corp

to multi year lows On the news front  Chevron moved closer to its goal of pulling out of UK exploration and production after selling bulk of its North Sea oil and gas assets to Israel s Delek group for  2 billion  Meanwhile  Canadian Natural Resources Limited announced that it has decided to buy Devon Energy s assets in Canada for C 3 8 billion Overall  it was a dismal week for the sector  West

optimization of portfolio in high return U S  shale plays  especially the Permian Basin The deal brings Chevron much closer to its goal of withdrawing from the aging North Sea  in a bid to streamline portfolio  The move is part of Chevron s strategic review of global portfolio to determine the competitiveness of all its projects  The decision seems to be a prudent one  as extracting oil from North Sea is not so economical since production costs are much higher than returns  With North Sea accounting for just around 3  of production  the company had put most of its assets in the region for sale

The market had been hit on Monday by a series of negative announcements  starting with weak economic data in China and culminating in U S  criminal charges against Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei 
The Justice Department unveiled two cases against the Chinese technology giant  One indictment accused the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T Mobile  while the second indictment claimed the company violated Iran sanctions 
 Today we are announcing that we are bringing criminal charges against telecommunications giant Huawei and its associates for nearly two dozen alleged crimes   Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said in a statement   China must hold its citizens and Chinese companies accountable for complying with the law  
the move came only two days before Chinese Vice Premier Liu He meets a U S  delegation led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer for talks aimed at de escalating a trade war that has slowed global growth  and consequently global demand for oil 
The only supportive factor of note Monday was that the U S  also announced sanctions against Venezuela s state owned oil company PDVSA  a move that could tighten supplies marginally 
The measures effectively block the regime of President Nicolas Maduro from exporting crude to the U S   and add to the pressure on him to step aside for Juan Guaido  the opposition leader who proclaimed himself interim president last week 
Citing three sources with knowledge  Reuters reported that PDVSA had requested its customers with tankers waiting to load Venezuelan crude bound for the United States to prepay for the cargoes before they leave the ports 
 They are not allowing tankers bound for Valero  Citgo and  Chevron   NYSE CVX  to leave Venezuelan ports if not prepaid   a PDVSA source told Reuters  referring to a decision by the company s trade and supply division ",2019-01-29,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-prices-gain-as-investors-weigh-sanctions-against-venezuela-sinous-tensions-1760934,1760934

192361,413877,CVX,Shell  RDS A  Starts Appomattox Production Ahead Of Schedule,opinion,With the global offshore oil industry gradually witnessing a rebound  Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  has been making remarkable progress in deepwater projects of late  The European oil giant recently commenced production at its Appomattox offshore platform in Gulf of Mexico  GoM  months ahead of the scheduled

their offshore projects amid the crude downturn  Shell decided to go ahead with the Appomattox deepwater project in GoM Norphlet formation amid the challenging business scenario The Anglo Dutch supermajor has been betting on cost and technology efficiencies to make the project more competitive since then  Notably  it has managed to lower the cost of Appomattox by 40  since the final investment decision  FID  on the project  Simplified designs  batch drilling and innovative  optimized development planning brought down the costs  The average peak production from the multi billion deepwater project is estimated to be 175 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  Boe d  The Appomattox development is also expected to act as a core long term hub for Shell in deepwater Norphlet reservoir that can be tied back to numerous discovered fields as well as future discoveries Shell  A Deepwater PowerhouseDeepwater development activities have been severely affected by the crude downturn  However  with recovering oil prices  this segment of the oil industry is gradually picking up pace  with Shell leading the way  Superior technology  capital efficiency  efficient execution and structural re engineering are enabling the company to remain competitive in the deepwater industry  Since 2014  the company has managed to trim its unit development and operating costs of its deepwater projects by 45   By 2020  the company expects around 900 000 Boe d from its deepwater projects Apart from Appomattox  the energy major has other important GoM projects in its kitty like Kaikias and Vito among others  The company commenced production from Kaikias in June 2018  a year ahead of schedule and also managed to lower the cost of the project by 30  since its FID in 2017  It also green lit Vito project in 2018  slashing its price tag around 70  from the original project design Last year  Shell also discovered a large deepwater well  the Dover well  in the Norphlet geologic play in the U S  GoM   marking its sixth oil and natural gas find in the region  The company has been focusing on exploration opportunities in the prolific Norphlet play  which will be tied

BP   slashed project costs from  20 billion to  9 billion However  effective cost controls and recovering oil prices have made offshore operations attractive again  Further  pipeline bottlenecks in shale plays like the Permian Basin have reduced producers  margins in recent times  Improving the infrastructure will take time and need investments  Hence  investing in offshore production is an attractive option at the moment The U S  offshore industry has been witnessing signs of revival with new project sanctions growing steadily  Per Rystad Energy  oil and gas finders committed to more

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
TOTAL S A  has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Chevron has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that TOT is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value

192368,413884,CVX,The Battle For Anadarko  Will Chevron Outbid Occidental ,opinion,Chevron Corporation   NYSE CVX   and Occidental Petroleum Corporation   NYSE OXY   are locked in a titanic battle over oil and gas producer Anadarko Petroleum Corporation   NYSE APC    At stake is Anadarko s 250 000 net acres in the fastest growing oil producing region in the world   the Permian basin spread over west Texas and New Mexico   The Story So FarChevron Announces It s Buying Anadarko  On Apr 12  America s No  2 energy producer  Chevron announced a roughly  50 billion deal to buy Texas based upstream company  Anadarko  The acquisition will give it access to potentially lucrative Permian Basin acreage  LNG operations in Mozambique  as well as attractive deepwater areas in the Gulf of Mexico The buyout was touted as the eleventh largest corporate deal ever involving an energy and power company and is the largest since Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  s  acquisition of BG Group plc in 2016  The agreement is subject to Anadarko stockholder approval and regulatory clearance and is expected to close in the second half of 2019 Anadarko s shares soared more than 32  following the proposal A Look at the Transaction  Under the terms of the agreement  Anadarko shareholders will receive  16 25 in cash and 0 3869 shares of Chevron for each Anadarko share they own  This combination of cash and stock values Anadarko shares at  65 apiece  a 37  premium to the pre announcement closing price The cash component of the deal is worth about  8 billion  while the equity contribution will be obtained through the issuance of approximately 200 million in Chevron shares  The headline price of  50 billion includes the assumption of  15 billion of Anadarko s debt Rumors Surface About Occidental s Interest  Meanwhile  word broke out that Occidental had been working to buy Anadarko since late March and reportedly bid as much as  75 a share for the company  more than Chevron s  65 and with a higher cash component  The motive was the same   become the largest crude producer the Permian Basin  where Occidental owns the most acreage  around 2 5 million acres  followed by Chevron  2 2 million acres  Widely regarded as the dominant domestic growth area for onshore oil output  the  super  basin is currently producing just above 4 million barrels daily  almost double that of two years ago  and is expected to churn out another 1 million barrels per day by early 2020   more than any OPEC country other than Saudi Arabia  Importantly  experts say that it s cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin   at around  35  40 per barrel   as compared to most other major fields Occidental  Officially  Tops Chevron s Bid  On Apr 24  Occidental officially tendered its offer for the purchase of Anadarko  It offered to purchase the upstream operator at a price of  76 per share   38 in cash and 0 6094 of its shares for each share of Anadarko   or roughly  57 billion  including debt   which is a 16 9  increase from Chevron s  65 a share deal  Moreover  Occidental is offering 50  in cash and 50  in shares compared to Chevron 25  cash and 75  shares offer In order to finance such a massive acquisition  compared to its own scale and size   Occidental has agreed to sell Anadarko s African assets to French supermajor TOTAL SA   NYSE TOT   for  8 8 billion once the transaction is complete  The company also brokered a deal with Berkshire Hathaway  wherein Warren Buffet s firm will invest  10 billion into Occidental preferred shares Anadarko shares gained a

  On May 6  Anadarko s board declared Occidental s  38 billion takeover offer as superior to the one it earlier accepted from Chevron What Happens Next Anadarko s acceptance of Occidental s bid has thrown down the gauntlet to San Ramon  CA based Chevron to come up with a better offer  Conversely  it can walk away with a billion dollar in breakup fee Analysts and industry watchers are expecting a higher counter bid from Chevron considering that Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Anadarko preferred the supermajor s lower bid initially even when Occidental was ready to shell out up to  75 per share You can see  Also  while Occidental claims that proposed deal will be highly accretive to cash flows based on potential annual synergies to the tune of  3 5 billion  the company has come under fire from certain quarters for paying an  expensive  price  As it is  Occidental faces hurdles to sell the deal to its own shareholders amid increasing backlash over the high payoff to Berkshire Chevron  which has until Friday to respond  no doubt has the financial muscle to indulge into a costly bidding war  It s also no secret that the company would love to get Anadarko s attractive worldwide assets  especially the promise of becoming top acreage holder in the booming Permian basin  At the same time  it seems highly unlikely that Chevron would a make counter offer  well above  Occidental s Instead  Chevron might just find strategic rationale in upping its bid a little bit to match slightly exceed Occidental s offer and see what happens  Thereafter  it might just decide to pocket the  1 billion

192369,413885,CVX,Does Chevron Know The Value Of Shale Oil And Gas ,opinion,"Welcome to the bidding war that didn t happen 
The decision last week by international oil giant Chevron Corp   NYSE CVX  to leave its takeover bid for shale oil and gas heavy Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC  in the wake of a higher offer from rival bidder Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY  surprised some who had expected a back and forth escalation between the two competitors 
Chevron s CEO told Bloomberg   Winning in any environment doesn t mean winning at any cost   Chevron s hesitancy to pay up for Anadarko s assets suggests a measured assessment about what Anadarko might deliver  one tempered by emerging political developments and perhaps a less sanguine view about the durability of the shale boom 
Anadarko  after all  has considerable operations in Colorado which recently enacted a bill increasing the ability of municipalities to curtail oil and gas development  authorizing more stringent air quality monitoring and rules  and turning the commission which was tasked with  fostering  oil and gas development into one which actually regulates it  That spells less oil and gas development in a state that has been critical to Anadarko and to the shale boom 
The promoters of shale oil and gas investment are pretending as if the kind of backlash which happened in Colorado could not occur elsewhere  Don t count on that being the case 
Beyond this  energy writer Nick Cunningham summarizes the most recent update of prospects for shale hydrocarbons released by a skeptical Post Carbon Institute  Issues identified by the institute way back in 2012 have continued to unfold as foretold  All the technological improvements since then are only hastening the day when production will turn down according to the report s author  Simply put  production from oil and gas shale deposits is being  frontloaded   That implies that when the decline comes  it s likely to be surprisingly steep   The precipitous decline of Mexico s giant Cantarell oil field after a technique known as nitrogen injection supercharged production for several years provides a cautionary tale  
During the height of a boom  promoters who stand to profit forecast a long prosperous future ahead  a never ending cornucopia that will fill the pockets of those smart enough to invest now  But as anyone who has lived long enough knows  the time to sell is when just this kind of narrative is being offered 
The current momentum could carry the boom further  Actively betting against it might prove costly in the short run  But simply leaving the party a little early might be wise when compared to the ugly hangover that is likely to ensue if one continues to party until the boom winds down  That could happen as early as the next recession or when the portion of drillers  exploration and development budgets devoted to merely replacing lost production from these fast declining wells reaches 100 percent  whichever comes first ",2019-05-13,Kurt Cobb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/does-chevron-know-exactly-what-shale-oil-and-gas-are-worth-200420585,200420585
192370,413886,CVX,Bull Of The Day  Anadarko  APC ,opinion,"The Deal
The bidding war for Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC  Corporation  APC  is ostensibly over with Chevron  CVX  unable unwilling to match Occidental s  OXY   38 billion bid  Chevron walks away with a  1 billion breakup fee  which it will use to buy back stock  and Occidental walks away with Anadarko  Occidental will be acquiring APC for  59 in cash and 0 2934 a share  adding up to  74 89 a share as of close yesterday  This will represent a 2 9  premium for APC s current shareholders if this deal goes through as planned  APC closed yesterday at  72 79 
Occidental is funding this deal with the help of Warren Buffet and his holding company Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  as well as a little help from Total SA  PA TOTF   TTFNF   Berkshire Hathaway committed to buying  10 billion in preferred stock to support the Anadarko acquisition  Total SA agreed to purchase Anadarko s African assets for  8 8 billion which is primarily made up of liquefied natural gas  Both these deals are the contingent factors of Occidental s acquisition of Anadarko and create some risk if one of them were to fall through 
APC has fallen 4 15  since they agreed to go with Occidental s offer  Shareholders were hoping for a bidding war between OXY and CVX to raise the price even further  Now APC s stock price is going to be completely correlated with both the perceived risk of the deal and OXY s stock price  Every  3 41 change in OXY s stock price  6  change  will have a  1 effect on APC s shareholder compensation  1 4   when the deal does go through 
Many of Occidental s current stockholders are concerned that they are paying too much for Anadarko  but since the firm is issuing less than 20  of its total equity for this acquisition  it doesn t require stockholder approval 
Occidental is paying a 19  premium for Anadarko but the synergies in the Permian Basin will make it worth it  Currently  Occidental s Delaware Basin  part of the Permian  wells perform 74  better than Anadarko s and spending less on each well  Occidental s operations are superior to Anadarko s and will increase their productivity significantly once the deal goes through 
Conclusion
I am confident that this deal will go through with funding secured from Berkshire Hathaway and Total SA s lucrative deal  The question is when this deal will go through  I might wait to see this stock track down with the rest of the market on trade concerns and buy it at a more equitable price  Beware if this deal does not go through APC will plummet  None the less  I believe this short term investment has a very high chance of success  APC   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

192381,413897,CVX,Venezuela s PDVSA inks oil deal with firm part owned by Florida Republican,news,"By Luc Cohen and Brian Ellsworth CARACAS  Reuters    Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA  PDVSA UL  has signed a deal with little known U S  energy firm Erepla that is part owned by a prominent Florida Republican to help increase the socialist run country s plummeting crude oil output  the company said   Erepla Services LLC  part owned by Republican Harry Sargeant III and which Delaware state records show was only registered two months ago  said it plans to invest up to  500 million to increase production at three Venezuelan oil fields in exchange for a portion of the crude produced  The arrangement faces significant hurdles including obtaining an exemption from Trump administration sanctions that block U S  companies from providing financing to the government of President Nicolas Maduro or Venezuelan state firms   It is a further sign that Venezuela is tapping inexperienced firms to stem massive declines in crude output as more established oil companies steer clear of the troubled country due to concerns about U S  sanctions and overall dysfunction  Erepla said that the agreement will  revitalize oil production  at the Tia Juana Lago and Rosa Mediano fields in the western Lake Maracaibo region and in the Ayacucho 5 bloc  in the eastern heavy oil Orinoco Belt  The company added that the deal gives it  enhanced managerial participation  in the projects and will be responsible for procurement  a key difference from long established joint ventures between PDVSA and oil majors like  Chevron  Corp  N CVX   where PDVSA has full operational control  It said Erepla would be  responsible for the entirety of the investment   A spokesman declined to elaborate on how it would raise the funds  Neither PDVSA nor the Oil Ministry responded to a request for comment  The Erepla spokesman confirmed media reports that Sargeant  who has served as finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party and currently runs asphalt trading and shipping firm Global Oil Management Group  is a part owner of Erepla   The spokesman declined to say what size stake Sargeant has in the company  The deal is the first new partnership between PDVSA and a private company since Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo in August announced a set of  joint service agreements  with 14 little known companies that did not appear to have experience operating oilfields and PDVSA  Those contracts were similar to ones rolled back under late socialist leader Hugo Chavez  who expanded the state s role in the OPEC country s energy industry   Output has continued to stagnate since the deals were signed  dropping to 1 46 million barrels per day in November from more than 2 million at the end of last year  according to OPEC figures  in a sign of the company s struggles under military rule  COMPLYING WITH SANCTIONS Washington has levied several rounds of sanctions on Venezuelan that block U S  citizens from providing financing to Maduro s government without placing explicit restrictions on commerce or investment  But because PDVSA is perennially cash strapped  agreements to boost production usually involve partner companies putting up significant amounts of up front funding that could run afoul of sanctions  Erepla said it had applied to the U S  Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control  which implements sanctions  for a  Specific License affirming the agreement   The Treasury Department  which is affected by the ongoing U S  government shutdown  did not immediately respond to a request for comment  Consulted on how a company with no evident oil field experience would be in a position to take on the project  the Erepla spokesman said the firm s  ownership includes serious and significant oilfield production capabilities as well as heavy oil refining ability    Maduro  who has deepened Venezuela s relationships with U S  adversaries like Russia and China  often accuses the United States of plotting to overthrow him and steal the OPEC nation s oil wealth  The deal has been criticized by hardline Chavez supporters  who say it cedes too much control to a foreign company  
 This is the worst giveaway in the history of our country s oil industry   former Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez wrote in a blog post on Sunday   Maduro and Quevedo will have to be held to account for giving away assets belonging to all Venezuelans and ceding our sovereignty over managing our oil  ",2019-01-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/venezuelas-pdvsa-inks-oil-deal-with-firm-partowned-by-florida-republican-1739378,1739378
192382,413898,CVX,Top Picks 2019  Chevron CVX,news,"Our 2019 market view remains cautious as continued pressures from a macro economic standpoint weight on an already tenuous technical landscape  Based on these views  we feel a  safety first  oriented approach with a focus on high quality  well managed companies is the best way to move forward in the new year  notes Zach Jonson  senior portfolio manager for Stack Financial Management  
 Chevron   NYSE CVX    our top value oriented pick for 2019   is one of the world s largest integrated energy companies with exploration  production  and refining operations that span the globe  The company has its hands in all aspects of the energy life cycle including upstream  midstream  and downstream chemical operations which gives them the ability to navigate the ever changing commodity environment  
Chevron s high quality assets allow for strong profit growth and free cash flow generation in a wide range of oil price environments  making them an ideal holding for 2019 
The collapse in oil prices that took place from the latter part of 2014 until early 2016 forced companies within the Energy sector to recapitalize and focus on balance sheet improvement  Chevron s scale and efficiency allowed them to weather the storm better than most as they were able to maintain a consistent dividend payout throughout the cycle 
In fact  in January of 2018  Chevron raised its quarterly dividend by 4  to  1 12  marking 30 straight years of annual dividend payout increases  As oil prices rebounded  Chevron s management team remained steadfast outlining a plan that focused on dividend growth  balance sheet strength  and the utilization of surplus cash for repurchases       
As we stand today  Chevron is on track to produce multiple years of positive Free Cash Flow driven by recently completed major capital projects  The completion of these projects allows Chevron to reduce capital spending over the next few years while still maintaining the ability to ramp up production 
From a valuation standpoint  shares are trading at 12 9 times 2019 EPS estimates which is well below the 10 year average of approximately 15 times  From a cash flow standpoint  Chevron provides investors a forward FCF Yield in excess of 6   which coupled with a 3 9  dividend yield  offers investors ample return to offset possible oil price volatility   
In a sector dominated by highly cyclical investment opportunities  CVX is a true high quality story   The company is a well managed  cash oriented firm that offers strong production growth when most peers are struggling to lower costs  Chevron offers investors the ability to maintain exposure to the volatile energy sector while still maintaining a  safety first  mentality

192386,413902,CVX,3 Things Driving Oil Prices Right Now,opinion,"1  Goodbye  Iran Oil Import Waivers  Hello  Higher Energy Prices 
Besides Occidental Petroleum s  NYSE OXY  bidding war with Chevron  NYSE CVX  for fellow producer Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC   the big energy news from last week is that President Donald Trump  as expected  moved to end all sanction waivers for nations that import Iranian oil  Starting in May  countries that still buy oil from Iran could face U S  penalties  In response  Brent crude hit  75 per barrel for the first time in six months 
Oil and natural gas are the Middle Eastern country s most important export  so the policy is intended to hit Tehran where it hurts  The plan  announced last summer  appears to be working so far  Between January 2018 and January 2019  Iranian oil exports fell by nearly 700 000 barrels per day  b d    The data could be inaccurate  though  since Iranian oil tankers are believed to be turning off their transponders in an effort to conceal themselves from satellite tracking systems  
It s unlikely that all countries will immediately zero out imports from Iran  I would be surprised to see China  the number one consumer  trim its imports much further  Iran is such a key strategic player connecting Asia and the Middle East as part of China s Belt and Road Initiative  BRI  
So who will pick up the global slack if Trump s plan succeeds and Iranian exports go offline  Trump suggests Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates  UAE  will  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also believes the U S  can  but this would  be a stretch   according to Bloomberg 
 Oil condensate from the Eagle Ford shale basin in Texas is similar  though a bit heavier than Iran s light South Pars condensate  But the Eagle Ford produces only about 150 000 b d of its product  compared with Iran s daily output of 600 000 barrels in 2017   the article reads

But maybe there s something to what Pompeo says after all  Thanks to its fracking industry  the U S  is producing oil at a breakneck pace  This is turning up in domestic inventories  which have been building steadily over the past seven months or so  For the week ended April 19  oil stocks rose by 5 5 million barrels  much more than what analysts had anticipated  At 460 million barrels  total crude stocks now sit at their highest level since October 2017 
The U S  is already the biggest oil producer in the world  having overtaken Saudi Arabia and Russia last year  Looking ahead  U S  output could equal that of both countries by 2025  according to International Energy Agency  IEA  estimates  And in January  the Department of Energy said that the U S  will become a net exporter of energy in 2020 something it hasn t achieved in almost 70 years 
3  Oil Prices Were Headed for Overbought Territory  Until Trump Stepped In
Oil prices neared overbought territory  as you can see in the chart below  which shows oil s 14 day relative strength index  RSI   When an asset s RSI rises above 80  it typically means that it s overbought  suggesting it might be time to take some profits  When it falls below 20  meanwhile  it often means that the asset is oversold  signaling a possible entry point 
Again  oil prices looked to be on the overbought side  especially after the administration announced the end to sanction waivers  But the trend could reverse very rapidly 
Case in point  On Friday  the president  who favors lower energy costs  claimed that he  called up  OPEC and told the global oil exporting cartel   You ve got to bring  gasoline prices  down  you ve got to bring them down   Which  of course  is not in Saudi Arabia s best interest 
In any case  the price of West Texas Intermediate  WTI  plunged close to 4 percent on Friday  its biggest one day drop since mid December  As a result  oil s RSI sharply turned down to around 50  from nearly 72 on Monday  Depending on what happens in the next few days  oil traders might be looking at another buying opportunity ",2019-04-29,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-things-driving-oil-prices-right-now-200412549,200412549

192396,413912,CVX,The Bidding War For Anadarko Has Begun  Chevron Vs  Occidental,opinion,"The bidding war for Anadarko Petroleum   NYSE APC   has begun and no one is happier than APC investors  When the news that Chevron   NYSE CVX   agreed to acquire Anadarko for  33 billion   65 a share cash and stock deal  was released on April 12th  APC shares soared over 32  in one day  Meanwhile  Occidental Petroleum   NYSE OXY   has been reaching out to Anadarko Petroleum with merger proposals since late March  and today Occidental public made a  38 billion bid  cash and stock deal for  76 a share  representing a 16 9  premium over Chevron s proposal  APC surged another 12  following this announced  for a total return of 53  over the past 9 days of trading 
APC closed today at  71 40  right between both bids  Chevron was able to lock in a break up fee of  1 billion with Anadarko  representing about  2 per share of APC  Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub voiced frustration in a letter to Anadarko s board  saying that Anadarko made this agreement  without even picking up the phone to speak to us after we made two proposals during the week of April 8 that were at a significantly higher value to the transaction you were apparently negotiating with Chevron   Chevron claimed they weren t aware of any negotiation between Occidental and Anadarko  Below are the returns for CVX   6 2   red   OXY   7 7   blue   and APC  52 5   green  since April 11th 
 
 
The Battle for the Permian Basis
The Permian Basin is one of the most fertile oil and natural gas basins in the US and has become the most productive oil fields in the world  Production in the Permian has proliferated over the last 10 years growing from less than 1 million barrels per day  BPD  to 4 2 million BPD  34  of total US oil production   displaying a 425  increase in a decade  This production rate has just surpassed Saudi Arabia s Ghawar oil field which produced 5 million BPD for decades but recently cut production to 3 8 million BPD 
 
 
OXY and CVX are fighting for control of the Permian Basin and Anadarko is the golden ticket  Occidental currently controls the largest portion of the Permian with Chevron as a close second  The acquisition of APC would significantly improve operations for both firms in the Permian  being one of the fastest growing geographic oil production locations in the world 
The Permian has grown to be the  crown jewel  of US oil basins because of its rewarding shale formation  The Permian has 8 distinctive rock levels compared to the 1 or 2 levels found in most other shale locations  This is advantageous because it allows producers to continue to drill in the same location over and over again using the same equipment  cutting costs and improving returns  The breakeven price for most Permian wells is about  35  40 per barrel  meaning that oil would have to drop almost 50  for these wells to stop being profitable 
Anadarko has a very lucrative piece of land in the Permian Basin with approximately 250 000 acres in the Delaware Basin  part of the greater Permian Basin  producing 160 000 BPD and even more natural gas 
Occidental Petroleum currently controlling the most substantial portion of the Permian with 2 7 million acres and producing 368 000 BPD  This production level has grown over 25  in just one year and is expected to continue this growth  A merger with Anadarko would solidify OXY s dominant position in the Permian  and the synergies could propel them to become one of the largest US oil and gas producers 
Chevron owns 2 2 million acres in the Permian Basin producing 159 000 BPD  The acquisition of APC would provide many synergies within the Permian because of their almost overlapping current operations  Chevron s scale and infrastructure will allow them to leverage Anadarko s core competencies and assets to their fullest potential  making them an ideal candidate for a merger 
The Golden Parachute
One day before Anadarko announced its deal with Chevron the board approved a  22 million increase in bonuses to its top execs in the event that they strike a deal  Anadarko CEO Al Walker was approved to receive a minimum of  43 million following an acquisition by Chevron   6 7 million more than prior guidelines  according to Equilar 
These  golden parachutes   as they ve been coined  are subject to controversy  Paying substantial amounts of money to CEO s for them to close a deal and subsequently departing doesn t sound like the most ethical move  Especially when the CEO wasn t able hit their performance benchmarks while in the position  like Al Walker who lagged behind his targets 
This type of behavior is frowned upon by shareholders because it is not in their best interest  Charles Elson  director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware  further explains that  sweeteners aren t for the shareholders  and when they re present  it always calls into question why management accepted a deal  That s why they re a bad idea   As shareholders  we hope that the  golden parachutes  won t impede management s judgment in deciding on which deal to move forward with 
Oil Outlook
Crude oil prices have been following the US equity prices for at least the last 52 weeks  which is contrary to most macroeconomic principles  Crude futures dropped 40  from their high of  75 65 per barrel down to a low of  43 80 a barrel on Christmas Eve  Oil has rallied 37  so far this year riding on the back of OPEC s production cuts and turmoil in Venezuela 
This oil rally is subject to continue with Trump implementing new sanctions on Iran oil exports  in an attempt to further obstruct the Islamic Republic s finances  Taking the 1 6 million barrels per day  that Iran currently exports  off the market will have a material impact on oil prices to the upside if this isn t replaced by another source  considering that oil is a leveraged commodity  This zero tolerance sanction is going to be fully implemented May 2nd and could cause complications internationally to Iran s chief oil importers  Below is a chart of Iran oil exports by country 
 
Deciding on a Deal
As of now Chevron is still fully expecting their deal with Anadarko to go through despite Occidental s opposing bid  A counter bid from Chevron is expected by analysts though 
Chevron is a much larger operation than Anadarko and Occidental combined  Chevron is over 9x the size of OXY on a revenue basis and produces 4 5x more barrels of oil and gas daily  The infrastructure of Chevron s extensive operations would likely benefit Anadarko more than an acquisition by a small fry like Occidental that doesn t have the scale to create the same synergies 
Occidentals proposed  38 billion deal is 50  cash and 50  stock while Chevron is only offering 25  in cash and 75  in shares for  33 billion  The  1 billion break up fee needs to be weighed as well  considering that Anadarko accepted this agreement even after knowing that Occidental was willing to offer more 
I believe it is likely that Anadarko will end up going with Chevron but whether Chevron will need to up the ante remains to be seen

192405,413921,CVX,Analysts Estimate Chevron  CVX  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Chevron  CVX  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 26  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  31 6  
Revenues are expected to be  37 89 billion  up 0 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9 55  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Chevron 
For Chevron  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  6 87  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Chevron will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Chevron would post earnings of  1 87 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 06  delivering a surprise of  10 16  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

192406,413922,CVX,ETFs To Buy Avoid On Higher Oil Prices ,opinion,"Oil price surged to a nearly six month high on the news that the White House has pledged to deepen its crackdown on Iran  The Trump administration vowed to end waivers that had previously allowed eight countries to purchase crude from Iran  bringing oil exports to zero  Crude oil price jumped to more than  65 per barrel for the first time since November 2018 while Brent crude climbed to  74 for the first time since early November The end of waiver has added to supply concerns that is driving oil prices  Falling output in Venezuela hit by Trump sanctions imposed earlier this year on PDVSA  the Latin American nation s state owned oil company   unexpected losses in Libya due to violence  OPEC led fresh crude output cuts  signs of slowing production growth in the United States and disruption in a key Nigerian pipeline are also bolstering the bullish sentiment  read    Further  the Fed s dovish outlook  which pushed the U S  dollar down  led to a spike in oil price  Notably  a weak dollar made dollar denominated assets cheap for foreign investors  potentially raising demand for commodities

192414,413930,CVX,Exclusive  Three more South Korean firms rigged U S  military bids,news,"By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON  Reuters    South Korea s  S Oil Corp   KS 010950   Hyundai Oilbank Co  INPTVH UL  and Jier Shin Korea Co took part in a bid rigging scheme that led to more than  100 million in overcharges to the U S  military  according to two sources with knowledge of the matter  The three companies were not named in filings in U S  federal court in Ohio that described a conspiracy that involved a total of six companies that overcharged U S  military bases in South Korea for fuel  The South Korea bid rigging investigation is part of a more aggressive effort by the U S  Justice Department to crack down on companies that defraud the U S  government on military contracts  The court papers filed by U S  Justice Department after it settled with three other companies last month named SK Energy Co Ltd SKENGG UL   GS Caltex Corp  GSCAL UL   50 percent owned by  Chevron   N CVX   and Hanjin Transportation Co Ltd  KS 002320   They agreed to pay a total of  236 million in criminal fines and civil damages  The Justice Department estimated that the bid rigging occurred from about 2005 to 2016  The government procurement data site GovTribe said that between 2008 and 2013 the major sellers of fuel to U S  military bases in South Korea were S Oil  GS Caltex  SK Energy  Hanjin  Hyundai Oilbank and Jier Shin Korea  S Oil Corp said through a spokesperson that it was  unaware of any investigation   S Oil is partially owned by Aramco Overseas  according to both Aramco s and S Oil s web sites  A spokesperson for Hyundai Oilbank acknowledged that it was under investigation but declined further comment  A Jier Shin Korea spokesperson also was  unaware of such investigation   Court filings which accompanied the Justice Department settlement with SK Energy  GS Caltex and Hanjin this month referred to other companies involved in the probe as Company A and Company C  both oil companies  and Company B  a logistics firm  The sources  who were not authorized to speak on the record  identified S Oil and Hyundai as the oil companies and Jier Shin as the logistics company  The U S  military had a budget of about  700 billion in the 2018 fiscal year  which ended on September 30  A large proportion of the budget is spent in South Korea where the United States has kept a military presence in the divided peninsula since the 1950 1953 war  There are currently more than 28 000 troops in South Korea  Camp Humphreys south of Seoul is the largest U S  overseas base with nearly 20 000 U S  personnel  Following the settlement announced last week  Makan Delrahim  head of the U S  Justice Department s antitrust division  said that the department planned to be more aggressive in pressing antitrust charges against companies that rigged bids for contracts to supply the government  In addition to scrutinizing mergers to make sure they comply with antitrust law  the Justice Department investigates and charges companies that are supposed to compete but who conspire to raise prices

192425,413941,CVX,Dollar s Technical Picture More Nuanced  Significance Of S P 500 Gaps,opinion,"The U S  dollar fell against most of the major currencies over the past week  The yen and the Swiss franc were the exceptions  The technical correction  we anticipated last week  may have some more room to run  However  we do view it as a counter trend move and expect the data to show the U S  economy picked up some momentum going into the end of Q1  If recession fears are exaggerated  so too are expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates  An adjustment of such expectations can be the fuel of the next leg up for the dollar 
Dollar Index  The Dollar Index tried one more time to push through the 97 50 area at the start of last week and gave up and retreated to about 96 75  where the 50 day moving average is found  ahead of the weekend  It traded below its 20 day moving average   96 90  for the first time this month but managed to close just above it  The move that we think is being corrected began ironically with the low on March 20 when the FOMC last met and the Dollar Index posted an outside down day  But there was no follow through  and before the past week  it had risen in nine of the 12 sessions after the FOMC meeting  It had retraced 38 2  of the move by the middle of last week   96 85  but before the weekend  made a push lower toward the 50  retracement   96 65   The 61 8  retracement is found about 20 ticks lower  The five day moving average   97 02  is poised to fall below the 20 day moving average   96 90   which may be a useful proxy for some models  The technical indicators we look at also suggest scope for more declines  Waiting for some sign of a reversal may be preferable to trying to catch the falling knife  That said  on a risk reward basis  a dip below 96 50 would look attractive 
Euro   The single currency was capped near  1 1285  It looked as if the market was about to give up and then talk of a large direct investment related euro yen trade propelled it higher as stops were triggered  It was the first time in nearly three weeks that the euro traded back into its old range    1 1300  1 1500   The technical condition is still constructive although it was disappointing that it failed to close above  1 13  The five and 20 day moving averages are set to cross  and many of the late shorts are in weak hands  The next target is  1 1350  which is retracement target and the 100 day moving average  Above there  the  1 1400 area would beckon  On the downside  a convincing break of  1 1280 would be a warning sign that the correction may be flagging  while a move below  1 1250 would suggest the upper end of the new range has been found 
Yen  In the middle of last week  the dollar tested trendline support that connects the flash crash low  January 3  a little below JPY105 and the March lows   JPY109 75   It was near JPY110 85 in the middle of last week  and the dollar sprung higher  It pushed through JPY112 00 for the first time ahead of the weekend and the highest close since a week before last Christmas  Although we look for the dollar to head toward JPY114 JPY115  the charts suggest caution  The Upper Bollinger  Band is nearby   JPY112 20   The Slow Stochastics have not confirmed the new highs  setting up a potential bearish divergence and the MACDS have not generated a strong signal  A setback toward JPY111 60 may provide a new opportunity to play for a breakout 
Sterling   For two and a half weeks  sterling has bounced between  1 30 and  1 32  but from a slightly larger vantage point  it is carving out a triangle  This is most commonly seen as a continuation pattern  In this case  that is bullish  The top of the triangle is drawn from the March 13 high near  1 3380 and late March high and early April high  It came in near  1 3135 ahead of the weekend and arguably held sterling back from strong gains  The lower part of the triangle begins with the March 11 low of about  1 2950 and connects the March 29 and April 4 lows  It is found a little below  1 3010 at the end of next week  The technicals have not turned  but pullbacks to the lower end of the triangle may offer good risk reward 
Canadian Dollar  In January and February  the U S  dollar traded between CAD1 3100 and CAD1 3300  with a few exceptions  It moved into a higher range in March  It now seems to be in a CAD1 3300 and CAD1 3440  The market seems comfortable in that range  and the three month implied volatility is at five year lows   5 2    Outside of a few months in 2014  the implied volatility has not been below 5  since 2000 
Australian Dollar  The Australian dollar advanced nearly 1  last week to extend its streak to three weeks  Ahead of the weekend it almost reached  0 7200  for the first time since late February  A trendline from last November and late January highs comes in near there as does the 200 day moving average  The Aussie has not closed above its 200 day moving average in a little over a year  The technical indicators suggest there is near term to push through it  The next hurdle is near  0 7250  Positive news from China seemed to offset news of potentially large layoffs and branch reduction by Australia s largest lender 
Mexican Peso   The Mexican peso was the second strongest currency in the world last week  only bested by the Argentine peso   1 7  vs  4 1    The dollar had its lowest close so far this year ahead of the weekend   MXN18 75   It appears the high interest rates are drawing capital  offsetting the talk that many domestics are bringing savings offshore  The next technical target is near MXN18 40  but a move toward MXN18 00 cannot be ruled out  It is not a tail risk  Given the current volatility  there is a reasonably good chance it may be seen in the coming months  Peso strength will add pressure on the central bank to cut rates  which explains the appeal to many levered accounts 
Oil  Every day WTI for June delivery bumped up against resistance near  65 a barrel  It is primarily a supply story  OPEC  cuts are deeper than the commitments  Venezuela and Libyan supply have been compromised  and the U S  has yet to decide on the waivers from the embargo against Iran  The price of WTI has risen for the past six consecutive weeks and has only fallen three weeks of this year s first 15 weeks  The technical indicators are stretched  of course  but they have not turned down 
U S  Rates   For only the second time this year  the U S  10 year yield rose in back to back weeks  It was virtually flat coming into the end of the week  and despite the softer University of Michigan inflation expectations  the yield jumped six basis points  Rising oil and stock prices  and the data they made  gave credence to ideas that it too is finding better traction  which was thought to have spurred the sales  The next important target is near 2 60   That had been the floor through most of the first quarter  The June note futures closed at its lowest level since March 20  A break of 122 26 could signal losses toward 122 00  In the first two weeks of April  the implied yield of the January 2020 Fed funds futures fell 13 basis points to about 2 285   Given the current average effective rate is 2 41   there is scope for more adjustment  It is only halfway to pricing in a Fed that is on hold this year 
S P 500  The S P 500 closed at new six month highs before the weekend after gapping higher at the open  Favorable earnings from JPMorgan  NYSE JPM   a large acquisition in the oil sector  Chevron  NYSE CVX  Anadarko  NYSE APC    and strong export and lending growth in China  lifted sentiment  The gap is found between the April 11 high   2893 4  and April 12 low   2898 4   If it is a  normal gap  it should be closed over the next few sessions  The longer it is unfilled  the more bullish the signal  The gap created by the higher opening on April 1 appears on the weekly bar charts and has not been filled  The last time the S P 500 was this high  the 10 year yield was near 3 15   and the 2 year yield was around 2 82   If it is a measuring or runaway gap  the S P 500 met the initial objective  If the pre weekend gap is like the April 1 gap  it projects to the record high set last September near 2941 ",2019-04-15,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-dollars-technical-picture-turns-more-nuanced-and-the-significance-of-the-gaps-200406565,200406565
192426,413942,CVX,Dollar Softens Awaiting U S  Retail Sales,opinion,"The US dollar is lower against most major pairs except the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc  Risk appetite made a comeback this week and pushed the three currencies lower as investors shied away from safe havens  A strong start to the US earnings season with JP Morgan and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  leading the way triggered optimism despite global growth warning from the IMF earlier in the week  Central banks were muted this week as dovish rhetoric continues to be the norm  Brexit will be around for longer as an extension until October 31 as the two major parties discuss cooperation that would bring about a softer exit  More time means less pressure on the pound  the currency rose 0 34 this week after the new timeline was announced 
GBP   Pound Rises as Brexit Halloween Extension Granted
The GBP USD rose 0 19 percent on its way to another positive week as the European Union allowed a six month extension to Article 50  The UK parliament remains in a paradox  not wanting to exit on a no deal scenario  but not doing enough to support a single soft exit alternative  The talks between Conservatives and Labour is not likely to break the deadlock and Halloween could end up being spookier than intended 

Wages  inflation data  retail sales and a speech by Bank of England  BoE  Governor Carney in Europe are on the calendar  Brexit pressure will be continued to be applied to the economy as the extension only eased anxiety in the short term  only to be revised come Hallows eve  The pound will be sensitive to political updates as Theresa May s leadership is under threat with a lower valuation if a Eurosceptic captures the Prime Minister s job 
Oil   Supply Concerns Overshadow Trump Pipeline Push
Brent rose 1 03 percent and WTI 0 36 percent on Friday as supply disruptions and stronger Chinese economic data eased concerns about OPEC  rising production in the summer  The weakness of the US dollar as investors sold their positions with little need for hedging their exposures this weekend was positive for crude 

A potential civil war in Libya could wipe out all crude production and the US sanctions against Iran and Venezuela could end up convincing OPEC  members to pause their production agreement deal and increase production to offset the losses  The meeting in June will be crucial to the extension of the agreement  but with current prices higher than previously thought Saudi Arabia will have to make a compelling case to producers 

US production has been ramping up and Trump issued an executive order on pipelines to overstep on State level authority  Chevron  NYSE CVX  announced the purchase of Anadarko for  33 billion in a move that could trigger more M A activity in the shale industry 
GOLD   Yellow Metal Flat as Friday Brings Dollar Softness
Gold recovered from Thursday s losses  with a 0 11 percent rise on Friday but is headed for a weekly loss of 0 08 percent  The dollar was on the back foot  which helped the yellow metal advance towards the end of the week  US economic indicators have been mixed of late and next week could be another tough test for the dollar with core retail sales and the Philly Fed Manufacturing Index on Thursday

192443,413959,CVX,RDS A Or CVX  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Oil and Gas   Integrated   International sector have probably already heard of Shell  LON RDSa  Oil  RDS A  and Chevron  CVX   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  Shell Oil has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Chevron has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that RDS A likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than CVX has recently  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
RDS A currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 31  while CVX has a forward P E of 19 20  We also note that RDS A has a PEG ratio of 1 61  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  CVX currently has a PEG ratio of 3 85 
Another notable valuation metric for RDS A is its P B ratio of 1 31  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  CVX has a P B of 1 53 
These metrics  and several others  help RDS A earn a Value grade of A  while CVX has been given a Value grade of C 
RDS A has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than CVX  so it seems like value investors will conclude that RDS A is the superior option right now ",2019-04-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rdsa-or-cvx-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200403506,200403506

192451,413967,CVX,White House Backed Big Oil Over EPA on Finding Methane Leaks,news," Bloomberg     White House officials pushed the EPA to maximize savings for the oil industry despite the agency s concern that weakening regulations would allow more methane to escape into the atmosphere  according to newly released documents 
The White House pressure campaign came as the Environmental Protection Agency honed a proposal to relax Obama era requirements governing how frequently oil companies have to check for and repair leaks of methane  an intense greenhouse gas that warms the atmosphere 84 times more than carbon dioxide 
Every move to dial back required inspections and reduce industry costs triggered a corresponding climb in projected methane emissions  a jump that appeared to trouble some EPA officials  according to internal documents filed in a government docket Tuesday 
The documents show EPA officials also repeatedly resisted White House pressure to dramatically decrease the frequency of required inspections at oil wells and compressor stations in the name of saving money 
In one case  officials with the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs argued that less frequent inspections would provide  the highest net benefits  
But the EPA rejected that argument in May  countering that less frequent inspections also would allow more methane to escape 
The behind the scenes debate  revealed in hundreds of pages of correspondence  analysis and drafts from a White House led review of the plan  offers a rare look at how the Trump administration is pursuing a deregulatory agenda it says is saving the U S   1 6 billion annually 
The episode  encapsulates the Trump administration s environmental deregulation strategy   said David Hayes  a former deputy Interior secretary who now is the executive director of New York University School of Law s State Energy and Environmental Impact Center 
First the Trump administration overstates the costs to industry of environmental safeguards  then it ignores the costs to society of dismantling them  Hayes said  The result is  puffery   with claims of deregulatory cost savings from not requiring industry to protect human health and the environment    while ignoring the cost to everybody else 
The entire process was driven by an attempt to maximize corporate profits at the expense of public health and the environment  said Amit Narang  a regulatory policy expert with Public Citizen   The further OIRA tried to force EPA to maximize net benefits  the more it forced a weakening of the rule  and the more emissions went up  
OIRA s edits boosted projected cost savings from  246 million over six years to  484 million    and resulted in a plan that is projected to more than double the release of methane  Representatives of OIRA did not respond to an email seeking comment on the documents 
The correspondence reveals how President Donald Trump s zeal to cut regulatory costs has sometimes run into resistance from government officials worried the efforts go too far 
The EPA has been a willing partner in fulfilling Trump s pledge to roll back environmental regulations he blames for stifling the U S  economy  But under Trump  the agency has at least twice advocated taking a more moderate course and cautioned against deeper weakening of Obama era environmental rules  Earlier this year  EPA officials disputed the safety and economic assertions underpinning a Trump administration plan to ease vehicle efficiency and emission standards 
The Trump administration had already decided to relax a 2016 methane rule in response to oil industry complaints the inspections were too frequent and costly  Under the Obama era mandates  wells had to be inspected twice a year and compressor stations on a quarterly basis 
The question was how far to go in easing them 
 75 Million Savings
In the end  the EPA s replacement plan proposed dialing back the frequency of those inspections to as little as annually for wells and compressor stations and once every other year for low producing wells 
But that wasn t what Trump s EPA originally had in mind  For leak prone compressor stations  the agency initially insisted that quarterly inspections were necessary to keep fugitive emissions at bay 
 The EPA is not proposing changes to the quarterly monitoring frequency requirement for the collection of fugitive emissions components located at compressor stations   said one early draft of the proposal  The EPA defended that approach by asserting that  quarterly monitoring is cost effective  
But analysts at OIRA didn t agree  and that EPA language was axed as a result 
OIRA s insistence on less frequent inspections dovetailed with the wishes of many oil companies that lobbied the Trump administration to relax the timetable  The issue was at the top of the agenda during a May 10 meeting Trump administration officials held with representatives from the American Petroleum Institute   BP   LON BP  Plc   Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX   Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC    Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  Plc and other oil companies 
EPA defended its dogged insistence on quarterly inspections again in June  arguing that the more frequent timetable reflects  what can be supported by the currently available data  
But OIRA didn t give up  After pressing for yearly compressor station inspections again in a phone call  OIRA s Chad Whiteman emailed an EPA official to emphasize the point in July   We still feel that annual monitoring for compressors  is  the best option   Whiteman told told EPA s David Cozzie  a Durham  North Carolina based group leader in the agency 
Legal Threshold
Even after EPA employees relented and agreed to semiannual inspections for compressor stations  OIRA pushed them to relax the requirement even more  OIRA officials questioned why the EPA was willing to move to a semiannual schedule  but could not use the same justification to move to annual monitoring   EPA environmental engineer Karen Marsh recounted in an Aug  14 email 
The EPA s response  Semiannual monitoring could qualify as the  best system of emission reduction     a legal threshold under U S  law    but annual inspections would fall short of that benchmark   We can achieve greater emission reductions for a cost that is well within the acceptable cost of control   Marsh bluntly told OIRA 
EPA ended up relenting    partially    from its insistence on quarterly inspections  But it didn t make a choice between semiannual and annual inspections  instead proposing both timetables and offering it up for public comment 
The EPA is now taking public comments on the proposal through Dec  17  which will help guide a final version  expected next year

192466,413982,CVX,Qatar Wants to Get Even Bigger in Gas as Race With U S  Heats Up,news," Bloomberg     The world s biggest producer of liquefied natural gas wants to bulk up as competing supplies from Australia and the U S  are also set to come to the market over the next decade 
State owned Qatar Petroleum will build four new liquefaction plants  known as trains  by 2025  up from a previously announced three  Chief Executive Officer Saad Sherida Al Kaabi told reporters in Doha  That will boost production to 110 million tons of LNG a year from 77 million currently  Qatar last year announced plans to boost capacity to 100 million tons within seven years 
The decision to increase output even more was driven by rising demand for gas and the  good results obtained through recent additional appraisal and testing in the North Field   Al Kaabi said  referring to Qatar s portion of the giant offshore reservoir shared with Iran  Qatar s total production of oil and gas will reach an equivalent of 6 2 million barrels a day when the expansion is complete  up from 4 8 million currently  he said 
Global LNG consumption is expected to rise by more than a third over the next decade to 416 million tons a year  according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance  Chinese imports of the fuel surged 35 percent in the first eight months of this year  and gas producers from Australia  Africa and the U S  are boosting output to capture a bigger share of this growing market 
Qatar Petroleum plans to make its final investment decision on the expansion by the end of 2019 and to reach its 110 million ton per year target in 2024  Al Kaabi said  Tenders to drill new offshore wells will be issued next month 
Even if the company makes a final investment decision next year   it will be very challenging for them to bring all the planned capacity online in five or six years   said Maggie Kuang  an analyst at Bloomberg NEF   Competition for labor and equipment will increase globally  and the smaller plants planned in the U S  will likely be quicker to build than the mega trains in Qatar  
Al Kaabi didn t disclose how much Qatar Petroleum will spend on the expansion  He said the country s LNG projects have the lowest costs in the world  Sanford C Bernstein Ltd  estimated the additional 23 million tons of production to 100 million tons could cost about  27 6 billion  far lower than the  88 billion that  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  spent to build the 24 5 million ton per year Gorgon and Wheatstone export developments in Australia

192474,413990,CVX,U S  energy companies fume over rejected steel tariff exemptions,news,"By Liz Hampton HOUSTON  Reuters    The U S  Commerce Department recently granted a tariff exemption to oil major  Chevron   NYSE CVX  for its imports of 4 5 inch Japanese steel tubes for oil exploration   But the department rejected a similar request from Borusan Mannesmann Pipe to exclude 4 5 inch steel pipes imported from Turkey for casing used to line new oil wells  The reason  multiple U S  steelmakers objected to Borusan s application  arguing they could supply the product  according to the department  Chevron drew no such objections   When U S  President Donald Trump slapped a 25 percent tariff on imported steel this spring  his administration allowed companies to apply for exemptions if needed metals were not available in sufficient quality  quantity or in a reasonable time  But the process for seeking relief is proving slow and controversial as a deluge of applications has buried the small staff initially assigned to the task  prompting the department to hire dozens of extra contract workers  The limited number of decisions made so far are drawing protests from rejected applicants and sparking disputes between U S  steel mills and importers of products from their foreign competitors  Commerce has received more than 37 000 exemption requests  far more than it planned to handle  Although 130 employees and contractors are now evaluating the applications  the agency had only ruled on 2 871 of those requests as of August 20   The department has so far approved 1 780 of the applications and denied 1 091  Separately  the department turned back more than 6 000 requests for what it called  filing errors  by applicants  who can fix and resubmit their requests  Rejected applicants have criticized the department for taking sometimes misleading objections by domestic suppliers at face value and for not allowing importers a chance to rebut their arguments   The Commerce Department is now hard pressed to spend more than a few minutes reviewing each application   said Bernd Janzen  a partner in Akin Gump Strauss Hauer   Feld LLP  which is working with companies pursuing tariff exclusions  Commerce acknowledged its staffing issues and said it has requested permission from Congress to reallocate  5 million of its own funds to accelerate the review process  Congress has so far only approved a reallocation of  2 million  the agency said   We will continue to run behind unless we are allowed to divert more Commerce resources to the process   the department said in a statement to Reuters  The agency is also revising its evaluation process   The Department fully acknowledges that the information provided in an objection may not be correct   the agency said  Twenty exemptions have been approved over the objections from U S  steelmakers  a sign that its process is  balanced  fair and transparent   the department said  SUPPLIER OBJECTIONS Companies seeking exemptions have complained that Commerce provides little detail on the rationale for denying applications beyond boilerplate language that the product a company wants to import is available from a U S  supplier  Joel Johnson  chief executive of Borusan Mannesmann Pipe  a U S  subsidiary of a Turkish steelmaker  said the department did not explain how it came to reject its application   We don t know for sure why they denied us  but we did have objections from our competitors who also make pipe   said Johnson  adding that letters of support from its suppliers did not appear to influence the decision   Borusan expects to see its operating cost climb by  25 million to  35 million annually as a result of the tariffs  Borusan s parent company will supply steel for  Kinder Morgan   NYSE KMI  Inc s Gulf Coast Express pipeline  a  1 75 billion project to move natural gas from West Texas to the U S  Gulf Coast  Kinder  the second largest North American pipeline operator  has submitted its own request to avoid the tariff on the Borusan order but has not yet received a ruling   The Trump administration recently said it would double tariffs on steel from Turkey  adding between  60 million to  80 million to the cost of Kinder Morgan s pipeline  analysts for Tudor Pickering Holt   Co wrote this month  U S  Steel  which objected to Borusan s request  said it only commented on requests for products it can make   We stand ready to assist both new and longstanding customers  who are hit by tariffs  spokeswoman Meghan Cox said in a written statement   40 MILLION  TAX  After another pipeline operator  Plains All American  had its application denied  the company asked Commerce for an analysis from the International Trade Administration to explain the decision  None has been provided  incoming Chief Executive Officer Willie Chiang said at a congressional hearing called by Washington state Representative Dave Reichert last month  The Commerce Department said it does not disclose such internal analyses because they are  predecisional   Chiang called the rejection a   40 million tax  on its Texas oil pipeline project  which is anticipated to cost about  1 1 billion  Steel pipe makes up about 20 percent of the cost of a pipeline  Last month  Chiang pressed the issue before a U S  House of Representatives panel  calling the reviews  flawed  because they rely heavily on steel industry objections that aren t given enough scrutiny  His company also had scant time to counter objections filed by steelmakers  he said  which are sometimes filed at the last minute  Only three steel mills in the world can make the pipe Plains will use for its 550 mile Cactus pipeline  the company has said  Berg Steel  which filed an objection to Plains  application  said it could make alternate products to meet Plains  needs  Berg did not respond to a request for comment   Plains said the pipe U S  manufacturers suggested using is created through a different process that in some cases would either double the number of girth welds or increase the welding seams by 30 percent  Additional welding seems could raise the likelihood of cracks or failures    Decisions on product specifications should be made by companies  not government trade officials   he said  Plains All American has resubmitted its request for an exclusion   Heat Transfer Tubular Products   a Conroe  Texas based private company that supplies steel tubing for oil refinery equipment   had several applications rejected based on what vice president of sales Janese Sokulski called faulty objections from other U S  companies   Webco Industries Inc  a competitor of Heat Transfer s  argued in its written objection that it could make similar products in the United States  Webco did not respond to a request for comment   Even if Webco were to make the products  Sokulski said  she would not be able to buy them because the company is a competitor

192478,413994,CVX,Is Crude Oil Undersupplied ,opinion,"Crunch Time
Oil prices are bouncing back on hopes that the U S  might avoid a government shutdown and talk of progress on the U S  China trade talks  White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News that  This president  Trump  wants a deal  He wants it to be fair to Americans and American workers and American interests   Fox News also reports there is a deal to keep the government open  but with far less money for a wall then President Trump originally wanted  So  if we indeed get resolutions on these thorny issues  oil demand will outperform expectations and then oil prices go into crunch time  In other words  if we get a China deal coupled with OPEC cuts and Venezuelan sanctions  we are most likely going to see a supply crunch 
The recent crash in the price of oil assumed a lot of economic doom and gloom  If the gloom is not so gloomy  it is very possible that the oil market might be undersupplied 
It is not only me saying this  The CEO of BP  NYSE BP   Bob Dudley  warned that oil market uncertainty could lead to a  real crunch   In an interview with a CNBC reporter he warned that  there s a lot of variables here and there s a lot of things that could lead to a real crunch   Dudley said that   when prices are too high or too low  it leads to all kinds of unintended consequences  
For oil  we have had more than our share of unintended consequences  When President Donald Trump talked about sanctions on Iran  it caused prices to go too high too fast  When he tweeted about OPEC  he caused them to break too fast  When the OPEC and U S  producers ramped up production to offset the lost Iranian barrels  it had consequences  When President Trump granted waivers to Iran s biggest buyers  it had consequences 
The break in price forced drillers to cut back on rigs  It caused oil companies to cut back on investment and now OPEC is determined to remove any hint of excess supply 
Now with refiners scrambling to replace the heavy sour oil from Venezuela  we are seeing gas crack spreads start to improve showing the first signs that we may see tighter gasoline supplies once we get back to the summer driving season  Diesel prices are at big risk as well  especially if the refiners can t find enough heavy crude 
Refining maintenance season is ahead but soon crunch time will set in  When it does  we will see a big rally in oil and products  U S  demand is near record highs and U S  consumers feeling more confident about their prospects than they have in a long time bodes well for demand 
Maduro is still acting like he is staying around in Venezuela  Reuters is reporting that  Foreign partners of Venezuela s PDVSA are facing pressure from the state run oil firm to publicly declare whether they will continue as minority stakeholders in Orinoco Belt projects following U S  sanctions   three people familiar with the matter said  The sanctions on Petroleos de Venezuela  PDVSA   imposed last month in an attempt to dislodge Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro  barred access to U S  financial networks and oil supplies for the PDVSA joint ventures  pressuring Venezuela s already falling crude output and exports  PDVSA has been in talks with the companies to persuade them to commit publicly to the joint ventures  the sources said in recent days  France s Total SA  PA TOTF   Norway s Equinor ASA  Russia s Rosneft and U S  based Chevron  NYSE CVX  hold minority stakes in joint ventures with PDVSA that produce crude and operate oil upgraders capable of converting Venezuela s extra heavy oil into exportable grades  PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment 
On Monday  Venezuelan Oil Minister and PDVSA head Manuel Quevedo on a visit to India said that relations with international oil companies including Chevron were continuing  A manager at Rosneft said last week that the company did not expect oil output to decline at its projects in Venezuela this year  adding that the company saw the current situation in Venezuela as temporary  Rosneft did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday

However  crude oil markets have barely reacted to the measure  On Tuesday morning  Brent made some shallow recovery attempts but attracted the selling interest again and failed to regain the important  60 level 
Why is the market so indifferent to geopolitics this time  In fact  there is a number of reasons behind the lack of positive reaction 
First  traders are focused on the US China trade talks amid the growing worries about the global economy and the outlook for oil demand 
Second  Venezuela s exports declined to little more than 1 million barrels per day in 2018 already and further cuts could be easily replaced by Middle Eastern countries so the general impact on the supply side could be minimal  Third  there are exemptions for a number of US companies  including Chevron  NYSE CVX   Baker Hughes and others  that will continue operations in Venezuela until July 27  Fourth  it may be difficult  but PDVSA may yet be able to find new buyers in the future 
The effect from the sanctions could be felt by the global markets sometime later but for now  traders don t see any significant risks for global supplies  while demand concerns remain elevated which caps the upside potential in Brent ",2019-01-29,Helen Rush,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-oil-market-indifferent-to-turmoil-in-venezuela-200380348,200380348
192497,414013,CVX,US Sanctions Against Venezuela  ETFs To Top   Flop ,opinion,"Continuing tensions between the United States and Venezuela flared up as the Trump administration said it would support Venezuelan National Assembly leader Juan Guaido after he  
Soon after such support from the Trump administration  Venezuelan authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro   since 2013  severed diplomatic relations with the United States and gave American diplomats 72 hours to leave the country   
Notably  Maduro s re election as president in May 2018   with 68  of the votes despite an approval rating of only 21    was   The latest act of hostility increases the likelihood that the United States  
Venezuela  on average  exported about 500 000 barrels of crude a day to the United States in 2018  per U S  Energy Department data  However  such shipments declined in November to an   per a report by Caracas based consultancy Gas Energy Latin America  as quoted on Reuters  The U S  share of Venezula s exports has been on the decline in recent years with  
Since shipments to the United States make up about 75  of the cash Venezuela gets for crude shipments  according to a Barclays  LON BARC  research note published last week  if the United States cuts ties with Venezuela  the latter is likely to be in big trouble 
Fears of supply crunch drove oil prices with United States Oil  gaining about 1 1  on Jan 25  Against this backdrop  it would be prudent to discuss sector ETFs that tend to gain on rising crude prices as well as the ones that are likely to underperform 
Gainers 
Energy   SPDR S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production ETF   SNX XOP  
This is the most obvious choice  If oil price is trending up on reduced supplies  oil exploration and production stocks are sure to benefit as these companies will tend to pump more oil ahead 
Losers
Oil Refiners   Market Vectors Oil Refiners ETF 
Companies in the refining segment benefit from lower oil prices as crude is one of their main input costs  After taking crude  refiners transform it to the finished product   gasoline  Now with crude prices rising  refiners may see a lower crack spread and their profitability may be hurt   a lot in addition to U S  shale oil 
So  any kind of sanctions would hit U S  Gulf Coast refiners materially  The biggest U S  importers of Venezuelan crude were  last year  according to Rystad Energy  as quoted on cnn com 
Airlines   U S  Global Jets ETF   KL JETS  
The airline sector also performs better in a falling crude scenario  This is especially true as energy costs form a major portion of the overall costs of this sector  So  rising crude prices are likely to hurt earnings of airline companies 
Retail   SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT  ETF 
Lower gasoline prices are good news for retailers as consumers can have fatter wallets from energy savings and more money for discretionary spending  So  rising energy prices are not likely to bode well for retailers

192498,414014,CVX,Chevron  CVX  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Chevron  CVX  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 97 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  169 9  
Revenues are expected to be  41 63 billion  up 10 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 13 68  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Chevron 
For Chevron  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  7 57  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Chevron will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Chevron would post earnings of  2 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 11  delivering a surprise of  2 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Chevron doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chevron-cvx-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200379522,200379522

to  3 044 per million Btu  MMBtu  The U S  crude benchmark booked its first weekly gain of the past four weeks after the Energy Department s inventory release showed that stockpiles remained essentially unchanged  While large build in product inventories  gasoline and distillate  played spoilsport  it was more than offset by bullish jobs data and optimism surrounding talks between the United States and China to resolve the trade war  Both these developments eased fears of a possible economic slowdown Meanwhile  natural gas prices recorded a weekly decline following a below

192509,414025,CVX,Pipe dream  Chevron  Woodside vie to shape Australia s LNG sector,news,By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE  Reuters    After spending a decade and billions of dollars developing Australia s vast gas reserves  U S  energy giant  Chevron  Corp and local firm Woodside Petroleum are at odds over the pace and timing of the next leg of expansion  Shipments of liquefied natural gas  LNG  have become one of Australia s biggest exports and a key source of revenue for many energy majors  so any hurdles in the sector s development could strike a substantial blow  The issue comes down to how quickly to build a shared infrastructure system that would include a major trunk pipeline for transporting gas from mammoth new offshore fields owned by various companies in northwest Australia   Woodside  AX WPL  wants to take the lead in such a project  pushing to build soon so it can go ahead with its  11 billion Scarborough development  the only new gas field in the region that is primed for a final investment decision by 2020  But Chevron  N CVX  would prefer to spend more time planning and building such a system  which it says could be led by it or other companies   I don t think there are any showstoppers in changing     to a more shared infrastructure model   Chevron s Asia Pacific exploration and production president  Stephen Green  said in a group interview   It s just getting the alignment of all the different parties that want to participate in that value chain and coming up with the structure that satisfies each party s needs   Firms with stakes in the region s gas fields  including Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa    BP   L BP  and BHP Billiton  AX BHP   L BLT   will need to decide which option to pursue within the next 18 months to ensure untapped reserves are available ahead of a supply shortfall that some industry analysts see emerging from around 2022  Putting pressure on his peers  Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said last month that any rival would need to negotiate with him by September to get their gas into an infrastructure system led by Woodside   They really need to get to us in the third quarter and be very serious about what they re doing  because that window will close   he said at an investor briefing   Chevron has not put a cost estimate on its infrastructure plan  saying it depends on how big any trunkline is and how many fields it connects to  Woodside has not given an exact estimate of costs for a shared project that it would lead   Talk of collaboration is good rhetoric  but there are an awful lot of moving parts   said Wood Mackenzie analyst Saul Kavonic  BHP and BP declined to comment  Shell declined to comment except to reiterate that its Australian head  Zoe Yujnovich  has called for  greater cooperation between ventures to reduce waste and duplication   Chevron and Woodside are key in Australia s LNG sector as they operate the four LNG plants in Western Australia  and between them have a total of more than 60 trillion cubic feet  Tcf  of undeveloped gas resources in the region s offshore Carnarvon and Browse basins  To view a map on Gas fields around Woodside s Pluto  Scarborough fields  click   BURNT BY COSTS Until now  all 10 of Australia s LNG developments have been built as megaprojects  with the owners constructing pipelines and LNG plants dedicated to their own fields  Critics say that has wasted huge amounts of money as infrastructure has been duplicated  helping push total development costs to an eye watering  200 billion  Burnt by a cost of  54 billion in developing its huge Gorgon project off Australia s northwest coast  Chevron wants to change strategy   It s our view that that s not the most cost efficient     way to see resources developed across a large  prolific basin like the Carnarvon   said Chevron s Green  Cost control is key in a competitive industry in which Australia and Qatar vie for position as the world s biggest producers and in which major new output is seen coming online in places such as the United States  Canada  East Africa and Southeast Asia  After years of sky high LNG prices prior to 2014  when Asian spot cargoes sold for  20 per million British thermal units  mmBtu   prices are languishing at half of that  And the fate of the biggest undeveloped gas resource off Western Australia  the Browse project  where Woodside is operator  will likely remain in limbo until a common infrastructure is built  But both Coleman and Green expect each other s companies to come around eventually   I absolutely am confident we ll work things out   Green said  noting that Chevron and Woodside have long been partners in energy projects  And the possibility of Chevron or Woodside buying out additional stakes in the region s gas fields and LNG projects could help align interests better to speed up a resolution    M A can play a key role in helping to create alignment across the joint ventures   said Wood Mackenzie s Kavonic

192525,414041,CVX,Exclusive  Vitol  Glencore  Shell in running for Petrobras  Nigerian assets,news,"By Julia Payne
LONDON  Reuters    The world s three largest oil traders are competing to buy the African arm of Brazil s Petrobras  SA PETR4  that owns stakes in two major Nigerian offshore oil blocks  industry and banking sources with knowledge of the matter said  after submitting bids earlier this month 
Last November  state controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA  known as Petrobras  launched the sale of 100 percent of Petrobras Oil   Gas BV  or Petrobras Africa  as part of the heavily indebted company s plan to offload  21 billion in assets through 2018 as it also faces a massive corruption scandal 
Petrobras holds half the shares in the company while 40 percent are held by a subsidiary of Grupo BTG Pactual SA and 10 percent by Helios Investment Partners 
Bankers have previously estimated the value of the Petrobras venture to be about  2 billion 
The venture has stakes in two offshore blocks that contain two producing fields  the major Agbami field in OML 127  operated by a local  Chevron   N CVX  affiliate and the Akpo field in OML 130 operated by  Total  SA  PA TOTF  
The sale has attracted the top trading firms which are always on the hunt for long term crude supplies  Mercuria and  BP   L BP  had also its potential 
In early May  three consortiums including the major trading companies submitted bids to buy Petrobras Africa 
Vitol bid together with the oil upstream subsidiary of U S  private equity firm Warburg Pincus called Delonex and Canadian listed Africa Energy Corp  V AFE   an oil and gas exploration firm that is part of Sweden s Lundin Group  ST LUPE  
 Glencore   L GLEN  joined with Nigerian listed firm  Seplat   LG SEPLAT  and French firm Maurel   Prom  PA MAUP  that is majority owned by the Indonesian government  Indonesia s state oil firm Pertamina also backs Maurel   Prom and owns a 20 percent stake in Seplat 
The third bidder was privately held Famfa Oil together with Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  
Famfa Oil is one of the concessionaires in the operator of the Agbami oil field along with Chevron   Statoil   OL EQNR  and Petrobras  Chevron holds the majority stake 
Vitol  Glencore  Shell  Africa Energy declined to comment  Maurel  Famfa and Seplat did not respond for requests for comment 
Petrobras is expected to make a decision by the end of May  But the sources said that this could slide as there was a still a possibility that the bids might be split between the two oil block stakes

192531,414047,CVX,OPEC s Reason for Sticking With Cuts Rests on Shaky Ground,news," Bloomberg     OPEC and Russia seem determined to keep on cutting production even after their campaign to rebalance world oil markets achieved its main target  The primary justification for doing so looks shaky 
Sixteen months of output curbs have all but eliminated surplus oil inventories and prices are near a three year high  But Saudi Arabia says the  mission is not accomplished yet  and is urging fellow producers to keep output restrained to fulfill a new priority  encouraging companies around the world to invest more in future supply 
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries isn t the only voice warning about a lack of spending on new projects  Influential figures from the International Energy Agency to the boss of oil major  Total  SA  PA TOTF  have warned a supply shortage could emerge early next decade after a period of deep cuts in spending  Under investment could push prices as high as  300 a barrel within a few years  prominent hedge fund manager Pierre Andurand said this week 
Yet there s also no shortage of people who see OPEC s concern about investment as a pretext for prolonging a strategy that keeps oil prices as high as possible  First quarter earnings showed major companies including Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  Plc  Eni SpA and  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  are spending less but still expanding production thanks to cost cuts  U S  oil drillers are deploying more rigs and maxing out pipelines 
At current prices the industry is already on track to deliver the extra output the world needs  according to Rystad A S 
 Over the next 10 years  we see that supply will continue to keep up with demand growth   said Espen Erlingsen  an analyst at Oslo based consultant Rystad   The surge in North American shale activity and startup of new fields are the main drivers for this growth  
Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih said at a meeting of OPEC ministers last month that the world needs to invest enough to provide 4 million to 5 million barrels of additional daily oil production capacity each year  That amount    roughly equivalent to a new Iraq    is needed to meet growing demand and make up for supplies lost to natural decline 
Investment is the  most important metric  for gauging how long OPEC and Russia s cuts need to continue  Al Falih said  The group will examine this proposal along with a  menu  of other possible targets at its next meeting in late June  he said 
There s little doubt that energy companies have curbed investment in new projects since prices slumped almost four years ago  The IEA says spending dropped about  338 billion  or 44 percent  between 2014 and 2017 
It s also true that production from existing fields decreases naturally every single year  Supplies equivalent to the whole North Sea were lost to natural decline in 2017  the IEA estimates 
Cheaper Barrels
However  a modest recovery in spending already seems to be under way as crude prices rise  according to the IEA  The downturn has spurred companies to operate more efficiently  In the last few years  decline rates at mature fields have undergone a  remarkable deceleration   notably in the North Sea and Russia  the agency said 
New projects have become much cheaper after companies pressured suppliers and simplified their designs   BP   LON BP  Plc cut the costs for its Mad Dog oil field in the Gulf of Mexico by 60 percent   Statoil   OL STL  ASA s Johan Castberg field in Norway will now turn a profit at  35 a barrel  compared with  80 estimated just a few years ago 
The upshot is that it costs less to expand global oil production today than it did back in 2014  Rystad said industry spending in recent years will deliver the necessary 7 percent growth in global oil production to just over 103 million barrels a day by the end of the decade  That trend will continue over the next 10 years if oil remains between  60 and  70 a barrel  it said 
Even if the projections from Rystad  which also provides data to the IEA  prove to be spot on  OPEC needs something more immediate as a basis for its decision on whether to continue or phase out production cuts 
Yet the timeliness of hard data on investment is questionable  The oil inventory numbers from industrialized nations that OPEC has used up until now arrive with a delay of about two months  but the latest figures on spending reflect the state of the market 12 to 24 months ago 
Capex Uncertainty
 We only know capex expenditures when earnings reports are out  and even then forward guidance can be changed   said Harry Tchilinguirian  head of commodity markets strategy at  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  SA in London   In addition  pinpointing when first production will take place after capex spending is subject to uncertainty  Projects can be delayed for various reasons including budget over runs  technical hurdles  etcetera  
This lack of clarity may suit Saudi Arabia 
The kingdom is burdened with weighty domestic spending commitments and military involvement in Yemen  while also keen to get a rich valuation for the partial listing of its state oil company  It s seeking prices of  80 a barrel  people familiar with the matter say  compared with about  73 for Brent crude currently 
Showing concern about investment is a way to mask OPEC s main aim  according to Mike Wittner  head of oil market research at  Societe Generale   PA SOGN  SA

192545,414061,CVX,Under military rule  Venezuela oil workers quit in a stampede,news,By Deisy Buitrago and Alexandra Ulmer CARACAS  Reuters    Chauffeured around in a sleek black pick up  the head of Venezuela s oil industry  Major General Manuel Quevedo  last month toured a joint venture with U S  major  Chevron   NYSE CVX   Flanked by other trucks carrying security guards  Quevedo passed a handful of workers waiting by an oil well cluster  They wanted a word with the OPEC nation s oil minister and president of its state run oil firm  PDVSA  PDVSA UL   about the sorry state of the company  Quevedo and his caravan drove on by   He didn t get out to ask workers about what is going on   said Jesus Tabata  a union leader who works on a rig in the oil rich Orinoco Belt   That way it s easier to keep saying everything is fine   and at the same time keeping us on like slaves on miserable wages   What s going on is that thousands of oil workers are fleeing the state run oil firm under the watch of its new military commander  who has quickly alienated the firm s embattled upper echelon and its rank and file  according to union leaders  a half dozen current PDVSA workers  a dozen former PDVSA workers and a half dozen executives at foreign companies operating in Venezuela  Some PDVSA offices now have lines outside with dozens of workers waiting to quit  In at least one administrative office in Zulia state  human resources staff quit processing out the quitters  hanging a sign   we do not accept resignations   an oil worker there told Reuters  Official workforce statistics have become a closely guarded secret  but a dozen sources told Reuters that many thousands of workers had quit so far this year   an acceleration of an already troubling outflow last year  About 25 000 workers resigned between the start of January 2017 and the end of January 2018  said union leader and government critic Ivan Freites  citing internal company data  That figure comes out of a workforce last officially reported by PDVSA at 146 000 in 2016  Resignations appear to have increased sharply this year  said Freites  a prominent union leader at Venezuela s major refineries in the northern Paraguana peninsula   It s unstoppable   he said  Many of those leaving now are engineers  managers  or lawyers   high level professionals that are almost impossible to replace amid Venezuela s economic meltdown  the PDVSA workers and foreign executives told Reuters  PDVSA and the Oil Ministry did not respond to repeated requests for comment  PDVSA board member and pro government union representative Wills Rangel acknowledged the flight of talent is a serious problem    The massive resignations are worrying   Rangel said in an interview   In refinery operations  many have left   The pace of departures has quickened with the rapid deterioration of PDVSA s operations and finances   radiating pain through the OPEC nation s oil based economy  now beset with food shortages and hyperinflation  Quevedo   a little known former housing minister who replaced two executives jailed for alleged graft   has further poisoned the atmosphere  according to the two dozen sources who spoke with Reuters  A stiff official who rose through the National Guard  Quevedo fired many long term employees upon arrival and urged remaining ones to denounce any of their colleagues who oppose Maduro  He tapped soldiers for top roles  giving the oil firm the atmosphere of a  barrack   two company sources said   The military guys arrive calling the engineers thieves and saboteurs   said a Venezuelan oil executive at a private company who frequently works with PDVSA  Quevedo is also fighting to retain control of a company increasingly riven by turf wars  The ruling socialists  once held together by late leader Hugo Chavez  have succumbed to infighting under Maduro  a former bus driver and union leader who lacks Chavez  charisma and has seen his budget slashed with the decline in global oil prices  Quevedo has clashed with Venezuela s powerful Vice President Tareck El Aissami  When El Aissami in February appointed a vice president to the PDVSA unit that oversees joint ventures with foreign companies  Quevedo removed the appointee and had him arrested  according to three sources with knowledge of the incident  which has not been previously reported   Quevedo is an ally of Socialist Party heavyweight Diosdado Cabello    There is a fight between Diosdado and Tareck for control of the industry   said Hebert Garcia  a former army general who later broke with Maduro and fled the country  The political turmoil and mass resignations threaten Maduro s government  which depends on oil for 90 percent of export revenue  In the Orinoco Belt  some drilling rigs are working only intermittently for lack of crews  said two sources there  In PDVSA s refineries  several small fires have broken out because there are no longer enough supervisors  two sources in the northern Paraguana peninsula said  Lack of personnel in export terminals have forced some ports to cut back working hours  according to two shippers and one trader  Oil production in the first quarter of this year slipped to a 33 year low of 1 6 million barrels per day   WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING   Jobs at PDVSA were once coveted for their generous salaries and benefits  including cheap credit for housing  Now  many PDVSA workers can t feed their families on wages that amount to a handful of U S  dollars a month  Rampant food shortages that caused Venezuelans to report losing an average of 11 kilograms  24 pounds  last year are particularly tough for oil workers tasked with grueling physical work in often remote oil fields  Some oil workers have resorted to working odd jobs on the side  taking vacation to work abroad  or even selling their work uniforms   red overalls   for money to eat   Some workers in Lake Maracaibo  a production region near Colombia  can no longer get to their jobs  according to two sources there  Transport can cost up to 55 000 bolivars   equal to only 10 U S  cents  but close to what some workers earn in a day    Now what we ask each other is   When are you leaving and for where     said one of the Maracaibo workers  who like thousands of other Venezuelans emigrated to Colombia this month   Even in the bathroom  people are talking about quitting    WHO WILL BE LEFT   At PDVSA headquarters  Quevedo often walks through the offices with a half dozen bodyguards who clear his path  according to one current and one former PDVSA employee  The company s ongoing decay is evident all around him in the once polished office tower  Broken elevators  poor cafeteria food  empty desks in once crowded divisions  Maduro has overseen the arrest of dozens of high level PDVSA executives since late last year  sometimes at the Caracas headquarters as shocked employees looked on  Workers now feel watched by supervisors and are loathe to make any business decision out of fear they will later be accused of corruption  the sources said  PDVSA workers  often visibly thinner  sometimes surreptitiously hand out resumes to executives from private companies  according to a source at a foreign firm  In a rare protest last month  angry Oil Ministry workers blocked access to the cafeteria  demanding better benefits and chanting that Quevedo should resign  Venezuela s foreign oil partners  which include California based Chevron  Russia s Rosneft and China s CNPC  are increasingly worried about PDVSA s rapidly departing workforce  according to a half dozen sources at multinational companies operating in Venezuela  But as minority partners  they have little or no sway over salaries and management   The foreign partners have also grown increasingly frustrated with Quevedo  who initially asked for their suggestions on fixing the state run firm but now appears ill disposed toward reforms  the sources said  At least one foreign company is considering bringing in foreign specialists to improve its operations  one of the sources added  But with crime  power cuts and shortages rampant in Venezuela  luring foreign professionals is tough  Still  in the Orinoco belt  some vow to stay in the belief that Maduro s government can t last   We can t give up   said Tabata  the union leader who watched Quevedo s truck drive by that day   This government is unstable and could fall at any moment   and who will be left  ,2018-04-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/under-military-rule-venezuela-oil-workers-quit-in-a-stampede-1397750,1397750

192548,414064,CVX,Exclusive  Arrested Chevron workers could face treason charge in Venezuela   sources,news,"By Marianna Parraga and Alexandra Ulmer HOUSTON CARACAS  Reuters    Two  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  employees detained in Venezuela last week could be charged with treason for refusing to sign a parts contract for a joint venture with state owned oil company PDVSA  according to two sources familiar with draft charges against the U S  firm s executives  The arrests  by national intelligence agents  marked the first at a Western oil firm in Venezuela and represent a dramatic escalation of growing tensions between PDVSA and foreign companies over control of supply contracts  the sources told Reuters  The widening dispute could worsen operational chaos that has caused the OPEC nation s oil output to plunge by 23 percent  or 450 000 barrels per day  since October   These detentions are going to accelerate the operational crisis   another source with knowledge of Chevron s operations told Reuters   Procurement could end up in paralysis if nobody wants to take the risk of signing or authorizing anything   The draft treason charges   seen by Chevron lawyers last week  the two sources said   raised concern that the oil major could get caught in the crossfire between Washington and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro  who accuses the U S  government of sabotaging the economy to topple his administration  The United States has imposed sanctions on senior members of Maduro s government and PDVSA  The two Chevron employees were jailed when they refused to sign a supply contract written by PDVSA executives under an emergency decree   which skips the competitive bidding process  according to a half dozen sources close to the case  Such decrees have been cited by Venezuela prosecutors as a means of extracting bribes in some recent PDVSA corruption cases  The Chevron employees balked when the parts were listed at more than double their market price in a contract worth several million dollars  one of the sources told Reuters  The workers oversaw operations and procurement at Petropiar  an oil upgrading project co owned by PDVSA and Chevron to transform Orinoco Belt s extra heavy crude into an exportable product  Venezuela s national intelligence service  Sebin  arrested the Chevron workers  Carlos Algarra and Rene Vasquez  in front of stunned co workers in a raid of Chevron s office in Puerto La Cruz and the upgrader on April 16   Venezuelan authorities have yet to comment on the arrest of the men  both Venezuelans  and no charges against them have been made public  The Venezuela public prosecutor s office declined to comment  and PDVSA did not respond to several requests for comment  The arrests follow a purge that has seen more than 80 executives at PDVSA and its suppliers jailed for alleged corruption as the state firm s new chief  Major General Manuel Quevedo  has sought to stamp his authority on the sector   the financial lifeblood of Venezuela s unraveling socialist government  Tensions between PDVSA and foreign oil companies have steadily risen since Quevedo took charge in November and appointed military officers who had little or no oil industry experience to senior jobs  Foreign firms have pushed for a greater say in procurement to combat inefficiencies and graft  oil industry sources said  but disputes over governance standards have caused operational delays  raising tensions over Venezuela s falling oil output  In February  the Petropiar upgrader had been temporarily halted because of problems scheduling its exports  and PDVSA executives were concerned it could be forced to stop again due to lack of spare parts  one of the sources said  When the imported furnace parts did not arrive on time  PDVSA executives blamed the Chevron employees for the delays  according to the two sources familiar with the draft charges  The men are being represented by Chevron lawyers  The charges against them have not been formalized and could change  the two sources said  A spokesman for Chevron declined to comment  Venezuela defines treason as conspiring with foreign enemies against the state and proscribes punishment of up to 30 years in prison  Defendants are not entitled to due process protections afforded to those accused of other crimes  according to the statute  As of Sunday  the two men were being held in the offices of the intelligence services in the coastal city of Barcelona  according to the two sources with knowledge of the draft charges  CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE The detentions highlight the growing difficulties for foreign oil firms amid a deepening economic crisis in Venezuela  allegations of rampant corruption  a power struggle within PDVSA and an increasingly authoritarian government  Reuters reported earlier this month that Maduro had granted extra powers to Quevedo to  create  annul or modify  deals involving state energy company PDVSA and its subsidiaries  Foreign oil firms  at a meeting in Caracas this month to discuss how to tackle production problems at joint ventures  expressed their concerns over procurement and governance to Quevedo  according to documents seen by Reuters  PDVSA has a minimum 60 percent stake in joint ventures and has been slow to share operational control  despite large scale staff resignations in recent months   About 25 000 PDVSA workers resigned between the start of January 2017 and the end of January 2018  out of a workforce last officially reported at 146 000  Reuters reported last week  The resignations   including high level professionals that are now almost impossible to replace   have only accelerated since Quevedo arrived  two dozen industry sources told Reuters  Oil majors such as Chevron and Eni SpA   Total  SA  PA TOTF  and Repsol  MC REP  SA still operate in Venezuela  home to the world s largest oil reserves  Although no foreign workers have been detained in the purge of the sector until last week  some companies have previously withdrawn expatriate workers over security concerns  Many foreign workers  families are reluctant to stay in Venezuela for long periods  one executive from a company operating in the Orinoco Belt told Reuters

192549,414065,CVX,Australia s  20 Billion Missed Opportunity Shows Tax Problem,news," Bloomberg     Australia is on track to match Qatar as the world s biggest liquefied natural gas exporter next year  The boost to the budget bottom line  Virtually nil 
While the Persian Gulf nation is forecast to rake in as much as A 26 6 billion   20 1 billion  in fiscal 2020 from taxes on the fuel  Australia is set to reap a paltry A 800 million  according to analysis by the Tax Justice Network s Australian office 
Australia s Petroleum Resource Rent Tax levies 40 percent on profits after company tax has been paid  a system that works pretty well for oil projects but is a poor fit for LNG projects  That s because an oil venture can be cash positive within a few years of production  while LNG requires significantly more capital expenditure  prolonging the time before it generates enough cash to pay tax  a government report found 
The figures  are an indication the fiscal regime for Australia s LNG sector is broken   said Juan Carlos Boue  who made a submission to Australia s inquiry on tax avoidance while working as an oil industry consultant at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies   The incentives are simply too excessive  
Australia is set to post its 10th straight budget deficit  even as receipts get a boost from higher commodity prices and strong employment growth  Treasurer Scott Morrison is tipped to flag personal cuts in the May 8 budget    about a year out from a general election    and should still be able to project a return to surplus by 2021  He announced the dumping of a planned tax hike on Thursday following a A 4 8 billion windfall in tax receipts 
The potential for greater stimulus is vast  especially in an economy that relies heavily on consumption  A  back of the envelope  calculation by  HSBC Holdings  Plc  LON HSBA  shows that A 10 billion in tax cuts and spending could boost the economy by 0 6 percentage point of gross domestic product 
Lawmakers are gun shy on tackling resource taxes after a ferocious campaign by mining companies against such a proposal in 2010 that helped topple the then prime minister  While the opposition Labor party has proposed curbing some loopholes such as tax breaks on property and cash refunds to retirees  the government has pledged to retain them  That just further limits its scope to provide relief 
 Every special treatment that s in the tax code has an army of people who want to defend it to the death   said Saul Eslake  an independent economist who has campaigned to overhaul the system of revenue raising for much of the past quarter century   It has become politically fraught in Australia  
As politicians uphold the status quo  significant new LNG volumes are poised to start production this year   Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX   s gigantic Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects off Western Australia will pay no PRRT until the end of the next decade  according to an estimate by  Barclays   LON BARC  Capital 
Not  Shortchanged 
Treasurer Morrison did take advantage of a community backlash against the finance industry to introduce a bank levy last year  but has shown little appetite to take on LNG multinationals  He last year argued that Australians weren t being  shortchanged  by the industry  following a review of energy taxes 
Part of the problem with reforming Australia s tax system is that every time a government moves to close a loophole  lobbyists emerge to fight it  Labor has managed to avoid much scrutiny of its recent plans due to the government s frequent  self inflicted crises 
With one recent exception  The retirement industry and government have kicked up a stink over the opposition s latest plan to scrap a loophole that gives refunds to some shareholders  even if they re retired and don t pay tax 
 We ve allowed ourselves to be bullied into thinking the tax code is inviolable   said Eslake   It s not

A bearish American Petroleum Institute  API  report  as well as the continuing drama surrounding Turkey is raising fears of a slowdown in oil demand based upon fears of raising contagion coming out of Turkey  The oil market that tried to mount a major comeback yesterday was thwarted by a risk aversion in the dollar that sunk oil  as well as industrial and precious metals  Oils case was not helped  as the API reported a much larger than expected 3 66 million barrel increase in supply and It was led by a big 1 5 million barrel increase in Cushing Oklahoma  We did get a bullish gasoline draw  as it appears that U S gas demand bounced back as pump prices eased  Yet  a 1 64 million barrel increase in distillate kind of offset some on the bullishness of the gasoline draw 
Now  in a pre Turkey contagion raging market  we would probably shake off and look beyond this report to the overall big picture bullish market fundamentals  Yet  the fears surrounding Turkey are on fire this morning and it may take a political event to stop the fear  The arrest of Pastor Andrew Brunson  the American being held under house arrest  is the reason why President Donald Trump started to put economic pressure on Turkey  If he is released  then it is very possible that the U S  will lift sanctions on Turkey and we can go back to a more normal market  Yet  Fox News reported that Turkey  on Wednesday  rejected the U S   appeal for an American pastor s release from detention  Turkish media reported  Pastor Andrew Brunson s lawyer renewed an appeal on Tuesday for Brunson s release from house arrest and for his travel ban to be lifted  Yet  Reuters is reporting that an upper court is yet to rule on the appeal  his lawyer told Reuters on Wednesday  If the upper court allows him to go free  sanctions will be dropped and what this will be is like a fire drill stress test  If they don t release him  we may start to see some real stress and the contagion is indeed raging to other markets 
The Wall Street Journal wrote yesterday that  Sharp declines in the Turkish lira  Indian rupee and other currencies have raised the prospect of a self reinforcing flight from riskier emerging markets  While the lira recovered slightly on Tuesday  and so did many peers  India s currency tumbled past 70 per dollar  a historic low  Across the world  the Argentine peso fell another 2 1   even after an emergency increase in interest rates to 45  from 40   The unexpected price action has sparked questions over how contagious the selloff might be  even for far flung markets

At this point there is only one data point that has yet to confirm renewed strength in the bull market  One more market to make a new all time high  One last hurdle  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the lone Index that has yet to make a new all time high  It would seem that this Index of 30 mega cap stocks should not hold up the party with the other 7000 stocks 

In fact there are plenty of the Industrials that are also at all time highs  so it is not even all 30 of them  There is only 1 of the 30 that is more that 5  below its high  Chevron  NYSE CVX   And although the Industrials are 552 points below the all time high close this is only just over 2  from the top 
Many eyes will continue to watch as historically the Industrials have been the barometer of a bull market  When they make a new all time high after the Transports also do so  they reconfirm the primary trend as bullish in Dow Theory  Maybe these two sectors do not carry as much importance about the broad market direction as they did in the early 20th Century  or maybe they still do  Either way the debate will rage until a new high is made 
The Industrials do have a lot of support for that to happen  They have made a series of higher highs and higher lows since bottoming at the 200 day SMA in the beginning of April  They also have bullish momentum readings with the RSI strong in the bullish zone and the MACD rising and positive  The Bollinger Bands  are also supportive of further upside as they point higher and are opening 
It would be fun if the market closed out the month and headed into Labor Day Weekend with the Industrials finally making a new high  Three days left to go for that  Or maybe they take the weekend off and wait until September  I can t wait to see what happens

192560,414076,CVX,Fear And Speculation Rule As Oil Markets Ignore Reality,opinion,"Right now  the two most important factors affecting oil markets are fear and speculation based on that fear  The fear is that at some point over the next several months there will not be enough oil available on the global market to fully satisfy customer demand  The speculation is that this fear will push oil prices into the triple digits  But are these concerns in line with reality 

Hedge funds and major oil trading houses are all betting that the United States  Saudi Arabia  the UAE  Iraq  Kuwait and Russia will not be able to produce and export enough barrels of oil to offset the decline in oil production and exports from Venezuela and Iran over the next few months  These positions have caused the Brent benchmark to gain 4 82  and WTI to jump by 5  over the past 7 days 
The fear of this hypothetical supply and demand imbalance is overriding fundamental indications that the oil market is well balanced at present and that there will be enough supply to accommodate demand  Platts reported that Saudi oil minister Khalid al Falih told attendees at the Russia Energy Week Forum this week that   there is not a single customer who has requested a barrel since June that hasn t been supplied   This may be true  but the price of Brent has risen 10  since the beginning of July  indicating that the market is largely controlled by speculation and fear  not supply and demand 
U S  President Donald Trump s recent remarks directed towards OPEC and Saudi Arabia reflects his frustration with the recent increase in oil prices  Average gasoline prices in the United States are nearing the  3 per gallon mark and there is still more room to rise between now and the midterm elections 
When it comes to supply  the truth is that Saudi Arabia and Russia are delivering  both in messaging and in oil  but the market seems to be ignoring it  OPEC and its non OPEC partners may not have formally indicated that an increase in oil production is warranted at the group s most recent meeting in September  but in reality  the big producers are singing a different tune 
Khalid al Falih announced on Wednesday morning that Saudi Arabia s October production has already increased to 10 7 million barrels per day  This reflects an increase of 200 000 to 300 000 barrels per day from September 
Likewise  Russia announced that its production rose 150 000 barrels per day in September and Vladimir Putin said that Russia could increase production by another 300 000 barrels per day 
There are also indications that Saudi Arabia  Kuwait and Chevron  NYSE CVX  are coming to an agreement that would restart oil production in the neutral zone area between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait  Reports are conflicted on whether oil production would come online immediately following an agreement or whether it would take at least 6 months to get the area up and running again 
Market speculators seem to be ignoring this information  as oil prices continued to rise as this news was being reported 
There are also bearish indications for oil on the demand side  but the market is ignoring them as well  The EIA s weekly data showed a build in oil stockpiles in the U S  This kind of information would typically result in a decline in prices  but it did not  Gasoline inventories in the United States are also at record highs for this time of year  which indicates that refineries may soon decrease their crude oil purchases until the inventory is used up  Europe is entering its refinery maintenance season and crude oil draws should reflect a drop in demand  but the market is ignoring this information 
Fear and speculation regarding the Iran sanctions can only buoy the oil market so far  At a certain point  the supply situation will be clear and the fear factor will dissipate  We are left with two questions 
How high can prices be pushed  And when will this bubble pop ",2018-10-04,"Ellen R. Wald, Ph.D.",https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-is-fear-200346892,200346892

out as one of the highest quality names in the integrated oil and gas universe  While shares have run up considerably and are just 10  off their 52 week highs  there is still time to add the stock to your portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead The performance was supported by the company s excellent earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in each

recovery  Shell s integrated gas business   consisting of the BG Group activities   also impressed on the back of pricing and production gains  Importantly  the Anglo Dutch company s position as a major supplier of LNG should help cash flow to grow even further Not surprisingly  the stock is a huge draw among investors and is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Let s take a look into the factors why this mega cap company is one of the best bets in the  Why Royal Dutch Shell is a Good Pick Impressive Stock Performance  Royal Dutch Shell has outperformed the industry over a year  The company s shares have rallied 27 2  over this period compared with a roughly 18 6  rise recorded by the industry The BG Factor  In 2016  Royal Dutch Shell acquired the U K  s third largest energy player BG Group for a total consideration of  50 billion  The company has made remarkable progress regarding the speed of its BG integration  Shell s integrated gas business   consisting of the BG Group activities   reported first quarter adjusted income of  2 439 million  more than doubling from the  1 181 million in January March quarter of 2017 A Free Cash Flow Machine  For 2017  the Anglo Dutch company generated an impressive  27 6 billion in free cash flows  the most by any supermajor  Moreover  Shell was comfortably able to cover its payouts with cash from operations   something that investors really want right now On Track with the Disinvestment Target  With the recently inked  worth  1 3 billion  Shell is close to achieve its  30 billion multiyear divestment program to lower debt that shot up in the wake of BG acquisition  With Shell already wrapping up transactions worth  27 billion and having announced further asset disposals of around  2 billion  the company remains focused to meet its target by 2018 Scrip Dividend Cancellation  Hit by the industry downturn  Shell began to pay dividend in the form of shares in 2015 to address cash flow woes  However  the supermajor finally aborted the two and a half year long scrip dividend program as cost containment efforts and divestment strategies have paid off  The company s solid results over the past few quarters also underscore the fact that it has successfully adapted itself to thrive at  50 barrel crude LNG Leadership  The BG acquisition also made Shell the largest liquefied natural gas  or LNG  producer in the world  With LNG demand likely to rise to around 500 million tons per annum by 2030 on the back of strong consumption from Asian importers like China  South Korea and India  Shell s position as a major supplier of LNG should help the company meet the fuel s growing demand and help cash flow to grow even further Robust Earnings Growth Expectations  The Zacks

192575,414091,CVX,How Shell hid a Whale before placing Mexican oil bet,news,"By Ron Bousso and Marianna Parraga LONDON HOUSTON  Reuters    The gasps in the audience were clearly audible at the auction of Mexico s oil blocks a month ago as Royal Dutch Shell s hefty bids were announced one by one  The size of Shell s cash payments    343 million out of the total of  525 million that Mexico earned in the sale   far outstripped its competitors  offers  guaranteeing that the company swept up nine of the 19 offshore blocks  The Anglo Dutch major knew something no one else did  Six months earlier  its drilling rig had struck a giant oil reservoir  the Whale well  in the U S  side of the Gulf of Mexico   just across the border from many of the Mexican blocks  which share a similar Paleogene age geology  Calculating that this significantly increased the chances of the Mexican blocks also containing treasure  Shell delayed the announcement of the discovery until the day of the auction  after bids had been submitted   Post the Whale discovery we had some geological insights  It is not by accident we didn t announce it until the day of the bid   Andy Brown  Shell s head of oil and gas production  told Reuters   The nine blocks give us significant potential    The geological intelligence gleaned from the Whale discovery explains why Shell  L RDSa  bid so aggressively for the Mexican blocks  something that had confounded industry experts   It could also offer insight into the rationale underpinning its bet that Latin America   particularly Mexico and Brazil   will be a major source of new reserves as its current resources dwindle  Shell  or any other explorer  is not legally obliged to publicly disclose a discovery  The fact that its first major exploration success in over 10 years came adjacent to blocks coming up for auction was a matter of good fortune  while the timing of the announcement was canny  Shell has not yet released any estimates for the Whale s recoverable resources  but two industry sources close to the exploration project put the figure at up to 700 million barrels of oil  That equates to about half of Shell s 2017 oil production and would make the reservoir one of the biggest discoveries of the past decade in the industry  Shell declined to comment on the potential size of the reserves  Fossil fuels like oil are formed over millions of years in specific rock formations  which geologists and explorers try to identify via seismic studies and drilling to predict where resources might be found  But  even though a similar geology might increase the chances of similar exploration success  there are no guarantees  and luck is always a big factor  So there is no certainty that the Mexican blocks will yield commercial volumes of oil   For a graphic on Shell s oil and gas reserves click    NOT  OBSESSED  Shell acquired large amounts of specialized seismic data before the auction  about Whale and the Mexican blocks  to try to gain a better sense of the geological formations and potential oil reserves under the seabed  according to a source at an oil services company that provides such information    Even for us it was surprising the way Shell bid during Mexico s deepwater auction  They really wanted the blocks close to the border  which indicates there must be a link between the formation in the U S  and in Mexico   the source added   Shell needs to replenish its oil and gas reserves to maintain its production into the 2030s  Aside from the  54 billion acquisition of BG Group in 2016  which boosted its reserves  the company has had limited success in recent years   Last year  it was able to replace only 27 percent of its production  while on a three year average  the figure was 78 percent  the company disclosed in its full year results  The decline in reserves means that at the end of 2017 Shell had enough reserves to sustain its production for 8 9 years  compared with around 10 5 years in 2015   CEO Ben Van Beurden  while insisting he was not  obsessed  with the scale of his company s reserves  said Shell was starting to work on restocking its resources   We have a deepwater program that looks pretty good all the way into the next decade  but if you look at the second half of the next decade     you will need new elements in the development funnel to sustain the cash flow generation   he told reporters after the annual results announcement last month  Shell has now given itself seven years to replenish its exploration program in order to sustain its deepwater production growth well into the 2030s  he added  The company  like many of its peers  was forced to dramatically slash spending in recent years because of weak oil prices  with its exploration budgets hit particularly hard  Now that prices have recovered to a near three year high of around  65 a barrel  firms feel more confident to once again invest in expensive offshore developments  Shell owns a 60 percent stake in the

192583,414099,CVX,California says will block crude oil from Trump offshore drilling plan,news,"By Sharon Bernstein SACRAMENTO  Calif   Reuters    California will block the transportation through its state of petroleum from new offshore oil rigs  officials told Reuters on Wednesday  a move meant to hobble the Trump administration s effort to vastly expand drilling in U S  federal waters  California s plan to deny pipeline permits for transporting oil from new leases off the Pacific Coast is the most forceful step yet by coastal states trying to halt the biggest proposed expansion in decades of federal oil and gas leasing   Officials in Florida  North and South Carolina  Delaware and Washington  have also warned drilling could despoil beaches  harm wildlife and hurt lucrative tourism industries   I am resolved that not a single drop from Trump s new oil plan ever makes landfall in California   Lt  Governor Gavin Newsom  chair of the State Lands Commission and a Democratic candidate for governor  said in an emailed statement  The commission sent a letter on Wednesday to the U S  Interior Department s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management  BOEM  urging the bureau s program manager Kelly Hammerle to withdraw the draft proposal  saying the public did not have an adequate opportunity to provide input on the plan    It is certain that the state would not approve new pipelines or allow use of existing pipelines to transport oil from new leases onshore   the commission wrote in the letter seen by Reuters  California has clashed repeatedly with President Donald Trump s administration over a range of other issues since last year  from climate change to automobile efficiency standards to immigration  The Interior Department last month announced its proposal to open nearly all U S  offshore waters to oil and gas drilling  sparking protests from coastal states  environmentalists and the tourism industry   Governors from nearly every U S  coastal state except Alaska and Maine expressed opposition  and even Alaska s governor requested sensitive areas be removed  The proposal also comes amid low U S  oil industry demand for new offshore leases  as drillers focus on cheaper and highly productive wells onshore that have pushed U S  production over 10 millions barrels per day for the first time since 1970   Heather Swift  spokeswoman for Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke  said developing the five year plan for offshore oil and gas leases is  a very open and public process    Secretary Zinke looks forward to meeting with more Governors and other coastal representatives who want to discuss the draft program   she said  adding the bureau  has planned 23 public meetings  in our coastal states  to secure feedback directly from citizens   In an interview on Tuesday  William Brown  the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management s chief environmental officer  said state input is taken seriously  and has resulted in past drilling plans being scaled back  He said the approval process would take two years and include an environmental review  PROTESTS Trump has said more offshore drilling would boost the U S  economy and national security by reducing reliance on imported oil   Opponents of offshore drilling have complained that Congress has passed no new safety standards since  BP   LON BP  Plc s Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010  It took months to stop that leak  which became the largest oil spill in American history  despoiling the environment of Gulf Coast states and causing billions of dollars in economic damage  Offshore drilling has been restricted in California since a 1969 oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara  In 2015  another spill in Santa Barbara County sent as much as 2 400 barrels of oil  101 000 gallons or 382 000 liters  onto the coast and into the Pacific  leaving slicks that stretched over nine miles  14 km   Major oil companies  like  Chevron  Corp  N CVX   have long since abandoned their efforts in California s offshore region  despite its estimated 250 million barrels of proven oil reserves  due in part to legislative and political hurdles and easier prospects elsewhere  Chevron gave away the U S  Geological Survey seismic data on offshore California and other parts of the U S  West Coast for research use in 2005  deeming it no longer commercially useful  Neal Kirby  a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Association of America  which represents small and mid sized drilling companies  said his members support the administration s drilling plan   But  he said that the industry was primarily interested in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico  a region close to existing oil infrastructure and highly productive fields  He said if California bars oil from passing through pipelines  companies would be even less likely to seek new offshore leases there  A number of other states have asked the Interior Department to exempt them from the drilling plan  So far  Secretary Zinke has said he would exempt Florida  which borders the Eastern Gulf and the Southeastern Atlantic  to protect its tourism industry and he has promised to hold discussions with other states that have expressed concerns   On Jan  24  U S  lawmakers from Florida sent Zinke a letter pressing him to honor his pledge  noting that the acting chief of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management had said Florida s coast is  still under consideration for offshore drilling

192587,414103,CVX,Chevron Dodges Climate  Methane Proposals In Annual Meeting ,opinion,"Chevron Corporation   NYSE CVX   recently held its annual meeting  wherein its shareholders voted against two non binding resolutions proposed to fight climate change  The outcome of the vote can upset the environment activists who are pressurizing the oil and gas companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions  But the last laugh is still up for grab 
Chevron s shareholders are following a similar path as shown by Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc s  investors  who  that could have compelled Shell to commit to firmer carbon emission reducing objectives  Notably  the Anglo Dutch energy mammoth is currently following a  wide ranging and progressive approach  toward energy transition  enabling the company to invest more in renewable energy since the last few quarters 
Climate Related Resolutions 
One out of the two resolutions focused on methane emissions  demanding the company to take firmer steps toward monitoring and reducing emissions  Methane is the primary component of natural gas  and stronger and harmful than carbon dioxide  The resolution received 45  of the total votes cast 
The second resolution demanded Chevron to provide a business model  following which the company can reduce its carbon footprint and shift more toward renewable energy  The proposal was in line with the Paris accord and received only 8  of the total votes cast 
What s in Store 
Although oil majors like Chevron are not being affected at the moment from these proposals  it might not be the same in the future  The votes cast were against the resolutions proposed  yet the companies are responding to the pressure from the activists  Chevron has been focusing on reducing carbon footprint since a long time  and the recent votes will only add to that notion 
Winning against the emission proposal by a low margin  55 45   further confirms the fact  This is the current trend in the industry  despite President Trump pulling back from the issue  Although Chevron does not need to address the situation currently  failure to pay heed to the investors  sentiment can hurt the company s bottom line in the future 
Another energy company  Fort Worth  TX based Range Resources Corp    NYSE RRC   witnessed somewhat similar voting scenario  wherein the company lost to the proposals  as 50 3  voted in favor of the resolution  Range Resources is now required to review its methane curbing policy  Even though the vote was non binding  it surely shows which way the investors are treading

192588,414104,CVX,Chevron s  CVX  South African Assets  Bidding War Heats,opinion,"Chevron Corporation s   NYSE CVX   South African asset divestment recently witnessed a new turn of events  as competition among the bidders became intense  China Petroleum   Chemical Corporation or Sinopec   NYSE SNP   and Switzerland based Glencore  LON GLEN  Plc   OTC GLNCY   were in the race to acquire the assets 
Earlier  Sinopec won approval from the South African watchdog  Competition Tribunal  which had positioned Sinopec a step closer to victory over Glencore  However  the recent turn of events can change the outcome 
The Public Investment Corporation   PIC    a quasi public investment entity of South Africa  has now entered the bidding war  according to reports  The entity is planning to back Glencore in the acquisition  buying 50  stake in the assets  Notably  the assets up for sale include more than 800 Caltex service stations and a 100 000 barrel per day refinery 
The Glencore and PIC team is planning on exercising a preemptive right held by the empowerment partner of Chevron  Off the Shelf  Mashudu Ramano is an influential person in charge of the empowerment partnership  Moreover  PIC is responsible for several funds including the government pension fund s 2 trillion rands  It makes the entity a large empowerment player in the country 
Sinopec won the first round in acquiring 75  Chevron stake in the assets for  900 million  With PIC joining Glencore  the next rounds can be enticing for the investors 
Notably  the deal with Sinopec went largely in favor of the local government as Ebrahim Patel  the Economic Development Minister  squeezed out several commitments from the Chinese energy giant for the local communities  The commitments included Sinopec investing 6 billion rand in the economy  Now  if a new deal is made with Glencore and its partners  the kind of commitments the local government will receive is yet to be seen 
The sell out from Chevron is in line with its divestment program announced in 2014  as the company is focusing on balancing its global portfolio with long term business priorities  Moreover  it will help Chevron cut costs and streamline its business models to help it concentrate more on the assets producing higher margin barrels

192597,414113,CVX,Exclusive  Small refiners hit EPA with surge of biofuel waiver requests  sources,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw NEW YORK  Reuters    More than two dozen small U S  refineries are seeking waivers from the nation s biofuels law  an unusually high number that reflects growing oil industry resistance to the program  according to sources familiar with the matter  The requests  made to the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  add pressure on the administration of President Donald Trump to help an industry that claims the U S  Renewable Fuel Standard  RFS  costs it billions of dollars a year by requiring refiners to blend increasing volumes of biofuels like corn based ethanol into the nation s gasoline and diesel  Philadelphia Energy Solutions  the largest U S  East Coast refiner  filed for bankruptcy on Monday and blamed its financial distress on the program  While the White House and EPA chief Scott Pruitt have expressed concern for refiners and are mediating talks between representatives of the industry and the ethanol lobby  they have so far largely sided with corn growing states with large Republican majorities   The sources familiar with the matter said the EPA was currently reviewing 27 waiver applications from small refineries  covering multiple years  They said more refiners had applied this year than usual  emboldened by the Trump administration s anti regulatory stance as well as recent court rulings that broadened the EPA s criteria for granting waivers  The EPA has the authority to grant exemptions from the program to refineries with a capacity under 75 000 barrels per day if the company can demonstrate financial hardship  but the agency has been reluctant to do so in the past  In the four years ended in 2016  the EPA granted a total of 29 small refiner exemptions   fewer than eight a year on average  according to data provided to Reuters by the EPA in response to a Freedom of Information Act request   A U S  appeals court concluded last August  in a case filed by Sinclair Refining against the EPA  that the agency was being too strict in granting waivers only to companies that can prove the RFS would drive them out of business  There are 53 refineries in the United States with capacity less than 75 0000 bpd  and their owners include some of the nation s largest oil companies  including  Chevron  Corp  N CVX  and Andeavor  formerly  Tesoro    N ANDV    Waiver requests and decisions are considered private business matters by the EPA and not typically disclosed  An official at the agency who asked not to be named said the EPA was reviewing waiver applications on a case by case basis but did not provide details on numbers  An EPA spokesman declined to comment  If all or most of the current applications were granted by the EPA  it could drive down prices for blending credits  called RINs  which must be earned or purchased by refiners to prove they are complying with the RFS program   That is because exempted refiners could sell any credits they have on hand  instead of using them for compliance  Aggressive use of the EPA s exemption authority could also reduce the total amount of ethanol that the nation s refiners must blend  and have a more dramatic impact on RIN prices   
Since 2013  RIN prices have swung violently  from 16 cents to nearly  1 50  More recently  RIN prices have fallen to the low 60 cent range  in part because of unusual selling of credits  sparking speculation that exemptions will be  or already have been  granted  two credit brokers said ",2018-01-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/exclusive-small-refiners-hit-epa-with-surge-of-biofuel-waiver-requests-sources-1149627,1149627

192608,414124,CVX,The Energy Report For April 26  No One Knows But Macron,opinion,"US President Donald Trump says that no one knows what he will do about the insane and ridiculous Iranian nuclear accord  but he said to French President Emanuel Macron   you have a pretty good idea   Oil is up as the French President shared that idea and said his bet was that Trump would drop out of the deal because of what he suggested were domestic reasons  Oil traders then bet that there would be an enhanced political risk factor in oil against a back drop of tightening global supply  We are also seeing concern about Venezuela as two Chevron  NYSE CVX  employees detained in Venezuela last week could be charged with treason for refusing to sign a parts contract for a joint venture with state and Chevron pulled out other executives  Miltary rule of the oil industry is not going so well  Venezuela s crude production has fallen from almost 2 5 million barrels per day  bpd  in early 2016 to around 1 5 million bpd 
It s clear that the bearish talking points on oil are being proven to be wrong and the trade and major agencies are coming to grips with a secular bull oil market  Even the World Bank raised their forecast for oil to a lofty  65 a barrel  up sharply from their previous forecast of  53 for 2017  The World Bank sites strong consumer demand as well as OPEC Non OPEC compliance to cuts and now expects the prices of crude oil  natural gas  and coal to increase by 20 percent in 2018  up an incredible 16 percent from last year s upward revision from the bank s previous commodity market outlook from October last year 
This comes as the US becomes the world s best hope for production increases as well as filling their new role as oil refiners to the world  In fact  US oil exports broke a record as we sent roughly 8 3 million barrels of oil products to an energy hungry world  To put that in perspective that is up 450  from just 10 years ago  US refiners are doing an amazing job  improving efficiencies and maxing out production 
Still refiners must take a break some time  Oil saw a surprise 2 2 million barrel build as we saw a drop in US refinery runs due to maintenance and other issues  Record exports for oil were offset by a strong week of oil imports as US refiners seek heavier crude to mix with the too light shale oil 
The EIA reported that US crude oil refinery inputs averaged over 16 6 million barrels per day during the week  328 000 barrels per day less than the previous week s average  Refineries operated at 90 8  of their operable capacity last week  Gasoline production decreased last week  averaging 9 9 million barrels per day  Distillate fuel production decreased last week  averaging 5 0 million barrels per day  The EIA for products reported that gasoline inventories increased by 0 8 million barrels last week and are in the upper half of the average range  Both finished gasoline inventories and blending components inventories increased last week  Distillate fuel inventories decreased by 2 6 million barrels last week and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of year  Oil Is well below average for this time of year 
So is the bullish case for oil all bad  Should we be doom and gloom about the economy  The answer is no  As I have said before  rising energy prices are a good thing if they are rising for the right reason  That is if it is being driven by economic growth as it is now and not some other disaster factor 
These points were raised brilliantly from my old friend Caroline Baum at MarketWatch s  Rising oil prices release a gusher of crude nonsense   She asks 

Strong demand is pushing prices up  so why are economists warning about demand weakening 
There is nothing  and I mean nothing  that causes economists to lose their moorings the way oil prices do  When crude prices are rising  economists forget the foundations of microeconomics   the law of supply and demand   and assert that higher prices are a tax on the consumer  a driver of inflation  a brake on economic growth  or all the above  I think that an industrial commodity  albeit a vital one  is endowed with such power 

With US crude oil closing in on  70 a barrel  a price last seen in late 2014  the Wall Street Journal published an article on Monday filled with inherent contradictions  displaying all the accumulated nonsense about oil prices  According to the Journal 

If crude continues to move higher  it could begin to stifle economic growth
Higher consumer prices for gasoline and other energy products act like a tax  while pushing inflation higher

One economist quoted in the story warned of higher oil prices  sucking cash flow out of the economy   Another said that an increase of   10 to  15 a barrel  from the current  Goldilocks zone  would be a drag on growth  At the same time  the article cited Goldman Sachs  assessment that the first quarter of 2018 witnessed the strongest year over year increase in global oil demand in seven years   Demand has remained strong even as oil and fuel prices have been rising   according to the Journal  Imagine that  Maybe strong demand is driving the rise in prices  in which case expectations of stifled growth are totally misplaced  A must read for those that always think that rising oil prices are a bad thing 
Natural Gas prices are rising and that is a bad thing if you like spring  We have seen prices rise as winter keeps hanging on and we might jump right to summer  I do not know about you  but I want my spring back  Well maybe we will see a sign of spring as the EIA will finally show an injection into supply in today s report  Farmer are getting into the fields  Diesel demand will stay strong  We see a demand surge coming  Total Commercial inventories are well below where we have been in years  Make sure you have your risk hedged ",2018-04-26,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-042618-200309379,200309379

192611,414127,CVX,Paralysis at PDVSA  Venezuela s oil purge cripples company,news,"By Alexandra Ulmer and Marianna Parraga CARACAS HOUSTON  Reuters    Decisions at some joint ventures with foreign firms are delayed  A growing number of oil tankers sit idle because no one authorizes payments  Employees struggle to get approval for routine expenses  from taxis to training   An alleged crackdown on graft in Venezuela  seen by critics as an effort by President Nicolas Maduro to consolidate power  has sown panic across the country s energy industry and all but paralyzed state run Petroleos de Venezuela SA  or PDVSA  according to people at the company and across the sector   The ongoing purge  in which prosecutors have arrested at least 67 executives including two recently ousted oil ministers  now threatens to further harm operations for the OPEC country  which is already producing at near 30 year lows and struggling to run PDVSA units including Citgo Petroleum  its U S  refiner   Further trouble for the all important industry could cause yet more economic chaos in the once prosperous Andean country  which is currently grappling with a profound recession  soaring crime and violence  crippled public services and the world s steepest inflation rate   Many of those detained have not yet been replaced  as the once world leading company  already struggling with a brain drain  wants for qualified personnel  Executives that remain  meanwhile  are so rattled by the arrests that they are loathe to act  scared they will later be accused of wrongdoing    In PDVSA  nobody dares sign anything now  not even a Christmas card   said one executive at a joint venture between PDVSA and a foreign firm in the Orinoco oil belt  asking to remain anonymous   Interviews with around 20 current and former PDVSA employees  executives at foreign firms  traders and PDVSA clients say fear is compounding problems including the loss of talent  mounting debts  equipment shortages  rampant theft and chronic underinvestment   Venezuela s Oil Ministry and PDVSA  PDVSA UL  did not respond to a request for comment    WITCH HUNT   Oil accounts for over 90 percent of Venezuela s export revenue and provides the hard currency for Maduro s socialist government  Yet the country  which sits on the world s largest crude reserves  is now producing under 2 million barrels per day  bpd    A political tool even before Maduro mentor Hugo Chavez became president in 1999  PDVSA has increasingly become an extension of Venezuela s beleaguered government  critics say  with lackeys and soldiers now filling posts  including the top job  that once required industry expertise   In what some executives call a  witch hunt   some mid level managers are now using the purge as an excuse to fire anti government employees or even disliked colleagues    You say anything against anyone right now  and they believe you   said one PDVSA employee  calling from a relative s phone to avoid potential eavesdropping   The purge comes years after industry analysts and opposition politicians began criticizing PDVSA management for widespread graft  A report by the opposition led Congress last year said at least  11 billion went  missing  at PDVSA between 2004 and 2014   For years  the government decried such accusations as  smear campaigns  against socialism and in favor of a U S  backed coup   But Maduro  expected to run for reelection next year  recently changed tone  He now blames  thieves  and  traitors  for an economic crisis so severe that disease and malnutrition are spreading unchecked by a broken public health system   Arrests  including that of former oil ministers and PDVSA bosses Eulogio Del Pino and Nelson Martinez last month  have targeted officials once thought untouchable  Attorneys and opposition figures criticize prosecutors for providing little evidence of crimes   Maduro last month appointed a general to take the reins of PDVSA and the oil ministry  The new oil czar  former housing minister Major General Manuel Quevedo  has no experience in the energy sector   Quevedo has yet to produce a detailed business plan  but has vowed to boost production by 1 million bpd   roughly the volume lost in the last four years    If we can build almost 2 million homes  we can recover production   he said in a recent speech to employees  urging them to name and shame  squalid  pro opposition colleagues   Critics within the sector say Quevedo s words betray ignorance of what it would take to revive the foundering industry  They say there is no proof that the general even oversaw construction of that many houses   Already  Quevedo decreed that all contracts with PDVSA be reviewed in a  clean up   While it is unclear what the review will entail  it has already spooked clients and partners who fear for the integrity of existing contracts   DELAYS AND CONFUSION  There is also growing concern about PDVSA s dwindling ability to finance payments and operations  especially with inexperienced executives now at the helm   Some PDVSA employees say boat shortages are so acute in western Lake Maracaibo that workers often cannot get to platforms  Late payments have led tanker operators to halt around 18 vessels needed to carry oil and refined products  two sources said   PDVSA s crown jewel  Texas based Citgo  has not been spared   Most of its board was arrested in Caracas last month  and Asdrubal Chavez  a cousin of the late president  was appointed to replace his jailed predecessor  So far  Chavez is managing Citgo from Caracas  two sources said  causing delays and confusion   Citgo did not respond to a request for comment  Even much of the day to day office work at PDVSA has ground to a halt  One PDVSA worker said simple expenses like taxis are now off the table   They ve suspended training courses   said another employee  Combined  the woes are prompting analysts to question just how low Venezuela s oil production will fall  The International Energy Agency predicts output will fall at least 500 000 bpd to 1 5 million bpd in 2018  Analysis firm Medley Global Advisors forecasts a decline of as much as 550 000 bpd  citing risks including  PDVSA s militarization and purge of what remains of its technical capacity   A steep drop would heighten chances that cash strapped Venezuela defaults on some  60 billion in foreign debt  Maduro s government has sought to restructure the debt  but has continued to make payments  albeit with delays   Even if production rebounded  PDVSA does not stand to reap a windfall  A growing portion of exports are being used to repay loans from allies  like China and Russia  who have thrown vital lifelines to Maduro s government   Meanwhile  foreign companies in Venezuela  including U S  oil major  Chevron  Corp   N CVX  and Russian energy giant Rosneft  MM ROSN   are frustrated  They see little progress on longstanding demands  from more operational control at joint ventures with PDVSA to better security at isolated oil fields  according to people close to the firms    We ve lost hope of resolving our problems   said one executive   We re on hold

192616,414132,CVX,Oil Jumps as Resurgent Chinese Demand Brightens Global Outlook,news," Bloomberg     Crude edged higher as near record Chinese orders for foreign crude signaled stronger demand in the world s second largest economy 
Futures climbed as much as 1 9 percent in New York  A rebound in China s crude imports last month from a one year low defused some of the pessimism among investors fanned by a U S  government report earlier this week showing bearish increases in fuel inventories and domestic oil production 
 Everyone is talking about that big jump in imports of crude into China last month   according to John Kilduff  a partner at Again Capital LLC  a New York based hedge fund   It s definitely a strong source of demand  
This year s watershed moment for global oil markets was last month s agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  Russia and allied producers to extend production curbs through all of next year  Euphoria among bullish traders was short lived though in the face of the American shale juggernaut 
Output from shale fields from the Great Plains to West Texas continued to surge  raising the specter for a renewed worldwide glut  This week   Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  announced plans to ramp up investment in the Permian Basin and other shale fields  extending the company s multi year shift toward a shale heavy focus 
The oil market continues to feel pressure from the ongoing  ramp up in U S  crude oil production   Kilduff said by telephone   A lot of credit and hopes were pinned on OPEC and the deal that was cut but there continues to be more and more oil and product coming to market  
Drillers expanded the number of rigs searching for crude in two of the busiest U S  shale fields this week  Baker Hughes reported on Friday  The rig tallies in the Permian and Eagle Ford regions rose by three each 
West Texas Intermediate for January delivery climbed 45 cents to  57 14 a barrel at 1 18 p m  on the New York Mercantile Exchange  Total volume traded was about 8 percent below the 100 day average

China will  inevitably  become more reliant on crude imports due to falling output from some of its biggest fields  according to Fitch s BMI Research 
U S  crude production expanded for a seventh week to 9 71 million barrels a day  the highest level in weekly data compiled by the EIA since 1983  Gasoline inventories surged by 6 78 million barrels last week  the biggest gain since January 
Further increases in product stockpiles in the U S  could put pressure on spot prices  Tariq Zahir  a New York based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors LLC  said in a telephone interview  At the same time  if the oil rig count also creeps higher into the end of this year  then  there is definitely more risk to the downside going into the first quarter

192619,414135,CVX,Crude Oil  Time To Buy The Rumor Again,opinion,"Buy the rumor and sell the fact  Many traders thought the run up on oil was based only on the potential of an attack on Syria and fears that it spins out of control  Yet  the run up in oil has been about a lot more than just Syria  but about falling supply  rising demand and other geo political risk factors  Oil is already shaking off the  sell the fact  trade after the successful attack on Syria s alleged chemical weapons sites and now focuses on other supply risks and generally strong global demand  Oil is finding support on private reports that we may see a drop in U S  crude supply led by a drop in the NYMEX delivery hub of Cushing Oklahoma 
Private forecaster Genscape reported that crude supply in Cushing Oklahoma fell by 1 23 million barrels  Matthew Epstein  of COWEN Research also reported a substantial draw at 769 663 Barrels  This reverses the recent trend of builds as this increases the odds of a large drop in overall U S  crude supply 
We also must consider the impact of the total collapse of the Venezuelan oil industry   The Independent  reported that  Despite having the greatest oil reserves in the world  Venezuela s government is being forced to spend millions of dollars a day importing crude to prop up its ailing industry  
They write that  the speed of decline in production has been vertiginous  with output falling by 100 000 barrels a day in February  according to Bloomberg  The Central University of Venezuela says production is reaching its lowest point in 70 years  Most of the enormous oil reserves Venezuela has access to   almost 25 per cent of all the oil controlled by the world s biggest producers   is heavy crude and needs to be diluted with lighter oil to become a commercially viable product  
Reuters is reporting that under military rule  Venezuela oil workers quit in a stampede  The leader Major General Manuel Quevedo  last month toured a joint venture with U S  major Chevron  NYSE CVX   but now is speeding the total breakdown of the Venezuelan oil industry 
Reuters reports that thousands of oil workers are fleeing the state run oil firm under the watch of its new military commander  who has quickly alienated the firm s embattled upper echelon and its rank and file  according to union leaders  a half dozen current PDVSA workers  a dozen former PDVSA workers and a half dozen executives at foreign companies operating in Venezuela  Some PDVSA offices now have lines outside with dozens of workers waiting to quit  In at least one administrative office in Zulia state  human resources staff quit processing out the quitters  hanging a sign   we do not accept resignations   an oil worker there told Reuters  Official workforce statistics have become a closely guarded secret  but a dozen sources told Reuters that many thousands of workers had quit so far this year   an acceleration of an already troubling outflow last year 
Oil is getting signs of strong demand even as gasoline demand fell below year ago levels last week for the first time  Rising pump prices and cold weather hurt gas demand  Wacky weather is supporting Natural gas because of the cold and storms in the Ivory coast are causing Cocoa to skyrocket  Some parts of the country are seeing the coldest temperatures ever and some have to go back 60 to 100 years to see weather this cold  And now we have to get ready for Hurricane Season

Major General Manuel Quevedo  the military leader that took over PDVSA last month toured a joint venture with US major Chevron  Chevron Corp  NYSE CVX  said on Tuesday two of its executives   Reuters said that Venezuelan Sebin intelligence agents burst into the Petropiar joint venture s office in the coastal city of Puerto La Cruz on Monday and arrested the two Venezuelan employees for alleged wrongdoing  a half dozen sources with knowledge of the detentions told Reuters  Chevron said in a statement 

Chevron Global Technology Services Company is aware that two of its Venezuelan based employees have been arrested by local authorities 
We have contacted the local authorities to understand the basis of the detention and to ensure the safety and well being of these employees  Our legal team is evaluating the situation and working towards the timely release of these employees

192623,414139,CVX,New Venezuela oil boss to give military more PDVSA posts,news,"By Alexandra Ulmer and Deisy Buitrago CARACAS  Reuters    A general appointed at the weekend to run Venezuela s energy sector will name more military officers to senior management posts at state oil company PDVSA as part of a shakeup the government says is aimed at fighting corruption  two company sources told Reuters on Monday   In a surprise move  unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro on Sunday tapped Major General Manuel Quevedo to lead PDVSA  PDVSA UL  and the Oil Ministry  giving the already powerful military control of the OPEC nation s dominant industry   Besides the corruption scandals  Quevedo will have to tackle an attempted debt restructuring  within the context of a deep recession and debilitating U S  sanctions  Sources in the sector said Quevedo s appointment could quicken a white collar exodus from PDVSA and worsen operational problems at a time when production has already tumbled to near 30 year lows of under 2 million barrels per day  About 50 officials at state oil company PDVSA have been arrested since August in what the state prosecutor says is a  crusade  against corruption  Sources within PDVSA and the oil industry said Maduro s administration was using corruption allegations to sideline rivals and deepen its control of the industry  which accounts for over 90 percent of export revenue    The order given is to militarize PDVSA in key areas   said a PDVSA employee  asking to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media   A second source said he was told military officials would take over key production divisions in Venezuela s east and west  Venezuela s president  a former bus driver and union leader whose popularity has plummeted during the economic crisis  has gradually handed the military more power in his cabinet and in key sectors such as mining  Unlike his popular predecessor Hugo Chavez  Maduro does not hail from the military  The opposition says he has been forced to buy the loyalty of the army  historically a power broker in Venezuela  giving them top posts and juicy business contracts while turning a blind eye to corruption   PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment  but an internal company message seen by Reuters called on workers to come to Caracas on Tuesday for Quevedo s swearing in   Let s all go to Caracas to consolidate the deepening of socialism and the total  absolute transformation of PDVSA   the message read   INCREASING MILITARY SWAY Quevedo  a former housing minister with no known energy experience  is not a heavyweight in Venezuela s political scene  although two sources close to the military told Reuters he was a Maduro ally   Opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado predicted the appointment would worsen PDVSA s operations    They re getting rid of the old executives  who although socialist and working under catastrophic management  at least knew about oil   he said   Now we re going to have totally inexperienced hands    Although military appointees had been on the rise within the oil industry too  Quevedo s appointment is the first time in a decade and a half that a military official has taken the helm of the oil industry   PDVSA so far had been led by chemist Nelson Martinez and the Oil Ministry by engineer Eulogio Del Pino  both of whom rose in the ranks under previous PDVSA president and Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez   Later demoted to become Venezuela s representative at the United Nations in New York  Ramirez recently criticized Maduro for not reforming Venezuela s flailing economy  in what insiders say is a power struggle between the two rivals   OIL COMPANIES WORRY The opposition has also accused Quevedo of violating human rights during the National Guard s handling of anti Maduro protests  in which stone throwing hooded youths regularly clashed with tear gas firing soldiers   U S  Senator Marco Rubio included Quevedo on a 2014 list of Venezuelan officials whom he said should be named in U S  sanctions  although Quevedo does not appear in the list released by the U S  Treasury Department  Venezuela s government denies abuses  saying protesters were in fact part of a U S  promoted  armed insurrection  designed to sabotage socialism in Latin America   Quevedo s appointment has worried foreign oil companies in Venezuela  including U S  major  Chevron   NYSE CVX  and Russian state oil giant Rosneft  according to industry sources  Venezuela is also trying to pull off a complex restructuring of foreign debt  including  60 billion in bonds  about half of which have been issued by PDVSA  Bondholders were invited to Caracas for a meeting with the government two weeks ago  but market sources say there has been no concrete progress or proposals since   PDVSA said on Friday it was making last minute payments on two bonds close to default  including one backed by shares in U S  based Citgo  a Venezuelan

192628,414144,CVX,How Fracking Is About To Change The Middle East s Oil And Gas Dynamic,opinion,"Hydraulic fracturing   fracking   opened new oil and gas opportunities for the United States when the advanced techniques became common practice beginning in the late 1990s in the Permian Basin  Texas   Eagle Ford  Texas   Bakken  South Dakota  and Marcellus  New York   Though they have received less attention  similar fields were  in Russia  China and Argentina  Now  tight oil and gas fields are gaining attention in the Middle East 
In 2014  Saudi Aramco held a  on fracking at its Houston based Aramco Research Center  At the time  Saudi Aramco was exploring and studying several areas in Saudi Arabia for their fracking potential  Four years later  in 2018  Aramco  the discovery of its own shale oil fields  The Jafurah field  at the southeastern end of the Ghawar oil field in the eastern area of Saudi Arabia  rivals the Eagle Ford in size  Eagle Ford is the second largest natural gas producing shale play in the United States 
Aramco is  looking at using fracking to produce more natural gas  Saudi Arabia hopes to convert all of its oil burning power plants to natural gas in the near future  It is unlikely at this point that Saudi Arabia would try to produce significant amounts of oil from fracking  because it produces plenty of oil from conventional fields and does so at costs far below what it would face in a fracking enterprise 
If Saudi Arabia starts producing significant amounts of natural gas to feed its electrical grid  this would ease domestic Saudi demand for oil  Saudi Arabia could either increase exports or cut production while maintaining the same exports  This would give the impression that global oil supply is decreasing even though the same amount of oil is still entering the global market 
Saudi Arabia is not the only Middle Eastern oil producer with major shale fields  Bahrain recently  a significant find on the west coast of the tiny island kingdom  The discovery of this oil and gas field is the most significant discovery in Bahrain since 1932 
Bahrain is located in the Persian Gulf  just miles away from Saudi Arabia s east coast  Oil was actually discovered in Bahrain before it was discovered in Saudi Arabia  In fact  the company that discovered oil in Saudi Arabia  Standard Oil of California  now Chevron  NYSE CVX    was producing oil in Bahrain when one of its geologists saw similar geological formations across the bay in Saudi Arabia  It was only then that he thought maybe there was some oil in Saudi Arabia as well   The story of how Bahraini oil led to the creation of the Saudi oil industry is one of many detailed in my new book   Saudi  Inc   which was   
But Bahrain s oil production has waned  in recent decades  The country only produces an average of 40 000 bpd from its own fields and receives additional oil from from an oil field it shares with Saudi Arabia  bringing its total production up to 200 000 bpd  Bahrain is not a member of OPEC  However  Bahrain is a participant in the OPEC non OPEC production cut deal  This discovery may change Bahrain s interests  In fact  Bahrain may seek a quicker end to the cuts depending on when it can start production on this field  or  alternatively  it may seek to join OPEC  The discovery of this new oil field could put Bahrain back on the map as an important oil producer 
At the same time  Bahrain is aiming to get into the natural gas export industry  The country is in the process of building a liquefied natural gas terminal that is expected to be complete in 2019  and with this new unconventional oil and gas field discovery  Bahrain could become a significant natural gas exporter  Just how significant will become clear when Bahrain reveals more details about the extent of the field  Bahrain s timeframe for production and how expensive it will be to produce the oil and gas 
Update  Bahrain held a press conference at 2 00 pm local time today to announce that it estimates the field contains between 10 and 20 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 80 billion barrels of oil ",2018-04-04,"Ellen R.

 Industry  Oil   Gas  Part 1Link  Crude OilPosting its second annual gain in a row  oil prices closed 2017 up more than 12   Keeping up the momentum  the commodity got off to a strong start this year with the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures climbing 7 1  in January  Though the benchmark tumbled 4 8  in February in the wake of a broad stock market selloff  crude continues to trade above the psychologically important  60 level Are the Prices Sustainable The sentiment in the oil market has not been this good in years  with U S  crude prices hitting a more than three year high of around  66 recently   a spectacular recovery from below  30 in early 2016 Riding on the positive oil price momentum  the major oil firms like Chevron  BP plc  Royal Dutch Shell plc and Total S A    all part of the  Big Oil  group   recorded massive year over year growth in their top and bottom line  Both BP and Shell sports Zacks Rank  2  Buy   while Chevron and Total carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   The key question is whether the rally can continue or will these gains be short lived  having risen too far  too fast   While it is extremely difficult to predict movements in oil prices  we have identified several drivers that support the commodity s steadily rising trend  In particular  unlike other short lived rallies over the past three years  we believe the current higher oil prices are a result of improving fundamentals  as discussed below Production Cut Deal Extension One of the significant reasons why the U S  oil benchmark soared  revolved around the expansion of the output cut deal between OPEC and other major producers beyond March  True to predictions  the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018 The agreement  now renewed twice  keeps 1 8 million barrels a day  or 2  of global supply  off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut  There s no ignoring the fact that the cuts continue to narrow the market imbalances Sharp Inventory Drawdowns Investors have pinned hopes of recovery over the U S  Energy Department s inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles  pointing to a tightening oil market  Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 35 of the last 47 weeks and are down approximately 110 million barrels since April last year  The gradual fall   stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiraling exports   has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  At 423 5 million barrels  current crude supplies are 19  below the year ago period Specifically  stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   is down by almost 23 million barrels in the past nine weeks alone The Shift into  Backwardation   The front month WTI contract remains in a state of  backwardation    a phenomenon when near term oil futures trade at a premium to futures dated further out  Analysts consider this as a bullish signal with the so called backwardated market helping flush out inventories by eliminating the incentive to put oil in storage Booming Exports  Following the lifting of the four decade long ban on oil exports at the end of 2015  the country witnessed a substantial increase in demand for its oil  While exports ticked up only modestly in 2016  it was last year when the floodgates really opened  Average exports in the first six months of 2017 were around 75 000 barrels per day  which soared to an all time high of 1 7 million barrels a day during October Reflecting the substantial demand for U S  oil   exports surged in the second half of last year  The disastrous Hurricane Harvey in August knocked out 25  of domestic refining capacity and forced the operators to sell abroad  The widening Brent premium to WTI   as much as  7 after the storm   played its part too  A discount in U S  oil prices to the global benchmark Brent  or a larger spread  makes domestic crude attractive in overseas markets Though exports are expected to retreat a bit from their October highs  we expect levels to remain elevated throughout this year  With U S  crude trading at a fair discount to international benchmark Brent  American oil remains attractive to foreign buyers  While more shipments might narrow the discount between WTI and Brent  surging U S  shale output will keep WTI prices in check  Overall  we are unlikely to see the boom in crude exports recede anytime soon Favorable Economic Data The final three months of 2017 saw U S  GDP grow by 2 6  following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3   This marks one of the economy s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid 2009  Further  the unemployment rate remained at a 17 year low of 4 1  in January  while he average level of jobless claims continues to hover just over 200 000  which was last seen in the early 1970s Employers have also hiked wages in order to retain and attract workers  Wage growth hit the fastest pace in January in more than eight and a half years  Finally  strong earnings reports from corporate biggies  which has helped support high valuations  boosted sentiments  With American economy remaining on solid footing  the resultant demand growth bodes well for oil prices A look back at the Q4 earnings season reflects that earnings for the sector recorded a massive 157 2  jump from the same period last year   by far the highest growth among all sectors   on 23 8  higher revenues For more information about earnings for this sector and others  please read our  report 2018 a Pivotal Year for Oil Stocks While we do not rule out chances for short term pullbacks on oversupply concerns and a stronger U S  dollar  we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future  An anticipated surge in demand this year is set to push global consumption above 100 million barrels per day threshold for the first time  However  supply from OPEC   which still accounts for roughly 40  of the world s crude   is expected to remain weak throughout 2018  Also  years of low price environment have forced operators to trim their capital expenditures considerably that means a relatively narrow pipeline of new projects To sum it up  though the triple digit territory of 2014 looks improbable  we expect oil prices to continue to head higher  Also  we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being Natural GasSpurred by its cost effectiveness and abundant supply in North America  natural gas   the least harmful fossil fuel compared to coal and oil   is set for a major transformation  The commodity s long term demand is expected to soar due to the transition toward a low carbon future and growing usage of natural gas in the Asia Pacific region U S  Natural Gas Production to Set Record in 2018 With the advent of hydraulic fracturing  or  fracking     a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water  sand and chemicals   shale gas production is now booming in the U S  Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract gas from shale formations  the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U S  energy supplies  playing a key role in boosting domestic natural gas reserves  As a result  once faced with a looming deficit  natural gas is now available in abundance On the flip side  the glut has kept prices constrained with demand failing to match supply  As per Energy Information Administration  EIA   the U S  energy watchdog  the country churned out an estimated 73 6 billion cubic feet  Bcf  per day of dry natural gas on an average in 2017  This year  the level is expected to reach a record 81 7 Bcf per day  outweighing the total forecasted consumption of 78 19 Bcf per day   also an all time high China  The Main Driver of Natural Gas Demand GrowthDespite domestic supply glut  the fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run  considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia Pacific region in particular The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040  Countries in Asia and in the Middle East   led by China s transition away from coal   will account for most of this increase And it will be the world s largest gas producer U S   which will step up to meet this soaring demand  With domestic prices struggling to break the  3 per million Btu threshold  U S  natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U S  production at higher prices to rest of the world  In fact  more than 50  of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas  or LNG   As per Paris based International Energy Agency  IEA   the United States   which became a net natural gas exporter in 2017   will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022 As of now  Cheniere Energy  Inc  is the only company to receive Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  approval to export LNG from its 2 6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal in Cameron Parish  Louisiana  But with five LNG facilities likely to begin operations by the end of next year in just the United States  the industry will see a deluge of supply in the short to medium term that will take care of the rapid expansion in demand Strong Stocks that Should Be in the NewsMany are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar  They re virtually unknown to the general public  Yet today s 220 Zacks

The remaining 25  interest will be owned by local shareholders  The energy supermajor also plans to jettison 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana  With the divestment plans  the company focuses on balancing its global portfolio with long term business priorities

The deal will enable Sinopec to increase its market share and revenues in the fuel retail market  Moreover  the overseas deal will help the company hedge its bets on China s economy  as the country is witnessing declining oil demand and is shifting focus to other less energy intensive sectors for growth The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2018-03-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chevronsinopec-deal-gets-nod-from-competitive-commission-200297422,200297422

192683,414199,CVX,Rohingya crisis dents Myanmar hopes of Western investment boom,news,"By Yimou Lee and Marius Zaharia YANGON HONG KONG  Reuters    When officials from Myanmar s commercial capital Yangon toured six European countries in June  they were hoping to drum up investment in transport  energy and education  Instead  they were bombarded with questions about the country s treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority  who have long complained of persecution by the Buddhist majority in the oil rich  ethnically divided  western state of Rakhine   In each of every country  that issue was always brought up   Hlaing Maw Oo  secretary of Yangon City Development Committee  told Reuters after the 16 day trip  The situation in Rakhine has worsened dramatically since then  with more than 400 000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh to escape a military counterinsurgency offensive the United Nations has described as  ethnic cleansing   Western trade and investment in Myanmar is small  but there were hopes that a series of reforms this year would prise open an economy stunted by international sanctions and decades of mismanagement under military rule  With most sanctions now lifted  an expected flood of Western money was seen as a key dividend from the transition to civilian rule under Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi  Regional diplomats saw it balancing China s growing influence over its neighbour  But Suu Kyi has been beset by international criticism for saying little about human rights abuses against the Rohingya  and lawyers  consultants and lobbyists say the European and U S  companies that had been circling are now wary of the reputational risks of investing in the country  Louis Yeung  managing principal of Yangon based investment firm Faircap Partners  said one of his business partners   a listed  U S  based food and beverage company   decided to hold off its plan to enter the Myanmar market for three to five years  citing factors including slower than expected reforms and the Rohingya crisis   Their conclusion is that it wasn t the right time for them   he said   They want to see more traction from the government and Rakhine is not helpful    ON HOLD  The pressure has been growing in recent months  even on existing investors  with rights group AFD International calling on foreign firms to stop investing in Myanmar  A small group of investors in U S  oil major  Chevron   N CVX  filed an unsuccessful motion at its annual general meeting urging it to pull out of its production sharing contract with a state run firm to explore for oil and gas  while Norwegian telecoms firm  Telenor   OL TEL   which runs a mobile network in Myanmar  issued a statement calling for human rights protection  Chevron declined to comment on its investment in Myanmar  while Telenor did not respond to several requests for comment   Bernd Lange  chair of the European Parliament Committee on International Trade  said last week his delegation postponed a visit to Myanmar indefinitely  saying the human rights situation  does not allow a fruitful discussion on a potential EU Myanmar investment agreement   Khin Aung Tun  vice chairman of the Myanmar Tourism Federation  told Reuters global firms planning to hold conferences in Myanmar were now considering other locations       People were just starting to see Myanmar as a  good news  story   said Dane Chamorro  head of South East Asia at Control Risks  a global risk consultancy   Now you can imagine a boardroom in which someone mentions Myanmar and someone else says  hold on  I ve just seen something on Myanmar on TV  villages burned down  refugees  etc    In an interview published in Nikkei Asia Review on Thursday  Suu Kyi acknowledged it was  natural  for foreign investors to be concerned  but repeated her view that economic development was the key to solving poor Rakhine s long standing problems   So investments would actually help make the situation better   she said  IN CHINA S ORBIT Myanmar s  70 billion economy should be a strong investment proposition for Western firms  It boasts large oil and gas reserves and natural resources such as rubies  jade and timber  Wages are low and its youthful population of more than 50 million is eager for retail and manufacturing jobs  In April  Myanmar passed a long awaited investment law  simplifying procedures and granting foreign investors equal treatment to the locals  A game changing law allowing foreigners to buy stakes in local firms is expected later this year    The investment conditions were improving   said Dustin Daugherty  ASEAN lead for business intelligence at Dezan Shira   Associates  a consultancy for foreign investors in Asia  Myanmar s economy may not suffer much  however  if Western firms shun the country   or even if their governments were to reimpose some sanctions  although that appears unlikely for now  Suu Kyi has sought to deepen relations with China at a time when Beijing is keen to push projects that fit with its  Belt and Road  initiative  which aims to stimulate trade by investment in infrastructure throughout Asia and beyond   Myanmar trades with China as much as it does with its next four biggest partners  Singapore  Thailand  Japan and India  None of that top five participated in previous sanctions  Trade with the United States is only about  400 million and U S  investment is just 0 5 percent of the total  Europe accounts for around a 10th of investment  while China and Hong Kong make up more than a third  and Singapore and Thailand another third  Than Aung Kyaw  Deputy Director General of Myanmar s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration  told Reuters European investors might have  second thoughts   but he expected Asian investors to stay put   China is already in talks to sell electricity to energy hungry Myanmar and pushing for preferential access to a strategic port on the Bay of Bengal  In April  the two countries reached an agreement on an oil pipeline that pumps oil across Myanmar to southwest China   It is going to feed Aung San Suu Kyi straight into the hands of  Chinese President  Xi Jinping   said John Blaxland

192720,414236,CVX,Denning  Chevron in relatively strong shape as Watson prepares to leave,news,"Chevron   CVX  0 4   has come through the worst of its trials and looks like a solid investment relative to other oil majors  especially  Exxon Mobil   XOM  0 1    as CEO John Watson reportedly prepares to leave the company 
All the oil majors are reducing their breakeven oil price  but Bloomberg s Liam Denning writes that CVX is different in that it should enjoy production growth of  5  per year at least through the end of the decade as it has brought giant projects onstream  and  now gets to enjoy rising production and lower spending  portending an increase in both free cash flow and go forward return on capital  
XOM s lack of growth and doubts about its long term project pipeline due to Russian sanctions  make it tough to come up with a compelling buy case beyond the traditional defensive one   and even that has been dented in the past year or so   says Denning  which has allowed CVX s relative valuation gap to rise to the narrowest ever during Watson s tenure as CEO 
 All in all  then  Watson s successor would be assuming control at a relatively good time  for CVX  Denning concludes

192756,414272,CVX,Special Report  Vladimir s Venezuela   Leveraging loans to Caracas  Moscow snaps up oil assets,news,"By Marianna Parraga and Alexandra Ulmer CARACAS HOUSTON  Reuters    Venezuela s unraveling socialist government is increasingly turning to ally Russia for the cash and credit it needs to survive   and offering prized state owned oil assets in return  sources familiar with the negotiations told Reuters  As Caracas struggles to contain an economic meltdown and violent street protests  Moscow is using its position as Venezuela s lender of last resort to gain more control over the OPEC nation s crude reserves  the largest in the world  Venezuela s state owned oil firm  Petroleos de Venezuela  PDVSA   has been secretly negotiating since at least early this year with Russia s biggest state owned oil company  Rosneft  MM ROSN    offering ownership interests in up to nine of Venezuela s most productive petroleum projects  according to a top Venezuelan government official and two industry sources familiar with the talks  Moscow has substantial leverage in the negotiations  Cash from Russia and Rosneft has been crucial in helping the financially strapped government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro avoid a sovereign debt default or a political coup  Rosneft delivered Venezuela s state owned firm more than  1 billion in April alone in exchange for a promise of oil shipments later  On at least two occasions  the Venezuelan government has used Russian cash to avoid imminent defaults on payments to bondholders  a high level PDVSA official told Reuters  Rosneft has also positioned itself as a middleman in sales of Venezuelan oil to customers worldwide  Much of it ends up at refineries in the United States   despite U S  sanctions against Russia   because it is sold through intermediaries such as oil trading firms  according to internal PDVSA trade reports seen by Reuters and a source at the firm  PDVSA and the government of Venezuela did not respond to requests for comment  The Russian government declined to comment and referred questions to the foreign ministry and the ministries of finance and defense  which did not respond to questions from Reuters  Rosneft declined to comment  Russia s growing control over Venezuelan crude gives it a stronger foothold in energy markets across the Americas  Rosneft now resells about 225 000 barrels per day  bpd  of Venezuelan oil   about 13 percent of the nation s total exports  according to the PDVSA trade reports  That s about enough to satisfy the daily demand of a country the size of Peru  Venezuela gives Rosneft most of that oil as payment for billions of dollars in cash loans that Maduro s government has already spent  His administration needs Russia s money to finance everything from bond payments to imports of food and medicine amid severe national shortages  For a graphic detailing the decline of Venezuela s oil industry  see   Venezuela s opposition lawmakers say Russia is behaving more like a predator than an ally   Rosneft is definitely taking advantage of the situation   said Elias Matta  vice president of the energy commission at Venezuela s elected National Assembly   They know this is a weak government  that it s desperate for cash   and they re sharks   Matta echoed many others in the opposition majority congress who have blasted corporate deals they say are underpinning Maduro s efforts to establish a dictatorship  The Venezuelan government has said previously that Russia s investment in its oil industry shows confidence in PDVSA s financial stability and the nation s business opportunities  Maduro s administration has grown increasingly dependent on Moscow in the past two years as China has curtailed credit to Venezuela because of payment delays and the corruption and crime faced by Chinese firms operating there  according to Venezuelan debt analysts and two oil industry sources  Many multinational firms worldwide  meanwhile  have all but written off their Venezuelan operations amid the nation s tanking economy and chronic shortages of raw materials  Rosneft is making the opposite play   using Venezuela s hard times as a buying opportunity for oil assets with potentially high long term value   The Russians are catching Venezuela at rock bottom   said one Western diplomat who has worked on issues involving Venezuela s oil industry in recent years  As other companies shutter operations here  Rosneft has expanded to an additional floor of its office tower and added staff  The Russian firm has poached PDVSA professionals and brought in more Russian executives  two sources close to Rosneft told Reuters  The corporate expansion provides a striking contrast to the scene on the streets below these days  in the once thriving business district of Caracas  As Rosneft staffers work in swanky offices alongside posters of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a bust of Hugo Chavez   the late Venezuelan leader and socialist icon   crowds of young men outside often throw rocks and Molotov cocktails in escalating protests of Chavez  successor  Rosneft currently owns substantial portions of five major Venezuelan oil projects  The additional projects PDVSA is now offering the Russian firm include five in the Orinoco   Venezuela s largest oil producing region   along with three in Maracaibo Lake  its second largest and oldest producing area  and a shallow water oil project in the Paria Gulf  the two industry sources told Reuters  In a separate proposal first reported by Reuters last month  Rosneft would swap its collateral on 49 9 percent of Citgo  PDVSAC UL    the Venezuelan owned  U S  based refiner   for stakes in three additional PDVSA oil fields  two natural gas fields and a lucrative fuel supply contract  according to two sources with knowledge of the negotiations  Under the proposal  Rosneft would also take increased management control over all the joint oil projects between the two firms   Rosneft secured the collateral late last year on a loan of  1 5 billion to PDVSA  The negotiations over a collateral swap are driven in part by a recent threat from U S  President Donald Trump to sanction Venezuela s oil sector as punishment for Maduro s efforts to undermine the nation s elected congress  Rosneft has already been sanctioned by the United States over Russia s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014  Such actions require U S  firms to end business relations with sanctioned entities  RUSSIAN OIL DEALS UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY Maduro s need for Russian cash played a key role in a move by his political allies earlier this year that destabilized Venezuela s already teetering democracy  the top Venezuelan government official told Reuters  In March  the nation s Supreme Court   whose members are loyal to Maduro   took over the powers of the opposition controlled National Assembly  A majority of elected Assembly members opposed any new oil deals with Russia and insisted on retaining power to veto them  Days later   after fierce national protests against the action   the court returned most powers to the national legislature at Maduro s public urging  But the court allowed the president to keep the legal authority to cut fresh oil deals with Russia without legislative approval  The episode was pivotal in escalating daily street protests and clashes with authorities that have since caused more than 120 deaths   Maduro needed sole authority to cut new oil deals to clear the way for Rosneft s expansion  the top Venezuelan government official told Reuters   Pressure from Russia has played an important role in Nicolas Maduro s decisions   the official said  speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to make public comments  Rosneft said this month that it has lent a total of  6 billion to PDVSA  In total  Russia and Rosneft have delivered Venezuela at least  17 billion in loans and credit lines since 2006  according to Reuters calculations based on loans and credit lines announced by the government  Venezuela does not publish the full details of the debts it owes Russia  Maduro has sought to limit the power of congress since the opposition won a majority in 2015   In late July  he created a legislative superbody called the Constituent Assembly in an election that was widely criticized as a sham  Allies of the Socialist Party won all 545 seats in the new assembly  which has the power to rewrite the nation s constitution  dissolve state institutions   such as the opposition run Congress   and fire dissident state officials  SPIRAL OF DEBT  DEPENDENCE Venezuela s oil based economy has collapsed since international prices crashed to a low of  24 per barrel in early 2016 from more than  100 in 2014  Prices now hover at about  50  which hasn t proven high enough to pull Venezuela out of its tailspin  Nearly all of the nation s export revenue comes from oil  so income has fallen sharply and a shortage of petrodollars has left Maduro s government unable to finance the generous subsidies of food  medicines  fuels  power and other public services instituted by his predecessor  Chavez  The erosion of subsidies has contributed to rapid inflation  which is forecasted to top 700 percent this year by the International Monetary Fund  Venezuela s currency  the bolivar  has become nearly worthless  Government spending cuts have also slashed budgets for maintaining the nation s oilfields  refineries  ports and tankers  causing Venezuela s oil output in the first half of 2017 to fall to nearly its lowest level in 27 years  PDVSA is repaying a growing portion of its mounting debts to Russia with oil  according to internal PDVSA trade data reviewed by Reuters  The oil payments are choking off the cash flow from its petroleum business   thereby creating the need for more loans   CIRCLING OIL ASSETS The nation s downward spiral has put Rosneft in a position to acquire Venezuelan oil assets on the cheap   Of the package of stakes PDVSA has offered to Rosneft  the most valuable is a 10 percent stake in Petropiar  a multi billion dollar project to produce and upgrade extra heavy crude in the Orinoco Belt  The value of the stake is likely between  600 million and  800 million  based on the valuations of similar deals  The rising volumes of Venezuelan crude that Rosneft receives have made the Russian firm a middleman in sales to refiners that once bought directly from PDVSA  The oil payments have also helped Rosneft grow a major oil trading business to complement its massive production apparatus  In the process  the Russian firm has appropriated some of PDVSA s hard won international supply deals and valuable trading relationships with refiners as far afield as China  the PDVSA documents show  At today s prices  the Venezuelan oil exports that flow to Rosneft would be worth about  3 6 billion annually  And the flow of PDVSA crude to Rosneft is expected to keep increasing  according to the internal PDVSA documents  Most of it is sold into the United States  according to the documents  Rosneft also will soon start selling Venezuelan crude to India s refiner Essar  taking PDVSA s second largest customer in the Asian country   Russia is taking everything they have   said an oil trader who regularly deals with PDVSA  A DICEY INVESTMENT The Russian strategy has its risks  Many of the world s top energy firms took a hit when Chavez nationalized their assets  and an opposition led government could later reverse or revise any deals Maduro cuts without their blessing  Venezuela s bond yields are among the highest in the world because of the nation s high default risk  The bonds pay nearly 30 percentage points more than benchmark U S  treasuries  PDVSA s many connections to the United States oil industry also raise the specter that the deals now under negotiation could run afoul of U S  economic sanctions already in place against Russia and threatened against Venezuela  The Petropiar project  for instance  is 30 percent owned by U S  oil major  Chevron  Corp  N CVX   Should Rosneft take a stake in the project  it could be complicated for Chevron to ensure it is not violating U S  sanctions  In the meantime  Chevron has sent guidelines to executives to ensure they comply with sanctions  an employee at Chevron told Reuters  The guidelines advise staff  for instance  to avoid one on one meetings with sanctioned entities or officials  the employee said  In a statement  Chevron said it abides by  a stringent code of business ethics  and complies with applicable laws  For now  Russia s status as chief lender to PDVSA has put Rosneft in a position to supercharge its holdings and profits in the region  If Venezuela s government defaults on its debt payments   an increasingly likely scenario   Rosneft likely will be one of the entities at the front of the queue as a creditor because of its large collateral stake in U S  based Citgo  according to a confidential independent analysis of its debt commissioned by an investment fund and seen by Reuters   Representatives of Citgo  PDVSA S largest foreign asset  did not respond to requests for comment  GUNS FOR OIL Rosneft s involvement in Venezuela can be traced back to a  4 billion arms for oil deal in 2006 that cemented the bond between the governments of Chavez and Putin  Chavez  a former military officer  signed the deal himself in Moscow  Shunned by the United States   which since 2006 has refused to supply spare parts for Venezuela s fleet of U S  built F 16 fighter jets   Chavez bought Russian Sukhoi fighter jets  helicopters  tanks and guns from Putin  Top executives from Rosneft and PDVSA were later involved in negotiations related to the military purchases because Rosneft was the Russian entity receiving the Venezuelan oil cargoes used to pay for a portion of the weapons  the top Venezuelan government official told Reuters  They included Rosneft President Igor Sechin  a powerful long time advisor and deputy to Putin  Sechin is a trained linguist who began his career as a military interpreter and has a passion for the history of Latin America s revolutionaries  according to two people who worked with him  He had a direct line into Chavez until the former president s death in 2013  the Venezuelan official told Reuters  Sechin has maintained close ties with Maduro and the two meet regularly  the official said  Speaking to reporters in at a hydroelectric plant in Russia last week  Sechin called Rosneft s growing investments in Venezuela an obvious and essential play   This is a country with the world s hydrocarbon reserves   he said  referring to a central component of oil and natural gas   Any energy company should aim to work in this country     No one could force us from there   Russia was swift to defend Maduro s government from international criticism after the Supreme Court moved to nullify congress  with Moscow issuing a statement saying foreign governments should not meddle in Venezuelan domestic politics  Sechin was Maduro s guest of honor at a ceremony last October to unveil a Russian made granite statue of Chavez erected in the late president s hometown of Sabaneta   In the sweltering heat  a Russian choir dressed in black sang the Venezuelan anthem in heavily accented Spanish before Sechin addressed the crowds of mostly red shirted Socialist Party supporters  
 Thank you for trusting us   Sechin told the crowd in Spanish during the speech  broadcast on Venezuelan state television   Russia and Venezuela  together forever  ",2017-08-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/special-report-vladimirs-venezuela--leveraging-loans-to-caracas-moscow-snaps-up-oil-assets-517586,517586

192769,414285,CVX,Is It The Right Time To Bet On Energy Major Statoil  STO  ,opinion,"Commodity prices have been moving up lately  thanks to a decline in U S  oil inventory  It is accompanied by a weakening U S  dollar  which has declined for the first time in the last five years 
The market has also witnessed a rise in energy demand and oil and gas companies are poised to benefit from the situation  One such company  which is also currently the investor favorite  is Statoil  OL STL  ASA   NYSE STO    It is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock holding immense potential  You can see  
Statoil   an energy company that explores for  produces  transports  refines and markets petroleum and petroleum derived products  and other forms of energy in Norway and internationally   enjoys leading market position  have a global footprint  strong cash position and is large enough to stay strong even in the face of unfavorable events 
Per the federal government s EIA report  crude inventories fell by 7 4 million barrels for the week ending Dec 29  At 138 8 million barrels  current Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  are 14 2  below the year ago level  All these have led to increasing energy prices and that s good news for producers  This calls for investing in a lucrative growth stock  which can help investors benefit the most from the current bullish trend  Statoil  with a Growth Score of A  ticks this box too 
Our Growth Score condenses all the essential metrics from a company s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth  Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a favorable Zacks Rank offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space 
Is Statoil Really Beating the Market 
Statoil  which has ENI  MI ENI  S p A    NYSE E   and Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   as peers  has gained 22 3  in the last year compared with 12  growth of its  

While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at both short term as well as longer term price metrics   such as performance over the past three months or year    and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful  In the case of Statoil  the results are quite impressive as shown below 

Moreover  return on equity  ROE  for Statoil is 8 6   higher than the industry s 6 4   reflecting the fact that it is efficient in using shareholders  funds  Also  return on capital  ROC  of the company is 5   higher than the industry s 4 8  
What Else Makes Statoil a Good Pick 
Positive earnings estimate revisions is the reason for a favorable rank  Over the last 60 days  two analysts have increased their estimates for 2017  while two have increased their projection for 2018  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has increased from  1 18 to  1 28 while that for the next year has increased from  1 06 to  1 22 in the same time frame 
In conclusion  we commend Statoil s endeavors to improve recovery of resources in mature fields  The company has operations in all major hydrocarbon producing regions of the world  with an emphasis on the Norwegian Continental Shelf  NCS   We believe that Statoil is well positioned to sustain its steady production growth over the next few years on the back of its large resource base at NCS 
If you are interested in the oil and energy space  we recommend another player that looks attractive at current levels  Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  PLC  carries the same Zacks Rank as Statoil  The integrated oil and gas company s earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 are expected to grow 84 1  year over year  The company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 18 1  in the third quarter of 2017

 is in a Massachusetts based offshore wind consortium  holds a lease off the New Jersey coast and has opened an office in Boston  Offshore wind generation began in the United States late last year  ironically after the election of President Donald Trump  He is skeptical about climate change  complains about subsidies for renewable energy and battled against an offshore wind farm near his Scottish golf resort  However  a string of federal seabed leases were awarded before Trump took office and more are planned  The investment needed to get projects going is one of the biggest obstacles   Undeniably  offshore wind is a big boys  game because it requires large amounts of capital because scale is such an important cost driver   said Samuel Leupold chief executive of DONG Energy s offshore wind business  While DONG has shifted decisively toward renewables  Statoil and Shell are still firmly rooted in fossil fuels and other major European oil companies  in common with their U S  counterparts  have so far steered clear of U S  offshore wind  Washington estimates its potential at 2 000 gigawatts  GW   many times anticipated capacity in Europe of 25 GW by 2020  but U S  federal subsidies expire at the end of 2019 and while they may be renewed by Congress  that is no means certain  Costs in Europe have fallen to a level that enabled DONG to place a zero subsidy bid earlier this year  but offshore wind farms are still multi billion dollar projects  A push into deeper U S  waters and the bigger turbines needed to compete without subsidies will keep price tags high  EARLY DAYS Trump signed an executive order in March expected to roll back his predecessor Barack Obama s plan requiring states to slash carbon emissions from power plants  There is also no carbon price mechanism across the United States like those in Europe and elsewhere  although there are two regional ones  U S  oil companies have some investments in solar and onshore wind  but when it comes to offshore wind  many say they are waiting for a time when government support is not needed    Chevron   N CVX  supports renewables that are scalable and can compete without subsidies   said Morgan Krinklaw  a spokesman for Chevron  which owns an onshore wind farm  A report from analysts at Lazard in December pegged the cost of U S  offshore wind at  118 MWh  around twice as much as onshore wind or combined cycle gas turbines  Asked to comment on that figure  Statoil  which is building its first floating wind turbine park off the Scottish coast  said costs were coming down and it was working to drive them down further  partly by redeploying existing staff  The company has about 1 000 employees in the U S  oil industry  said Stephen Bull  senior vice president of the company s wind business   There s scope for us to plug into our existing oil and gas supply chain   he added  referring to existing contracts with equipment and service suppliers  Statoil spokeswoman Elin Isaksen said she did not expect any of its offshore wind projects in the U S  to have begun construction by 2019 and that it was too early to quote numbers for the New York project  while acknowledging there was  as yet  no supply chain   We expect to see   and will help   the supply chain evolve rapidly in step with the broader industry as offshore wind takes hold in the U S  in the coming years   she said  In Virginia  where Spanish utility Iberdrola s  MC IBE  Avangrid has secured an offshore wind license  a rich marine engineering heritage is expected to help local companies gain work  Smaller European oil and gas firms are also gaining work  JDR Cable Systems  a British company that has traditionally supplied subsea power lines to oil and gas platforms  earlier this year won a  275 million contract to provide electric cables for the largest U S  offshore wind farm off the Maryland coast   We are well placed to develop business in the U S  because of the existing relationships we have in Europe   said John Price  global sales director for renewables at JDR  State level decision making on electricity procurement  the next stage of getting offshore wind off the ground  is helping  Massachusetts  where DONG has secured a seabed license  last year issued a law requiring its utilities to buy up to 1 6 GW of offshore wind power by June 2027  with a tender to be held later this year  DONG s North America wind power president Thomas Bostrom said it would bid in the Massachusetts power purchase tender in December and would not comment on costs ahead of that  He too  emphasized his company was playing the long game   As excited as we are for offshore wind in the U S   we are still in the early days of the industry   Bostrom said

192783,414299,CVX,Exclusive  Russia  Venezuela discuss Citgo collateral deal to avoid U S  sanctions   sources,news,"By Alexandra Ulmer and Marianna Parraga CARACAS HOUSTON  Reuters    Russia s top oil producer Rosneft is negotiating to swap its collateral in Venezuelan owned  U S  based refiner Citgo for oilfield stakes and a fuel supply deal   a move to avoid complications from U S  sanctions  two sources with knowledge of the negotiations told Reuters  State owned Rosneft holds a 49 9 percent stake in Citgo as collateral for a loan last year of about  1 5 billion to the OPEC nation  which is reeling from low oil prices and a severe recession  The arrangement with Venezuela s state owned oil firm  PDVSA  has drawn fire from U S  senators who do not want Russia in a position to own a substantial stake of U S  based energy assets in potential violation of existing economic sanctions   The negotiations took on more urgency this week  one of the sources told Reuters  when U S  President Donald Trump threatened to impose  strong economic actions  on Venezuela unless embattled leftist President Nicolas Maduro aborts plans to establish a new legislature with powers to rewrite the nation s constitution  Such sanctions  which could include a ban on U S  oil imports from Venezuela  could undermine Citgo s business model and threaten Venezuelan or Russian ownership of the U S based firm in the long term  Under a new proposal being discussed this week in Moscow by top executives from Rosneft and PDVSA  the collateral stake in Citgo  PDVSAC UL  would be exchanged for a package of eight key deals  one of the sources with knowledge of the talks said  Under the proposed swap  Rosneft would receive     Refined products from Citgo as partial payment for the loan extended last year    Ownership stakes in three crude fields   Rosa Mediano  Tia Juana Lago and Lagunillas Lago   in Venezuela s traditional oil producing state of Zulia     Stakes in two offshore natural gas fields  Patao and Mejillones  that are part of the large Mariscal Sucre gas project  which has reserves of 14 trillion cubic feet  TCF     A settlement payment for late dividends that are due to Rosneft by PDVSA from their largest joint venture  the extra heavy oil project Petromonagas     Rights to sell Venezuelan condensate   a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons present in natural gas deposits   from the Rio Caribe field  which is also part of the Mariscal Sucre project    Rights to commercialize Rosneft s share of oil output from all joint ventures with PDVSA  which would allow the Russian firm to export its share of its entire production in Venezuela  Typically  minority partners are required to sell their oil output from joint projects to PDVSA  Under the proposal  Rosneft would also be allowed to preside over its joint ventures with PDVSA on a rotating basis and be in charge of procurement for major purchases  That would give Rosneft more control over operations   something foreign minority partners have craved in Venezuela for years  one of the sources told Reuters  Foreign oil executives frequently complain of delays  inefficiencies  and opaque procurement contracts at joint ventures that are majority owned by cash strapped PDVSA  Venezuela s Oil Ministry  PDVSA  and Citgo did not respond to requests for comment  Rosneft declined to comment   AVOIDING POLITICAL  LEGAL CHALLENGES Both countries have a strong incentive to end the current collateral agreement   The deal in place now means that Rosneft   which has been under U S  sanctions since 2014   would be among the top creditors should the government of Venezuela default on its bondholders  Senators have questioned whether the deal could violate U S  sanctions   designed to punish Moscow for aggression in Ukraine   if Rosneft ever collected the collateral  It has also drawn objections from foreign companies seeking compensation for nationalizations by the socialist government of Venezuela under the late Hugo Chavez   Canadian miner Crystallex  for instance  has objected to the use of Citgo as collateral for Rosneft s loan  charging that Venezuela is seeking to reduce its exposure to assets in the United States to prevent Crystallex from ever collecting on its award  issued by a World Bank arbitration panel   Extricating itself from a thorny legal dispute could be a boon for Rosneft  provided the proposed package has a similar value as the Citgo collateral  But such an arrangement could further squeeze Venezuela s already troubled state owned energy company  PDVSA  The firm is laboring under a severe cash shortage and struggling to produce enough oil to cover payments on more than  50 billion in loans from Russia and China that it must pay back with shipments of crude and fuels  Although ending the Citgo collateral arrangement would free up a portion of its equity  the subsidiary would receive less income if it has to deliver barrels of oil to Rosneft  a PDVSA creditor  A new deal with Russia could also intensify criticism of Maduro  His opponents accuse him of selling off prized oil assets to raise the cash he needs to prop up his administration amid violent street protests and shortages of food and medicine  ROSNEFT EYES MORE CRUDE The proposed deal could further strengthen political ally Russia s financial position in Venezuela  where it has emerged as an increasingly important backer of Maduro  Russia stands to gain access to more Venezuela oil and more control over its production operations  The company has lent PDVSA at least  4 billion in recent years while increasing its oil stakes in the country  which has the world s largest crude reserves  Venezuela recently offered the Russian company a stake sale in the large oil project Petropiar  operated by PDVSA and U S  oil company  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX   Reuters reported in March  Rosneft currently has a 40 percent stake in the 140 000 barrels per day  bpd  flagship Petromonagas project at the Orinoco belt  Venezuela s most prolific oil region  It gets a commensurate share of the field s upgraded crude   The Russian firm also has a 40 percent stake in the Petrovictoria project and a 32 percent stake in the Petromiranda project in the Orinoco  and in two separate joint ventures in mature fields in the South American country   
Receiving more barrels from PDVSA and Citgo would help Rosneft grow its trading arm  Swiss based Rosneft Trading SA  And Rosneft could use light crude from the three joint ventures in Zulia for blending its extra heavy crude from the Orinoco   instead of relying on Venezuela s pricey and often delayed imports of diluents ",2017-07-20,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/exclusive:-russia,-venezuela-discuss-citgo-collateral-deal-to-avoid-u.s.-sanctions---sources-508131",508131

192793,414309,CVX,Tariff fight roils Argentina s shale patch as Macri opens trade,news,By Luc Cohen BUENOS AIRES  Reuters    Argentina needs oil rigs to develop its vast shale oil and gas resources  The United States has plenty of idle equipment laying around after its own unconventional drilling boom cooled  But moving that machinery from the plains of Texas to the windswept Patagonian desert is proving complex and costly for global oil majors who say Argentina s protectionist past is slowing efforts to spark its own shale revolution  A move by Argentina s government to cut import taxes on used oil field equipment has sparked fierce opposition from local manufacturers  who are lobbying the government to include protections for them in a measure they fear will destroy their livelihoods   Among them is Adrian Ramos  president of QM Equipment  a manufacturer of drilling and fracking equipment located in the Argentine coastal city of Mar del Plata    We got in touch with  the Production Ministry  and let them know it was totally impossible for us to survive this   Ramos told Reuters in a telephone interview  Negotiations with Ramos and others have slowed the rollout of tariff reductions  President Mauricio Macri in April had promised oil executives the changes would be coming within  weeks   The previously unreported talks with local manufacturers underscore the challenges faced by Macri  who came to power in 2015 on a wave of popular discontent that ended 12 years of leftist rule  The market friendly former businessman has pledged to revive Argentina s moribund  inflation racked economy by reducing trade barriers and wooing foreign investment   But he has gotten blowback from industries and unions that have benefited from protectionist policies  With mid term elections approaching in October  popular opposition to rising imports and factory layoffs has become a vulnerability for Macri s  Let s Change  coalition  Big oil firms  meanwhile  are fuming too  Vaca Muerta  a Belgium sized shale formation located in the western Patagonian province of Neuquen  is seen as the most promising unconventional oil and gas field outside of North America  the birthplace of the shale revolution   Already burdened with pricey labor and transport costs in Argentina  companies have grown frustrated with delays in the equipment import reform  Speaking at an industry event in Buenos Aires in late June  Richard Spies  chief executive of Pan America Energy  an Argentine subsidiary of  BP   LON BP  PLC  called on government officials to hit the accelerator   Get these things done   Spies said   We need that equipment that s idle in the United States moved down here to facilitate the developments that are coming in Vaca Muerta   In an emailed response to questions from Reuters  a Production Ministry spokesman said the import proposal was advancing and a decree would be passed by the executive branch in the coming weeks  It would not need congressional approval  the spokesman said  BRINGING THE  DEAD COW  TO LIFE Argentina is one of many resource rich Latin American countries that have struggled to develop abundant oil and mineral reserves  Rules aimed at protecting domestic players and guaranteeing large revenues for government have chased away some foreign investors   New right leaning governments in the region have introduced business friendly policies to lure them back  Brazil s Congress in 2016 opened the nation s deepwater pre salt fields to foreign operators  This year Peru lowered air quality standards to attract mining investment  Spurring development of Vaca Muerta   Spanish for  Dead Cow    is one of Macri s major priorities as he tries to unwind regulations put in place by his predecessor Cristina Fernandez  Argentina holds the world s second largest shale gas reserves  but it imports a quarter of its energy needs  one reason for the country s  7 billion current account deficit  Macri has promised rail and pipeline projects to connect remote Vaca Muerta to markets and ports  Most crucially  he struck a deal with unions in January to reduce notoriously high labor costs  Still  production costs remain well above those of global competitors  Prices at the Loma Campana field  jointly operated by state run oil company YPF SA and  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX  exceed  43 per barrel  compared with  32 in the Niobrara in Colorado and Wyoming   For a look at Argentine shale activity  see    Used oil equipment can currently be imported at tariffs ranging from 7 percent to 28 percent  with imports of some types of machinery banned  the Energy Ministry said in an emailed statement to Reuters   The proposed change would eliminate the bans  lower tariffs to between 0 percent and 7 percent and provide a form of compensation for companies that buy locally produced equipment  the Ministry said  It added that it has been meeting with drillers  oil services companies and local manufacturers about the rule    Evidently this dialogue process has taken time   a ministry spokesman wrote   We expect the decree to be signed soon    COMPETE OR  DISAPPEAR  Local companies fear the changes could be devastating   Everaldo Santa Cruz is head of the oil and gas business at HTI SA  a maker of drilling and hydraulic fracturing equipment in Canuelas  Buenos Aires province  He said HTI has invested heavily in building frac pumps to supply drillers in Vaca Muerta  and that the  1 2 million price tag is comparable with that of U S  manufacturers  But Santa Cruz said he worries he will never get to fully develop that part of his business if the decree is passed  HTI doesn t stand a chance if his customers are allowed to import equipment they already own from the United States  paying only

192836,414352,CVX,In Aramco IPO pitch  Canada plays up its natural resources expertise,news,  This May 26th story corrects paragraph 12 to show Falih was speaking at news conference not to Reuters and adds comment on listing   By Alastair Sharp TORONTO  Reuters    The Toronto Stock Exchange s efforts to win a slice of the massive Saudi Aramco public listing plays up the country s deep experience in natural resources as part of a broader offer to help the kingdom with its shift away from oil dependence  In pitch documents obtained by Reuters  the TSX talks up  a customized regulatory environment for resource issuers   its leading position in oil and gas equity capital raising  and strong trading interest from outside the country  The Canadian pitch is also broader than just for a slice of the Aramco IPO  On several trips to the kingdom  the most recent in late March  TMX executives have been joined by senior executives from some of the country s biggest banks  brokerages and other financial players as Canada Inc seeks a role in delivering the kingdom s broader Vision 2030 plan  One source directly involved in the Canadian pitch told Reuters they are focused on convincing the Saudis that Canada excels in 10 of the 12 areas they have targeted for development under that plan  including in mining and infrastructure  The source declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter   We feel that we have put TMX and Canada s best foot forward and we continue to promote our strengths in pursuit of business opportunities in the region and around the world   TMX said in a statement  But its best chance of winning a part of the biggest IPO ever  expected to raise about  100 billion as early as next year  may lie in its geography and geopolitics  securities lawyers say   While the exchange  owned by the TMX Group Ltd  is widely considered an underdog in a race that has also excited larger exchanges in London  New York  Tokyo  Hong Kong and Singapore its case could be bolstered by a recent change in U S  law that allows those affected by the September 11  2001 attacks to sue the Saudi government  they said   We are inoffensive from a political perspective   said Sarah Gingrich  a Calgary based partner at Fasken Martineau  who has previously worked in Dubai with Saudi clients for international law firm Freshfields  That law  the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act  came into effect in September  after the U S  Congress overrode a veto by former President Barack Obama  A group of insurers has since renewed a  6 billion lawsuit against the kingdom  seeking to hold it responsible for business and property damage as a result of the attacks  in which Saudi has long denied involvement  In a March 17 interview with the Wall Street Journal  the Saudi energy minister  Khalid al Falih  said the so called  terror law  is one consideration in the country s decision on whether to list in the United States  Falih  who is Aramco s chairman  declined to comment on the specifics of the IPO process at a recent news conference in Riyadh  citing legal restrictions  However  he said the Saudi government still intended to list Aramco in 2018 and that the preparations were on track  It was not clear if the issue was discussed during U S  President Donald Trump s recent visit  A spokeswoman for the NYSE  which sources have said planned to visit Saudi soon after Trump s visit  declined to comment on their efforts to win Aramco s business  Nasdaq  which is a technology partner to Saudi Arabia s exchange  is also pitching for the listing  while the London Stock Exchange is working on a completely new type of listing structure to woo Aramco  Reuters has reported   SMALL MARKET  BIG ENERGY FOCUS Canada listed oil and gas companies raised 22 percent of global energy financing over the past five years  the TMX pitch documents show  second behind the NYSE s 44 percent  The documents put Canada in third place behind Chinese and Hong Kong exchanges  and the United States for total capital raised in 2016  noting that TSX listed companies raised 28 percent more than fourth placed LSE  They say more than 40 percent of TSX trading originates outside the country and that bid ask spreads  a key measure of liquidity  are among the lowest in the world  Still  while Canada boasts significant expertise in oil and gas financing and strong interest from both institutional and retail investors  it is dwarfed by the much larger U S  market  The oil and gas companies listed on its main TSX exchange and the junior TSXV have a total market capitalization of C 325 billion   239 billion   TMX says  By comparison  the New York Stock Exchange says its oil and gas companies   which include super majors ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  Corp   Chevron   NYSE CVX  and secondary listings for Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  and Total   are worth  3 3 trillion  Neither the source in the TMX delegation nor the external lawyers said listing and regulatory requirements would prove much of an obstacle to a Canadian listing  especially if it were to be a third or fourth option  But Canada would only find a way in to the action  if their  Aramco s  bankers think they will get sufficient enough market interest here that it will help promote the stock price and give them some liquidity and trading   said Darrell Peterson  a partner with Bennett

together drill pipes one recent morning in the Permian Basin  a bulldozer cleared sagebrush to make way for the company s fifth well since January   Lilis aims to expand production sevenfold this year in America s most active oilfield  The whir of activity is all the more impressive after the small firm nearly collapsed in late 2015   amid unrestrained production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   As per barrel prices plummeted  Lilis piled on debt and struggled to pay workers  Now   with prices higher after a November OPEC decision to cut output   Lilis can t grow fast enough   Such resurrections are common these days in the Permian  which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico  They tell the story of the U S  shale resurgence and the quandary it poses for OPEC as it struggles to tame a global glut   Surging U S  production has stalled OPEC s effort to cut supply  Inventories in industrialized nations totaled 3 05 billion barrels in February   about 330 million barrels above the five year average  according to the International Energy Agency   The Permian boom will be high on the agenda as OPEC oil ministers begin gathering in Vienna ahead of a May 25 policy meeting to decide whether to extend output cuts  In the long term  too much U S  output could spur OPEC to open the spigots again   setting off another price war   but for now its member nations  need for revenue makes that unlikely  On Monday  the world s top two oil producers   OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia and Russia  a non OPEC nation   said they had agreed in principle on the need to continue output cuts for an additional nine months  through March 2018  That would extend the initial agreement  which took effect in January and reduced production by 1 2 barrels per day  bpd  from OPEC nations and another 600 000 bpd from non OPEC producers  including Russia  The pledge to extend cuts marked an evolution in the thinking of Saudi Arabia Oil Minister Khalid al Falih   in response to surging U S  output   After OPEC s decision in November  Al Falih expressed confidence that no further supply curbs would be needed because of rising demand  Then in March  Al Falih told a Houston energy conference that the  green shoots  in U S  shale might be  growing too fast    and warned there would be no  free rides  for U S  producers benefiting from OPEC production cuts  But by last week  Al Falih vowed OPEC would do  whatever it takes  to control oversupply  Unlike OPEC nations  U S  firms are barred by anti trust laws from colluding to control output or prices  leaving market demand as the only check on production    I m really proud American production is offsetting those OPEC cuts   said Lilis Chief Executive Avi Mirman  FREE RIDE ON OPEC CUTS Now it appears the free ride for U S  shale producers will continue at least into next year  U S  oil output has jumped to 9 31 million bpd this year  up 440 000 bpd from 2016  according to U S  Energy Information Agency estimates   About a quarter of that production comes from the Permian  where broad based growth comes from small firms like Lilis  global majors including  Exxon Mobil  Corp and large independents such as  N XOM   Parsley Energy  Inc  N PE   OPEC s two year price war sank hundreds of companies and forced majors including Exxon and  Chevron  Corp  N CVX  to retrench   but it also and stirred their interest in shale  Exxon paid nearly  7 billion in February to double its acreage in the Permian  Earlier this month  about 20 miles  32 km  south of Midland  Texas   the center of the basin s industry   a crew from ProPetro Holding Corp  N PUMP  was hydraulically fracturing  or fracking  an Exxon well  Silver silos held 18 million pounds of sand  which would be mixed with 22 million gallons of water and forced into the well  unlocking oil trapped in rock   We re really approaching the Permian as a major project   Sara Ortwein  president of Exxon s shale focused subsidiary  XTO Energy  said in an interview   Across the Permian  the number of rigs this year has risen 30 percent and the number of fracking crews has jumped 40 percent  according to Primary Vision  which tracks oilfield service equipment usage  That won t change soon  said Mark Papa  CEO of Centennial Resource Development Inc  O CDEV   which added to its Permian land holdings this month with a  350 million deal   A disproportionate amount of U S  production growth between now and the end of the decade will come from the Permian   Papa said in an interview   WE RE OUT OF RIGS  In a reversal from the thousands of layoffs here in 2015  oil companies are hiring briskly   Fracking service provider  Keane Group Inc   N FRAC   for instance  has plans to hire at least 240 workers this year  For the growth to continue  however  prices will have to rise for rigs and other services  executives and analysts have said  Paul Mosvold  president of drilling contractor Scandrill Inc  has more business than he can handle    We re out of rigs   he said   We have been since January    But he won t add more rigs unless producers pay more   maybe  25 000 per day  instead of the current  15 000

192872,414388,CVX,5 Trending Dividend Yield Weighted ETFs ,opinion,"As the start of Q4 spreads optimism in the broader market with the S P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial hovering around record levels  the buzz about stretched valuations has surfaced all over again  After all  the S P 500 is now trading about 22 6  higher than its 52 week low level 
If the trend continues for a few more days on hopes for materialization of the tax reform and decent earnings releases  investors looking for cheap stocks may be disheartened  However  there is another way by which investors can enjoy gains  i e  dividend yield 
There is a feeling of monetary policy tightening in the United States and the Eurozone  as these economies are on the mend  While the Fed is mulling over reverse QE and a rate hike in December  the ECB chief is also thinking about QE tapering  If these tightening moves hold good soon  bond yields are likely to see a sharp rise  read    
This should bolster demand for high dividend products as yield hungry investors will be relying more on regular source of current income  Even if rates continue to rise  there are always dividend yield weighted ETFs that offer benchmark beating current income  As of Oct 6  the yield on benchmark 10 year U S  Treasuries was 2 35  
Notably  as per   these are one of top trending investment objectives right now  We thus highlight a few ETFs with over 3  yield  which were in the green in the one week frame  Take a look at the list  read

192873,414389,CVX,Australian court dismisses Chevron appeal in landmark tax case,news,"MELBOURNE  Reuters     Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX  lost an appeal on Friday against the Australian tax office in a landmark case in which the U S  energy giant contested a tax bill of A 340 million   260 million   including penalties and interest  The full bench of the Federal Court dismissed the appeal against an earlier ruling that Chevron underpaid taxes by setting up a A 2 5 billion intercompany credit facility with an abnormally high interest rate which effectively lowered its taxable income within Australia  Chevron said it was disappointed by the judgment in the case  which covers the five tax years from 2004 through 2008   We will review the decision to determine next steps  which may include an appeal to the High Court of Australia   a Chevron spokesman said in an emailed statement  The case is a first test of how Australia s transfer pricing rules apply to interest paid on a cross border related party loan  It is being closely watched by multinational companies as governments around the world clamp down on what they deem elaborate means of reducing tax obligations   The economic effects of the internal financing structure put in place     included CAHPL s  Chevron Australia Holdings Pty Ltd s  Australian taxable income being reduced by the deductions it claimed for the interest payments it made to its United States subsidiary   the court said in its latest ruling  The Australian Taxation Office  ATO  said it was heartened by the ruling but noted Chevron could appeal to the High Court

192875,414391,CVX,Republicans take next step in U S  deregulation with Senate bill,news,By Lisa Lambert WASHINGTON  Reuters    Republican lawmakers launched the next round in their fight against federal regulation on Wednesday  helped by at least one Democrat  as the U S  Senate began work on legislation to change nearly every step agencies take in creating and applying new rules  Republicans have said they deem lightening federal regulation  which they consider costly and burdensome  as much a priority as overhauling healthcare and rewriting the tax code   For most of President Donald Trump s first 100 days  the Republican led Congress attacked regulation by passing resolutions to wipe some of former Democratic President Barack Obama s rules off the books under the Congressional Review Act  Trump also ordered agencies to scrap two existing rules every time they enact a new one  Just before Trump s January inauguration  the House of Representatives passed the  Regulatory Accountability Act   combining a half dozen bills to radically change government regulation  On Wednesday  Senator Rob Portman  a Ohio Republican  and Senator Heidi Heitkamp  a North Dakota Democrat  introduced a version of the act for that chamber  If it passes  the bill will be combined with the House version for Trump to sign into law  The bill would bring  our outdated federal regulatory process into the 21st Century by requiring agencies to use the best scientific and economic data available  strengthening checks and balances  and giving the public a voice in the process   Portman said in a statement  It requires stricter cost benefit analysis  use of the  best available science  to craft rules  and reviews of regulations  according to a summary  The bill diverges from the House version on what is known as the   Chevron   NYSE CVX  Deference   based on a Supreme Court ruling that courts should defer to agencies  interpretations of statutes governing their rulemaking  The House legislation eliminates the Chevron Deference  while the Senate one creates a judicial review process where courts can decide if agencies comply with the law and then remand non compliant rules to agencies  Courts would also review factual determinations used in drafting rules costing more than  1 billion annually  Environmental and labor groups said the Senate bill could block needed new regulations and weaken existing ones    This bill would tilt the scales in favor of polluters at the public s expense   said Scott Slesinger  legislative director of the Natural Resources Defense Council   It would make it virtually impossible to safeguard the public from dirty air  unsafe drinking water and other health threats  ,2017-04-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/republicans-take-next-step-in-u.s.-deregulation-with-senate-bill-477834,477834
192880,414396,CVX,Venezuela s Maduro wins power over oil despite court reversal,news,"By Alexandra Ulmer QUITO  Ecuador  Reuters    The Venezuelan Supreme Court may have amended part of its explosive decision to take over the opposition led congress  but it still gives embattled leftist President Nicolas Maduro broad new powers over the OPEC nation s vast oil wealth  The reversal on Saturday came after political leaders worldwide and street protesters at home accused the pro government court of effectively making Maduro a dictator   While the court backed off its Wednesday decision to fully take over the legislative branch  it left in place sweeping new authority for Maduro to cut oil deals on behalf of PDVSA  the state run oil company  without congressional approval  Maduro s cash strapped government now has the autonomy to sell stakes in Venezuela s oil fields  which contain the world s largest reserves  or launch new joint ventures with foreign firms  The court action sets the stage for a protracted legal and political fracas that could spook foreign investors and further undermine the nation s efforts to stabilize PDVSA  said opposition lawmakers and industry experts  The state run firm is already reeling from lower oil prices  a cash flow crisis and chronic operational problems that have crippled its ability to serve customers worldwide  The fight centers on a constitutional requirement that the National Assembly approve PDVSA contracts of  national public interest  with outside companies  In addition to Maduro s legislative opponents  Venezuela s attorney general   a longtime government ally   has called the court decision to bypass the assembly unconstitutional  The legislature   which has been controlled by members opposing Maduro s government since late last year   has warned investors that oil deals would be invalid without assembly approval   Opposition lawmakers slammed state run Russian oil major Rosneft  MM ROSN   for instance  after it paid  500 million last year to increase its stake in the Petromonagas joint venture  to 40 percent from 16 7 percent  without legislative approval   Rosneft   a major PDVSA partner at a time when relations between Caracas and Moscow have grown increasingly cozy   said the deal was legal  But the episode underscored the potential legal quagmire for investors   Following the court s action on Saturday  opposition leaders vowed to continue challenging the validity of oil deals it has not approved    This is desperation for dollars   opposition lawmaker Elias Matta  the vice president of the congressional energy and oil commission  told Reuters   Let it be clear that any company created under this scheme will be null   totally null    Venezuela s Information and Oil Ministries  along with PDVSA  did not immediately respond to a request for comment  NERVOUS INVESTORS The imbroglio could hamper investments from wary multinational companies  especially those that are subject to stricter regulatory scrutiny at home   On Thursday  National Assembly head Julio Borges tore up the Supreme Court order on the steps of the legislature  an image likely to unsettle corporate boardrooms  Other major oil players in Venezuela include U S  major  Chevron  Corp  N CVX  and China s state owned CNPC   Investor uncertainty  in turn  could further undermine Venezuela s ravaged economy  which depends on PDVSA for more than 90 percent of export revenue as millions face food shortages and runaway inflation  In theory  the court s decision would allow Maduro s government the power to do anything short of privatizing PDVSA without approval of the National Assembly  said Francisco Monaldi  a fellow in Latin America energy policy at the Baker Institute in Houston    But the legal ground could not be shakier if there is a change in government   he said   As a result of all this international scandal  foreign investors will be less likely to invest    3 BILLION IN BOND PAYMENTS Firebrand Hugo Chavez  president until he died in 2013  led a wave of oil nationalizations in Venezuela as part of his self styled  21st century Socialism   The policies have left many oil fields less productive and lacking investment   National oil output tumbled last year on the back of constant refinery outages  an outflow of talent  and shortages of basic equipment in oil fields and imported diluents needed for blending with Venezuela s heavy crude  Amid mounting debts  Venezuela has sought to sell stakes in oil fields to bolster its dwindling coffers before a deadline to pay about  3 billion in bond obligations this month  sources say  On Friday  Venezuelan bonds tanked on worries about the impact of the latest crisis on the country s credit worthiness  It is unclear if the initial Supreme Court decision   the one that sparked global outrage   was prompted by an imminent plan to sell an oil field stake or create a new oil venture   Reuters reported in March that PDVSA was negotiating a business deal with Rosneft and had offered the state led company a stake in the Petropiar joint venture  The offer has not been confirmed  and it remains unclear if Rosneft  which has become an increasingly key source of financing for PDVSA  is interested   PDVSA is also relying on Rosneft to help it meet its looming bond payments  Reuters reported on Friday  It is unclear if the deal will go through or what Rosneft might get in exchange  Late last year  Venezuela used 49 9 percent of its shares in U S  subsidiary Citgo as collateral for loan financing from Rosneft  The move enraged opposition politicians who argue a desperate government is mortgaging prized national assets

192882,414398,CVX,Exclusive   Saudis  oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO,news,"By Ron Bousso  Dmitry Zhdannikov and Rania El Gamal LONDON DUBAI  Reuters    Saudi Arabia and international oil companies have discussed gas venture opportunities inside the kingdom and abroad as part of the top crude exporting country s drive to diversify investments before the listing of national energy giant Saudi Aramco  Saudi officials explored investment opportunities with firms including  BP   L BP  and  Chevron   N CVX  to help develop its gas reserves  the world s sixth largest  at a time of booming energy demand at home  four industry sources told Reuters  Aramco has also looked into investing in gas ventures abroad  including with Italy s Eni  MI ENI   the sources said  The development revives memories of talks between Aramco and global majors at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s  known as the Saudi gas initiative  Most of those talks collapsed as the parties disagreed over returns on investment  This time  Aramco is gearing up for a share listing next year  aiming to get a valuation of up to  2 trillion in what could be the world s biggest initial public offering  IPO   Chevron  BP  Aramco and Eni declined to comment on talks   We have a long standing relationship with Saudi Arabia  so it is not uncommon for us to talk to them  We re always having discussions about business development  I don t have anything particular to say about Saudi Arabia   Chevron CEO John Watson told Reuters last week  BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley  who traveled to Saudi Arabia at the end of last year  said this year he wouldn t rule out  creative partnerships  with Aramco but that an outright investment by BP in the IPO was unlikely  The kingdom has a long term goal of increasing the use of gas for domestic power generation  thus reducing oil burning at home and freeing up more crude for export  This could help increase Aramco s valuation as it generates more revenue from exports than selling oil at lower domestic prices   Saudi Arabia is the world s fifth biggest oil consumer despite being only the 20th biggest economy  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih  who is also Aramco s chairman  said last year that Aramco was interested in investing in international upstream ventures  particularly gas  and could invest in importing gas into the kingdom  Diversifying gas assets abroad would help Aramco achieve a better valuation and is attractive for investors  industry sources said  Riyadh also plans to raise domestic gas prices  a move seen as an incentive for foreign companies  NEW GAS STRATEGY  Aramco is preparing to reveal in the next few months a new gas strategy aimed at developing resources to keep pace with rising domestic demand  sources familiar with the discussions said   It comes as part of the kingdom s push to diversify its economy away from oil  a strategy known as  Vision 2030   amid a global drive to phase out the most polluting fossil fuels  Aramco wants nearly to double gas production to 23 billion standard cubic feet a day in the next decade   IOCs  international oil companies  are waiting for that  strategy  to make their decisions   one industry source familiar with the matter said  Another industry source said Energy Minister Falih had said in private meetings with Western oil executives that he wanted Aramco to partner with other companies in upstream projects  Two Saudi based industry sources familiar with the discussions said BP s Dudley had expressed an interest in investing in gas exploration in the Red Sea  However  the two sides have yet to hold any talks on the project  Aramco controls gas reserves in excess of 8 trillion cubic metres  according to BP s annual energy review  The Saudi company has said it wants to explore for gas in the shallow waters of the Red Sea as well as onshore shale gas       SOUR MEMORIES Since gradually renationalizing the industry in the 1970s  Saudi Arabia has not allowed the majors to develop its oil  The Saudi gas initiative of the 1990s was effectively an effort by the then minister for oil  Ali al Naimi  to thwart attempts by companies such as  Exxon Mobil   N XOM  to partner with Riyadh in oil developments  In a book published last year  Naimi said he was convinced that as part of gas talks during that decade  oil majors hoped to acquire cheap Saudi reserves of gas condensate  a high quality form of crude oil  The  25 billion gas initiative offered in 1997 98 had some of the world s top oil companies such as Exxon and Shell  LON RDSa  expressing interest but struggling to agree terms  Riyadh later invited investors in 2003 2004 to find and produce gas in Rub Al Khail  a desert in the country s southeast  Companies including Russia s Lukoil  MM LKOH   Shell and China s Sinopec formed ventures with Aramco but have failed to find commercially viable deposits  They also complained about low domestic gas prices and high extraction costs  Russia s Lukoil  MM LKOH  was the most recent foreign company to quit Saudi Arabia s search for gas   However  Saudi Arabia last month slashed income tax on energy companies operating in the kingdom to make energy investments more attractive

192891,414407,CVX,Unpaid wages  sackings stir new tension in Nigeria s oil hub,news,"By Tife Owolabi and Libby George
PORT HARCOURT  Nigeria LONDON  Reuters    The moment a group of Nigerian contractors met executives from Italian oil major  ENI   MI ENI  to discuss unpaid wages they started shouting  calling them fraudsters and liars until a police commander restored calm 
Wenenda Mpi  local manager of ENI unit Agip  blamed the payment delays on debts owed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation  NNPC  and said the government had promised to sort the problem out 
The heated meeting  called after hundreds of ENI contractors threatened a protest that police feared could turn violent  highlights the challenge of stabilizing the Niger Delta oil region  even though attacks on oil facilities have halted 
Militants were persuaded to stop the attacks by promises of more investment and jobs from visiting officials including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo  a technocrat who stood in for President Muhammadu Buhari this year while he had seven weeks of medical treatment in London 
That has helped restore output to close to its former level 2 2 million barrels a day  bpd  from the 1 15 million bpd it hit last year  But it is unclear how long the calm will last 
Protests like that against ENI in the region s biggest city Port Harcourt are common  partly because low global oil prices mean oil firms are firing hundreds of workers and cutting back on contractors such as welders  security guards and cooks 
The ENI contractors showed up on time at the city s police headquarters for the meeting brokered by a local police commander  and tempers were high by the time three AGIP managers and the police boss arrived more than an hour later 
 We are giving Agip a two week ultimatum to pay all outstanding debt   said Clement Adaminegbe  head of contractors at Agip  threatening unspecified further action   In case of failure we will take a clear stand  
Mpi promised to look into the grievances but was shouted down by the workers until the Commissioner of Police Zaki Ahmed stepped in    persuading them to meet again next week in the presence of an Italian manager 
 I want both parties to resolve the issue amicably   he said  addressing the stone faced protesters at the meeting attended by a Reuters reporter 
EXPECTATIONS
Since the start of the year  vice president Osinbajo has been going back and forth to the swamps land  promising to drag the region s population out of poverty with a bigger share of Nigeria s huge oil wealth 
Residents say Osinbajo  a Christian like most in the southern region  has connected much better with them than Buhari  a Muslim from the north  who last year sent the army to hunt down militants and has only visited the region once 
Osinbajo has proposed legalising illegal oil refineries to ensure employment for angry youths who often join militants  although a military campaign to hunt them down has continued 
The future of the fragile peace will depend on whether the government follows up on such proposals at a time when Africa s biggest economy is hit by its first recession in 25 years 
State oil firm NNPC has been planning for two years to pay back funds owed to oil majors for joint oil operations  The government said in December a remaining  5 1 billion would be paid back in five years  a time scale which means tensions over payments on the ground will likely continue 
Locals are demanding that oil majors relocate their headquarters to the region   a move that most are loath to make due to security concerns 
A spokesperson for Shell s Nigeria unit said they had no such plans   Chevron   NYSE CVX  and Exxon  NYSE XOM  declined to comment on any relocation and a spokesperson for ENI did not respond immediately to a request to comment 
CASH
The oil swamps are home to 40 ethnic groups competing for a share of oil money  a major obstacle to reaching an agreement that would put a permanent end to attacks on oil facilities 
 There s a kind of cycle of violence in the Delta   said Anthony Goldman of Nigeria focused Promedia Consulting   It s not just about paying people off  This money is there   it s in the budget  It s really about what the situation is on the ground  
Villages fight for contracts  forcing oil firms to recruit only their youth as guards or risk pipelines being blown up by rejected hires  Or they demand firms to buy food or cement from them and block passage of vehicles if they bring in supplies from other villages  oil workers say 
 The issue of surveillance contracts is not working well  we will revisit it   the Agip manager said at the meeting  referring to security contracts with host communities 
The protesters handed the Agip delegation a list of 16 demands including a cash payment of 10 million naira   32 000  to  demobilize  the planned protest  They also want to get 60 percent of future work tendered by Agip 
Officials have repeatedly visited the biggest Delta group of Ijaw from which the Niger Delta Avengers  the biggest militant group  recruits  That has not gone down well with other groups 
 If the people of the upland part of the region are not treated with same level of respect as those in the creeks  there will never be security for the oil assets you so much cherish   the militant group Niger Delta Greenland Justice Mandate said in a media release last week 
Shell  LON RDSa  has been reluctant to reopen the only key pipeline that is still down   Trans Forcados   and oil traders say there are still worries from buyers about the reliability of Nigeria s exports  given the security problems 
Locals hope Buhari will allow Osinbajo to continue his peace efforts in the Niger Delta after he resumed work on Monday following his medical leave

192894,414410,CVX,High court pick could help decide fate of Trump s climate policy,news,By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON  Reuters    Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee could help decide the fate of his moves to undo climate related U S  regulations  but legal experts said Neil Gorsuch s judicial record makes it hard to predict whether as a justice he would back a sweeping rollback  If confirmed to the lifetime job by the Senate  the Colorado based federal appeals court judge would restore the court s 5 4 conservative majority  The Senate is planning an April 7 confirmation vote although many Democrats are fighting to block Gorsuch  On the court  Gorsuch could become a pivotal vote on the Republican president s deregulation agenda  along with fellow conservative Anthony Kennedy  who sometimes joins the court s four liberals in close cases  That agenda includes Trump s effort to kill Democratic former President Barack Obama s so called Clean Power Plan  blocked by the high court last year  aimed at reducing climate warming carbon emissions from mainly coal fired power plants  Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order kicking off a lengthy review process that environmental groups and Democratic governed U S  states have promised to challenge in court  Gorsuch s views on issues related to climate change are unclear  His mother headed the U S  Environmental Protection Agency under Republican former President Ronald Reagan for two years in the 1980s  Gorsuch was not asked about climate issues during his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing last week  In his 11 years as a judge  the only major ruling touching upon climate policy came in 2015 when he was on a three judge panel that upheld a Colorado measure requiring power generators to ensure a fifth of their electricity came from renewable sources  A 2016 case on federal agency power is potentially more instructive on how he might approach broad moves to slash current regulation  according to experts  In that case  Gorsuch questioned a 1984 Supreme Court precedent giving federal agencies broad deference to interpret laws  Gorsuch called the doctrine  enshrined in the  Chevron   NYSE CVX  v  Natural Resource Defense Council ruling  an  elephant in the room  that concentrates federal power  in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution   Questions remain over how that approach would manifest itself if applied to efforts by Trump s EPA to weaken or rescind existing agency regulations on fighting climate change  Some environmental lawyers say it could mean Gorsuch would be skeptical of any big changes at the agency level  The EPA under Obama compiled detailed scientific data to support its efforts to curb carbon emissions   That could hamper the Trump administration   said Jonathan Adler  a conservative law professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland  Sean Donahue  a lawyer who represents environmental groups  agreed  saying if the EPA were to  advance fancy interpretive footwork to try to make greenhouse gases not a Clean Air Act pollutant   the administration may not get the deference it wants  The extent to which the U S  Clean Air Act  the law that tackles air pollution  applies to carbon emissions is heavily contested in the courts  The Supreme Court  in the landmark 2007 decision Massachusetts v  EPA  held that carbon is a pollutant that could be subject to regulation under the law  In a 2014 case  the court largely upheld the Obama administration s first batch of greenhouse gas regulations  Environmental groups including the Sierra Club have said they are ready to pounce if they see signs that Trump s EPA  headed by fossil fuels industry ally Scott Pruitt  is ignoring science in making climate related regulatory changes   I think the bottom line is that we hope any anti regulatory rule making should be so unscientific     almost any federal judge should see through the Trump administration maneuvering   said Pat Gallagher  a Sierra Club lawyer ,2017-03-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/high-court-pick-could-help-decide-fate-of-trump's-climate-policy-470061,470061
192898,414414,CVX,Perfect Market Weather,opinion,"Have you ever had the feeling that the weather is either too good to be true  or too bad to be natural 
Forget climate change  it seems increasingly likely that the governments of the world either are at the moment or will be able to control the sunshine and clouds 
A program called HAARP  which is funded through the US Government s  program aims to do just that  Claims on the internet that HAARP was responsible for Harvey and Irma of course were  
Professor Michio Kaku a theoretical physicist who frequently dabbles in the weather  that the government of China banished clouds from the Beijing Olympics saying that the evidence is inconclusive 
He also mentioned that the US government used weather manipulation in the war against Viet Nam before the interviewer quickly interjected saying that they had  alleged to  influence the weather 
Still  it s nice to think that maybe one day we will indeed be able to control the skies  Personally  I want to see what the adverse effects of such experiments could be before rendering an official opinion 
Today s Highlights
Perfect Market Weather
Energy Led Gains
Carney s Big Day

Market Overview
The weather seems to be perfect in the stock markets lately  Despite everything that s happening in the world  the in the United States continued to climb into record high territory on Wednesday 
Not too hot and not too cold  The Dow Jones rose by a modest 0 18  marking its 37th record high of the year 

The gains were led by the energy sector  which rose by 1 2  after a fantastic day for oil 
Oil Surge
Black gold was rising nicely by the time the bell rang on   One hour later the crude oil inventories were released  circle in the graph below  showing that stock piles of the sticky stuff had risen drastically over the past week 
The initial reaction was for the price to fall on increased supply but that move was quickly reversed and oil ended the day much higher
 
Shares in companies like Chevron  NYSE CVX  and Shell  NYSE RDSa  which rely heavily on oil managed to push the entire market higher 
Over to England
Today is a big day in the UK and not because of the Brexit    not directly anyway 
The Bank of England is due to deliver their interest rate decision at Noon time in London along with their monetary policy statement 
The Canadian Governor of the BoE Mark Carney has been dreaming of raising the interest rates since early 2014  The plan was derailed at the time by the Scottish Referendum and just when he was ready to get on track the Brexit came and changed the entire picture 
Interest rates have been on the floor in the United Kingdom for a long time  Now that unemployment is at a 42 year low and inflation finally seems to be going the right way  the timing couldn t be better 
The only issue is  that the BoE hasn t really prepared anybody for a hike today  Most central banks like to give the market some time to prepare for a move like a rate hike 
On the other hand  the Bank of Canada did surprise the market with an unexpected hike earlier this month  If Carney does decide to follow in the footsteps of the bank he used to run it would very likely send the British Pound flying  possibly by several hundred pips in the span of a few minutes 
Let s have an awesome day

192900,414416,CVX,Hurricanes And U S  Rig Counts,opinion,"You Have Got Trouble
Hurricane activity and a big drop in U S  rig counts will force traders to look at forces that may hit both supply and demand  Hurricane Jose threatens the East Coast from Delaware to Massachusetts  mainly demand but some refineries  Hurricane Maria also poses a threat to the Virgin Islands and is a dangerous storm as it is following the same path as Hurricane Irma and tropical storm Lee right behind that  From the larger energy picture  a big drop in U S  rig counts show that U S  shale producers are pulling back and the International Energy Agency is warning about the under investment in oil production that may lead to future shortages 
The number of active oil and gas rigs in the United States are starting to plunge as we predicted would happen  Sub  50 a barrel oil has taken its toll on cash strapped shale producers and this week the U S  rig count fell by 8 rigs  The total oil and gas rig count is 936 rigs  up 430 rigs from the last prior  the number of oil rigs fell 7 and gas rigs by 1  While that s at 749 rigs up 333 from a year ago  we are seeing a significant slowdown in the second quarter and now rigs are falling in the third quarter and unless we see a significant increase in the price of oil  the U S  rig count has peaked and will continue to decline 
This comes as the International Energy Agency continues to warn about under investment in conventional energy projects  While they said they failed to foresee  technical ingenuity  of U S  shale production  they still see that a significant underinvestment in traditional projects that could lead to shortages in just a few years 
We have seen some real strength in heating oil and ultra low sulfur diesel as hurricanes have taken its toll on supply  Reuters points out that since 2000  between June and September  distillate inventories have risen by an average of 10 percent  but this year they fell by 2 2 percent  the first decline since 1982 when record keeping began  Inventories typically remain flat or rise modestly through September  and while some refiners delayed scheduled work  the loss of the Gulf has hit overall U S  refining  Because of Harvey  distillate stocks fell another 4 6 million barrels in the first two weeks of September  EIA data shows  U S  distillate stocks are now at three year lows for this time of year  and 5 2 percent below their historical average

Despite another hefty inventory draw  oil prices recorded their fifth successive weekly decline  The U S  Energy Department s inventory release showed that crude stockpiles   With oil supplies falling for the ninth week  investor sentiment has turned slightly positive on dissipating fears about a meltdown to sub  40 levels  Analysts also believe that the trend  if sustained  could help tighten the market significantly 
However  these positive effects were more than offset by the steadily rising domestic oil output that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market  At 9 5 million barrels a day  production is at the highest level in more than two years  thereby cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies 
Meanwhile  natural gas traded up handsomely following a below average increase in supplies  This caused the current storage level   at 3 155 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    narrow its surplus to the five year average to just 8 Bcf  0 3    while stocks have now fallen 239 Bcf  7   below the year ago figure 
Gasoline Soars on Harvey Shutdowns
But for the second week running  the major mover was gasoline  The most widely used petroleum product ended more than 13  higher on the week to  1 748 a gallon in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Harvey knocking out refining operations in the Houston area  Harvey caused weeks of disruptions at facilities in its path   shutting units  sparking fires and creating supply shortage possibly extending for months

192917,414433,CVX,Crude Oil Futures   Weekly Outlook  March 6   10,news,"Investing com   Oil futures ended higher on Friday  as a broadly weaker U S  dollar helped prices rebound from a sell off that took them to multi week lows in the prior session 
Oil prices typically strengthen when the U S  currency weakens as the dollar priced commodity becomes cheaper for holders of other currencies 
Uncertainty surrounding Libya s crude production following reports of violence near the war torn country s biggest oil terminal also provided support 
Prices  however  still ended with a weekly loss as concern over rising shale production and record high U S  crude inventories offset optimism that OPEC and its allies have been following through on their commitment to cut production 
The U S  West Texas Intermediate crude April contract climbed 72 cents  or around 1 4   to end at  53 33 a barrel by close of trade Friday  The U S  benchmark slumped more than 2  to  52 54 on Thursday  the lowest since February 8 
Despite Friday s gains  New York traded oil futures declined 66 cents  or almost 1 2   on the week 
Elsewhere  on the ICE Futures Exchange in London  Brent oil for May delivery added 82 cents  or about 1 5   to settle at  55 90 a barrel by close of trade  The global benchmark touched  55 03 a day earlier  its cheapest since February 8 
For the week  London traded Brent futures scored a loss of 9 cents  or less than 0 2   the fourth straight weekly decline 
Concerns that the ongoing rebound in U S  shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand pressured crude prices 
Data from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes on Friday revealed that the number of active U S  rigs drilling for oil rose by 7 last week  the seventh weekly increase in a row  That brought the total count to 609  the most since October 2015 
Meanwhile  the U S  Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude supplies increased by 1 5 million barrels last week to yet another all time high of 520 2 million  It was the eighth straight weekly build in U S  stockpiles  feeding concerns about a global glut 
Oil prices have been trading in a narrow  5 range around the mid  50s over the past two months as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between rising stockpiles and increased shale production in the U S  and hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers 
OPEC and non OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output by almost 1 8 million barrels per day by the end of June  with compliance currently at around 94  
Elsewhere on Nymex  gasoline futures for April tacked on 0 9 cents  or about 0 6  to  1 653 on Friday  It ended down about 4 8  for the week 
April heating oil inched up 1 4 cents  or 0 9   to finish at  1 593 a gallon  For the week  the fuel lost almost 3  
Natural gas futures for April delivery rose 2 3 cents  or almost 0 8   to  2 827 per million British thermal units  It posted a weekly gain of around 7 6  
In the week ahead  market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U S  stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world s largest oil consumer 
Meanwhile  traders will pay close attention to comments from global oil producers attending the annual CERAWeek Conference in Houston  Texas for further evidence that they are complying with their agreement to cut output 
 Big Oil  figures attending the week long event include OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Mohammed Barkindo  the oil ministers from Saudi Arabia  Russia and Iraq  as well as executives from major oil companies such as  Chevron   NYSE CVX    Exxon Mobil   NYSE XOM  and  BP   LON BP

TOTF  loss making refinery division in 2011  he demanded a breakdown of costs for every single unit  He was told such details didn t exist  Frustrated  he sent his lieutenants to produce numbers showing which units of the French oil major were performing well and which needed urgent cost cuts to stop hemorrhaging profit  Brutal cost cutting became Pouyanne s trademark and has served him well ever since   he turned around the refining unit  more than doubling net income in just three years  Today Pouyanne  who took over as Total s chief executive in 2014  is emerging from the worst oil price slump in a generation with his firm making more money than any of its peers except its much larger rival  U S  oil giant ExxonMobil  N XOM   Pouyanne s relentless fight to cut costs has earned him respect from investors who want to see strong results in a poor market while pressing him for future growth plans   We are happy with Total s progression  Lower cash flow breakeven is a good thing and it is good to see they are progressing with new project development and defending future growth   said Jonathan Waghorn  fund manager at London based Guinness Asset Management  which holds shares in  Total   Pouyanne  53  was propelled to the helm of France s top listed firm after his predecessor  Christophe de Margerie  died in a plane crash in Moscow  De Margerie  a bon vivant with connections to the French aristocracy and political elite  was widely seen as an ideal chief for the boom times as he won huge projects with big budgets  But as oil prices collapsed soon after Pouyanne took over  the rugby loving giant   he is 1 91 metre  six foot three inches  tall   was forced quietly to abandon de Margerie s  high risk  high reward  exploration strategy  in which the firm had poured  10 billion in a fruitless effort to find new reserves  For Jason Kenney  an equity analyst at Santander  MC SAN   Pouyanne s big achievement was to bring about a quick change of course at Total while preserving de Margerie s good relations with many nations   Pouyanne has built on these foundations but has brought a prudent commercial sense to the business that has helped see it through two very tough years   and strengthened Total to make it more  future proof  than peers   with a differentiated growth and profitability outlook   Kenney said  FLURRY OF PROJECTS A key distinction between Total and its peers became evident last week when it reported  8 2 billion in adjusted net income for 2016   almost on a par with Exxon  a company producing twice as much oil and gas as Total  The figure came well ahead of much larger peers Shell  LON RDSa   and  Chevron   N CVX   which reported  7 2 billion and  1 8 billion respectively  Total also became the only major oil firm to raise its dividend over the past year  According to Thomson Reuters data  five analysts currently rate Total as a  strong buy   14 analysts a  buy  and 11 analysts a  hold   Only rival  BP   LON BP  is rated slightly higher  Total s shares  up around 24 percent over the last year  remain around 10 percent below their price on June 19  2014  when the oil price peaked  but have outperformed peers like Chevron  Exxon and  ENI   MI ENI  over that period  Like BP  Total has impressed the market with a record number of new partnerships and acquisitions over the past year   in an effort to make sure it doesn t run out of profitable projects  But unlike BP  which irked the market this month by raising its breakeven oil price to  60 per barrel  Total is expected to break even at  50 including dividend  according to UBS  During a year when oil prices crashed as low as  27 per barrel   down from over  100 in 2014   Total went big after some projects as Pouyanne predicted the world

to invest in gas in Azerbaijan and bought into oil fields in Brazil  Qatar and Uganda   This is the right opportunity to launch new projects   Pouyanne  who worked for Total in Angola and Qatar  said this month while pledging moves on 10 new projects within 18 months  RISKS IN PROJECT DELAYS So far Pouyanne has been effectively harvesting results of giant projects launched under de Margerie several years ago   For Jason Gammel  analyst at Jefferies  it means that one of the key risks for cost obsessed Pouyanne will be in his ability to deliver on projects on time to preserve current output growth of over 4 5 percent   far above its peers   Delays in the start up of the company s major projects  such as was the case with Total s giant Laggan Tormore gas field in the North Sea  are one of the biggest dangers to the stock   said Gammel who has a  hold  rating on Total  Other risks include a further sharp fall in gas prices   of all new projects  Pouyanne has put a clear emphasis on low cost gas and renewables developments   Whether we like it or not  the share of oil in the energy mix will decline by 2040  gas will increase and renewables will also climb sharply   Pouyanne said in January   Longer term  Total aims to have 35 40 percent of its portfolio in oil compared to around 48 percent today  some 40 50 percent in gas and up to 20 percent in renewables and low carbon energies compared to 3 4 percent today  If that drive involves political risks  Pouyanne has proven he can be a risk taker   he agreed to stick with de Margerie s  20 billion Russian Yamal gas project despite Western sanctions   Last year  Total also agreed a  1 billion gas deal with Iran  becoming the first major to return to the country after the easing of Western sanctions despite pledges from U S  President Donald Trump to take a tougher stance towards Tehran  Pouyanne was paid 3 million euros in 2015  less than Shell s Ben van Beurden s remuneration of 5 14 million euros or BP s Bob Dudley s  19 6 million  But Pouyanne can rival many of his peers for political connections  Son of a customs officer  he graduated from France s most prestigious Ecole Polytechnique college to become adviser to ex Prime Minister Edouard Balladur

192937,414453,CVX,Republicans to kill U S  rules on corruption  environment  labor and guns next week,news,"By Lisa Lambert WASHINGTON  Reuters    Congressional Republicans are set to overturn a slew of Obama era regulations next week  including a controversial anti bribery rule aimed at U S  resource companies such as  Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM  and  Chevron  Corp  N CVX   according to a top lawmaker  After six years of legal battles  the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission in June approved the rule requiring companies to disclose payments to foreign governments  It will probably be killed swiftly with two simple congressional votes   Other rules eyed for quick overturning by Congress include newly minted environmental  gun control and labor relations measures  sources said   Under the Congressional Review Act  Congress can use simple majority votes to stop recent regulations in their tracks  The timing in the law means that any rules that became final after May 31 could go on the chopping block   House of Representatives Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy  the second most powerful Republican in the chamber  had said he would start using that law quickly after President Donald Trump was inaugurated to help roll back regulations the party considers abusive  House Republicans have been on a blitz of regulatory reform  passing bills to drive down regulations  costs and create more congressional oversight  The Republican dominated House will bypass the committee process and go directly to a vote by the entire chamber on a half dozen resolutions  McCarthy s spokesman said on Wednesday   Further rule reversals are likely to come out of various committees  Representative Greg Walden  a Republican from Oregon  said on Tuesday  Given the resolutions only require simple majorities to pass  they will probably sail through the House and then pass the Senate  where Democrats  the minority party  cannot mount a filibuster against them  They could then zoom to the White House for fellow Republican Trump to sign  But Walden also said the Congressional Review Act broadly wipes out entire regulations and forbids agencies from writing new versions in their place  That could be dangerous for a rule with some provisions that Republicans support  he said  Earlier this month  McCarthy said the House would try to kill regulations protecting streams and forests from coal mining s impacts  curbing methane leaks on public lands  and requiring employers to report workers  information as part of an attempt to end pay discrimination   Reforming regulations is as high a priority as undoing the Affordable Care Act and rewriting the tax code  he said  In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Wednesday  he also added a rule expanding background checks on gun purchases for disabled Social Security recipients to the hit list  as well as the anti bribery regulation  Requiring companies to state publicly how much they pay governments in taxes  royalties and other types of fees for exploration and extraction was included in the 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street reform law  Regulators struggled for years to make it a reality as the companies said it would drive up their costs

192939,414455,CVX,U S  lawmakers move to scrap SEC s  resource extraction  rule,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch and Lisa Lambert
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Two senior U S  lawmakers unveiled legislative plans on Monday to scrap a rule devised under the 2010 Dodd Frank financial reform law requiring publicly traded mining  oil and gas companies to disclose payments they make to foreign governments 
Michigan Republican Bill Huizenga  who chairs the House of Representatives Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets  and Oklahoma Republican James Inhofe  chairman of the Senate Environment Committee  took aim at the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission s so called  resource extraction  rule  saying it makes it harder for U S  energy companies to compete 
They introduced measures to ax the rule using the Congressional Review Act  which allows Congress to stop recently adopted regulations through a simple majority vote  Republicans this week are expected to undo five Obama era regulations  The full Republican led House on Wednesday will vote to kill all the regulations and then send them to the Senate  also controlled by Republicans 
The SEC rule is championed by human rights organizations who say disclosure of payments to foreign governments by companies like  Exxon Mobil  Corp  NYSE XOM  and  Chevron   NYSE CVX  helps fight corruption 
 There is absolutely no benefit to nullifying this common sense law unless your objective is to make it easier for corrupt elites to steal money   said Isabel Munilla who studies extraction policies for anti poverty group Oxfam 
But the U S  Chamber of Commerce and other industry groups have long opposed it  saying it hurts U S  companies without providing investors with meaningful  material information 
Industry groups successfully beat back the rule a few years ago and the SEC was forced to go back to the drawing board  Then  Oxfam accused the regulator of dragging its feet on a new draft 
A federal judge ordered the SEC to fast track the rule in 2015  and the agency issued a final version last summer set to take effect in 2018 
 The SEC continues to propose a resource extraction rule that is overly burdensome  puts U S  companies at a competitive disadvantage  and fails to provide investors with useful information   Huizenga said 
The House Financial Services Committee s senior Democrat  Maxine Waters  said killing the rule  is undoubtedly another conflict of interest on account of Trump and his cronies  
President Donald Trump s Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson headed Exxon when it fought the drafting of the rule  Waters said  She added the regulation would identify oil companies with financial ties to countries that have been hostile to the United States  such as Russia ",2017-01-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-lawmakers-move-to-scrap-sec's-'resource-extraction'-rule-456623,456623

192953,414469,CVX,Congress to limit powers of SEC  CFTC  and IRS,news,"Investing com     Congressional Republicans are moving forward with a landmark regulatory reform that would strip federal government agencies of their most powerful tool    the power to broadly interpret federal laws  The new U S  Congress was sworn in yesterday afternoon  a few weeks before President elect Donald Trump takes power 
Though repeal of Obamacare has grabbed the headlines in most media  reform of another policy may have an even greater impact on finance in the U S   experts are telling Investing com 
A more than 30 year old U S  Supreme Court case set the standard for administrative agency power in America  Lawyers call the power   Chevron   NYSE CVX  deference   in response to the case law  granting the exeucutive branch agencies nearly unfettered interpretive power over federal statutes they manage  
Chevron U S A   Inc  v  Natural Resources Defense Council  Inc   467 US 837  1984   was a landmark case in which the Supreme Court set the legal test for determining how to grant deference to a government agency s interpretation of a statute which it administers 
Agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC   Commodities Futures Exchange Commission  CFTC   and the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  have used    and critics say abused    the deference doctrine to interpret cases in ways favorable to the federal government   
Chevron was the Court s clearest affirmation of the doctrine of  administrative deference   based on the idea that those who work on a daily basis with a law  government lawyers and bureaucrats  know it best 
But scholarly law reform groups such as the Federalist Society  which calls for strict adherence to the U S  Constitution  have railed against the doctrine for decades  arguing that it gave unelected bureaucrats in the executive branch of government sometimes unlimited power

192959,414475,CVX,Exclusive  Sonangol delays payments as it battles to reform,news,"By Libby George LONDON  Reuters    Angola s state oil company Sonangol has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars in debts and deferred payments to oil majors and contractors while its new chief  Isabel dos Santos  attempts to reform its operations  Contractors say they have waited months even for small payments from Sonangol  which handles the oil and gas reserves of Africa s second largest oil exporter  The delays began following the appointment of dos Santos  the daughter President Jose Eduardo dos Santos  in June to root out waste and corruption at a company that was struggling even before oil prices plunged  As she worked to unravel the company s myriad debts and repayments  outgoing cheques ground to a halt  Contractors and sources close to Sonangol said it is months behind in payments to nearly every entity it works with  from cash calls worth hundreds of millions and smaller payments of hundreds of thousands    They haven t paid us  but we are talking to them   a source at one contractor told Reuters   They re trying to make reforms but there is a cash flow problem    Sources told Reuters that those owed included  Chevron   N CVX    Total   PA TOTF    BP   L BP    ENI   MI ENI  and ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM   EXXO UL   Sonangol has asked for a moratorium on other debts until the end of the year  they said   This is the most significant effort yet to reform the central pillar of sub Saharan Africa s third largest economy and one of the continent s biggest companies  Sonangol employs some of the Angola s most powerful people and its tentacles spread beyond energy to real estate and railways  and trucking to telecoms  The appointment of dos Santos was itself controversial  Her father has ruled Angola since 1979 and government critics accuse his family and associates of enriching themselves while doing too little to spread the benefits of Angola s oil wealth to its people  Isabel runs a multinational business empire that has made her Africa s richest woman  A group of lawyers has filed a lawsuit accusing the president of nepotism and violating Angolan probity by appointing her as head of the state oil firm  The supreme court last month ordered him to respond to the inquiry  Isabel dos Santos has defended the decision  saying she had been picked for her expertise and competence  GOVERNMENT COFFERS At the start of the shake up  she clipped the wings of the entire Sonangol legal department  barring them from conducting any external negotiations  This may have hindered sorting out payment complications  She even booted out the hair dressing and nail bar salons that had set up shop inside Sonangol s Luanda headquarters to pamper the oil executives in their lunch and coffee breaks  according to one Luanda based diplomat  Former chief executive Francisco de Lemos Jose Maria  along with the rest of the board  was replaced in June when dos Santos took over  Sources close to Sonangol said she had taken away Sonangol s ability to pay its own bills directly  Revenues from oil sales now flow directly to government coffers  where payments must be approved before they go out   The delays bubbled to the surface last month  when reports circulated that Chevron was demanding immediate payment of  300 million in unpaid cash calls   the money that Sonangol is required to pay for operations on oil and gas fields   Chevron declined to comment  but the talks prompted Sonangol to issue a rare statement about the troubles   This perfectly normal situation in the Angolan oil industry is not unique or isolated   the company said  It had reached a plan for some  200 million in payments to Chevron  it added    The difficult situation of the oil industry  marked by oil price fall  implies longer times of analysis and validation of expenses and invoices for costs and investments   it said  Total s Patrick Pouyanne said the company has a strong relationship with Angola and when he met with dos Santos   we discussed more about new projects than cash difficulties   ExxonMobil declined to comment and ENI did not respond to a request for comment   Sonangol said in a statement that measures adopted over the past five months had allowed  recurring savings of over  240 million per year    HERCULEAN TASK The troubles are a window into the Herculean task dos Santos faces in turning around Sonangol s fortunes during a prolonged oil price rout  and also of the concerns swirling around Sonangol and the government over a lack of transparency  Watchdog group Transparency International ranked Angola 163 out of 168 countries in its index of perceived corruption in the public sector  and said it had  minimal  budget openness   Opposition groups have complained about the absence of any public discussion of the state s dealings  particularly what it said was a failure to shield citizens against the pain of low oil prices that led it to slash fuel subsidies and cut public spending  Angola also cut off talks over a possible financial rescue package with the International Monetary Fund that would have forced it to diversify the economy and make a variety of reforms  CHINA DEBT Sonangol has already borrowed heavily from China  a major investor in Angola  which has limited its own access to oil cargoes to sell each month for more cash  In January  it has none at all to sell  possibly for the first time  In August  it suspended a planned refinery upgrade and in September  it delayed delivery of two ships it had ordered from South Korea s Daewoo Shipbuilding   Marine Engineering  adding significantly to that firm s financial stress   It s right across the value chain   IHS analyst Roderick Bruce said   They ve got money for certain things  clearly not for others   A source close to Sonangol defended the company s moves and said it was prudent to delay delivery of the vessels  postpone the refinery upgrade and comb carefully through every single payment to ensure money is spent properly   But the government s own financial fate  which is closely entwined with Sonangol  underscores the rough road ahead  The IMF expects Angola s public debt to exceed 70 percent of gross domestic product  GDP  by the end of the year  despite government spending cuts   Sonangol has had problems accessing cash  but this is also partly due to a liquidity issue more generally in Angola  tied to access to dollars in particular   said Alex Vines  head of the Africa program at Chatham House   Add to that bureaucracy and significant debts and the delays that have been reported   Still  Vines and others said Sonangol s current struggles will not deter oil majors  Analysts and oil industry figures also believe that dos Santos may be the best hope to fix things   The scale of the Sonangol crisis convinced the presidency that deep structural reform was necessary   Vines said  
 Only somebody with full political backing such as Isabel dos Santos could ever have a chance at delivering the type of the reforms that are needed  ",2016-11-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/exclusive:-sonangol-delays-payments-as-it-battles-to-reform-443243,443243

Safe havens are back in favor as the yen climbed  gold rose for a second day and bonds were junkier as yields fall  Additionally oil slips further as it faces a bear market 
Nevertheless  Asian stocks managed to climb  led by Australia s rebound  after its worst fall since President Donald Trump s election victory when uncertainty of what would happen in the markets was high on November 9th  the tech sector s recovery after last week s sell off  and Chinese stocks extending their gains 
The market narrative on WTI is that the rising US output with no end in sight will undermine any OPEC NOPEC cuts in their attempt to stabilize oil s price and return the supply demand dynamic into balance 
Are China s mainland shares now safer for investors 

Chinese shares advanced for a second day  after MSCI decided to include domestic equities in its indexes for the first time  after three previous rejections 
While the Financial Times View asserts that  China s stock market is given a test  not a pass   in which the country will have to convince the world that it s serious about having a free market  others view it as a nod of approval and a symbolic gesture of what s to come  Investors can t seem to make up their minds about which argument to buy  as the CSI 300  the top 300 stocks traded on both the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges  rose up 0 5  to its highest level since December 2015  but has since been fluctuating below and above yesterday s close 
The Shanghai Composite reached its highest level since April 19  but retreated below yesterday s level at closing 

As opposed to Asian Pacific stocks  all major European indices the Stoxx Europe 600  German Euro Stoxx 50  DAX  CAC 40  opened lower today and extended their declines for a third day  The UK s FTSE 100 opened higher  but like its European counterparts  also fell 
The NASDAQ 100 Futures  the index which led the recent  sharp  equity declines  attempted to rise but retreated to below yesterday s closing 
The Dow Jones 30 Futures  the only index to reach an all new high on Tuesday  rose yesterday but ended flat 
The S P 500 Futures also attempted to climb  but slid below yesterday s closing price  it s now prone but fluctuating 
It seems that the tech rebound which led to a rise in global markets may have finally had its last stand this morning in Asia

192996,414512,CVX,The Energy Report  Tropical Storms And Hoarding Oil,opinion,"Meltdown Madness 
Crude oil prices have plunged far below what the oil fundamentals might suggest and even hardened bears are starting to question this selling madness  The price drops and current levels will destroy the myth that U S  oil production will rise regardless of the price and we are already seeing downgrades of those energy stocks across the sector  Downgrades are coming fast and furiously 
Barron s reported that Seaport Global Securities downgraded 51 energy related stocks in the exploration and production arena  as well as offshore space  Morgan Stanley also reportedly lowered its outlook for the oil services industry to  in line   citing increasing odds of a bearish outlook that sees a 30  50  downside to historical valuation support  Macquarie Energy downgraded Chesapeake  BP  LON BP   Chevron  NYSE CVX   Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  saying that global oil majors will slip back into deficits and suffer additional painful cost reductions 
I think you get the picture  This sell off will have choking ramifications on future oil production at a time when we are seeing oil inventories start to fall  While global data is hard to decipher  we do know that the U S  does see another drop in U S  crude supply adding to the biggest trend in falling supplies in our history 
Sure  we are coming off extremely high levels of supply to begin with but the trend of falling supply in the U S  is not an argument  Crude inventories fell by 2 5 million barrels more than the 2 1 million barrels decrease that was expected  Even gasoline stocks fell by 578 000 barrels at a time when they normally rise and at a time when refiners are cranking out near record amounts of the stuff 
What is an argument is what does this mean for our future  Talk of oil floating in storage is making the rounds again and talk that shale output will reach 10 million barrels a day will be put to the test  Unhedged shale producers better hope that their line of cash does not dry up and hope the money men have the vision to see through this epic price collapse 
Yet with the rash of downgrades  the sense may just be that they would be throwing good morning after bad  Shale producers will stop adding rigs and production  that while we saw at new highs yesterday  should start to moderate and fall back  Prices need to bounce back quickly or we ll see another round of energy job cuts as well as Cap X cuts across the sector  Price collapses like we have seen too often will make it harder and harder for many oil companies to raise capital 
In the meantime  Tropical Storm Cindy is shutting down gulf oil production  The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement  BSEE  says that as of yesterday  based on data from offshore operator reports submitted as of 11 30 CDT  personnel have been evacuated from a total of 40 production platforms  5 43  percent of the 737 manned platforms in the Gulf of Mexico  Production platforms are the structures located offshore from which oil and natural gas are produced  Unlike drilling rigs  which typically move from location to location  production facilities remain in the same location throughout a project s duration  Personnel have been evacuated from one rig  non dynamically positioned  DP  rig   equivalent to 6 67  percent of the 15 rigs of this type currently operating in the Gulf  Rigs can include several types of offshore drilling facilities including jackup rigs  platform rigs  all submersibles and moored semi submersibles  There will be another update later today 
Sharp sell offs have ramifications  The last time we sold off like this in early May we snapped back  Even as the mood is negative  we expect a similar snap back  While U S  output did rise by 20 000 barrels a day last week to 9 35 million barrels a day  the increase for the month is still below what was expected  We really think that this selloff is being driven by emotion rather than fact and we should see a snap back  Great time to buy some cheap calls 
Natural gas has been pressured by cool weather forecasts but production shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico is going to raise real concerns about meeting demand and building storage when temperatures go back to normal  You want to buy calls when the market looks this bad  As the old saying goes  the market always looks worst at its bottom ",2017-06-22,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-06-22-17-200196856,200196856
192997,414513,CVX,Chart Of The Day  Trading Exxon Mobil s Slump,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen 
The S P 500 fell 0 1 percent on Wednesday  with Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  caught in the oil tsunami that s drowning the markets  Supply gluts and attendant price slides in crude have become cement shoes for the energy behemoths  weighing on shares and pulling them lower 
Let s look at the fundamentals of Exxon Mobil 

The stock price is near its lowest level of the year  trading at  104 19  That s only 1 3 percent from the lowest close of the year on June 2 and less than 2 percent from the low of the year  at 102 55  on June 7 
The stock is undervalued  with a price earnings to growth ratio of less than 1 
Diversification reduces exposure to oil   While its primary income has been from upstream projects searching and drilling for crude oil the company s integrated business model includes downstream projects   refining crude oil   which affords the company exposure to the commodity beyond exploration and extraction  Thanks to hedging  Exxon Mobil outperformed other oil companies when oil crashed 75  between June 2014 and February 2016 

However  that business model didn t seem to set it apart from other oil companies yesterday  when it led the decline of the S P 500 
Though the equity didn t suffer as much during the initial oil collapse  currently it appears to be taking the brunt of the stress to oil markets  As well  when oil s price tumbled the first time  investors couldn t conceive of oil which was above  150 before the 2008 crash and above  107 during June 2014  imploding all the way down to  26  losing 75  of its value  But this time  investors are wary 
With a never ending  rising US oil supply  as US shale companies reportedly hedged their bets  guaranteeing  50 a barrel  irrespective of oil market price  investors are remembering 2015 
XOM Technicals

Here s what Exxon Mobil s technicals look like 
After reaching the  79 26 low of the year on June 2  dropping nearly 15  since the height of  93 22 on December 13  it looked like the trading pattern was forming a base 
On June 12 though  the stock leaped on a gap  creating an upside breakout of the base  when investors shifted investments out of tech growth stocks and into energy value stocks  The dramatic price move was supported by an upside break in momentum  as was confirmed by a breakout of the Relative Strength Index 
Nevertheless  it couldn t maintain its gains  and closed back under the top of the base  creating a bearish shooting star  By June 14 the stock had slipped to  81 56  at which time the Relative Strength Index completed a double top and also fell back into the congestion of the base  making the failure of the price breakout all the more glaring 
Still  the stock gave the breakout another go  and although it didn t surpass the shooting star s resistance  it at least closed above the top of the base  However  and yet again  it couldn t maintain its gains  falling over the next three days  until yesterday  to a close of  81 44  once again  confirming and reinforcing the shooting star s resistance and the leading signal of the Relative Strength Index 
The initial breakout attempt on June 12 leaped over the 50 and 100 dma  Even after the shooting star was formed and the price fell  it remained above them  Yesterday though  it fell back beneath them  while the 200 dma  red  remained above the base the entire time  now at  84 47  as if guarding the exit 
The one thing bulls have going for them now is Tuesday s trading pattern  which formed a bullish hammer  and is meant to provide support  Yesterday s trading  despite falling lower on an intra day basis  closed 3 cents above the hammer s support 
Trading Exxon Mobil
Conservative traders would wait on a short for either a correction to the resistance of the shooting star  confirming the resistance of the pattern  at  83 69  or for a break of Tuesday s hammer at  81 41  with a close on a meaningful filter  Should they wait for the corrections  traders could place the range between the resistance of the shooting star  the high of  83 69 and the support of the hammer at the low of  81 41 
Moderate traders would wait for a correction of yesterday s high at  82 57 or a close beneath the hammer 
Aggressive Traders would short now 
Money Management  Stop losses are to be placed according to the trader s account  at the levels specified with regards to support and resistance 
The  80 price level would likely provide a staunch support  and the June 2 low of  79 26 will be crucial for the stock s future  It would be between continuing the base within a reversal pattern and between catapulting the price to deeper depths ",2017-06-22,Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chart-of-the-day:-200196832,200196832

192999,414515,CVX,Chevron sees big profits in California despite regulations,news,"By Ernest Scheyder RICHMOND  Calif   Reuters    The land of liberal politics  electric cars and strict pollution controls might seem like an odd place to drop  1 billion into a 115 year old oil refinery   Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX  sees an entirely different landscape in California  a uniquely isolated market  closed to new competitors  where the price of gasoline can skyrocket when even one refinery goes down  The company plans to make a fortune here   in part from the expected misfortunes of rival refineries in the state  who after Chevron s renovations will have older technologies and potentially more frequent outages   The  1 billion investment will go into Chevron s refinery in Richmond  an industrial city northeast of San Francisco  Analysts said the renovations  started this summer and scheduled for completion by 2019  will likely make the plant more reliable than the 13 other refineries operating in a state with high and volatile gasoline prices  That means Chevron may be well positioned to profit from rivals  breakdowns  such as the February 2015 explosion at Exxon  NYSE XOM  Mobil s refinery in Torrance  The outage kept the refinery from returning to full capacity for more than a year and pushed state gasoline prices to an 18 month high  boosting margins for other state refineries  Outages aside  Chevron also stands to profit from serving the California gasoline market  the world s third largest  behind only the rest of the United States and China   Californians like clean air  and they like helping the environment   said Dave Hackett  a refinery analyst at Stillwater Associates   But at the end of the day  they re not going to give up their cars   For a graphic showing surging gasoline use in California  see   The state s thicket of fossil fuel regulations has an upside for companies that can navigate it   most notably  a near certainty that no new competitors will open in California  which had more than twice as many refineries in the mid 1980s   That trend may continue  Among the state s ambitious clean air goals is Governor Jerry Brown s target of generating half of California s power from renewable sources by 2030   INSULATED MARKET  California is also the nation s largest auto market and an island of expensive retail gasoline  California s pump prices are the highest in the contiguous United States because the state requires a one off blend to curb smog  which few refineries produce  Gasoline refined in nearby Washington state  for instance  can t be sold in California  Transportation costs also drive up gas prices  With no gasoline pipelines flowing into the state  fuel must be shipped by truck or boat   To be a refiner in California is difficult and tough  but it can also be lucrative   said John Auers  a refinery industry consultant with Turner Mason   It s an insulated market  and that protects your margins   Amid the high prices  California Attorney General Kamala Harris launched a probe earlier this year into whether Chevron and other state refiners have manipulated gasoline prices  The companies deny the charges  Investigators are specifically examining price hikes during periods of refinery outages  according to a subpoena from Harris  who is also a U S  Senate candidate   Chevron has said it will cooperate with the investigation  Chevron s Richmond refinery is the state s largest producer of jet fuel  supplying San Francisco s airport at a time when air travel demand continues to soar    Clearly  we see continued opportunity within California   said Joe Naylor  Chevron s vice president for policy  government and public affairs   The refinery renovation  he said   is a sign that we remain committed to being in California as long as the business environment remains conducive to us    Chevron declined to detail expected margins for the Richmond plant  but said it expects to recoup its investment  BICYCLES IN BEVERLY HILLS  Brown signed a law two months ago that aims to cut California s greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030  The bill was unpopular among the state s oil companies who claimed it would push up consumer gas prices  which already average 57 cents more per gallon than the U S   according to AAA  a nonprofit association of U S  travel clubs  Chevron s refinery  however  will meet or exceed California s emissions  safety and other environmental standards  the company said  Chevron is replacing its refinery s antiquated hydrogen plant   a crucial component for a refinery   and installing new hydrogen purifying equipment and building a new cogeneration power plant  which uses heat from the refining process to generate electricity  lowering Chevron s power costs  In Richmond  a city of roughly 100 000 that was a major shipbuilding port during World War Two  residents who had fought Chevron s Richmond expansion efforts  Environmental groups cited a refinery fire in 2012 at the Richmond plant in arguing that Chevron cannot safely operate the plant in a densely populated region  Chevron rejects that criticism   If we look at the operation of our facilities around the world  I would stack our record up against anybody   said Naylor  the Chevron executive  California s political and regulatory environment has driven other oil giants away from the state  Exxon sold its Torrance refinery   its only California refinery   to PBF Energy last summer for  537 million  saying the sale was part of a  strategic assessment of the site and how it fits with our refining portfolio    Oil producer Occidental Petroleum Corp fled California in 2014 for Texas  well known for its business friendly policies   Maybe the people in Beverly Hills should park their Rolls Royces and drive bicycles going forward   Steve Chazen  then CEO of Oxy said in early 2014 when detailing the company s exit from the state and describing his frustration with its energy regulations   But while others may leave  Chevron s rival California refiners see opportunity as well   Tom O Malley  CEO of PBF Energy  called California  a very attractive market   and noted the company bought Exxon s Torrance refinery  at a very attractive purchase price   Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   which owns two California refineries  told investors earlier this year that demand in California for gasoline continues to rise

193005,414521,CVX,4 Trade Ideas For A Reversal In Chevron  Bonus Idea,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Chevron  NYSE CVX   stock price rose out of consolidation around  100 at the beginning of November  prior to the election  It continued higher to a top in December and paused into year end  With the change in the calendar the stock started lower  It gapped down at the end of January and then paused again until a pronounced move lower began in March  The fall turned into a consolidation in April with an eventual bottom near a 78 6  retracement of the up leg at the start of June 
The price broke above consolidation 2 weeks ago and the quickly fell back  This time it found support at the 50 day SMA  a higher low  and reversed back higher  It ended the week Friday at the cross of the 100 and 200 day SMA s  above the consolidation zone and at the earlier break out high  The strong candle supports more upside and so does the RSI rising in the bullish zone and the MACD crossed up  positive and rising  Even the Bollinger Bands  are opening higher to allow a run higher 
The Measured Move gives a short term target to 111 80 on this leg  There is resistance at 108 50 and 109 60 followed by 111 and 114 before 115 and a gap fill to 116 50 then the prior top at 119  Support lower comes at 107 40 and 106 then 104 and 102 70 and 100  Short interest is low at 1 2  and the company is expected to report earnings next July 28th 
The options chain expiring this week shows strong open interest on the call side at both the 108 and 110 strikes  On the put side the biggest is at 104 below  In the July monthly options the biggest open interest is at the 110 call strike and both the 105 and 110 put strikes  For the July 28th expiry there is little open interest but the biggest above at 111 and 112 on the call side  August open interest is bigger on the call side and focused at 105 and 110 with smaller put open interest at 100 and 105 
Chevron  Ticker   CVX
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 108 50 with a stop at 106 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 108 50 and add a July 28 Expiry 108 103 Put Spread   1 57  for protection  selling the September 115 Calls  77 cents  to lower the cost

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which saw with Options Expiration and the June FOMC meeting in the rear view mirror  equities looking to emerge on the other side mainly unscathed  There is consolidation in the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  and iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  but perhaps more damage in the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue to pullback while Crude Oil trends lower  The US Dollar Index has moved to consolidation in its pullback while US Treasuries are biased to continue higher  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the upside with the Chinese market drifting up  while Emerging Markets consolidate in their longer trend up 
Volatility looks to remain at abnormally low levels keeping a breeze at the backs of equities  Their charts show continued strength in all 3 Index ETF s on the longer timeframe but consolidation in the SPY and pullbacks in the IWM and QQQ on the shorter timeframe  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

193025,414541,CVX,Cheap Oil And The Summer Driving Season,opinion,"OPEC and Company 
OPEC is getting ready to have a big party in Vienna as they hammer out an extension of the current OPEC agreement on limiting oil production  While there has been some last minute negotiating by some players like Iraq  it is likely the deal will be extended by nine months 
The Wall Street Journal is reporting the   Ecuadorean Energy Minister Carlos Perez said most OPEC members support a nine month extension of cuts at current levels of about 1 8 million barrels a day   Russia  the largest of the non OPEC producers in the agreement  has said it supports a nine month extension  One country they do not have to worry about when it comes to compliance and that is Venezuela  Venezuela pumped 2 02 million barrels a day in April  a 310 000 barrel a day decline from a year earlier and the steepest drop among OPEC countries  So now the question becomes whether or not that is going to be enough to get the global market in balance  The answer is yes 
We all know the Saudis have a lot riding on a higher oil price because of the pending initial public offering of 5  of the stock of the state owned Saudi Aramco next year but there is more behind this cut  New fears about so called  peak oil  demands are scaring the Saudis into trying to modernize their economy that is still mainly dependent on oil  While the fears of peak oil demand are probably more real than actual peak oil production  the fears are being overstated and should lead to underinvestment in oil because oil producers and energy companies are taking the threat seriously 
While global oil demand continues to set records  there are fears that could change in a decade  The advent of reliable electric cars and breakthroughs on fuel efficacy  it clouds the future oil demand outlook  The Wall Street Journal reported that forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades  The Paris based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow  albeit slowly  past 2040  And the two biggest U S  oil companies  Exxon Mobil Corp  NYSE XOM   and Chevron Corp   NYSE CVX   say peak demand isn t in sight  Yet companies in the EU like Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  PLC and Norway s Statoil  OL STL  SA are placing bigger bets on natural gas and renewables  including wind and solar to diversify away from oil 
This comes after global investment over the last few years in energy fell by a record  mainly due to falling prices but also do to fear about the future of energy  The current stubborn glut of supply and talk that demand could dry up could lead to significant underinvestment to meet demand  peaking or not  that will grow faster than production for the next ten years 
While countries like India and China may look to an electric car future  the reality is they will also have to invest in massive electric grid capacity to charge all those electric cars  In the meantime  a false sense of security in the U S  will cause a late year oil price spike 
Speaking of China  a downgrade has miners worried  Moody s Investors Service downgraded China s credit ratings the first time since 1989  Moody s warns that the financial strength of China s economy will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise 
My buddies at Gas Buddy are ready for the summer driving season  checking out gas prices wherever they can find them  They are reporting that more Americans are planning to hit the road this summer compared to 2016  according to their annual Summer Travel Study  They say that more than 82 percent of their people surveyed said they will take a road trip this summer  a 7 percent increase from last year and a 9 percent increase compared to 2015  with a majority  70 percent  planning to take at least two trips 
Gas Buddy goes on to say that   A key finding behind the surge in travel is a feat never before seen  the national average gasoline price today is nearly the same  up 1 5 cents  as it was to start the year   2 34   compared to the average increase of 47 cents  and also nearly the same as Memorial Day last year   2 33   The stability at the pump is likely sparking optimism for the upcoming summer driving season as motorists have not been hit hard by skyrocketing gas prices during the spring

193027,414543,CVX,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Ensco Snaps Up Atwood  Dakota Access Pipeline In Service,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices dropped to the lowest close since May 10 amid the U S  climate pact withdrawal  while a bearish build created selling pressure on natural gas futures and pushed the commodity below the psychological  3 per MMBtu mark 
On the news front  London based offshore driller Ensco plc   NYSE ESV   is set to buy U S  rival Atwood Oceanics Inc    NYSE ATW   in an all stock transaction worth some  839 million  while Energy Transfer Partners L P    NYSE ETP   sponsored  3 8 billion controversial Dakota Access Pipeline began commercial operations on Jun 1 
Overall  it was another dismal week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures fell 4 3  to close at  47 66 per barrel  while natural gas prices lost 9 4  to  2 999 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here    
Oil prices took a tumble to end Friday at a more than 3 week low  The Trump administration s decision to opt out of the Paris climate change accord caused bulk of the profit taking as this could encourage more oil drilling in the U S   possibly intensifying the global supply glut  Investors also fretted over the continued rise in domestic production thanks to soaring shale output 
These narratives more than offset EIA s bullish storage report  which showed that crude stockpiles declined for the eighth straight week  continuing to drag down the overall surplus  Moreover  gasoline inventories dropped sharply ahead of the start to the summer driving season and refiners processed a record amount of crude 
Meanwhile  natural gas fared worse and turned sharply lower following a larger than expected storage build  The commodity was also undone by the absence of any heat waves to spur cooling demand for the fuel 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Oil and natural gas driller Ensco plc revealed its plan to acquire smaller rival Atwood Oceanics Inc  in an all stock deal worth  839 million  whetting investors  appetite for consolidation in the struggling sector As per the deal  Atwood shareholders would receive 1 60 shares of Ensco common stock for each share they hold  At Atwood s Friday s closing stock price of  8 08  the deal values the company s shares at 33  premium  The deal has been unanimously okayed by both companies  boards but is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals Ensco and Atwood expect to close the transaction sometime in the third quarter of 2017  The current stockholders of Ensco will own approximately 69  of the combined company  with Atwood shareholders owning the rest  Following the announcement  Atwood stock surged 24   while shares of London based Ensco fell about 5  The transaction will meaningfully diversify Ensco s offerings of products and services  The combined group will have a market capitalization of about  7 billion  supplying offshore drilling rigs across varying water depths spread over six continents to the world s largest energy groups  Ensco  one of the strongest players in the oil drilling sector  will get access to Atwood s six ultra deepwater floaters  including four drillship and five high specification jackups

Protesters also continued to block the entrance to a  Chevron   NYSE CVX  oil depot in the restive southern region for a third day 
On Wednesday  a previously unknown group called Delta Greenland Justice Mandate said it had attacked a crude pipeline belonging to state oil firm NNPC and local firm Shoreline Natural Resources in Urhobo in Delta state 
 It is true but I don t have details yet   said Collins Edema  a youth leader  He said the pipeline was on fire  but Reuters was unable to confirm this and it was not immediately possible to get more details 
He also said protesters  mostly unemployed youths  were continuing a demonstration started on Tuesday at the gate of a Chevron oil depot to demand jobs and housing  claiming the facility had destroyed their settlement 
 Our protest is going on peacefully today on Thursday  Our community workers inside the tank farm have joined the protest as we speak   Edema said 
 Nobody is going in and out of the facility since we ve started but Chevron has airlifted their senior staff from there   he said  a claim Reuters could not verify 
Chevron confirmed a protest had taken place but did not say whether oil production had been affected 
Edema said the protesters might shut down Chevron s crude flow in Abiteye  Jones Creek and other operations in the area if the company does not agree to their demands

193029,414545,CVX,Lack of investment  payment delays hamper Venezuela oil output,news,"By Marianna Parraga CARACAS  Reuters    Venezuela  which holds the world s largest crude reserves  is on track to suffer its steepest annual oil output drop in 14 years as it suffers the effects of an economic crisis and years of under investment and mismanagement  according to data seen by Reuters and interviews with company sources and workers  The state run oil company  Petroleos de Venezuela  PDVSA   is struggling to stem a production decline that has accelerated this year as a result of payment delays to suppliers  lack of investment in equipment  and poor planning in the country s vast oil fields  In the 12 months to June  Venezuela s crude output fell 9 percent to 2 36 million barrels per day  bpd   while the Organization of Petroleum Exploration Countries  OPEC  has boosted its output by 4 percent  according to the group s official figures   Venezuela s oil minister and PDVSA president  Eulogio Del Pino  last month confirmed a 220 000 barrel per day production decline    around 8 percent    so far this year compared with 2015  However  he said the  circumstantial fall  had been  contained   The Oil Ministry later said the country s output rebounded in July to 2 54 million bpd  without giving comparative figures  The data have not yet been reported to OPEC  PDVSA s statistics have been a matter of debate for years  Internal trade and supply data seen by Reuters show that PDVSA s crude exports  which account for 94 percent of the country s hard currency income  fell to 1 19 million bpd in July  excluding independent sales made by its joint ventures  PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment on its sales to customers  Several PDVSA workers and local union members  in interviews with Reuters  said that an increase in equipment theft  maintenance delays  low salaries  and what they called a sense of  abandonment  of some oilfields are continuing to hit production    I have never seen so much inefficiency in my 28 years in the oil industry   said a worker of a drilling firm hired by Petroboscan  a project with participation of U S   Chevron   NYSE CVX  that is one of more than 40 joint ventures by PDVSA and foreign firms   Del Pino told local media last month that power outages and limited upgrading capacity to convert Venezuela s extra heavy oil into exportable crude has hampered production  It has forced PDVSA to import some 95 000 bpd of heavy naphtha and light crude to dilute its oil  Reuters trade flows data says  These problems  occurring while oil services providers reduce operations in Venezuela  have analysts forecasting that production will not recover in the second half of the year  falling instead to its lowest level since a strike that brought output down to an average of 2 56 million bpd in 2003  Venezuela s active rig count  a good indication of future production  fell to 49 in July according to Baker Hughes  the lowest since the end of 2011  U S  based oil servicing giant Schlumberger noted a  significant reduction of operations  in Venezuela in its most recent earning release and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  said it is operating on fewer active rigs in Latin America  including Venezuela  PDVSA has said there are ongoing talks to solve payment issues with many companies  including those  Energy consulting firm IPD Latin America in May predicted that Venezuela s crude output will average 2 35 million bpd in 2016  a 400 000 barrel per day decline from last year  Medley Global Advisors  meanwhile  expects an average decline of 250 000 to 300 000 bpd  said analyst Luisa Palacios  who believes any rebound will not last   They achieve a temporary relief  but the declining trend continues   she said  INACTIVE RIGS  LOST EQUIPMENT The cutbacks in oil services have particularly afflicted Venezuela s second largest producing region  Norte de Monagas  where companies have been halting operations and laying workers off  according to union representatives   There are many inactive rigs here in Monagas   said Luis Hernandez  a local union representative   Some 60 workers are laid off for every halted rig  Some companies say PDVSA owes them money  there are also halted rigs due to lack of spare parts   Being a technically challenging area  Norte de Monagas s output has declined faster than the country average in recent years  particularly affecting PDVSA s output of medium and light crudes used to dilute its extra heavy oil and creating a growing need for imports at a time when dollars are scarce   Monagas  confined reservoirs need a specific pressure to properly work  If natural gas is not injected correctly  the output falls   explained a former executive of PDVSA s exploration and production department  who did not want to be identified  After Venezuela in 2009 nationalized oil services firms  including Venezuelan assets owned by Williams Companies  NYSE WMB   PDVSA has faced problems maintaining output levels at areas that need secondary recovery techniques such as water  gas and vapor injections into reservoirs  Basic maintenance goes undone at many fields  workers say   It s painful to see how the equipment is lost deep in the weeds  including flow stations and jack pumps   the worker from the drilling company said  The fall in output volume  coupled with the drop in global oil prices  has forced the government of President Nicolas Maduro to choose between paying external debt or supplying the dollars needed to sustain imports of basic goods  
 PDVSA  who has no money leftover at all  now needs even more investment in exploration and production than in the previous decade to see its output to revive  At this price level  that is not going to happen   the former PDVSA executive said ",2016-08-15,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/lack-of-investment,-payment-delays-hamper-venezuela-oil-output-420314",420314
193030,414546,CVX,Anger in the Delta keeps oil majors quiet   and Nigeria s crude offline,news,"By Libby George and Ulf Laessing
LONDON LAGOS  Reuters    Oil companies and even Nigerian officials are losing faith in a deal anytime soon with militants who have slashed the nation s oil output  casting doubt on a production recovery in what is typically Africa s largest oil exporter 
In the six months since the first major attack on Nigeria s oil   a sophisticated bombing of the subsea Forcados pipeline   dozens of attacks have pushed outages to more than 700 000 barrels per day  bpd   the highest in seven years 
Talk in the country has shifted from ceasefire optimism  and oil companies  assurances that repairs were underway  to hedged comments from the government and radio silence from oil majors  
 People are giving up in the short term   one oil industry source told Reuters of a resumption in exports of key Nigerian grades such as Forcados or Qua Iboe  adding that you  can t get anything  out of the majors  including Shell  LON RDSa    Chevron   NYSE CVX   ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  or  ENI   MI ENI   about when the oil might come back 
Shell declined to comment  while the other companies did not immediately responded to a request for comment 
In June  Nigerian government officials said privately it had a ceasefire with militants  But pessimism crept in  with even Oil Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu telling journalists this week  we are talking but  it  is not an easy thing   and  we need a ceasefire    a contrast to the belief that a ceasefire was underway 
The problems reflect deep seated issues in the Niger Delta  which produces the bulk of oil but whose local communities complain of pollution  a lack of opportunities and what they say is an insufficient share of petro dollars  These problems are compounded by an economic crisis and a government battle with Boko Haram militants in the north 
 This is likely the beginning   said Elizabeth Donnelly  deputy head and research fellow of London think tank Chatham House s Africa Programme said of the unrest  adding that  the resolution that will come will not come quickly  
The government this month resumed cash payments to militant groups that it stopped in February  just before the launch of the worst violence since the payments began under a 2009 amnesty  But attacks continued anyway 
A group calling itself the Niger Delta Avengers claimed the bulk of them  announcing strikes on Twitter even before oil majors themselves knew their remote pipelines had been hit  Twitter shut the group s account  but sources said the Avengers have extensive knowledge of oil sites  and follow the media closely to track companies  actions  
 With the Avengers  you don t want to say  we ll be back up next Wednesday   because then you ll get a bomb next Tuesday   one oil executive said   They have to be careful  
But new groups  such as the self styled  Revolution Alliance   which claimed an attack on a Shell owned oil line  loom  while non violent local protests have also exacted a toll 
Collings Edema  a local youth leader of the Itsekiri group that has blocked access to Chevron s Escravos tank farm for almost two weeks  said  the oil companies have not shown any sign that they are ready to improve our lives  
Experts warned that as long as people are unhappy  militants and their targets could evolve in unpredictable ways 
 This is also about frustrations of younger people coming up in the Niger Delta and needs not having been addressed   Donnelly said   This isn t just about militancy  though the political and economic context feeds it  
Kachikwu told journalists this week that it was too early to say when Nigeria could increase output due to security concerns 
But the Avengers call the country a  failed state   while youth groups in the region remain deeply skeptical of the oil industry 

 From the situation on the ground I do not think the oil companies are ready to improve the lives of people of the Niger Delta region   said Eric Omare  spokesman for the Ijaw Youth Council  the youth body of biggest ethnic group in Delta   The present structure of Nigeria does not encourage that  ",2016-08-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/anger-in-the-delta-keeps-oil-majors-quiet---and-nigeria's-crude-offline-421484,421484
193031,414547,CVX,Chevron wins dismissal of claims of poor savings plan oversight,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    A U S  judge has dismissed a lawsuit by  Chevron  Corp  N CVX  workers who said the oil company breached its fiduciary duties by putting costly and poorly performing investment options in a  19 billion employee savings plan 
In a decision on Monday  Chief Judge Phyllis Hamilton of the U S  District Court in Oakland  California  wrote that the workers failed to raise a  plausible inference  of wrongdoing 
Hamilton gave the plaintiffs until Sept  30 to file an amended complaint 
 The mere fact that the fund s price dropped is not sufficient to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty   she wrote 
The judge also said it was acceptable for the plan to offer a money market fund rather than a higher return stable value fund for plan participants seeking to preserve capital 
Neither Jerome Schlichter  whose firm represents the plaintiffs  nor a spokesman for San Ramon  California based Chevron immediately commented 
Schlichter s St  Louis firm has pursued many lawsuits accusing companies of mismanaging 401 k  and other retirement plans  This month it also brought similar claims against a number of major universities

193040,414556,CVX,After Last Week s Oil Plunge  Can Prices Recover ,opinion,"When oil futures dropped 5  last Thursday  analysts were quick to blame OPEC for production cuts that have  over the past four months  failed to resolve the oil glut  But the real culprits are as follows 
1  As a result of the OPEC and non OPEC production cuts deal  financial institutions and hedge funds  that global crude oil inventories would draw down more quickly than they have  When their predictions were wrong  they were disillusioned  leading to a drop in oil prices 
2  Shale oil production did not immediately rebound when the OPEC non OPEC production cuts began  However  over the past two months  more DUCs  drilled uncompleted wells  were quickly completed and put into production in the more   This production jump is showing up now and putting downward pressure on the oil market  The shale oil industry currently has more potential to increase production than the conventional oil industry  but it will soon face the weight of increased service and production costs 
3  Gasoline demand in the U S  has not risen as much as is  for this time of year  According to the EIA   is 250 000 bpd lower now than it was at this time last year  On the other hand  since oil prices fell last week  gasoline prices have   With the summer driving season approaching  U S  drivers may soon start filling up  If they do not  it will continue to depress oil prices 
4  Speculator panic resulted in 520 million barrels of crude oil options traded on Thursday  This was the third most ever  Over 7 000 contracts a minute were traded during a time of day when usually only a few hundred change hands  The  was amplified by speculators and helped exacerbate the sudden drop 
What now  All eyes are on OPEC and its non OPEC producing friends to shore up prices with talk of extending the production cut agreement for the rest of the year  In fact   is leading the jawboning with calls for extending the agreement beyond 2017  Since last week s sudden drop  oil prices have not rebounded  Instead  they have continued to bounce 
News at the end of April from the equity markets that the oil majors   including ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX    beat expected quarterly earnings was a false sign of success  Exxon recovered after  the previous quarter and Chevron has been helped by  less productive assets  Much of the profit jumps came from cost cutting and unloading assets  which could hurt oil companies in years to come and do not signal    a turn around in the oil market 
Key factors to look at include summer gasoline demand in the U S   summer electricity demand in the Persian Gulf  shale oil production costs  offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazilian pre salt regions  and most significantly  Venezuelan political unrest  These factors  more so than this month s OPEC meeting  could have the greatest impact on oil prices over the next six months ",2017-05-10,"Ellen R.

Top Research Reports for Today  Mo  CVX  KHC   TWX 

	The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s publication features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Chevron  NYSE           Altria  NYSE          Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ          and Time Warner  NYSE           These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today  You can see   

Chevron  started 2017 on a bullish note  It not only swung to a Q1 profit from a year ago loss  but results handily beat estimates on the back of rebounding commodity prices  lower expenses and an improved U S  refining environment  Following outperformance in 3 of the last 4 quarters  the stock has performed about in line with the Zacks Integrated Oil Industry over the past year  up about  7    but handily outperformed ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  which saw its stock go down  8 6  over the same time period  However  with oil testing the psychologically critical  50 threshold again  the near to medium term revenue outlook for Chevron   one of the most oil weighted majors   remains cloudy  Moreover  Chevron is still outspending its cash flow  making it dependent on asset sales  Hence  the Zacks analyst thinks investors should wait for a better entry point before buying shares in America s second largest oil company   You can         

Altria  shares have lagged the Zacks Tobacco industry in the year to date period  with the stock up  6 5  vs  the peer group s  15 8  gain  The company s weaker than expected Q1 quarterly results have added to its under performance  Altria  the U S  based entity whose international sibling is Phillips Morris International  PM   is operating in a mature and heavily regulated market that has been undergoing consistent volume declines over the last many years  But the strength of Marlboro brand and a solid portfolio or low risk smokeless tobacco products positions it to profitably navigate this market  Further  the recent takeover of SABMiller  LON SAB  by Anheuser Busch InBev s helped Altria maximize the value of its SABMiller investment  An attractive dividend  currently yielding 3 4   is a notable part of this story as well   You can         

Kraft Heinz shares remained relatively subdued this year  gaining only  3 4  year to date  Kraft Heinz s first quarter earnings and revenues fell short of expectations  Notably  the company s sales have now declined in four of the past five quarters  The Zacks analyst stresses that Kraft Heinz has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food  That said  strong brand portfolio  cost savings initiatives  innovation and marketing efforts raise growth prospects for the company   You can         

Time Warner  share have handily outperformed the broader market as well as the media space  the stock is up more than  35 4  over the last one year  on greater appreciation for the company s proactive strategic initiatives in response to the evolving media landscape  This trend is also borne out by its positive earnings surprise streak for more than 20 straight quarters  Investments in video content and technology continued to show results  Further  Time Warner s significant international presence has helped broaden client base and product portfolio  Additionally  investments in programming  production and marketing  along with focus on operating and capital efficiencies augur well  However  decline in overall advertising spending and currency headwinds may adversely impact performance  On the other hand  AT T  NYSE T  has agreed to acquire Time Warner in an  85 4 billion deal  which is expected to be concluded by the end of the year   You can

193052,414568,CVX,Shale Cost Is Rising ,opinion,"Oil rig counts are rising but so are costs  Crude oil prices are modestly lower on weak Chinese PMI data and a rising rig count but the reality of the limitation of shale may start to become painfully obvious  While the number of active oil rigs increased for the 15th week in a row by 9 rigs  the cost of those wells increased by 7 percent between November and March according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  That is the first significant increase in drilling costs in three years and that should continue to rise  With the rapid increase in drilling rigs  oil service and labor costs will go higher 
As OPEC continues to remove production from the global market  the increase in shale production  despite its best efforts  will not and cannot fill that void  Recent increases in efficiencies of shale rigs are being offset by the high cost of labor  rising oil service costs as well as the steep shale oil decline rate  Wood Mackenzie says that project and service cost will rise by 15 and 40 percent 
Big oil s earnings have done well by cutting costs and moving production as they look to shore up profits at the expense of oil discoveries that have fallen to the lowest level in history  Big oil is back as Chevron  NYSE CVX  and Exxon  NYSE XOM  beat expectations but those profits came at the expense of future oil production  Chevron made  2 3 billion in the first quarter of this year  compared to a loss of  725 million in the same period in 2016  Its cash flow more than tripled to  3 9 billion  Exxon s profits more than doubled to  4 billion in the first quarter  year on year  Big oil has now embraced cheap shale for quick profit turnaround at the expense of long term sustainable projects that are needed to meet the growing demand curve that we will be seeing 
U S  production is up 327 000 barrels a day from last year and that is a small part of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  1 2 million barrels per day cut and does not even cover the 558 000 barrels per day non OPEC cut  On top of that  as drilling costs rise  the break even on shale projects may slow the amount of shale projects and may make some banks think twice about extending money to drillers that are pumping more oil but losing money on every barrel 
Looking ahead we should start to see large drawdown in U S  supply as the impact from traders dumping oil from floating storage and sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve start to subside  At that point  the market may wake up to the fact that we are entering a global supply deficit for the first time in over a decade and rising shale output is not going to be able to fill that void 
Oil drama on the high seas near Libya  Aljazeera reported that Libya s coastguard seized two foreign flagged tankers and detained their crews for allegedly smuggling oil after an hours long gun battle off the coast  The coastguard spotted the vessels on Thursday night about 2km off Sidi Said near Zuwara  a town on the coast west of Tripoli  authorities said   The Libyan coastguard boarded the two tankers  one flying the Ukrainian flag  the Ruta  and the other  the Stark  flying the Congolese flag   said General Ayoub Qassem   The coastguards had monitored them from afar and waited until Friday morning to act   he told AFP news agency on Sunday 
Natural gas is on the rise as warm temperatures and falling production is raising concerns about supply  Natural gas rigs did rise by 4 rigs but that is not enough to shake off growing supply fears  Andrew Weissman of ECB Analytics said that with the June contract climbing more than 15  after it hit bottom and a moderately bullish forecast shift over the weekend  natural gas may have established a near term low with the potential for further gains this week  Above normal temperatures along the Atlantic seaboard could boost early season cooling demand for Northeastern ISOs  pulling day ahead power prices higher as a result ",2017-05-01,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-05-01-17-200186268,200186268

193055,414571,CVX,Twin crises expose Angola s failure to kick its oil habit,news,"By Ed Cropley LUANDA  Reuters    A month ago  a 17 ton shipment of bananas left Angola for Portugal in what state media heralded as a  first symbolic batch  in the resurgence of a farming sector wiped out by civil war  But that war ended 14 years ago and since then Angola has overlooked agriculture  developing instead an addiction to oil income and the imports it buys  Now  with crude less than half its price of two years ago  the country appears to be grinding to a halt  Africa s top oil producer needs more than a container load of fruit to solve a financial and economic crisis   compounded by a public health crisis   that has laid bare the failings of the  diversification  mantra of Jose Eduardo dos Santos  its president for the last 37 years  Oil wealth turned Angola into sub Saharan Africa s third biggest economy and one of the continent s few  upper middle income  states  But beyond the high rises on the capital s Dubai style coastal promenade  the problems are plain to see  Cranes stand idle atop half finished concrete office blocks in Luanda while piles of rubbish lie uncollected in the streets  a result of municipal budget cuts imposed this year to try to balance the books  The squalor is a breeding ground for vermin  flies and disease  and health experts say it is no coincidence that a yellow fever epidemic that started in December in one of Luanda s vast slums has spread across the country and beyond  reaching even China   Luanda is dirty  disgusting   said 58 year old businessman Antonio Bobbe  edging past a vagrant rummaging through a mound of trash   The government doesn t do anything  There s no responsibility  You should see the rats  They re huge   On top of the filth  a shortage of hard currency makes doing business tough for anyone but the well connected   If you have friends  government friends  you can get dollars  If not  nothing   said Bobbe   We hope that the situation changes  but at the moment there s no light at the end of the tunnel    ANGOLA RISING  NO MORE Before independence from Portugal in 1974  Angola was a major exporter of fruit  coffee and sisal  Then two decades of conflict destroyed commercial agriculture and since peace returned in 2002 problems ranging from uncleared mines in sugar plantations to uprooted rural workers have frustrated efforts to revive it  While Angola has rebuilt an impressive infrastructure  getting any sort of productive industry off the ground has gone nowhere apart from the oil on which it relied to achieve breakneck economic growth  It now churns out 1 8 million barrels a day from its offshore fields and is China s leading crude supplier  But those petro dollars come at a price  Oil accounts for 40 percent of GDP  70 percent of government revenues and 95 percent of foreign exchange income  leaving the nation of 25 million people dangerously exposed to fluctuations in world oil markets  With crude languishing at  50 a barrel  down from over  100 in mid 2014  Angola is starved of dollars  Growth has slowed to 3 percent   almost a recession in local terms   while the national currency has collapsed and inflation in a country that imports almost everything hit an annual 29 percent in May  For dos Santos  a Soviet trained oil engineer regarded as the pillar of post war stability  the timing of the twin crises could not be worse  They have struck a year before an election and two years before what the 73 year old president has said will be his retirement   The fragilities of the post conflict state that dos Santos has built are being exposed   said Paula Roque  an Angola expert at Britain s Oxford University   That whole rhetoric of  Angola Rising  no longer holds    Desperate  the government swallowed its pride and sought help from the World Health Organization against yellow fever but last week the International Monetary Fund said Luanda had ended talks about a broad financial rescue package  The government has not commented and finance minister Armando Manuel did not respond to requests for an interview  GOLDEN GOOSE Besides yellow fever  few indicators are as telling as the kwanza currency  down more than 40 percent in the last year against the dollar at the official central bank rate  Available only to a lucky few individuals and firms  the rate is of little consequence to ordinary Angolans  who have to rely on a black market where the kwanza is worth as little as 570 to the dollar  less than a third its official value of 165   For people bringing in anything from the United States or South Africa it s very difficult   said 26 year old Nadio Medina  who used to import used cars from South Africa  Now he sells eggs wholesale to pavement burger stalls  In an unusually frank admission last month  dos Santos admitted that bloated state oil company Sonangol  the central pillar of the economy and the source of nearly all its dollars  had not paid a cent into state coffers since January   Our country lives upon imports   imports for food  for raw materials to national manufacturers  for industry  agriculture  construction   he said   We need to make other goods to export besides the oil  That is a strategic task   Yet looking past the rhetoric  the only thing likely to change is Sonangol  Last month  dos Santos made his 43 year old daughter Isabel chief executive  inviting cries of  supersonic nepotism  from anti graft website Maka Angola  a rare dissenting voice in one of Africa s most politically closed states  Last year  for instance  17 members of a Luanda book club were jailed for reading a volume described as a  blue print for non violent resistance to repressive regimes   Isabel dos Santos   said by Forbes magazine to be Africa s richest woman   insisted her appointment was everything to do with shaking up Sonangol and nothing to do with a dynastic dos Santos succession plan  as her father s opponents allege   It s not because of politics  I was brought into this project because of my experience from the private business sector   she told Reuters in an interview that laid out her central aim  to produce more oil for less money  Foreign oil firms  Chevron   NYSE CVX  and  BP   LON BP  applauded her plans that include having Boston Consulting Group and PriceWaterhouseCoopers as advisers and stripping out Sonangol s real estate  banking and aviation units to focus on oil  To many  the overhaul is the clearest sign yet that President dos Santos really is preparing for retirement but not necessarily to make way for his daughter

193057,414573,CVX,Exclusive  Chevron s giant Australia LNG plant facing union calls for safety checks,news,"By Sonali Paul  Oleg Vukmanovic and Ron Bousso
MELBOURNE MILAN LONDON    Reuters    Forced to shut its  54 billion Gorgon liquefied natural gas  LNG  export plant twice in its first five months   Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX  now faces calls from union officials for a probe into the site s safety 
Chevron denies there have been any safety breaches at the plant but is under pressure to resolve problems that have limited exports to just two cargoes since starting operations in March 
The Australian Manufacturing Workers  Union  AMWU  has told Reuters it has formally requested access to the site 
 The AMWU has concerns about safety at Gorgon   Steve McCartney  West Australian secretary of the AMWU  told Reuters via email 
A failed weld on a valve casing called a trunnion caused the gas leak that forced the plant to close on July 1  he said 
 The AMWU wants to know why it failed  and what checks were carried out to ensure it met Australian standards   McCartney said 
Chevron called the leak  minor   although it did evacuate some workers  On Wednesday the company said it expected to resume production shortly 
 Chevron Australia is in discussions with the AMWU to visit the site as part of usual union engagement with its members   a spokeswoman said  adding that there had been no safety breaches at the plant 
Reuters could not independently confirm whether the issues at the plant pose any risk to worker safety 
MISTAKES
Chevron  which is counting on Gorgon to help it become an LNG leader in Asia  reported its first shutdown in April and was forced to shut again following a gas leak on July 1 
In interviews with Reuters  site workers and industry sources familiar with operations at Gorgon said mistakes led to the first shutdown 
According to information provided by one engineer at the plant  liquid propane in the refrigerant circuit flooded into a section of pipeline meant to handle gases only 
Metal debris inside the piping was propelled along at speed  damaging equipment and producing  very loud clunking noises  which prompted operators to initiate emergency shutdown procedures  according to one worker and corroborated by AMWU s McCartney 
Chevron said the problem occurred in the propane refrigerant circuit where natural gas is cooled into a liquid but declined to provide further details 
LAGGING RIVALS
The shutdowns have cost Gorgon more than  200 million in lost output  excluding repairs and other expenditures  one industry consultant estimated  basing the figure on an export schedule of around one cargo per week 
The outages have also contributed to a jump in global LNG spot prices  which are up by around 40 percent since April   LNG AS 
Two industry sources said Chevron ignored advice from project partners Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  and  Exxon Mobil   NYSE XOM  to go slow with the launch of Gorgon 
 We do not comment on industry rumor or speculation   Chevron said  Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon also declined to comment 
 Gorgon s teething issues mirror the ongoing problems at Angola LNG and put the spotlight on Chevron   said Rystad Energy analyst Readul Islam regarding Chevron s ability to deliver LNG plants 
Chevron and partners  BP   LON BP    ENI   MI ENI  and Total has just finished work on its LNG plant in Angola following a two year shutdown to fix design flaws 
Operations tentatively resumed at the plant just last month 
Meanwhile  rivals have moved forward  with Exxon Mobil launching its Papua New Guinea  PNG LNG  liquefaction plant on time and on budget in 2014  when Gorgon was first due to start operations 
 The relatively niggle free ramp up of Gladstone LNG  in Australia  as well as the PNG LNG trains over the past two years could lead to questions being asked of Gorgon s onshore  start up  team   said Rystad s Islam  but he added that Gorgon s greater complexity and size arguably make it a bigger challenge 
Industry sources and analysts continue to project start up delays at subsequent phases of Gorgon due partly to the latest hiatus 
Chevron denies this  It says that construction on Gorgon production lines two and three  which will boost its export capacity to 15 6 million tonnes a year in 2017  are unaffected 
Peter Coleman  chief executive of Woodside Petroleum which is partnered with Chevron in developing the  33 billion Wheatstone LNG project in Australia  said his company was taking a more hands on role in development as Chevron is  having to direct resources elsewhere  
But he added he had no concerns about Chevron as a project operator 
 They ve got a lot on their plate and so many hands help  and that s where we are at the moment   he said ",2016-07-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/exclusive:-chevron's-giant-australia-lng-plant-facing-union-calls-for-safety-checks-415725,415725

Segment Performance
Upstream  Chevron s total production of crude oil and natural gas remained essentially unchanged from the year earlier level at 2 676 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day  MBOE d   The U S  output decreased 4  year over year to 672 MBOE d  while the company s international operations  accounting for 75  of the total  was up 2  to 2 004 MBOE d 
Contribution from volume increases from showpiece projects and base business were offset by normal field declines  the effect of asset sales and production entitlement effects in different regions 
Despite flat production volumes  Chevron s upstream segment had a massive turnaround   from a loss of  1 459 million in the year earlier quarter to a profit of  1 517 million  This was mainly on account of a leaner cost structure and higher realizations 
Meanwhile  Chevron s production outlook remains one of the most robust in its peer group  with a number of major initiatives scheduled to come online during the next few years  A major start up during the quarter was the Mafumeira Sul project  offshore Angola 
Downstream  Chevron s downstream segment achieved earnings of  926 million  26  more than the profit of  735 million last year  The results were driven by higher margins on refined product sales in the U S 
Cash Flows
Importantly  Chevron delivered a good cash flow performance this quarter   an important gauge for the oil and gas industry   with  3 879 million in cash flow from operations  up from  1 141 million a year ago 
Costs   Expenses
Exploration costs fell from  370 million in the first quarter of 2016 to  144 million  The second largest U S  oil company by market value after ExxonMobil spent  4 392 million in capital expenditures during the quarter  a considerable decline from the  6 469 million incurred a year ago  More than 90  of the total outlays pertained to upstream projects

Euro tests highs as inflation accelerates in April
The euro has made some strong gains this morning  a day after having fallen back below 1 09 against the dollar as ECB President Mario Draghi warned that the path back to the central bank s inflation target will be gradual  He did  however  warn that we should see a pick up in inflation this month and that it would remain around this level until the end of the year  and this morning s flash CPI data has confirmed the first part of his forecast 

Prices rose more than expected in April  with the CPI measure rising to 1 9  year on year   in line with the ECBs target of below but close to 2    and the core reading jumping 0 4  to 1 2   With Draghi acknowledging this spike in yesterday s press conference  it s unlikely that it s going to change the outlook as far as the ECB is concerned but it will likely feed into the discussion come June  when many think the central bank will start planning for future tapering of its asset purchases 
Sterling higher as consumer feels inflation pinch
The pound is also trading higher again this morning despite GDP data for the first quarter coming out weaker than expected at 0 3   It would appear that the consumer is starting to feel the inflation bite  with the services sector growing at its slowest rate in two years  significantly below the levels achieved in the previous two quarters  Still  sterling is testing 1 2950 against the dollar and close to breaking through a key technical level that could open up a move towards 1 3450  having entered back into last year s June to September range 

Weak US Q1 GDP number expected for fourth year
There s still plenty of data to come from the US today  including its own advanced GDP reading for the first quarter  which is expected to be 1 3  on an annualized basis  While this may seem weak and trigger concerns about stalling growth  it is worth considering that first quarter growth has been very low in each of the last three years but has recovered in the following quarters on each occasion  There s currently no reason to doubt that the same will happen again  should we see another disappointing first quarter reading  We ll also get UoM consumer sentiment  employment cost index and Chicago PMI data  and hear from Fed officials Lael Brainard and Patrick Harker  Earnings season also continues with Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX  and General Motors  NYSE GM  among those reporting ",2017-04-28,Craig Erlam,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-data-and-earnings-in-focus-as-euro-rises-on-inflation-spike-200185894,200185894

193070,414586,CVX,Empty houses and jobless maids  Indonesia s expat exodus gathers pace,news,"By Eveline Danubrata and Fergus Jensen JAKARTA  Reuters    Foreign workers are leaving Indonesia at an increasing rate due to the slump in commodity prices that has forced resource companies to slash jobs at a time when the government has also introduced tighter regulations on expatriates in Southeast Asia s biggest economy  The number of temporary residential permits issued to foreigners  including renewals  has fallen for the past few years to 171 944 in 2015 from 194 162 in 2013  In the first five months of this year  there were 72 399 issued but many of those who provide services to expats say they expect a further drop over the whole of 2016 as they are seeing very few new arrivals  As a result  rents on upmarket homes in Jakarta have plummeted and enrolment at international schools has fallen   The expat drought has been really noticeable in 2016   said Deborah Minicola  a Jakarta based technical advisor at international relocation company Allied Pickfords   This time the expat community has been hit from so many angles   The outflow is likely to dent higher end consumption and drive up unemployment  economists say  as big spending expats tend to hire multiple workers ranging from housemaids and drivers to gardeners and bodyguards  Some workers who recently lost their jobs are finding it difficult to get new employment  Christiana Ambar Putriani is one example  She has been looking for a job as a part time housekeeper in Jakarta after her former bosses left for South America a few weeks ago  She hopes to work for an expat family again as foreigners tend to pay higher wages but it is getting tougher to find such jobs  she says  The Australian Independent School in Balikpapan  a city in Indonesia s resource dependent province of East Kalimantan  expects a 36 percent reduction in its student body this year  said human resources officer Ni Ketut Novia  Three international schools in the city have shut over the past 2 3 years due to the mass layoffs at mining contractors and a drastic cut in expat allowances  she said  The expat exodus will also create skill shortages that could hold the country back when the commodity downturn is reversed   Low resource prices and a slowdown in demand from China  one of Indonesia s top export markets  have reduced the incentive for exploration or production in the oil and gas and mining sectors  forcing companies to hack back on staff costs  The mining  oil and gas and geothermal sectors accounted for 7 62 percent of Indonesia s gross domestic product in 2015  down from 11 81 percent in 2011  Drilling contractors and exploration site surveyors are among the worst hit  industry experts say  Oil and gas companies operating in the country include  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX    Total  SA  PA TOTF  and  Exxon Mobil  Corp  NYSE XOM   Total s Indonesia spokesman said the company has  manpower planning which is in line with our evolution of activities   Chevron  which is selling assets in Asia including some in Indonesia  declined to comment  Exxon also did not comment  POLICY CONFUSION A PwC survey of 53 firms in the oil and gas sector  released in May  found that almost three quarters of respondents expected a smaller expat workforce in future  partly because of tighter controls on hiring foreigners     Indonesia opened up dozens of business sectors recently to foreign investors in a move described by President Joko Widodo as a  Big Bang  liberalization of the economy  Yet business groups say there are mixed signals from the government  which imposes restrictions apparently under pressure from protectionist voices around the president  The manpower ministry is encouraging companies to hire more Indonesian workers and is tightening its scrutiny of the work permit applications from foreigners  said Ratna Agustina  a director at a firm that provides services to expats  The government also sets an age ceiling of 55 years for foreigners employed by oil and gas contractors  downstream businesses and supporting service providers   with certain exemptions for top executives or those with skills deemed crucial   If they are above 55  the assumption is that many have ailments and are less productive   said Taslim Yunus  a spokesman for the energy regulator  Adding to the regulatory uncertainty  the government last year introduced requirements for foreigners to be proficient in Indonesian and for companies to hire 10 locals for every expat  only to backtrack less than 12 months later after businesses raised strong protests  The manpower ministry did not respond to requests for comment  The expat exodus hasn t hit the rest of the region as hard  In neighboring Singapore  the number of foreign professionals  managers and executives earning at least S 3 300   2 500  a month actually rose 5 percent to 187 900 as of December 2015 from a year earlier  the latest official data show   Banks are hiring more compliance professionals in the city state  but many condominium units have been left empty and office vacancy rates are near their highest level in almost a decade  partly due to the departure of expats from the energy and commodities sector  property agents say  EMPTY HOUSES The gloom is evident on the streets of Kemang  a ritzy neighborhood in south Jakarta where opulent homes are now festooned with  for rent  signs  The rental price of one house there  with a garden and swimming pool  has fallen by a third to  3 000 per month  says property broker Julizar   I ve been trying to market this house for six months but there has been no taker   A British national who provides training for energy executives in Indonesia has been hit by a 60 percent decline in revenue over the past 18 months  This slump  he says  is the most pronounced throughout his 20 years in the industry  He declined to be named  citing company policy  The long term impact of the restrictions in hiring foreign workers will be  an exacerbation of an existing acute skills shortage   said Lin Neumann  managing director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia  
Widodo has taken steps to move the economy away from its dependence on commodity exports and build a manufacturing base  but Neumann said that isn t enough to offset the shrinkage in mining and oil and gas ",2016-06-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/empty-houses-and-jobless-maids:-indonesia's-expat-exodus-gathers-pace-410977,410977
193071,414587,CVX,Exclusive  BP Exxon impasse blocks renewal of giant Azeri oil deal   sources,news,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov LONDON  Reuters    U S  oil major  Exxon Mobil   N XOM  and Britain s  BP   L BP  are at loggerheads over a giant oil production deal with Azerbaijan  blocking renewal of what was once called  the contract of the century   three high level industry sources told Reuters  BP  which operates the Azeri Chigar Guneshli  ACG  fields in the Caspian Sea and relies on them for a tenth of its global output  has tentatively agreed terms with the Azeri government on extending the 30 year contract  they said   But Exxon  which gets around one percent of its hydrocarbon production through its stake in the ACG consortium  has been holding out for a better deal since the halving of world oil prices in 2014  The result is deadlock in talks over a project that may produce another  100 billion worth of oil at current prices  coming on top of old tensions between Exxon chief executive Rex Tillerson and his BP counterpart Bob Dudley  the sources said    There have been numerous attempts to find a breakthrough  with BP and Azerbaijan agreeing new terms but Exxon rejecting them time and time again  It has been going on for almost two years  with Exxon insisting on better terms   a Western oil industry source familiar with discussions said  A high level source in the former Soviet republic said   Exxon wants better terms  It has its own views of how the consortium should work which are different from the views of the operator BP    Neither source would go into details of the terms under discussion  While the existing deal still has eight years to run  usual energy industry practice is to try to renew such long term production sharing agreements as early as possible   preferably around a decade before they are due to expire   to plan huge new investments in advance  So far the consortium partners have invested  32 billion in the project  At stake is three quarters of overall Azeri crude output or about 600 000 barrels per day   equal to 0 7 percent of global output   extracted under the agreement between the ACG consortium members and the Azeri government  Azerbaijan signed the original deal in 1994  only three years after the collapse of the Soviet Union  Since then  energy wealth has transformed what had been an impoverished nation into one confident enough to host a Formula One Grand Prix a fortnight ago  although the oil price crash has badly hurt its economy  For Europe  the country is a vital source of oil and gas as the continent tries to lessen its dependence on Russian energy  BP declined to comment on details of the extension talks  saying the ACG fields had already produced over 2 9 billion barrels since 1994  That would be worth  155 billion  using an average price of  55 per barrel for the past two decades   Together with our co venturers in Azerbaijan  we remain committed to building on this record of success and supporting the continued development of the local market   BP said  Exxon said it does not comment on  commercial negotiations   TENSE RELATIONS While BP has a 35 8 percent stake in the project  Exxon holds only 8 percent  Other members include Azeri state oil firm Socar and U S  major  Chevron   NYSE CVX  with over 11 percent each  Inpex of Japan with 11 percent and Norway s  Statoil   OL STL  with 8 6 percent  Turkey s TPAO  Japan s Itochu and India s ONGC have smaller stakes  The ACG consortium has had problems in the past  The fields had been expected to pump more than 1 million bpd at their peak but after hitting 820 000 bpd in 2010  output has fallen  prompting Azeri President Ilham Aliyev to accuse BP of making  false promises   Azerbaijan even suggested it may develop the fields on its own after the deal expires in 2024  But BP managed to mend fences and opened talks on extending the agreement until 2040 and possibly 2060  The aim is to extract as much as 2 billion barrels of additional oil  worth another  100 billion at today s prices of  50 per barrel  However  oil companies around the world have been reviewing production contracts to slash costs and limit spending during the worst downturn in global prices in at least three decades  Exxon s position began to toughen after 2014  and one source close to the discussions said the Tillerson Dudley relationship had complicated matters   It could have been sorted out at the very top level  But Rex and Bob have had frosty relations for years   the source said  Sources pointed to several events over the past years which had soured matters between the two Americans  After BP s deadly 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster  Dudley said it was  one in a million occurrence  and that BP did not act in a negligent manner  Tillerson  however  called the biggest oil spill in U S  history  a breakdown of management oversight  and called Dudley s remarks  a great disservice to the industry   A year later  BP lost a deal to drill for oil in the Russian Arctic after a surprise decision by its long time local partner Rosneft to chose Exxon  Then last year  BP was among a group of top oil firms that made a rare joint appeal in support of the United Nations backed Paris climate deal  Tillerson refused to sign  saying he didn t want to be  disingenuous  or  fake it  as far as his long standing scepticism on the issue was concerned  In contrast to the ACG deal  a BP led consortium which operates the giant Shakh Deniz gas field nearby agreed new terms with the Azeri government extending the agreement to 2036  Exxon is not involved in that consortium  It is not unusual for host countries to use disagreements between consortium partners to extract better terms  under the threat of refusing to renew deals  
But the Azeri source played down this possibility   Azerbaijan is not giving any ultimatums  We are still hoping for a deal before the end of September   the source said   Reporting and Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov ",2016-07-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/exclusive:-bp-exxon-impasse-blocks-renewal-of-giant-azeri-oil-deal---sources-411914,411914

193082,414598,CVX,Nigerian militant group says it blew up two Chevron wells,news,"YENAGOA  Nigeria  Reuters    A Nigerian militant group said on Wednesday that it had blown up two  Chevron   NYSE CVX  oil wells in the second such attack in a week on the company s facilities in Nigeria s oil producing Delta region 
An oil spill was seen in waterways and wetlands surrounding the Chevron sites after the attack  according to a Reuters witness and a local official  though the volume spilled could not be immediately determined 
The attacks occurred as tensions flared between international oil companies and Niger Delta residents  some of whom are pushing foreign energy companies to leave Africa s largest economy in a bid for greater economic self reliance 
A group calling itself the Niger Delta Avengers said in a post on Twitter that it used  100 Gunboats  4 Warships and Jet Bombers  to attack Chevron s RMP 23 and 24 wells early on Wednesday morning  It claimed the wells were Chevron s highest producing in the country 
The attacks have reduced Nigeria s total oil output to below that of rival producer Angola  sharply affecting the national budget which relies on oil tax revenue 
The Niger Delta Avengers  a relatively new radical group that has claimed responsibility for a number of pipeline bombings in the country this year  had told Chevron and other oil companies to leave Nigeria by the end of May 
Last week the group claimed responsibility for blowing up electricity feeds to Chevron s facilities  forcing the company to shutter onshore operations 
Attacks carried out by the group since February have cut Nigeria s oil output by at least 300 000 barrels of oil per day  bpd  and shuttered two refineries  The group has also attacked facilities owned by Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  
The wells attacked on Wednesday are in the Dibi field near Warri  about 265 miles  426 kilometers  southeast of Lagos  Nigeria s largest city 
Local residents confirmed to Reuters that an attack had taken place 
In response to a request for comment  Chevron spokesman Kurt Glaubitz said   As a matter of long standing policy  we do not comment on the safety and security of our personnel and operations  
It was not clear what effect the attacks would have on Chevron s daily Nigerian output  Last year Chevron pumped about 224 000 bpd in Nigeria  about 9 percent of the company s global output

193083,414599,CVX,Nigerian militants say aim is zero oil output after three new attacks,news,"By Libby George and Ulf Laessing
LONDON ABUJA  Reuters    The Niger Delta Avengers militant group has claimed responsibility for three new attacks on Nigeria s oil infrastructure  promising to cut production to zero 
The attacks are the latest in a Delta region conflict that a major local youth group said is  rapidly deteriorating and getting out of control   putting intense pressure on Nigeria s stretched finances 
The Nigerian Air Force  in a statement issued late on Friday  said it had deployed additional  fighter aircraft  helicopter gunship and surveillance aircraft  in troubled oil producing areas to conduct  offensive air operations and intelligence gathering  
The army has moved reinforcements to the swamps in the last few weeks 
Early on Friday  the Niger Delta Avengers group said via its Twitter account it had blown up a pipeline in Nigeria s Bayelsa state owned by Italy s  ENI   MI ENI   hours after attacks on another ENI pipeline as well as one belonging to Shell  LON RDSa  Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd  SPDC  
 At about 3 30am our   NDAvengers  strike team blew up the Brass to Tebidaba Crude oil line in Bayelsa   the group said on a Twitter feed it uses to claim attacks 
Shell confirmed its 250 000 barrels a day Forcados pipeline had been hit again and was leaking   We have     mobilized appropriate oil spill response measures   SPDC said in a statement 
The pipe had been shut in February after a seawater attack but a new strike might complicate three month long repairs  for which the firm has brought in experts from abroad  Force majeur has been in place for Forcados crude since then 
The Niger Delta Avengers say oil firms are responsible for pollution and say the poor swampland region fails to reap any benefit from its reserves 
It said its attacks had brought Nigeria s oil production to just 800 000 barrels per day  bpd   from 2 million bpd  without killing anyone  though they hit infrastructure feeding crude grades already under force majeure 
The ENI pipeline is used to transport Brass River crude 
The group also hit ENI s Ogboinbiri Tebidaba and Clough Creek Tebidaba pipelines in Bayelsa and warned ENI not to start repairs or  we will make you regrets it  
ENI did not respond to a request for comment 
LOUD SOUND
Ayiri Appah  a resident of Ogboinbiri  where the ENI pipelines are located  said he  heard a loud sound  from the area between 2 and 4 am local time 
Three grades of Nigeria s oil   Forcados  Brass River and Bonny Light   are under force majeure  while  Exxon Mobil   NYSE XOM  lifted force majeure on Qua Iboe  the country s largest export stream  on Friday 
Nigeria s oil minister said on Thursday that output was 1 6 million bpd  Even if the most recent attacks  which also included facilities belonging to  Chevron   NYSE CVX  under its Escravos grade  took out all exports of the oil linked to them  June production would remain near 1 2 million bpd 
Experts said the violence showed little sign of abating  and would keep pressure on the Nigeria s oil production and finances  President Muhammadu Buhari  a Muslim from the north  on Thursday canceled what would have been his first visit to the Delta region since taking office 
The Avengers have accused Buhari of ignoring local problems by having never visited the Christian region in the south

193087,414603,CVX,Exclusive  Isabel dos Santos pledges transparency  efficiency at Angolan state oil giant,news,"By Ed Cropley LUANDA  Reuters    Angolan state energy giant Sonangol is spinning off non core investments in areas such as banking and real estate into a separate fund to allow it to focus exclusively on oil  new CEO Isabel dos Santos said on Thursday  In her first interview since being appointed last week  the daughter of Angola President Jose Eduardo dos Santos also pledged to bring openness and efficiency to the 40 year old company that is frequently criticized as opaque and unwieldy   We re very committed to transparency  We re very committed to improving our profits at Sonangol and to improving our organization   she told Reuters in the staff canteen at the company s swish headquarters in central Luanda  The 43 year old  a major investor in various Angolan and Portuguese telecoms  banking  media and energy companies  is ranked as Africa s richest woman by Forbes magazine  Dos Santos dismissed suggestions that it was her family connections rather than business acumen that led to her appointment last week after the surprise dismissal of the Sonangol board  Some analysts have seen the move as a sign of President dos Santos    Angola s ruler for the last 36 years    putting close family members in charge of key pillars of the economy ahead of 2018  when he has said he intends to step down   It s not because of politics   the Sonangol chief executive said of her appointment   I was brought into this project because of my experience from the private business sector   She also confirmed that Sonangol would be split into three units  one overseeing its oil operations  another logistics and the third handling the management of concessions to international energy companies  Like other energy businesses  Sonangol has been hit hard by the decline in oil prices and Dos Santos emphasized the need to find ways to improve margins by lowering the unit cost of producing a barrel of oil  In particular  Sonangol officials have spoken of operators in Angola sharing logistics infrastructure to reduce overheads  Angola is now ahead of Nigeria as Africa s top producer because of militant violence that his hit output in the Niger Delta region  FIXING THE MENU Dos Santos said the restructuring would have taken place regardless of the oil price collapse  given the rapid development of Angola s economy since the end in 2002 of a devastating civil war  during which Sonangol was often called upon to provide basic services such as housing and hospitals   It is a state company and it was always the provider for many  many things for the country  If we required social housing or if we had issues regarding health  it was always a company that contributed   she said   But the country has grown  There are a lot more businesses  You have a thriving banking sector  the real estate market is there  you can see all the construction  There are other companies  so Sonangol can push back a little bit from its non core areas   Angola  which relies on oil exports for 95 percent of its foreign exchange  is often cited by anti bribery campaigners as one of the world s most corrupt countries  President dos Santos has said he has a  zero tolerance  approach to graft  Isabel dos Santos said she intends to change the culture at Sonangol  improving relations with oil majors such as  Chevron   N CVX    Total   PA TOTF  and  BP   L BP  while breaking down internal barriers with down to earth gestures such as using the staff canteen   We re a team  It doesn t matter what job you have in a company  whether you re at the top  bottom or in the middle   she said in the canteen

193090,414606,CVX,Profiting In Bear And Bull Oil Markets,opinion,"Oil prices have been falling since June 2014 as increasing supply of crude oil by major producers exceeded global demand for the commodity  Brent crude oil prices are down by more than 64  since June 20  2014 causing great strain for oil producers who have to repay debts taken when no such downturn was expected 
U S  oil rig count fell by 703 since March 2015 as lower prices led to falling earnings  Since the start of 2015 more than 40 U S  energy companies have declared bankruptcy  Energy Information Administration estimates in its March  2016 monthly report that the U S  shale oil output will fall 106 000 barrels per day  bpd  in April from March to total 4 871 million bpd 
Major oil producers Saudi Arabia  Russia  Qatar and Venezuela agreed last month to freeze crude oil output at January levels in an attempt to stem the global glut  but on condition other producers will join the agreement  Oil prices have reversed after that on expectations that rising demand will clear the global overhang of stockpiles with output kept steady 
Data from China s General Administration of Customs seem to support this expectations at least for the world s second largest oil consumer  China s crude oil imports in February jumped 20  year over year to 8 0 million barrels per day  to highest ever on a daily basis 
While the recent advance in prices has resulted in more than 7  gain in Brent crude price year to date  many analysts have rightfully noted that the oil market is still oversupplied and prices have to remain lower to help rebalance the market  as supplies fall  Increasing output by Iran is a major factor which may contribute to continued downward pressure on prices as Iran increases its crude oil output to pre sanction level of 4 million bpd and ramps up its exports to regain lost market share as Tehran has said repeatedly it intends to do 
 of major energy companies are correlated with crude oil  they change as crude oil prices fluctuate  but over time these changes are usually smaller than fluctuations in oil prices  This is largely the result of integrated business model of major energy companies with operations involving both upstream exploration and production of crude oil  as well as downstream refining of crude oil and marketing of refined oil products 
Such an integrated model makes earnings less sensitive to changes in crude oil prices  while earnings from crude oil sale fall as oil prices fall  with falling input costs earnings from refining business units rise helping to compensate partially for declining upstream earnings  Thus stock prices of major energy companies tend to fall less for a given decline in oil prices and tend to advance less than a given rise in underlying oil prices 
A comparison of asset performances in the table below verifies that changes in stock prices of major oil companies   Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX  and BP  LON BP  were smaller in magnitude than changes in underlying oil prices in recent periods 

A trading strategy of combining long and short positions in stocks of major oil companies and oil can be employed to take advantage of differences in rates of change of these instrument prices  In essence this strategy of taking opposite positions in oil and stocks of major energy companies is similar to pairs trading  For example  in the first period from June 20  2014 to January 14  2015 the profitable trading strategy would be taking a short position in Brent oil and long position in any of the major energy company stocks 
In the second period from January 14  2015 to May 6  2015 going long in Brent oil and short in any of three stocks would be the winning strategy  And in the next two periods of falling oil prices shorting the Brent oil again and going long in stocks would generate positive returns The Personal Composite Instrument  PCI  technology developed by the IFC Markets based on GeWorko Method is the perfect instrument for studying the relative performance of oil and major energy company stocks  and implementing appropriate trading strategy 
Investors can create unlimited numbers of new financial instruments   PCIs  by combining assets from various markets and asset classes to test their investment ideas using the proprietary NetTradeX platform of IFC Markets 
A PCI with one of the stocks of major energy companies as the Base portfolio and the Brent oil as the Quote portfolio can be created  For details on how to create PCIs using the innovative GeWorko Method follow the link  How to create PCI GeWorko   We have set the structure of the PCI as a Base portfolio composed of 123 shares of Exxon Mobil  and a Quote portfolio made up of 274 barrels of Brent crude oil  The PCI has been named  XOM Brent  and the chart of the newly created instrument is displayed in Figure 1 
The chart of the Brent crude oil price is presented in Figure 2 for a reference 


To understand what the PCI chart is telling about the relative performance of the Exxon Mobil stock and Brent crude oil it should be noted that the price of our PCI is equal to the ratio of the dollar values of 123 shares of Exxon Mobil and 274 barrels of Brent crude oil 
The charts look like the inverse version of each other  while Brent fell steeply in summer winter period of 2008 the PCI rose sharply  And as Brent rebounded in 2009 2010 period the PCI fell  This means that Exxon Mobil stock  which is in the numerator for the PCI price ratio  fell less in summer winter period of 2008 than Brent  And in the subsequent period as Brent rebounded Exxon Mobil stock recorded smaller gains  This pattern allows to trade two assets by taking opposite positions in them  which is what our PCI allows to do 
We can use the analytical tools of NetTradeX platform to conduct a technical analysis of the  XOM Brent PCI chart for trading signals  Let us have a look at the daily candlestick chart of  XOM Brent below in the Figure 3 

The PCI price had been rising since May 2015  hit the highest in mid January 2016 and is retracing lower since then  It breached below the neckline of the head and shoulder chart pattern formed in the last three months  This is a bearish development  The price has breached the support line of the uptrend and closed below it  which is clearly a bearish development 
The RSI indicator has reached the oversold zone and is edging up  The MACD signal line has breached below the zero level  the indicator is below the signal line  and the gap with the signal line is widening  This is also a bearish signal 
The  also gives a sell signal  The overall signal is bearish which is indicated by the red down arrow on the PCI chart  We can go short on the PCI right away by placing a limit order to sell with an entry point below the support line  and limit the risk by placing the stop loss above last fractal high at 1 0172  The result of the  XOM Brent PCI technical analysis is straightforward  sell the PCI  which will result in selling the Exxon Mobil stock and buying the Brent crude oil  just what would be expected when oil prices were trending upward 
Similar analyses can be conducted for PCIs made up of any other energy stock as the PCI Base asset paired with the Brent crude oil as the Quote asset  A slightly complex PCI with a combination of major energy stocks as the Base portfolio and the Brent oil as the Quote portfolio can also be constructed and analyzed for trading 
The versatile PCI technology  which allows comparing the relative performance of various assets  from same as well as different asset classes  by pairing them as the Base and Quote portfolios of the PCI  can be used to test ideas for trading strategies for other assets with similar correlation patterns  All is needed is to construct corresponding PCIs through straightforward steps for creation of the PCIs described at the webpage above  and check if the resulting PCIs display appropriate trending behavior ",2017-04-03,IFC Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/profiting-in-bear-and-bull-oil-markets-200180989,200180989
193091,414607,CVX,Crude Oil Glut Does Not Help Gasoline Supply,opinion,"Getting Ready To Erupt
Gasoline prices hit the highest level since last January as supply continues to fall and demand continues to rise  While traders are fixated on the oil supply glut and the resumption of Libya s largest oil field  the global surplus is tightening  Bloomberg News reports that since mid February  between 10 million and 20 million barrels have left storage in the Caribbean  a sign that the global market is tightening  More important for drivers  the supply of gasoline in the U S  is tightening at a frantic pace  Big oil investments have been cut back and according to the Wall Street Journal  they will be happy to break even  It is the calm before the bullish storm as the markets are in a comfort zone not realizing that the lack of investment and falling global inventories are setting the stage for a larger rally and a much more expensive summer driving season 
Jason Schenker  the President of Prestige Economics  LLC  agrees  In a Bloomberg op ed piece he said   Traders in the energy market are too focused of late on crude oil inventories  When oil inventories rose in last week s Department of Energy report many zeroed in on the fact that they increased less than expected to explain a bump higher in the price of crude  Traders largely ignored recent trends showing sharp drops in gasoline and distillate inventories  Schenker points out that while crude inventories increased   product inventories fell in last week s DOE report by a combined 6 2 million barrels  bringing the total product inventory decline over the past six weeks to 36 5 million barrels   That s the biggest six week drop in almost 11 years    and the summer driving season doesn t even start for another seven weeks 
That is being reflected in higher prices at the pump  AAA says that gas prices hit an average price of  2 33 per gallon for regular unleaded gasoline and is four cents more than a week ago  one cent more compared to one month ago and 27 cents more than the same date last year  National gas prices have increased six of the last seven days  AAA says that while the increase in prices has been moderate  it is possible this trend could continue as refinery maintenance wraps up  more expensive summer blend gasoline becomes available and driving demand increases this spring 
Big oil is not so big  Sarah Kent of the Wall Street Journal writes   The world s biggest oil companies are struggling just to break even  Despite billions of dollars in spending cuts and a modest oil price rebound  Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa   Chevron  NYSE CVX  and BP  NYSE BP  didn t make enough money in 2016 to cover their costs  according to a Wall Street Journal analysis  The Journal writes   To calculate each companies  free cash flow the excess cash remaining after costs the Journal deducted the firm s dividends and capital expenditures from its cash from operations  All four firms fell short of cash flow for the year  although Exxon said it broke even by its own metrics  which exclude dividends  The analysis also showed that the four companies ended last year with more debt than they began it   That lack of profitability by big oil means that they will not risk big money on higher yielding  more expensive energy projects  They will go with the low hanging fruit like shale that will leave the market very under supplied in the next few years 
While oil stalled at  55 00 a barrel as U S  inventories stayed strong  it is probably reducing the long term investment we will need for future demand  If you are fixated on the moment you may think we have plenty of supply  If you are a futures trader you must look to the future and realize that we are going to see a significant tightening of supply in the coming weeks and months and years  The gasoline and product tightening is the first phase and in a few weeks  it will be the oil  Imports to the U S  are falling and the exports will be rising  Demand for gas and diesel are starting to heat up  Do not be surprised when the glut of oil is gone  The signs are all around ",2017-04-04,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crude-oil-glut-does-not-help-gasoline-supply-200181276,200181276
193092,414608,CVX,Oil Price Hurting Energy Giants  They re Healthier Than You Think,opinion,"A study this week by the  found that the largest publicly traded oil producing firms  fell short of cash flow for the year   According to the study  Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa   Chevron  NYSE CVX   and BP  NYSE BP  showed negative balances when the Journal  deducted the firm s dividends and capital expenditures from its cash from operations  
These findings are actually what one would expect and what a long term investor would prefer from major oil companies considering the downturn in oil prices  The price of oil is low  but these majors are still paying dividends to appease investors and investing in capital intensive projects that will profit in the long run when the fluctuating price of oil trends higher 
For instance  the study explains that   Exxon spent nearly  7 billion more on developing new projects and dividends in 2016 than it generated in cash   In other words  even though Exxon s revenues are down  the company is still preparing for the longer term  Energy businesses make money and succeed with long term plans for exploration  R D  and production 
A long term  fundamentals driven investor would appreciate this behavior by these giants so long as the company itself is financially stable  With relatively easy access to capital  significant assets  and tremendous market advantages  all four of these oil giants seem financially stable in the long run  If they are stable enough to weather a downturn  a long term investor one who buys and holds wants to see such expenditures to ensure the continued generation of revenue in the future 
This study was not only a good sign for the long term health of these giant public energy companies  but also a good sign for some national oil companies  For example  as Aramco prepares for its expected initial public offering  IPO   its success and positioning will be compared to these energy giants 
While these companies traditionally provide good dividends to their investors  Aramco has been producing enough revenue to pay sums to the government of Saudi Arabia that are significant enough to largely fund the country s budget   40 billion a year apparently covers Aramco s operating costs and capital expenditures   Khalid al Falih  
Aramco does this while also paying its own operation costs and investing heavily in long term projects  especially in downstream operations around the globe   Even though Aramco is providing less cash for Saudi Arabia than it used to  its payments to the government are more than the sum of taxes and dividends for each of the four giants 
Long term investors should appreciate any oil company that can survive today and prepare for the future while making its investors happy  If short term investors keep the stock prices of these oil giants down  these equities could present bargains as investments with a longer horizon ",2017-04-05,"Ellen R.

YENAGOA  Reuters    Militants attacked crude oil and gas pipelines operated by Nigeria s state oil firm in the Niger Delta  a community leader said on Friday  in an attack claimed by the Niger Delta Avengers  which has been targeting energy facilities for weeks 
 Another crude pipeline was attacked yesterday Thursday night near Batan oil field in Warri   said Eric Omare  spokesman for the Ijaw Youth Council  which represents one of the largest ethnic groups in the vast delta in southern Nigeria 
 There were two simultaneous attacks on  state oil firm  PPMC and NNPC pipelines   he said  referring to the marketing arm of the NNPC 
The militant group tweeted later that they had blown up a gas and crude pipeline near the town of Warri that was protected by soldiers and operated by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation  NNPC  
 At 11 45pm on Thursday  NDAvengers blew up other  NNPC Gas and Crude trunkline close to Warri   the group said on its Twitter feed  It had claimed on the same platform an attack on  Chevron   NYSE CVX  s main power feed in the Delta  which shut down the U S  firm s onshore operations  according to a company source 
The Avengers  who have given oil firms until end of the month to leave  say they want independence for the Delta and have intensified attacks in recent weeks  pushing oil output to its lowest in more than 20 years and compounding Nigeria s economic problems 
Delta residents  some of whom sympathize with the militants  have long complained of poverty in an area producing oil accounting for 70 percent of national income 
The government has responded by moving in army reinforcements but British Foreign Minister Philip Hammond said this month that President Muhammadu Buhari needed to deal with the root causes of poverty and anger about oil spills 
In the first signal that the government might try a less heavy handed approach  Oil Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu said on Thursday an amnesty program for former militants  signed in 2009 to end a previous insurgency  needed to improve 
A committee set up by Delta state leaders warned on Thursday that a military approach would not work and saw  an apparent consensus  that the federal government and oil companies have neglected the grievances of local communities

193112,414628,CVX,Blast hits Chevron oil facility in Nigeria s Delta  security source,news,"By Tife Owolabi
YENAGOA  Nigeria  Reuters    An explosion rocked a  Chevron   NYSE CVX  oil pipeline in Nigeria s restive Delta region on Friday  a security source said  the second blast at a facility of the U S  oil major within a week  feeding concern over a revived militant campaign in the area 
The swamps of the southern Delta have been hit by a series of militant attacks on pipelines and other oil and gas facilities that have reduced Nigeria s output by 300 000 barrels a day and closed a major export port and two refineries 
Last week  militants calling themselves the Niger Delta Avengers claimed an attack on a Chevron Platform in the Delta 
The group has warned oil firms to leave the region within two weeks and says it is fighting for independence for Delta  It had earlier said it wanted a greater share of oil revenues and an end to oil pollution 
The attacks have driven Nigerian oil output to near a 22 year low and  if the violence escalates into another insurgency  it could cripple output in a country facing a growing economic crisis 
On Friday  a new blast occurred at a Chevron oil well at the Marakaba pipeline in Warri  a security source told Reuters  No more details were immediately known 
Chevron had no immediate comment  while Nigeria s army  which has stepped up its presence in the region  could not immediately be reached for comment 
A day before  the  Avengers  had warned Chevron on their website against repairing the last week s damage

193124,414640,CVX,U S  stocks lower after jobs report  S P struggles to hold 2016 gains,news,"Investing com   Wall Street traded lower on Friday  with the S P 500 struggling to stay in the positive for 2016 and the Dow making an attempt to trade up  after a disappointing employment report raised concern over the strength of the U S  labor market and pushed back calls for the next rate hike from Federal Reserve  Fed   while oil staged a turnaround to continue a one month rally 
At 15 34GMT  or 11 34AM ET  the Dow Jones slipped 3 points  or 0 02   while the S P 500 inched down 4 points  or 0 21   and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite traded up 18 points  or 0 37  
The U S  economy created only 160 000 nonfarm payrolls  NFP  in April  missing consensus estimates for 202 000 new job contracts and causing concern over the state of the labor market 
Experts were split on the reading of the data as some pointed to the stronger levels of wage growth 
Decidedly  the consensus felt the report would be a negative for the Federal Reserve  Fed  that is concerned about its stable employment mandate  though some suggested that the weakness in contracts could just be a one time blip on the radar 
Regardless  markets were quick to take a June rate hike off the table as the odds of a move dropped to just 6   according to CME Group data  compared to 10  before the publication of the nonfarm payrolls and 20  a month ago 
Furthermore  the disappointing NFP convinced both Goldman Sachs and  Barclays   LON BARC  to push back rate hike expectations 
The American firm took June off the table and pushed its call for the first increase back to September 
The British bank also forecast September for the first move  but reduced its expectations for hikes this year to just one from the prior two 
The first scheduled Fed appearances will not arrive until Monday with Chicago Fed chief Charles Evans set to participate in a panel at the International Financial Services Forum  while Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari will give a speech to the Economic Club of Minnesota

193133,414649,CVX,Travel Ban  Rig Counts And Shale,opinion,"Crude oil prices are trying to figure out the potential risk to the market because of the fallout from President Trump s travel ban and another rise in the U S  oil rig count  This comes as the trade puts on it biggest net long oil position in history as OPEC production cuts are exceeding market expectations 
OPEC naysayers are starting to eat their words as compliance to the historic production cuts are blowing people s minds  Saudi Arabia said that as of now compliance to the OPEC cuts are at a historically high 80   Geneva based Petro Logistics gives them a 75  score but that is still a record high the tanker tracking firm said that OPEC will reduce supply by 900 000 barrels a day  Eleven non members  led by Russia  are to curb their output in support 
Some are fearful that there may be some retaliation from the U S  travel ban from Syria  Iran  Iraq  Yemen  Libya  Sudan  and Somalia  What that retaliation might be is unclear  Iran has already vowed retaliation by banning U S  citizens to go into the country but other than that there is not much more they could do that would impact oil  Supposedly some terrorist group says that this is proof that the U S  is at war with Islam but considering the source  it is not likely to increase the terror risk that already exists from these evil wacko extremists group 
The Baker Hughes rig count for oil in the U S  rose by 15 in the past week to 566  the highest reading since November of 2015  While money seems to be pouring back into shale  larger  more expensive projects are not seeing the same type of investment  The U S  offshore rig count fell by 3 from last week to 21  which is 7 fewer than a year ago  The Wall Street Journal explains the recent shale boom but larger oil project doom 
The Journal writes that   Shale oil drillers are boldly raising annual budgets for a quick recovery  but international rivals chart a more cautious course  Big oil companies and smaller U S  upstarts are plotting sharply divergent paths as they plan spending for 2017 after a modest recovery in crude prices  While shale oil drillers are boldly raising annual budgets to revive drilling in Texas  New Mexico and North Dakota  international oil giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp  NYSE XOM    Chevron Corp   NYSE CVX   Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  PLC and BP  LON BP  are planning to hold back spending  charting a cautious path to recovery  One reason for tighter purse strings at the bigger companies is a concern that the recent rebound in oil prices has run out of steam or could even reverse if members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fail to follow through on promised output cuts  

The WSJ continues   Another threat  Even if OPEC does make good on its pledge  the smaller firms focusing on U S  wells could respond by replacing the barrels the cartel takes off the market  keeping a ceiling on oil prices over the longer term  The resilience of some shale oil producers during the energy downturn and their ability to once again tap capital markets as oil prices stabilize has added complexity to the decision making at their bigger brethren  which traditionally have been focused on multibillion dollar mega projects that start and stop slowly  The big firms are catering to the demands of their largely conservative investor base  That forces the companies to focus on profits and debt reduction to maintain share price stability and steady dividend payments   A must read in the Journal 

You see  the point of the article is that shale projects are easier to bring on line and easier to shut down  Yet for long term sustained production  what mis really needed is larger more sustainable projects that have a much slower decline rate than shale  The Journal says that   Investors in shale companies  meanwhile  are focused mainly on production growth  That gives these companies more flexibility to return to U S  oil fields but it leaves the weakest vulnerable when oil prices drop  as the more than 100 bankruptcies during the past two years showed  
The Journal points out that in all  spending at major oil companies is expected to decline by as much as 8  this year  per consulting firm Wood Mackenzie  So  it is not all good news when it comes to replacing OPEC cuts and meeting what may be the strongest oil demand growth in the world in over a decade 
Dow Jones said that the former Russian energy minister on Friday dismissed concerns that U S  shale oil companies may try to use production cuts by Russia and nations in the Middle East to swoop in and steal market share  saying the Americans know there are some no go zones  Igor Yusufov  Russia s energy minister from 2001 to 2004  said U S  shale producers wouldn t attempt to enter core OPEC and Russia markets where prices are too low for them to compete   The fact is that shale oil and gas are doing well markets that start from a certain price   he said in an email exchange with The Wall Street Journal 
For oil  we are on the side on money managers that are seeing that for oil there is a lot more upside potential than downside potential  We like the long side as we feel the floor for oil is pretty much here  The longer we stagnate the higher ultimately  we will go as investment in big oil projects are still on hold while demand expectations are rising

193134,414650,CVX,Dogs Of The Dow 2017  Know The Strategy s Bets,opinion,"The  strategy is one where investors select the ten stocks that have the highest dividend yield from the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Index  DJIA  after the close of business on the last trading day of the year  Once the ten stocks are determined  an investor invests an equal dollar amount in each of the ten stocks and holds them for the entire next year  The popularity of the strategy is its singular focus on dividend yield 
As we noted in a year end post  the  did outperform both the S P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index last year  However  the strategy is somewhat mixed from year to year in terms of outperforming the Dow index though  Over the last ten years  the Dogs of the Dow strategy has outperformed the Dow index in six of those ten years  For investors utilizing the strategy it is important to be aware of where ones bets are in terms of stock and sector exposure 
Essentially one months has passed in 2017 and the Dogs of the Dow strategy is underperforming both the Dow index and the S P 500 Index  Below is a table noting the year to date performance of the current Dogs  
In evaluating the performance difference  investors will note the largest detractor from performance is related to the energy sector  The 2017 Dow Dogs contain two energy stocks  Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX   In 2016 the energy sector was the best performing sector in the S P 500 Index  up 28   To date in 2017  for the S P 500 Index  energy is the second worst performing sector  down 2 5   followed by telecom stocks which are down 3 3  
The below table details the attribution analysis of the Dow Dogs to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index itself  As one can see  the Dogs of the Dow strategy is overweight to the energy and telecom sectors  thus  detracting from the strategy s year to date performance  Also of note is the absence of holdings in the Financial  Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors  In comparison to the S P 500 Index  the Dogs  and the Dow index itself for that matter  do not contain positions in utilities or REITs  
For investors then  if the Dogs of the Dow strategy is one being pursued  it is beneficial to know where the strategy s bets are in terms of stocks and sectors  As noted previously  the Dow Dogs contain no materials stock positions and this sector is the second best performing sector in the Dow Index and the S P 500 Index  Also  if one believes financial stocks can continue to perform well this year  the Dow Dog strategy is absent any financial positions  At the end of the day  investors will benefit knowing what they own and the economic exposure of these holdings ",2017-02-06,Blog of HORAN Capital Advisors,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dogs-of-the-dow-2017:-know-the-strategy-39;s-bets-200174753,200174753
193135,414651,CVX,5 Stocks To Watch In Recovering Energy Sector,opinion,"Volatility in the oil and gas markets continues  with prices plunging yet again in the recent chaos surrounding Greece s default negotiations and other global political uncertainties  But a rebound is inevitable  and Mackie Research s Bill Newman has his eye on companies that have managed to grow  step by step  even in hard times  In this interview with The Energy Report  Newman identifies companies with individual stories that will  in the end  defy the trend 
The Energy Report  With the collapse of the crude oil price and the timing of a recovery difficult to predict  the energy sector has fallen out of favor with investors  In the current oil and gas investment climate  are there any stocks that are immune to the negative sentiment and can still perform 
Bill Newman  We had low commodities prices over the past two years  which have really hit the junior oil and gas sector hard  alongside the corresponding valuations and share prices of many small cap energy companies but this is where the opportunity exists for investors today  The companies that have survived are generally underleveraged and it s been incredible how efficient they ve become in driving down drilling and completion costs  These companies have been able to really improve the well economics and are generating strong returns even at lower commodity prices  With a stronger and more stable oil price outlook expected in 2017  activity is starting to pick up and investors should be once again looking at those juniors that have survived the last two years  as they are positioned for healthy returns as the energy market firms back up and gets back to business 
TER  So which small cap energy companies do you like right now 
BN  Domestically  we like companies that are applying horizontal drilling and multi stage frac technology to unlock the Mannville oil and gas trend in Alberta  Generally  the well costs are low and the reserves sizable  so the economics are very attractive  The three Mannville players we like are Point Loma Resources  V PLX   Prairie Provident Resources  TO PPR  and Altura Energy  V ATU   All three are relatively new companies with clean balance sheets  are opportunity rich  and we expect them to show substantial growth this year 
TER  Let s take your first pick  Point Loma  What makes it stand out 
BN  Point Loma Resources  V PLX  is a new start up and it holds a huge concentrated land base of over 200 000 net acres in west central Alberta with a massive horizontal drilling inventory  over 400 horizontal locations   The company was founded by a strong management team and board that are from highly successful oil and gas start ups including Painted Pony  TO PPY   Thunder Energy  Surge Energy  TO SGY  and Ember Resources  Production has built very quickly from around 135 barrels of oil equivalent per day1 35 boe d  when it went public in July 2016 to an exit 2016 rate of 570 boe d  mostly through the tie in of behind pipe production volumes  In late January 2017  Point Loma announced an acquisition of an additional  400 boe d of production that came with over 55 000 net acres of land  which is a perfect fit with its existing assets  So we expect Point Loma will be producing over 1 100 boe d by the end of Q1 17 through the tie in of additional behind pipe volumes and increase to over 1 750 boe d by year end 
With so much land and a very large drilling inventory we expect production to continue to grow for many years  Through acquisitions and organic growth  Point Loma is targeting to grow to 10 000 boe d within four to five years and this team has done it before  Valuation wise  given the company is not well known as a new start up yet  Point Loma is one of the cheapest stocks in the domestic Canadian space today  trading far below where it should be and management s average cost is approximately  0 59 share  versus the current trading price of  0 58 share   which means investors today can buy in and be aligned with management as they create value in the future for shareholders 
TER  What about Prairie Provident  How is it different from Point Loma 
BN  Prairie Provident Resources  TO PPR  is also targeting Mannville plays within Alberta  The company is a little larger with current production of approximately 5 500 boe d and should be over 6 000 boe d by year end  Prairie Provident has an inventory of over 170 horizontal development drilling locations  which should generate stable growth for many years 
The company is cheap on a net asset value basis  In January the company released its year end 2016 reserves that showed a proven developed producing valued at approximately  1 14 share versus the current market price of around  0 72  In other words it is trading below its PDP value and a big discount to its proven plus probable value of  2 17 share  Prairie Provident is also cheap on a cash flow basis  trading at just a 2 5x multiple of our 2017 cash flow forecast  We think the discount will start to shrink as the company achieves its production targets and becomes better known by the market 
TER  What else can you tell us about Prairie Provident 
BN  Investors might be unaware that Prairie Provident holds over 230 000 net acres in the Saint Lawrence Lowlands in Quebec that is prospective for the Utica Shale  Later this year the Quebec government could release new regulations that govern the oil and gas industry that might lead to the drilling of the Utica  which was pretty much shut down in 2011  It s unclear how attractive or restrictive the new regulations will be but the Quebec play is really a free option for investors in the Prairie Provident asset base 
TER  And Altura  What s its story 
BN  Altura Energy  V ATU  was founded by high profile board members  including Darren Gee  president   CEO of Peyto Exploration  TO PEY   and Brian Laverne  president   CEO of Storm Resources  V SRX   and is run by an experienced CEO  David Burghardt  ex Vermillion Energy  
Altura s assets are located in east central Alberta and the company is targeting oil within the Upper Mannville Group  specifically the Sparky and Rex reservoirs  Management has applied its extensive experience in horizontal drilling and completion technology to achieve the lowest well costs with industry leading rates of return  The well economics are great because the Sparky and Rex reservoirs have large oil in place  with low drilling and operating costs 
Like Point Loma and Prairie Provident  Altura is a growth story focused on the Mannville  The company has taken production from about 400 bbl d last year to over 900 boe d currently and it should exit this year with over 1 350 boe d  And it is in good shape financially with no debt and current working capital of about  9 million  and it should fund most of its 2017 drilling program with cash flow 
The next catalyst should be the release of its reserves report on February 24  Altura had a 100  drilling success rate in 2016 so reserves should look good 
TER  What about international companies  What s your strategy there 
BN  Internationally  we like companies that can grow production through lower risk appraisal and development plays  as well as those international companies with exposure to massive high impact higher reward resources plays or exploration and appraisal upside for speculative appeal  The attractiveness to invest in small cap international energy companies is gaining exposure to plays that can potentially provide investors to multi bagger upside  targeting resources in the 50 million to billion plus barrel size 
So we like Condor Petroleum  TO CPI   The company has a 100  interest in licenses in Thrace Basin in Western Turkey and in the Pre Caspian Basin in Kazakhstan  Condor has made discoveries in both countries and has recently started light oil production of 500 bbl d in Kazakhstan  We expect first natural gas production of about 10 million cubic feet per day  10 mmcf d  in Turkey to start up in the second quarter of this year  That should give the company a cash flow base to fund more development in both countries 
The natural gas field in Turkey is called the Poyraz Ridge  and Condor just finished a very successful four well drilling program to develop and appraise the field  All four wells were successful and Condor discovered natural gas at a greater depth than was previous known  so it has substantially increased the mapped reservoir area  The company also found two new deeper reservoirs that could have significant resource potential  so we expect a substantial increase in the reserves of Poyraz Ridge field  Also later this year  Condor plans to drill the Yakamoz 1 exploration prospect that is structurally similar to Poyraz Ridge field  which is only 2 km away 
TER  What s the high impact upside with Condor 
BN  The big exploration plays are in Kazakhstan  Condor holds a 100  interest in the Zharkamys West 1 block  which is in western Kazakhstan in the Pre Caspian Basin  The basin has super giant oil fields including the 13 billion barrel Kashagan field and the 9 billion barrel Tengiz field  Later this year Condor plans to drill the Korumbet NW exploration well targeting an intra salt structure that has the potential to hold a recoverable resource of 45 million barrels  But the real upside is the pre salt play  The cost of the well could be  25 million  so Condor will need to secure a partner before it can try to drill a potential company maker 
TER  Any other international names with big upside 
BN  Madalena Ventures  V MVN  has certainly had its ups and downs in the downturn of the energy market  but we think the company is finally turning the corner  In January  the company farmed out a 55  interest in the Coir n Amargo Sur Este block to Pan American Energy  Madalena keeps a 35  stake in this prime Vaca Muerta shale asset and received US 10 million in cash and a carry on a two well drilling program  The first high impact horizontal well targeting the Vaca Muerta shale should spud in the first quarter  The deal with Pan American has not only put Madalena back in business  it should also get the market excited again as horizontal drilling begins in the Vaca Muerta shale and there is the potential for a carried deep gas test by Pan American Energy 
TER  Is the investment situation in Argentina improving 
BN  The situation has definitely improved since Argentina s new president  Mauricio Macri  took office in December 2015  Macri cut farm export taxes  lowered personal incomes taxes and reduced utility subsides  He lifted currency controls  which allowed the Argentina peso to float for the first time since January 2002  The Macri government also lifted restriction of capital movements out of the country  In January 2017  the government announced that it will maintain the natural gas price at US 7 50 mmbtu  The federal government and the provincial government of Neuqu n reached an agreement with the labor unions to reduce costs in exchange for increased investment  As a result  YPF  NYSE YPF   Total  Shell  LON RDSa   KL SLRS   Chevron  NYSE CVX   Downer  AX DOW  and Madalena s new partner Pan American Energy pledged to invest a combined US 5 billion in 2017 in the development of the Vaca Muerta shale play  increasing to US 15 billion per year starting in 2018 
TER  What s the direct impact on Madalena 
BN  Madalena has a number of high quality blocks Argentina and is actively looking for a deal to appraise and monetize the huge potential resource on its blocks  In November 2015  the company released the results of an independent resource estimate of the Vaca Muerta and Lower Agrio shale within two key blocks within the Neuqu n basin in Argentina  The total net unrisked contingent and prospective resource within the Coiron Amargo and Curamhuele blocks was estimated at over 1 5 billion boe  The improved political and fiscal situation in Argentina and the massive injection of new capital into the energy sector can only help MVN secure a sale as a potential takeout target or joint venture on one or more of its assets  which would be a huge catalyst for the stock  At the current market price the company trades at a deep discount to the value of its conventional producing assets alone  giving no value to the potential of the Vaca Muerta shale and Lower Agrio Shale resources that the company holds

193136,414652,CVX,Aramco s IPO  How Will It Affect Oil Markets  3 Key Questions,opinion,"Additional news is emerging about Saudi Aramco s upcoming IPO suggesting it s possible that the process will take longer than initially thought  Till now  markets have been speculating the IPO will occur during either the second or third quarter of 2018  However  despite the delays  it is becoming increasingly clear that both the company and the Saudi royal family are serious about opening Saudi Arabia s prized business to the public 
Underwriters have just been selected  J P  Morgan  Morgan Stanley and HSBC  reports the   and oil reserve auditors  Gaffney  Cline and Associates  according to   have started auditing Aramco s oil reserve data  As the process continues  all energy investors need to be asking themselves the following key questions  because an initial public offering of this size and scope will inevitably impact energy markets 

1  Will Aramco truly remake itself into a western style international energy company 
The Wall Street Journal recently  that some Saudi officials are pushing for Aramco to go public sooner rather than later  On the other hand  other officials are advocating for more time for the company to follow through with financial reforms recommend by the banks  These changes  such as the rate and means at which the Saudi government taxes Aramco  are necessary to show investors that Aramco is a profitable operation that operates more like BP  NYSE BP   ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  than like the National Iranian Oil Company 
Some argue that Saudi Arabia will take Aramco public without completing the restructuring because Saudi Arabia needs   However  the evidence suggests that even with continued low oil prices  Saudi Arabia s foreign  and  success in bond sales will provide the country with sufficient cash to meet its budgetary needs for years to come 
Saudi Arabia will likely stay the course with Aramco s IPO and take the time necessary to restructure the company to achieve maximum investor interest  This will serve Aramco and Saudi Arabia best in the long term  Furthermore  Aramco will need to meet particular disclosure  bookkeeping and financial standards  depending on the exchanges on which Aramco lists   According to a recent Wall Street Journal   Aramco is now rumored to be considering New York  London and Toronto exchanges in addition to Tadawul  the Saudi exchange   This alone indicates a need to move toward the style of a traditional international energy company  rather than a national oil company 

2  Will Aramco reshape itself into a multinational energy conglomerate or will it focus its mission primarily on oil and gas 
Reuters recently reported that Aramco executives are debating whether the company should reshape itself into an  or retain  on oil and gas  This discussion specifically concerns whether Aramco will venture into the petrochemicals sphere or whether its downstream operations will remain focused on oil refining  While Aramco is active in the refining business globally  it currently maintains shares in some petrochemical  run by the Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Company  SABIC  but has not made significant ventures into this sector on its own 
Some argue that concentrating on oil and gas operations will make Aramco shares more valuable because the company s focus and resources will not be diverted to areas of lesser expertise  Others  however  argue that unless Aramco expands into other sectors  its growth potential will ultimately be limited  An Aramco push into the petrochemicals business could shake up that field with Aramco s cash resources and easy access to crude and refined petroleum products 
With respect to alternative energy  Aramco has long been an investor in energy technologies  alternative and conventional  In fact  Aramco was an early consumer of solar power technology  Because Aramco already invests in these technologies there is no indication that the IPO will change its strategy or alter this market 

3  How will the IPO affect oil prices 
There is some speculation that the Saudis are deliberately pushing Aramco s IPO back because   OPEC s agreement to cut oil production  oil prices continue to   Higher oil prices would certainly help raise the price of Aramco shares at the IPO 
One indication that the IPO may be further off than previously thought is that Saudi Arabia  via OPEC  has yet to show urgency to significantly raise oil prices in 2017  And just as urgency for higher prices might indicate an impending IPO  investors should keep close tabs on Saudi Arabia s plans for the Aramco IPO  because that could be a sign that the price of oil will indeed rise ",2017-02-22,"Ellen R.

193148,414664,CVX,Energy Market Wars  The OPEC Anachronism And How You Can Profit,opinion,"I wrote an article two years ago titled  Oil and Gas  USA 1  OPEC 0   Here s an update 

Things have only gotten better for those of us lucky enough to live in North America or Australia 
While Iran out negotiated the Saudis  it only gained a small advantage 
But OPEC  OPEC is an anachronism that doesn t yet know it 

I began that earlier article with these words 

 OPEC doesn t stand a chance 
 Since most OPEC nations can pump all the oil and gas they need using first  or second generation technology  they fail to  utilize 4thor 5thgeneration role technology to decrease their costs   The point  when investing in energy companies  is not to ask merely   Is the price of oil up or down   When investing  we are seeking firms that can grow their revenues and their earnings  thus increasing their intrinsic value  through good times and bad  So the more important question to answer is  At what point can company A or country X make a reasonable return so that its earnings grow at whatever the current price of oil is  
 Answering that question for individual companies like those in America  Canada  Australia and much of Europe and the rest of the world  involves determining the price the company receives for its efforts  and beyond that  what its costs are to service its debt  pay its employees  upgrade equipment  etc  For these independent companies  once they have satisfied their creditors and employees  the rest is effectively divided among its shareholders via dividends  buybacks or an increasing stock price 
 But for OPEC nations  which typically have  just one state owned monolith  the answer is very different  These behemoths exist to provide revenue for the massive welfare states the rulers of these nations have created   They need more profit in order  to keep their grip on power  lavish largess upon their cronies  and provide food  fuel and other subsidies to their restive subjects in order to keep them in line  

These state monopoly producers might be able to  pump  oil at a lower cost but the price they need to stay in power far exceeds what independent oil and gas companies need to pay their bills and keep their shareholders happy  And  thanks to OPEC  private companies have cut their cost of production by up to 50      since I wrote the original article two years ago  This is a tsunami that OPEC cannot hold back 
Non governmental producers of oil and gas  especially in the US and Canada  have only to satisfy their shareholders  not the entire welfare state   Except for ridiculously high taxes  of course  but that s a subject for a different article  
Here is what governments with state owned monopolies need the price of oil to be in order to balance their budgets  Saudi Arabia may be able to extract oil for  7 a barrel  but they need it to sell for roughly  100 a barrel in order to break even after paying off the royal family  the cronies  the bureaucrats and via massive subsidies a restive populace 

OPEC is whistling past their own graveyard  Their level of na vet  dooms some  their arrogance the others  And now  after the much feted  agreement  of November 30  they face the possibility  likelihood  that almost all of them will agree to one thing but will do another 
I liken this to The Prisoners  Dilemma  It is a very real interrogation tool and famous in game theory whenever two or more perpetrators  or other actors like individuals  companies  and nations  are placed in a situation where their courses of action are limited and their choices critical to their future 
In the traditional example of the Prisoners  Dilemma  two suspects have been apprehended fleeing the scene of a heinous crime  They are immediately separated to prevent them from concocting a mutual story  are placed in separate holding cells  and then in separate interrogation rooms  When interrogated  they each have a choice dilemma  whether to confess  implicating their partner in crime  or protest their innocence 
No matter what their partner is doing in the other room  each one can improve their own chances of more favorable treatment by confessing   as long as they fear the  other guy  is going to confess as well  And   even if Perp  2 keeps silent and fails to confess  then Perp  1 can obtain the better treatment accorded a state s witness by confessing  It is this dilemma that helps explain why guilty prisoners often confess  Honor among thieves is a nice catch phrase  but it more often than not breaks down when hoisted upon the horns of this dilemma 
This dilemma is faced every day in economics  in business  and especially in geopolitics  For instance  let s say there are two countries selling the exact same product  We ll call them Saudi Arabia and Russia  Each must decide on a pricing and production strategy  They best achieve their same goal of maximum national revenue when they both charge a high price  Their decision is complicated  however  because theirs is a business where supply and demand dominate pricing 
Lots of gas and oil sloshing around  The price will be lower  Too little available when and where needed  Buyers are willing to pay up  If Perp  1  let s call them Russia  wants to sell their product to a country that is willing to collude with them by hiding the true amount purchased  let s call them China  then Perp  1 will gain market share at the expense of Perp  2  In a commodity type market  market share is critical  For simplicity  let s say at price  x  both Russia and Saudi Arabia sell  15 billion per month of gas and oil  If one undercuts price  x   under the table  by 10  it will lose a little revenue but it will increase its market share at the expense of the other that is still selling the agreed upon amount of production  Since there is more supply now  the price will likely decline  harming all other gas and oil exporters 
Let s say Russia decides to act in its own best interest and raise production above their allotment under the agreement because they can get it across the border into China and no one allegedly monitoring production can see it  By selling more gas and oil  even at a slightly lower price  Russia makes a much bigger contribution to their GNP and no one is the wiser  Of course  it doesn t have to be Russia  It could also be Venezuela  Iraq  or any other country  Iran has been cheating all along so  even with their uncapped until they catch up agreement  it might still cheat just to stay in practice 
In this example  by producing more but selling at a lower price  Russia wins business and increases its GNP at the expense of its rivals  er  teammates  This low price   more  hidden  production strategy is akin to the prisoner s confession  and the high price   hewing to the agreement production level is like keeping silent  Call the former cheating  and the latter cooperation 
So cheating is like a prisoner confessing  cheaters get the upper hand  The problem is  even though their monitoring doesn t detect Russian sales to China  Saudi Arabia notices that the known  not hidden  supply is still keeping a lid on prices and may even worsen  they decide to cheat a little as well  When both cheat the result is worse than when everyone cooperates 
Compound this possible  likely   outcome with cheating by more than just two members of the agreement  Add to that the uncapped production levels for Libya and Nigeria and the special accommodation for Iran  And  who knows  Maybe China will became an exporter of oil itself and claim it came from Chinese production or  more likely  prop up North Korea with all the extra oil it doesn t need for its strategic reserves  Now we have a prisoners  dilemma on steroids 
Where does this leave OPEC members  OPEC members cheat  Russia cheats  They always have  they always will  It is a cultural way of looking at the world that goes beyond the rationalism of understanding the prisoners  dilemma  and adds another solidifying element to it  Many cultures believe that win wins are possible  Many others believe life is a zero sum game as in  For me to win  you must lose  
Many OPEC nations and Russia will negotiate in bad faith  cheat on production  slip a few  million  barrels off to a known miscreant in whose interest it is not to divulge the source of their fuels  and do whatever it takes to  win   Signers of the agreement will likely cooperate more when their actions are more easily detected and less when actions are less easily detected  And industries with fewer competitors providing the product and strong barriers to entry are more likely to be collusive   This is why free market capitalism will always provide a more effective barrier to collusion and a better price for consumers than oligopolies  monopolies and socialist state run enterprises  
The problem with a  if you cheat  then I will cheat  strategy is that it is subject to misinterpretation  If Perp  2 only cheats if they righteously indignantly believe Perp  1 cheated  but Perp  1 really didn t cheat  then innocent actions misinterpreted as cheating increase the risk of setting off successive rounds of  unwarranted  retaliation 
OPEC has jumped the shark  And other sharks are now in the water  Saudi Arabia could once dominate both OPEC and world oil prices  Russia  Canada and the USA are now roughly equivalent peer competitors to the Saudis  with many more nations like Norway and Australia rapidly closing the gap  Of course  there may be collateral benefits from this change  As the Saudis reflect on their changing role  maybe they will broaden their economy and reconsider their support and export of Wahabist Salafist extremism 
Whether they do or not  the place to invest is in US and Canadian shale oil and gas producers using horizontal fracturing and other modern techniques to extract product even from fields once declared dry  Just not right now 
OPEC members cheat  Russia cheats  They always have  they always will  It is cultural as well as economic   If I win  you must lose   For this reason I see another decline in the price of oil and gas as supply mysteriously rises 
Of course  we need to remember that since 2013  US and other free market producers have lowered their costs of production substantially  so much so that in many places  companies are actually profitable with oil at  50 a barrel  Heck  in the uber prolific Permian Basin  costs are down as low as  35 a barrel

193149,414665,CVX,In 8 Weeks Gas And Oil Stocks Will Be Cheaper  What To Buy Then,opinion,"There is entirely too much optimism over the recent accord to curtail production signed by Russia  OPEC and some tertiary non OPEC producers  Mexico  a non OPEC member  attended the meeting and set its production target at 1 94 million barrels per day  bpd  output  which OPEC hailed as solidarity  This was not in solidarity with OPEC  It was because bureaucracy and neglect have meant declining production from the state owned oil giant Pemex  anyway 
The United States did not attend  nor did Canada  And neither agreed to slow their production  Tellingly  neither did China or Brazil  Why is this important 
Well  let s see  the United States is the most technologically advanced gas and oil producing nation  where companies are able in some areas like the Permian Basin to make a profit pumping oil at  35  Canada has the largest oil sands resources  where oil is effectively mined  It is processed  not drilled for 
Assuming breakthroughs in technology allow such mining to keep the environment safe as it is mined  there is no exploration and production risk  it is all right there  out in the open  This  along with its conventional oil reserves  places Canada among the top 4 or 5 nations in terms of oil resources  And China probably has the most shale gas resources of any nation 
    Canada is among the top 4 or 5       China probably has the most shale gas reserves    What gives here  Don t we know who has what  Isn t this  settled science  
Absolutely not  It all depends upon what your definition of  is  is  Or  in this case  proven reserves  probable reserves  potential reserves  technically recoverable reserves  and many other variations on a theme  See the chart below for a good example of the more commonly used terms 


The US Energy Information Administration  EIA  is the source for the estimate that places China  1 in shale gas resources  with 1 quadrillion  115 trillion cubic feet  tcf  of wet shale natural gas  That s a whole lot  For comparison  Argentina comes in second at 802 tcf  Algeria third at 709 tcf and the USA just fourth at 623 tcf  with Canada and Mexico nipping at our heels for the next two positions 
The EIA also says that the USA is  1 in tight oil  from shale  resources with 78 billion barrels  bbl  followed by Russia at 74 bbl and China at 32 bbl  However  you must always check the fine print when reading such predictions  In this case  the EIA was looking at  unproved technically recoverable reserves  
 Technically recoverable  only means that we have the technology to extract the product  It doesn t mean it is economically feasible to do so 
That s why  if you go to 20 different independent sources  as opposed to the hundreds of websites that just publish the EIA s numbers  you ll find 20 different estimates  Worse  the 2015 estimate from the same source may be radically different in 2016  even within the same category of technically proven or any other reserves  The landscape changes  as do the reserve predictions  based upon ever better technologies 
If we are serious about determining who today not tomorrow has the wherewithal to deliver the energy and not go broke doing it  we need to look at the proven  or at least proven and probable    P2   technically and economically recoverable reserves  those which can be recovered and sold at current market prices 
Who REALLY Sits in the Catbird Seat When it Comes to Energy 
Understanding the above shifts the favorable balance of power away from the Middle East  including Iran  where governments must buy their citizens  loyalty with massive subsidies and therefore must sell the oil or its gas equivalent at somewhere between  60 and  130 a barrel  It also places Russia in a whole new light  given its extreme over dependence on exporting oil and gas  Russia is economically a third world nation dependent on selling the commodities its massive land mass provides and a first world nation in the technical prowess of its people 
China looks very good from an energy standpoint if you look only at its technically recoverable reserves  But to be economic  shale production needs copious amounts of water 
China is one of the least secure nations from a water standpoint  Most of their water comes from the Tibetan Plateau  which is why there is no chance  not even a snowball s chance in hell  that the Chinese autocracy will ever willingly relinquish control of Tibet  You simply cannot separate realpolitik from economics  No matter how much shale gas China has  or doesn t have  it doesn t have the water to get it out of the ground economically  at least not in any size 
But China has all that Russian gas coming in  right  If anyone can remember all the way back to November 2014  certain US newspapers opined that Russia  in a brilliant coup  had agreed to sell China 2 trillion cubic feet of gas over a 30 year period  Once again  many moaned about how  them there Gawdless Rooskies and Chicoms were getting together to end run around the US   Not really  Did I mention you cannot separate realpolitik from economics  It all depends upon pricing 
At this point  the Russians demand  X  and the Chinese are only willing to pay  X minus Y   Russian monopolies need to satisfy the State because they only exist at the pleasure of the State  Ditto Chinese monopolies  So if there s no give in this give and take  who benefits 
That would be US and Canadian producers  An early harbinger of this may be that the largest suppliers of LPG to China are already US companies  more nimble and more capable of controlling their costs  pricing and  indeed  their destiny than are the Russian and Chinese monopolies  I imagine we ll see a day when Russia lowers its prices or China increases its deals with the US  Canada  and Australia  Their rising consumption and attempts to wean themselves from coal leave them no other choice 
Energy firms in the US and Canada  along with those from nations like Australia  the UK and Norway  have huge advantages over lumbering  state owned behemoths that must satisfy the state s demand for income  Companies in the US can negotiate leases with separate individuals who own the rights to what lies sub surface on their property  Some will always be ready to deal  that is never the case when one arm of The State is negotiating with another arm of The State 
The US and Canada are home to the most advanced and most numerous independent operators as well as the drilling contractors with the most experience  expertise and advanced technology  We have an amazing pipeline and distribution capability that will only get better as we continue to develop our infrastructure  And finally  we have water  If a nation like China truly wants to increase production by hydraulic fracturing  they need water 
I ve spent 30 years analyzing renewable and non renewable energy  but another area of research and writing has been about water  Welcome to the New World  i e  the Western Hemisphere 
Led by Canada  the entire Western Hemisphere is blessed with fresh water  So is the Lucky Country  Australia  and neighbor New Zealand   as is Russia and all of Scandinavia  Canada gets about 88 000 cubic meters of water  or some 88 000 000 liters per inhabitant  of  total renewable water resources  every year  Even the much more populous USA gets nearly 10 000 cubic meters per person 
China  Thanks mostly to Tibet  all of 2 000 cubic meters or so 


So What s All This About The OPEC Deal Collapsing 
Prices can be held artificially high for only so long  OPEC and Russia are hoping it lasts long enough to enter into long term contracts with buyers with deep pockets who are willing to stand by their deal if prices collapse  Good luck with that 
Gas pricing and oil pricing has been  is and will always be  about supply and demand  On the supply side  hydraulic   operated by the pressure of a fluid   fracturing has multiplied U S  production by an order of magnitude  Canada has all the water it needs to develop the oil sands   and is an honest partner that stands by its commitments  Mexico has opened its offshore areas to US and multi national players 
It s a new day  a new dawn for North American energy firms  Supply is increasing in the most stable  nearest to home parts of the world  Demand  beyond a few successful economies  is not keeping pace 
What OPEC and Russia came up with is a temporary fix to their long term problems  a bureaucratic  statist plan to try to disrupt true market dynamics  Worse  it depends upon honor among thieves 
History bodes against them  OPEC members have consistently cheated their within OPEC competitors  And now  there are 11 non OPEC nations  most run as socialist and or autocratic enterprises  whose economies are sick and will be sicker unless world gas and oil demand outstrips world supply  Non OPEC signatories like Evo Morales s Bolivia and  The Sultan s  Brunei control their nations with whatever they have and for most  what they have is oil or gas 
This keeps their otherwise restive populations at arm s length and allow the Friends of  Fill in the Blank  to live the good life  Production caps will last until the first one of these feels the pain of not having enough vigorish to distribute in the form of subsidies and bought and paid for loyalty 
The worst is likely yet to come for many of these autocrats of the negotiating table  99  of the charts and research on  who has the oil  tell us Venezuela  with just under 300 billion barrels  bbl  of proven reserves  is the world s luckiest nation when it comes to oil resources  But you now know there is a huge difference between proven reserves and a nation s ability to technologically and economically get that oil out of the ground 
Economically  Venezuela is a basket case  Ever since the United Socialist Party of Venezuela  under the reign of Hugo Chavez  took control of the government in 2002  the country has gone backwards  It will take years before any outside firm will be willing to take the country s word that they will be repaid for fronting all exploration and production costs on their own 
The world s second largest owner of proven reserves  according to the consensus  is Saudi Arabia  Where to begin here 
Of Saudi Arabia s 10 million plus barrels per day of production  they expend 1 million on desalination   In the 1970s there was a subterranean reservoir the size of Lake Erie under the Saudi Arabian desert  The Kingdom bled it dry trying to prove they could become self sufficient in agriculture  producing wheat at 3 times what the market would pay   Now they have launched a bold new campaign to reinvent themselves yet again 
But every person they educate or give an opportunity to raises those people up and places them closer to parity with the extended royals  The Saudis fear this more than they fear low oil prices  Better to keep buying loyalty with subsidies 
I could go on with the travails of many of these producing nations  I think by now you see why I believe the  deal  reached at the end of 2016 will last every bit as long as other previous ones  You can t replace the law of supply and demand 
Instead  let me share with you what I believe is the most realistic appraisal of who really has the most oil reserves in the world  And also who has more than we currently know in natural gas  And the most that is technically and economically retrievable 
Rystad Energy is an independent energy consultancy based in Norway but has offices in the UK  Singapore  Russia  Brazil and the US  I have followed their work with great interest since 2010 or so  Their conclusions may well shake up what we know  and don t know  about real reserves 
Before I provide their conclusions  please note that they aren t even assessing whether these reserves are economically viable  or even proven  Even standing on their own as just  reserves  they conclude  as you can see from this chart  that Venezuela is a distant 8th in total reserves   and that the USA is really the top dog globally 
Rystad estimates that the U S  holds 264 billion barrels of oil  more than half of which are located in shale  That is more oil than is found in Russia  and considerably more than Saudi Arabia 
Rystad disagrees with the EIA estimate of Venezuela s reserves of 298 bbls  noting that there simply has not been enough work done to verify that those reserves are actually there  The numbers are based upon outdated and likely wildly optimistic projections that if something is found at point A on the periphery and point B in the middle and point C at the other periphery  that all in between must be exactly like those three points  Seismic technology has shown the folly of such linear thinking  Instead  Rystad estimates that Venezuela only has about 95 billion barrels  which includes Rystad s estimate for as yet undiscovered oil fields 
Moreover  Rystad notes accurately that there is no global standard to measure oil reserves from one country to another  Some countries report proven reserves  using conservative estimates from existing oil fields  Others  like Venezuela   include  undiscovered  reserves 
Rystad has done the heavy lifting and applied a similar set of metrics to all countries  It doesn t matter whether their metrics are the ones that will be used in the future if better ones are found as technologies change  Theirs is the first apples to apples comparison  rendering the process both more transparent and more accurate  Too many  authoritative  reports like BP s Statistical Review  which many analysts rely upon  are nothing more than a compilation of what the host nations say 
You say you want to see more jobs created in America  Rystad s research concludes that Texas alone could have 60 billion barrels of oil  By the way  Rystad s rankings change when reviewing only the  proved and probable  category  also called 2P  In this case  Saudi Arabia comes out on top with 120 bbls and the entire US is dropped to 40 bbls 
I am personally far more optimistic  I debunked the Peak Oil argument in a paper 30 years ago   it applies to individual wells  not to the entire planet  So far I ve been correct  And I imagine  as our seismic and 4 D mapping improve  as do our recovery techniques  it will be the same story for the next 100 years  by which time solar and wind will have made a strong addition to the energy production picture 
Is There Anything Special To Buy 
My readers must be tired of me saying   Yes  but not yet   Let me amend that statement to  Not yet  but yes  
I have made the case in previous articles  as well as in this article  that OPEC members cheat  Russia cheats  Every tin horn autocrat with oil in his backyard will cheat as long as he can get away with it  So I am still biding my time  I still spend hours every day poring over articles  research  10 Ks  and such to make certain I understand the energy business inside and out 
Nothing has changed my opinion that US and Canadian firms are the companies I most want to invest in  Nothing has changed my belief that the mid tier firms are likely to offer the best combination of cash flow  survivability  agility and alacrity 
My short list is therefore comprised of the following firms I will buy when the time is right  I believe that time is likely to be in this quarter as the OPEC Russia et al agreement falls apart and oil prices decline temporarily at the end of heating season in the Northern Hemisphere  I may place smaller orders above these prices but here are my new  if I can steal them here  I will  prices as well  All are GTC

193151,414667,CVX,4 Things To Watch When ExxonMobil And Chevron Report Earnings,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
For oil traders 2016 was an overly full year  rife with opportunity  uncertainty and even some market chaos  With the price of oil ranging from  26 to  55  avid traders had ample room to take advantage of or be taken advantage of by the situation and the lack of clarity  OPEC was active as well  trying repeatedly  and eventually successfully  to negotiate a production cut that would be adhered to by both cartel members and non OPEC countries 
Oil price moves are often broadly reflected in the stock market across a wide range of sectors  But for oil and gas companies the impact has obviously been much more severe  The S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production Select Industry Index has almost perfectly mirrored crude oil price fluctuations in 2016 

Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX   two of the world s biggest integrated oil and gas companies  were also affected by the recent oil crisis which has pulled each of their share prices down  But now that the price of oil appears to be on steadier footing  oil and gas majors are a more reliable investment  Which company  then  is the better play 

Chevron reports earnings on Friday  January 27 before the market opens  and Wall Street expects it to post an EPS of  0 63 on  32 6 billion in revenue 

ExxonMobil will report on Tuesday January 31  before the open  and is expected to report EPS of  0 71 on  60 6 billion revenue 

1  The Businesses
Both Exxon and Chevron operate globally  with drilling platforms and refineries situated all over the world  Exxon and Chevron  like many companies in the sector  divide their income streams into two separate segments  Upstream  under which exploration and drilling operations are classified  and Downstream  which includes refineries and marketing of the actual product  Exxon also has significant revenue from a third segment that Chevron lacks  chemicals operations 
Both company s earnings have taken a beating over the past nine months  Exxon s Upstream earnings have dwindled from  6 2 billion in the first nine months of 2015 to just  838 million over the first nine months of 2016  Downstream earnings have suffered too  falling from  5 2 billion to just over  3 billion  Exxon s chemicals division  however  which refines and produces petrochemicals for a variety of industries  grew from  3 4 billion to  3 7 billion 
Chevron has done worse  Its Upstream earnings went from a loss of  600 million over the first nine months of 2015 to a staggering loss of  3 4 billion over the first nine months of 2016  CVX s Downstream earnings mirrored the similar decline in Exxon s segment   6 5 billion to just over  3 billion over the past nine months 
Chevron s overall earnings are now negative  All of Exxon s divisions remain profitable 

2  Proven Reserves
Each company s most recent end of year reserves report  released at the beginning of 2016  showed that Exxon had 24 8 billion BOE  barrels of oil equivalent   while Chevron had 11 2 BOE  Taking into account the number of shares outstanding for each stock  calculations show that both companies have 5 9 BOE Share of proven reserves 
However  while Chevron took a  2 6 billion write down in Q2 2016 something many oil companies did following the downturn in crude prices Exxon hasn t yet taken any write downs  The fact that Exxon didn t recorded any write downs thus far is peculiar  So much so that the   As a result  Exxon could de book some 4 6 billion barrels from its assets  hurting its BOE Share to a point at which it would trail Chevron  These write downs will make for an interesting end of year report for both companies 

3  Levels of Debt
Since the oil and gas sector is capital intensive  requiring billions in expenditures for exploration and extraction  highly leveraged companies can go bankrupt in the face of a sharp drop in company revenues and earnings  And because the industry s revenues and earnings are severely affected by volatile oil prices this metric is twice as important when evaluating companies operating in the oil and gas sector 
Exxon has  46 billion of debt  while Chevron s debt totals  45 billion  However  Exxon s situation is actually better  it is the larger of the two companies with a  352 billion market cap  versus Chevron s  219 billion valuation  These numbers help to better comprehend the debt figure via two ratios  Debt to Equity and Debt to EBITDA  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  
Debt to  Equity shows that the company is not relying excessively on debt relative to the value of their shareholder equity  Exxon has a ratio of 0 271  while Chevron has a slightly higher ratio of 0 310  Both are reasonable 
Looking at Debt to EBIDTA measures the company s ability to repay the debt  Once again Exxon leads by a wider margin with a ratio of 1 4 to Chevron s 2 6  which indicates that Chevron is leveraged twice as much as Exxon  However  Chevron s 2 6 ratio isn t considered excessive or dangerous 

4  Profitability
Almost every single widely used profitability metric points to the same conclusion  Exxon is  overall  a more efficient and more profitable company  Return on equity  Exxon leads with 5 2  over Chevron s  1   Return on invested capital  4 1  for Exxon  compared to  0 78  for Chevron  Return on assets  2 63  versus  0 57   once again in Exxon s favor  It s been like this for the past ten years   Exxon has historically almost always shown better returns than Chevron 
As for margins  until June 2015  Chevron actually led Exxon for the major part of the last decade  But low oil prices took their toll on Chevron s TTM margins  Since the end of 2014  CVX went from an operating margin of 14 7  to  5 8   and from a profit margin of 8 9  to  1 34   Over the same timeframe XOM s operating and profit margins shrunk from 12 5  to 4 5  and from 7 8  to 3 9  respectively 

Conclusion
Both companies are very stable  They re two of the largest players in the industry  with good reason  Their managements are capable  opportunities are often seized through strategic acquisition  and there are no immediate red flags to worry about  Both companies value their dividend programs and offer relatively attractive yields  3 7  for CVX  3 5  for XOM  
On paper  Exxon appears to be the safer and better choice  There s just one problem   share appreciation 
Exxon has been trading in the  80 to  90 per share range for almost a decade  While the company has had its ups and downs  providing good returns for those who took advantage of the volatility  buy and hold stakeholders haven t been properly rewarded for the past ten years  The share price seldom pushed beyond  95  and when it did it never held at that level for longer than a few months 
Chevron has better prospects in this regard  and has also had a faster recovery from the oil price collapse due to its more focused business model  Because it lacks a big chemicals operation like Exxon s it has less to anchor it down when the price of oil rises  Exxon may have performed better than Chevron when oil prices were at their lowest  but the almost over diversification of Exxon prevents it from achieving considerable growth 
We believe that as oil prices begin to recover  Chevron will head higher  Exxon may be the safer play  but given recent commodity market conditions and the way the equity market loves pricing stocks according to potential growth  Chevron might just be the better investment ",2017-01-26,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-things-to-watch-when-exxon-and-chevron-report-earnings-200173556,200173556

Oil E P Stocks Catch Wave of Optimism
The deal by members of the OPEC oil cartel to cut output is expected to bring much needed stability to the market with prices set to improve steadily  Multinational oil enterprises  on the back of greater certainty  will now be able revive spending on drilling activities 
While all crude focused stocks stand to gain from the OPEC driven oil rally  companies in the exploration and production  E P  sector are the best placed  as they will be able to extract more value for their products 
Moreover  the firms boast of a conservative balance sheet with enough cash on hand and manageable leverage  This provides them ample flexibility to make acquisitions or grow internally  Moreover  driven by operational efficiencies  these entities have been able to reduce unit costs    an impressive achievement amid the low realization scenario 
Apart from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Diamondback Energy Inc   FANG   we advocate the likes of Matador Resources Co   MTDR  and Newfield Exploration Co   NFX   You can see  
MLPs Offer an Attractive Choice
The Master Limited Partnership  MLP  business model looked like a goner earlier this year  As oil prices plummeted to a 13 year low in Feb  the Alerian MLP index dived 30  in just five weeks  However  market sentiment has improved considerably thereafter 
The major advantage of the MLP is that the assets that these partnerships own   oil and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities   are largely run on volumes  not prices  This implies that the firms get remuneration to transport the same volumes irrespective of the price of the commodity 
Given the current weaknesses in petroleum stocks  MLPs are probably the best method of investing in the sector  They also offer liquidity and tax benefits  which add to their appeal  This is why these stocks would make good additions to your portfolio 
With capital market access remaining tough for most sector components  we suggest buying stocks with clean balance sheets  Our picks would include the likes of Archrock Partners L P   APLP   CONE Midstream Partners L P   CNNX  and TC PipeLines L P   TCP  
Safe Bet on Integrated Majors
In this current turbulent market environment  we advocate the relatively low risk energy conglomerate business structures of the large cap integrateds  with their fortress like balance sheets  ample free cash flows even in a low oil price environment and steady dividends  These companies continue to benefit from their scale and diversification that result in the strongest returns on capital in the industry 
Thanks to their integrated structures  entities like Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  RDS A   Chevron Corp   NYSE CVX   CVX  and Eni SpA  E  have been able to withstand plunging oil prices better than the rest and protect their top and bottom lines to a certain extent 
The companies  financial flexibility and strong balance sheet provide them with a larger war chest to draw upon in this highly uncertain period for the economy  Most of them remain in excellent financial health  with ample cash on hand and investment grade credit ratings with a manageable debt to capitalization ratio  On top of this  managements have established quite a track record of conservative capital management and cash returns to shareholders  They also pay a safe dividend  yielding attractive returns 
While all of them have suffered from the crude carnage over the past few years  holding on to them can still prove to be an astute move  Moreover  large integrated companies   unlike their small or medium sized producers   are not known to hedge a major share of their future production  So  they are more likely to benefit from the OPEC driven higher spot prices

	With capital market access remaining tough for most sector components  we suggest buying stocks with clean balance sheets  Our picks would include the likes of TC PipeLines L P   NYSE      

Safe Bet on Integrated Majors

	In this current turbulent market environment  we advocate the relatively low risk energy conglomerate business structures of the large cap integrateds  with their fortress like balance sheets  ample free cash flows even in a low oil price environment and steady dividends  These companies continue to benefit from their scale and diversification that result in the strongest returns on capital in the industry 

	Thanks to their integrated structures  entities like Chevron Corp   NYSE     andEni SpA  NYSE      have been able to withstand plunging oil prices better than the rest and protect their top and bottom lines to a certain extent 

	The companies  financial flexibility and strong balance sheet provide them with a larger war chest to draw upon in this highly uncertain period for the economy  Most of them remain in excellent financial health  with ample cash on hand and investment grade credit ratings with a manageable debt to capitalization ratio  On top of this  managements have established quite a track record of conservative capital management and cash returns to shareholders  They also pay a safe dividend  yielding attractive returns 

	While all of them have suffered from the crude carnage over the past few years  holding on to them can still prove to be an astute move  Moreover  large integrated companies   unlike their small or medium sized producers   are not known to hedge a major share of their future production  So  they are more likely to benefit from the OPEC driven higher spot prices

193166,414682,CVX,Obama administration reverses course on Atlantic oil drilling,news,"By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Obama administration reversed course on Tuesday on a proposal to open the southeastern Atlantic coast to drilling as an oil price slump and strong opposition in coastal communities raised doubts about the plan 
Besides market and environmental concerns  the U S  Interior Department said it also based its decision on conflicts with competing commercial and military ocean uses 
The decision  which is sure to reverberate in the presidential election campaign  reverses a January 2015 proposal for new leases in the Atlantic as part of the department s five year plan to set new boundaries for oil development in federal waters through 2022 
 We heard from many corners that now is not the time to offer oil and gas leasing off the Atlantic coast   Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said 
 When you factor in conflicts with national defense  economic activities such as fishing and tourism  and opposition from many local communities  it simply doesn t make sense to move forward with any lease sales in the coming five years  
Hillary Clinton  the front runner in the race for the Democratic Party s nomination to run in the Nov  8 presidential election  has moved to the left on environment under pressure from green groups  She tweeted   Relieved Atlantic drilling is now off the table  Time to do the next right thing and protect the Arctic  too  
Donald Trump  the businessman and former reality TV personality who is the Republican front runner  has raised questions about whether more offshore drilling is necessary given the abundance of onshore shale production 
The proposal would have opened up drilling sites more than 50 miles off Virginia  North and South Carolina  and Georgia to oil drilling by 2021 
Coastal communities in these states protested the administration s plan  fearing the possibility of an oil spill like the  BP   LON BP  Horizon accident in 2010 on the U S  Gulf Coast  and its effects on tourism and their economies 
 With this decision coastal communities have won a  David vs  Goliath  fight against the richest companies on the planet  and that is a cause for tremendous optimism for the well being of future generations   said Jacqueline Savitz  environmental group Oceana s vice president for U S  oceans 
Virginia officials had welcomed the initial plan to allow offshore drilling  saying it would bring economic benefits  On Tuesday  Senator Tim Kaine  a Democrat from Virginia  said he was surprised that the Department of Defense had raised concerns about naval installations  one of which is off the state s coast 
 The DOD has been relatively quiet during this public debate and has never shared their objections with me before   he said 
OBJECTIONS
Major oil companies  including  Exxon Mobil  Corp  NYSE XOM   Shell  LON RDSa  and  Chevron   NYSE CVX   had pushed for an open Atlantic 
Shell Oil Company spokeswoman Natalie Mazey said the decision was  short sighted  and would  jeopardize the abundance of affordable domestic energy the economy has become dependent on  
The American Petroleum Institute said the decision goes against the will of voters  governors and members of Congress who support more development 
 The decision appeases extremists who seek to stop oil and natural gas production which would increase the cost of energy for American consumers and close the door for years to creating new jobs  new investments and boosting energy security   said API President Jack Gerard 
The Interior Department also announced Tuesday that it would evaluate 13 other potential lease sales in other areas of the country   10 in the Gulf of Mexico and three off the coast of Alaska 
 The proposal focuses potential lease sales in areas with the highest resource potential  greatest industry interest  and established infrastructure   Jewell said 
The Interior Department said that in the Gulf  resource potential and industry interest are high and infrastructure already exists 
It proposes two annual lease sales that include the Western  Central  and part of the eastern Gulf of Mexico not subject to the current congressional moratorium 
It also includes a potential sale each in the Chukchi Sea  Beaufort Sea  and Cook Inlet planning areas in Alaska  The department would take comments on other options  including an alternative that includes no new leasing 
CONCERNS ABOUT ARCTIC
While green groups praised the decision to keep the Atlantic off limits for now  they raised concerns that the United States would keep the door open for drilling in the vulnerable U S  Arctic 
 The administration must take Arctic leases out of the final five year plan   said Cindy Shogan  executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League   No place has potentially more to lose due to climate change than the Arctic  
The Interior Department will open the five year proposal to a 90 day comment period ",2016-03-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/obama-administration-reverses-course-on-atlantic-oil-drilling-390035,390035
193167,414683,CVX,Ride to the Bottom  U S  energy workers hit hard by company stock bets,news,"By Tim McLaughlin and Luc Cohen OKLAHOMA CITY  Reuters    Nearly 15 years since Enron s collapse decimated the retirement accounts of its employees  hundreds of thousands of U S  energy workers remain precariously exposed to big  concentrated bets on company stock in their 401 k  retirement plans  The slide in oil prices to their lowest levels in over a decade wiped out several billion dollars of retirement wealth in the energy sector in the past year  The losses may prove temporary for companies that successfully navigate the crisis  but tens of thousands of employees of struggling firms may see much of their nest eggs gone for good  In Oklahoma and Texas  workers are delaying retirement plans  surrendering trucks  cars and land in personal bankruptcy cases  or just praying oil prices will recover   I just didn t see it coming   said John Thompson  57  who was laid off in February from Oklahoma City based  SandRidge Energy  Inc  PK SDOC   SandRidge shares  which peaked above  65 in 2008  are now worth 10 cents apiece   Because of this  I m not retiring any time soon   SandRidge did not return messages seeking comment  Almost without exception energy company 401 k  plans offered at least 10 different investment alternatives to company stock  their plans show  Yet company reports and interviews with more than 20 current and former employees at independent energy firms show many employees have not taken advantage of opportunities to switch out of company shares   Maureen Nelson  who retired from Chesapeake Energy Corp  N CHK  in 2013  said she lost an estimated  100 000 as she watched the company s shares plunge in value  Inertia and a strong faith in company leadership played a role in holding on to company stock  but so did company policies  Many energy firms continued to match employee contributions with company stock  even as most large U S  companies stopped the practice after the Enron debacle  according to several corporate benefits consultants  The energy industry followed the lead of heavyweights such as  Chevron  Corp  N CVX  and  Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM   which for years provided matching contributions in company stock in worker 401 k  retirement plans while also funding separate defined benefit pension plans for them  DOUBLE IMPACT Smaller companies could not afford to do both  but they typically matched employee contributions in stock  And energy workers often plowed some or most of their own contributions into company stock  benefits consultants said    It s not prudent investing   said Lou Harvey  chief executive of Boston based financial research firm Dalbar Inc   But employees tend to clamor for company stock   Typically  workers at larger energy companies would have 20 percent to 60 percent of 401 k  assets in company stock  according to a Reuters analysis of such holdings for more than 400 000 employees  By contrast  the average U S  401 k  plan has about 7 percent of assets in company stock  according to Washington D C  based Investment Company Institute  At Chevron  more than 40 000 participants in its 401 k  plan held  8 9 billion  or 47 percent of investment assets  in company stock at the end of 2014  according to the latest annual report   Graphic   Chevron stopped matching in company stock last year for better diversification  spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie said  Exxon stopped new stock contributions after 2006  Its shares still accounted for  12 9 billion of the 401 k  plan s  22 3 billion in assets in 2014  Exxon declined comment  When Texas based Enron filed for bankruptcy in 2001  employees suffered a one two punch   they lost their jobs and much of their savings because nearly two thirds of their retirement assets were in Enron stock  After Enron s collapse  companies successfully lobbied Congress mostly against proposals to limit company stock ownership in 401 k  plans  fearing billions of dollars of their shares would be offloaded to meet the caps   Caps were a bridge too far for companies   said Sheila Bair  former chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and a U S  Treasury official who worked on President George W  Bush s 2002 task force on retirement security  Still  publicly traded companies have revamped their retirement plans to make them more balanced  even imposing own limits on company stock ownership  said Rob Austin  director of retirement research at Aon Hewitt  FOLLOW THE LEADER Diversification has yet to reach much of the energy sector  though  Oil and gas workers had more than  32 billion in company stock in their 401 k  accounts  or about 38 percent of plan assets for the 40 companies in the S P 500 Energy Sector Index  according to 2014 annual reports filed with the U S  Department of Labor  Since then  the index has lost 21 percent  Smaller independents have been hit about twice as hard  on average  With about a third of his 401 k  plan in company stock  retired Chesapeake geologist Keith Rasmussen  61  looks to sell land he owns in Oklahoma and Idaho to shore up his depleted retirement funds   Chesapeake  once a shale boom darling  now trades 84 percent below mid 2014 levels  hurt by heavy debt and prolonged slump in natural gas prices  Nearly 8 000 participants in its 401 k  are exposed to the reversal of fortune  holding 35 percent of the plan s  615 million in assets in company stock at the end of 2014  according to the latest annual report  Some current and former Chesapeake employees said their decisions to hold onto stock were based partly on their reverence for Aubrey McClendon  its legendary former chief executive  who died in a car crash in early March   You could be the biggest skeptic in the world  and you listen to him in a room for 30 minutes  and you re ready to hand him all your money   said Ginni Kennedy  58  who retired from her engineering job at Chesapeake in 2013   I had faith that he d continue to be able to pull those rabbits out of his hat   Chesapeake  which declined to comment  stopped matching in company stock last year  Many workers are now paying a heavy price for failing to heed warnings about concentration risk   Our bankruptcy work has quadrupled over the past six months   said Roger Ediger  an Enid  Oklahoma lawyer who handles personal bankruptcy cases   Most of them are energy related   A U S  Supreme Court decision in 2014 underscored the risk of offering company shares in 401 k  plans  Its decision made clear that company stock was not automatically a prudent investment  The ruling also highlighted the potential conflicts of interest for companies in their role as fiduciary of 401 k  plans    It was a wake up call to companies   said Bill Ryan  chief fiduciary officer at Evercore Trust  the largest U S  third party fiduciary  At Fort Worth  Texas based Quicksilver Resources Inc  PK KWKAQ   Evercore Trust took a rare step to block further employee investment in the company s 401 k  plan in October 2014  as fiduciary for the stock plan  The move preserved some value  but not much  given that by the time the stock fund was liquidated company shares have already fallen to about 50 cents from about  3 50 in 2014  Equity investors lost virtually everything five months later when Quicksilver filed for bankruptcy protection  Bair  now a college president  said companies with heavy stock concentrations in their 401 k s should follow peers that have caps in place to protect workers and avoid government mandates

193175,414691,CVX,ExxonMobil In Talks With Chadian Government Over  74B Fine,opinion,"According to recent reports  ExxonMobil Corporation   NYSE XOM   is in talks with the Chadian government regarding a record fine of  74 billion that the oil major was asked to pay last month by a court in the country owing to dispute over royalties The fine was imposed by a court in the central African nation after the Finance Ministry said that a consortium led by ExxonMobil had not met tax obligations  Alongside  the court also ordered the company to pay overdue royalties of  819 million Per the sources  ExxonMobil has appealed against the Oct 5 ruling by the High Court  Reportedly  the appeals court hearing has been deferred because of negotiations between the company and the Chadian government The penalty exceeds the  61 6 billion financial blow BP plc   NYSE BP   incurred after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010  Notably  the accident had killed 11 rig workers and contaminated the Gulf of Mexico with crude for months  The aforesaid fine is also 70 times larger than the  977 5 million ExxonMobil was ordered to pay fishermen and other victims of the 1989 Valdez oil spill in Alaska According to the government s general director of legal affairs  the penalty is in sync with the customs code of a regional organization   the Economic and Monetary Community of Central African States   of which Chad is a member  Interestingly  the charge is almost six times Chad s gross domestic product  EXXON MOBIL CRP Price
 

   The code specifies that   in the event of fraudulent behavior  as is the case  the fine should amount to double the value of the object of the fraud  According to the central African nation  the consortium should pay 2  in royalties on crude exports even if ExxonMobil argues that it inked an agreement with the government in 2009 that set the royalties at 0 2   Further  the government s general director of legal affairs pointed out that the previous  convention wasn t ratified by parliament and never signed by the head of state  Earlier in the year  the government announced a series of strict measures to deal with the steep decline in oil income   its main source of foreign revenues  For about two weeks judicial workers  including judges  have been on strike alongside medical staff and teachers ExxonMobil started exploring Chad for crude in 2001 and has been procuring oil from the region since 2003  The company also operates a pipeline that transfers Chadian oil to a marine terminal in Cameroon for export  The two other companies named in the case are Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   and Malaysia s state owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd  Chevron divested its stake in Chad in 2014 None of the partners of the consortium disclosed any details regarding the progress ExxonMobil currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Another better ranked player from the same sector is SunCoke Energy Inc    NYSE SXC    sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  SunCoke Energy posted a positive earnings surprise of 177 78  in the preceding quarter  It reported a positive earnings surprise in three of the four preceding quarters The Best Place to Start Your Stock SearchToday  you are invited to download the full list of 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks   absolutely free of charge  Since 1988  Zacks Rank  1 stocks have nearly tripled the market  with average gains of  26  per year  Plus  you can access the list of portfolio killing Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sells  and other private research ",2016-11-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/exxonmobil-in-talks-with-chadian-government-over-$74b-fine-200165079,200165079
193176,414692,CVX,Chevron Vs  ExxonMobil  Which Is Better Positioned Post Q3 ,opinion,"ExxonMobil Corp    NYSE XOM   and Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX     with their massive market capitalizations of  360 billion and  206 billion  respectively   dominate and define the U S  energy industry 
Both these companies are engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas  refining and marketing of petroleum products  manufacturing of chemicals  and other energy related businesses 
But how do you choose between the two supermajors  Here s a look at ExxonMobil and Chevron stocks  performance in 2016 
Stock Performance
Despite all commodity related headwinds  both ExxonMobil and Chevron have handily outperformed the S P 500 in the current year  with Exxon Mobil stock rising 11  to Chevron s 21   compared to the S P 500 s gain of just 7   Of course  these are numbers at a time when oil prices recovered from a 12 year low of  26 21 a barrel in February to  50 barrel mark in early June  slipped again to under  40 only to rally toward  50 once more EXXON MOBIL CRP Price
 

   ExxonMobil stock now trades at about 40 times trailing twelve months  earnings and 39 times forward earnings for 2016  while Chevron stock is valued at 232 times trailing twelve months  earnings and about 88 times forward earnings 
Being much more expensive  Chevron shares are primed for a fall CHEVRON CORP Price
 

   Recent Earnings
In an indication of the industry s adaptability to low commodity prices  ExxonMobil and Chevron reported earnings beats for the three months ended Sep 30  although profits deteriorated from the year ago quarter 
Moreover  the two largest U S  energy companies by market value are experiencing signs of weakness in the refining business  suggesting that the units   which had saved them when crude prices plunged   could now be a drag  In fact  ExxonMobil and Chevron s  downstream  unit profits dived 40  and 50   respectively  from the comparable period of 2015 
The deteriorating downstream results could be attributed to a fall in refining margins as the cost of gasoline  heating oil and other refined products catches up on the beaten down crude price  Following a prolonged period of high differentials  crack spreads have weakened  which lead to deteriorating earnings and cash flows 
As it is  the companies are struggling with faltering sales of their exploration and production businesses amid plunging commodity prices 
Production   Capital Expenditure
Exxon Mobil and Chevron are suffering from marginal or falling returns  reflecting their struggle to replace reserves  as access to new energy resources becomes more difficult  Given their large base  achieving growth in oil and natural gas production is anyways a challenge for these companies over the last many years 
During the Jan Sep period  the Irving  TX based oil and natural gas powerhouse ExxonMobil s production averaged 4 030 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day  MBOE d   essentially unchanged from the first nine months of 2015  For another domestic behemoth Chevron  total volume of crude oil and natural gas was down 1 4  from the year earlier level at 2 569 MBOE d 
Despite broadly similar production profiles  Chevron s attractive growth prospects set it apart  Chevron s existing oil and gas development project pipeline is among the best in the industry   targeting volume growth from the current 2 5 million barrels of oil equivalents per day  MMBOE d  to 2 9 3 0 MMBOE d by 2017   driven by the big Australian LNG projects  Gorgon and Wheatstone   as well as deepwater developments in the U S  Gulf of Mexico 
At  14 5 billion  ExxonMobil s capital and exploration expenditure for the first three quarters of this year has run 39  lower than in the equivalent period of 2015  Chevron managed to reduce its outlay by 32  to  17 2 billion 
Shareholder Value
Despite the bloodbath  both ExxonMobil and Chevron have continued to reward shareholders with large annual dividends of  3 00 and  4 32 per share   currently yielding 3 5  and 4 0   respectively  In Apr  ExxonMobil boosted its quarterly payout for the 34th consecutive year  while Chevron raised its dividend last month for the 29th straight year 
With a superior dividend yield  Chevron is more attractive on this front 
However  in a move designed to conserve cash amid the energy price rout  the companies have stopped pouring money into their once vigorous stock buyback programs  It can be safely inferred that the most notable victim of the commodity meltdown has been share buybacks   gone for not only ExxonMobil and Chevron   but also for European biggies Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  and BP plc   NYSE BP   
Cash Flow from Operations
Leaving aside dividends  ExxonMobil s cash flow from operations and asset sales came in at  16 9 billion in the first nine months of the year  Importantly  this was enough to take care of its capital spending  a testament to the company s solid operations and cost discipline 
In contrast  Chevron s cash from operations was  9 0 billion  more than  8 billion short of its capital spending 
While ExxonMobil has remained free cash flow positive throughout the commodity price collapse as opposed to Chevron  the advantage is slipping rapidly  Investors should note that ExxonMobil s free cash flow of  4 billion  year to date  are down to a sixth of  24 billion five years ago  Moreover  with Chevron being one of the most oil weighted majors  it might actually become free cash flow positive very quickly in case of the commodity s rebound as per our expectations 
Bottom Line
ExxonMobil and Chevron are two of the best run companies among the global oil majors  consistently producing industry leading financial returns  Both are still sound financially  In fact  their financial flexibility and strong balance sheets are real assets in this highly uncertain period for the economy  Both remain in excellent financial health  with enough in cash on hand and a very manageable debt to capitalization ratio  ExxonMobil  though  with a lower ratio of 14  scores over Chevron s 21  
Nevertheless  neither ExxonMobil nor Chevron   both carrying Zacks Rank  3  Hold    has been spared the effects of the rout in crude prices  But going by their performance thus far in 2016  Chevron seems to be in relatively better shape  You can see  
It s true that ExxonMobil s business  being roughly twice the size of Chevron s  gives it the gargantuan scale to stand up a bit better to industry headwinds  However  the latter s attractive production growth profile  medium term project start ups and crude leverage tilts the balance in its favor 
Not only Chevron offers a higher dividend but If you are expecting oil prices to rebound  one might go with Chevron to reap more rewards

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  

Will Oil Majors Slip on Trump s Lofty Promises 

The surprise victory of Donald Trump in the U S presidential election might add to the woes of the already beleaguered energy sector 

The billionaire real estate developer  who never held elected office before  proposed a few changes for the oil and gas sector  According to Trump  the nation needs to augment crude production in order to reduce its dependence on imports  However  increasing crude output in an already oversupplied market would actually be a recipe for disaster 

Trump s Proposal for Energy Sector

The 45th President of the U S had announced his intention to support to increase the production of oil and natural gas during his campaign  Let s take a look at some of the other proposals tabled by Trump 

No Restrictions on Exploration and Production of Oil   Gas 

Trump had announced his plans to lift restrictions on the exploration and production of crude and natural gas  upon election  to boost production  In the U S   activities of all energy players are strictly regulated both at federal and state levels  If an upstream energy player intends to engage in exploration and production activities  it should get a development permit  a drilling permit as well as an operating permit  This apart  the firm has to undergo a public review  Failure to comply with these regulations might result in penalties   both legal and financial   not to mention delays 

On the other hand  companies from the gas drilling industry need to abide by the Clean Air Act that targets reduction in greenhouse gas emissions while drilling   For details please read    

More Federal Acres for Oil   Gas Drilling 

Trump also promised to integrate more federal acres of land for oil and gas drilling operations  More land for drilling purposes will significantly improve the oil and gas production 

Support Keystone XL Pipeline Development 

Trump also proposed the extension of the Keystone XL pipeline to carry oil from Alberta  Canada to the U S refineries  The initial phase of the pipeline project was finished in 2011  The proposed extension of the pipeline line will add another 1100 miles to the over 2100 miles it already covers 

However  the proposed extension development has not been supported by environmental groups and politicians  This is because bitumen that might be transported by the pipeline system along with crude to the U S might emit greenhouse gas 

Impact on Oil Price

It is a well documented fact that oil price primarily determines the fate of energy players  Since mid 2014  the energy sector has been witnessing persistent oil prices weakness due to supply glut  In such a scenario  Trump s proposals undoubtedly raise concern as increased production will worsen the situation  This will not only impact the commodity price but will also raise environmental risks by increasing greenhouse gas emissions 

This is definitely unfavorable for most energy players  This is because lesser the price of oil  lower will be the revenues for upstream energy players after selling the commodity  The upstream businesses of oil integrated majors like Chevron Corp   NYSE             Exxon Mobil Corp   NYSE             BP plc  NYSE           and Royal Dutch Shell plc  NYSE           are likely to be the worst hit

193178,414694,CVX,Deepening default fears cast shadow over Venezuela s oil flows,news,"By Marianna Parraga
HOUSTON  Reuters    As Venezuela grows closer to exhausting nearly every means of paying its debt  some oil market participants are seriously pondering the possible implications of an unprecedented event  the default of a major crude producing company 
State run firm PDVSA faces around  5 2 billion in payments to bondholders in 2016  much of it in October and November  a sum that some experts say it will be hard pressed to meet after the government used nearly all of its available cash reserves to pay  1 5 billion in maturities last week 
A default could curtail some of the OPEC member s exports by crippling its ability to import crude and fuels used to blend its extra heavy oil  experts and sources say  It could also degrade the quality of domestic gasoline by limiting purchases of necessary components 
With the risk growing and payment delays to suppliers already emerging  some firms that sell to PDVSA have begun hedging their bets by using intermediaries or seeking higher prices  fearful they might never get paid  according to sources who deal with the firm 
 A possible PDVSA default is worrying for everybody   a source from a U S  oil company that buys from PDVSA told Reuters  And if they scrape together enough funds to pay off bondholders   they will not be able to pay suppliers  
The implications of a default for global oil supplies swamped by the biggest glut in decades are difficult to divine  but experts are closely watching the deteriorating finances of exporters for anything that could jolt markets 
 Of course  Venezuela is at the top of the list   Daniel Yergin  vice chairman of analysis firm IHS  told Reuters last week 
Without imports of light crudes and diluents like naphtha that have rose to some 110 000 barrels per day  bpd  in 2015  PDVSA may be unable to export an estimated 235 000 bpd of its own heavy blends  according to calculations based on Thomson Reuters trade flows data   a disruption that could help curb an oversupplied global market 
Most of the country s estimated 2 million bpd of exports  a portion of them secured against long term loans  would likely still flow as PDVSA s entire output is not dependent on imports and it has been increasing shipments to political allies 
Crude blend supplies to the United States and Asia could also be sustained if PDVSA s partners  including U S   Chevron   N CVX   Russia s Rosneft  MM ROSN   Spain s Repsol  MC REP  and China s CNPC  step in to secure more diluents  as PDVSA has already asked them to do 
Yet a default would also likely reduce fuel components imports  which have risen to some 85 000 bpd due to growing use of cheap high octane gasoline and falling domestic production 
Venezuela was the United States  third crude supplier last year and Latin America s sixth largest buyer of U S  fuels 
DIGGING OUT OF DEBT
While PDVSA s pending fourth quarter debt payments of some  3 3 billion appear beyond its means  a default is far from a certainty  and its president Eulogio Del Pino said this week it is taking all measures to avoid it 
Even so  short of a sudden  unexpected recovery in crude prices  asset sales  new loans or refinancing agreements  the odds look long  said Benjamin Ramsey from JP Morgan 
While not yet calling for a credit event in Venezuela  a JP Morgan report said PDVSA s best intentions  cannot nonetheless trump the cold  hard realities of diminished cash flow  
Refinancing efforts  including a bond swap through its pension fund  are making little visible progress  Expected dividends from its U S  unit Citgo Petroleum along with money coming from Russian Rosneft s  MM ROSN  stake increase in a joint venture would not be enough to reach October with full pockets  a government source said 
Some PDVSA suppliers are already edging away 
A prominent trading firm has recently been using local intermediaries in Venezuela to secure payments when supplying PDVSA  as selling directly or providing it with even minimal credit are no longer options  a source said 
PDVSA this month failed to award two spot tenders to buy gasoline components because of high price premiums  a reflection  according to one source who participated in the offer  of growing payment risks 
To ensure its supply lines remain open  PDVSA has signed deals with India s  Reliance Industries   NS RELI  and Rosneft to exchange crude by fuels 
PDVSA s close ties with CNPC and PetroChina Co could also guarantee some imports  but those could still be not enough to secure all barrels needed  traders said 
LEGAL RESOURCES
Even though any legal response to a default would have to pass through an external court to target PDVSA s assets  clauses included in bond contracts make the company more exposed than the country to any actions taken by creditors to claim owed money  according to lawyers and experts 
Amid ongoing arbitration cases  oil giant ExxonMobil  N XOM  was granted court orders in 2008 that temporarily froze up to  12 billion in PDVSA s overseas assets and  315 million in a joint bank account in New York  It was done through an extraordinary legal resource called  Mareva injunction  that surprised Venezuela 
Even though the injunction was later overturned  that case and others that followed have exposed PDVSA s bank accounts  tankers  cargoes and external terminals and refineries to the legal power of creditors 
PDVSA has taken steps recently to protect itself  including moving the accounts that collect money from its exports to China s CITIC Bank from Banco Espirito Santo  
Getting a court order to freeze an account in China would be more difficult than acquiring access to those in the United States  Some PDVSA sales could also be protected if it delivers at its ports under prepayment agreements  so cargoes are owned by the buyer when leaving Venezuela  lawyers said 
After selling facilities in Germany  the Caribbean and the United States  PDVSA s former president  Rafael Ramirez  recommended the government in 2014 to also get rid of all Citgo s operations to protect the company against potential efforts to seize assets  according to a document seen by Reuters 
But even though the U S  unit was offered for sale  the attempt was abandoned in 2015 after Venezuela asked it to raise  2 5 billion in loans and bonds on PDVSA s behalf ",2016-02-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/deepening-default-fears-cast-shadow-over-venezuela's-oil-flows-386807,386807

193189,414705,CVX,Will Oil Majors Slip On Trump s Lofty Promises ,opinion,"The surprise victory of Donald Trump in the U S presidential election might add to the woes of the already beleaguered energy sector 
The billionaire real estate developer  who never held elected office before  proposed a few changes for the oil and gas sector  According to Trump  the nation needs to augment crude production in order to reduce its dependence on imports  However  increasing crude output in an already oversupplied market would actually be a recipe for disaster 
Trump s Proposal for Energy Sector
The 45th President of the U S had announced his intention to support to increase the production of oil and natural gas during his campaign  Let s take a look at some of the other proposals tabled by Trump 
No Restrictions on Exploration and Production of Oil   Gas 
Trump had announced his plans to lift restrictions on the exploration and production of crude and natural gas  upon election  to boost production  In the U S   activities of all energy players are strictly regulated both at federal and state levels  If an upstream energy player intends to engage in exploration and production activities  it should get a development permit  a drilling permit as well as an operating permit  This apart  the firm has to undergo a public review  Failure to comply with these regulations might result in penalties   both legal and financial   not to mention delays  
On the other hand  companies from the gas drilling industry need to abide by the Clean Air Act that targets reduction in greenhouse gas emissions while drilling   For details please read   
More Federal Acres for Oil   Gas Drilling 
Trump also promised to integrate more federal acres of land for oil and gas drilling operations  More land for drilling purposes will significantly improve the oil and gas production 
Support Keystone XL Pipeline Development 
Trump also proposed the extension of the Keystone XL pipeline to carry oil from Alberta  Canada to the U S refineries  The initial phase of the pipeline project was finished in 2011  The proposed extension of the pipeline line will add another 1100 miles to the over 2100 miles it already covers 
However  the proposed extension development has not been supported by environmental groups and politicians  This is because bitumen that might be transported by the pipeline system along with crude to the U S might emit greenhouse gas 
Impact on Oil Price
It is a well documented fact that oil price primarily determines the fate of energy players  Since mid 2014  the energy sector has been witnessing persistent oil prices weakness due to supply glut  In such a scenario  Trump s proposals undoubtedly raise concern as increased production will worsen the situation  This will not only impact the commodity price but will also raise environmental risks by increasing greenhouse gas emissions 
This is definitely unfavorable for most energy players  This is because lesser the price of oil  lower will be the revenues for upstream energy players after selling the commodity  The upstream businesses of oil integrated majors like Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX    Exxon Mobil Corp    NYSE XOM    BP plc   NYSE BP   and Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  are likely to be the worst hit

193192,414708,CVX,Shell pursues transition plan after sealing  53 billion BG deal,news,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON  Reuters    Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  on Monday sealed the  53 billion  36 billion pounds  acquisition of British rival BG Group  L BG  to form the world s top liquefied natural gas company  even as slumping oil prices cast a shadow on the upcoming years of transition 
The success or otherwise of the complex merger will define the legacy of Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden  seeking to transform Shell into a more specialized group focused on the rapidly growing LNG market and deepwater oil production 
 We will now be able to shape a simpler  leaner  more competitive company  focusing on our core expertise in deep water and LNG   van Beurden said in a statement  In 2014  Shell acquired Repsol s  MC REP  LNG business 
Van Beurden s vision won overwhelming support from shareholders  though a number of major investors had voiced concerns that the forecast slow recovery in oil prices would strain Shell s financials and risk its growth plans 
The deal  announced 10 months ago  creates a combined group which will leapfrog  Chevron   N CVX  to become the world s second largest public oil and gas company by market value behind  Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM  
BG shareholders largely opted to receive shares rather than cash under the proposed mix and match deal  according to a statement  BG becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell and will be headed by Dutchman Huibert Vigeveno  who has headed the integration planning team and will oversee its implementation 
SPECTACULAR GROWTH
Signs at BG s headquarters in Reading outside London were replaced by Shell s red and orange logo over the weekend  according to company sources 
Incumbent CEO Helge Lund  former head of Norwegian oil major  Statoil   OL STL  who led it through a period of spectacular growth  is set to step down and has yet to indicate his plans 
Shell has said it will cut thousands of jobs from the combined group and sell  30 billion of assets over the next three years in order to finance the deal  buy back shares and support dividends  which it has vowed to maintain or increase 
Shell is betting heavily on a rapid growth in the global LNG market over coming decades as the world turns to less polluting sources of energy  Yet with oil prices near a 12 year low  a struggling global economy and major restructuring under way of its oil and gas operations across the globe  the merger is set to be a challenge even for 126 year old Anglo Dutch company 
Shell saw its income drop 87 percent in 2015 
 The financials will work in time  admittedly perhaps not as originally hoped  but we still see this deal as accretive within a two  to three year timeframe   said Jason Kenney  analyst at Grupo Santander  MC SAN   who estimates the acquisition will increase Shell s oil and gas production to around 4 7 million barrels of oil equivalent by 2020 

 The deal means Shell will have little need to explore near or medium term  or to invest in highly capital intensive unconventional projects   Kenney added ",2016-02-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/shell-pursues-transition-plan-after-sealing-$53-billion-bg-deal-384695,384695

companies have beaten earnings estimates   though undoubtedly aided by low expectations Oil Refining   Marketing  Operating Environment Remain DepressedTill recently  the downstream operators  oil refiners and marketers  benefited from crude s collapse  This is because the companies use oil as an input from which they derive refined petroleum products like gasoline  the prime transportation fuel in the U S  Hence  the lower the oil price  the higher will be their profits However  this also led to overproduction and stock build up that now threatens to bite the refiners  The companies have been struggling this year with the existing stocks of refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate   remaining at their maximum seasonal levels in at least 20 years despite healthy demand  Consequently  margins have narrowed forcing some of the operators to announce production cuts  postpone capital spending and retrench employees In fact  as per  from British oil major BP plc

193218,414734,CVX,Royal Dutch Shell  RDS A  Q3 Earnings Soundly Beats Estimate,opinion,"Europe s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  reported strong third quarter earnings amid improvement in production   due largely to the BG assets   and cost structure 
With its outperformance  Shell joins integrated peers like Exxon Mobil Corp    NYSE XOM    Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   and BP plc   NYSE BP   in adapting to low commodity prices to report earnings beats 
The Hague based Shell reported earnings per ADS  on a current cost of supplies basis  excluding items  of 70 cents  well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents 
However  the bottom line fell from the year ago adjusted profit of 76 cents on continued weakness in commodity prices and depressed refining margins 
Revenues were down 6  to  61 855 million and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  67 997 million ROYAL DTCH SH A Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Confirms Dividend   Outlines 2017 Capex  Putting an end to speculation  Shell confirmed its quarterly dividend at 47 cents per share and said that it expects to spend  25 billion next year on capital investments   at the bottom of the previously stated range 
Segmental Performance
Upstream  Upstream segment recorded a marginal income of  4 million  excluding items  during the quarter  turning around from the  582 million  adjusted  loss in the year ago period 
This primarily reflects the impact of a rise in production on the back of contribution from the BG assets  reduced costs and lower taxation  To some extent  these were offset by lower oil and gas prices and depreciation charges associated with the BG takeover 
Shell s upstream volumes averaged 2 683 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day  MBOE d   21  higher than the year ago period  While crude oil production increased 25   natural gas output was up 15   thanks to the contribution from BG Group that was acquired earlier in the year  Liquids contributed approximately 61  to Shell s total volumes  while natural gas accounted for the remaining portion 
Production during the quarter compared with the year ago quarter included volumes from new field start ups and continued ramp up of existing fields   particularly Erha North ph2 in Nigeria and the Corrib gas field in Ireland  Sabah Gas Kebabangan in Malaysia and Stones in the U S    that boosted output by roughly 51 MBOE d 
Shell s worldwide realized liquids prices were 11  below the year earlier levels  while natural gas prices were down 31  
Downstream  In the Downstream segment  the Anglo Dutch super major reported adjusted income of  2 078 million  21  less than the  2 617 million earned in the year ago period  The negative comparison reflects the impact of weaker results from refining operations  partly offset by lower costs 
Integrated Gas  The Integrated Gas unit reported adjusted income of  931 million as against  918 million in Jul Sep quarter of 2015  Results were buoyed by improved LNG and liquids output  mainly contributed by the BG assets   better operational performance  cost saving initiatives and lower well write offs  Partly offsetting these factors were lower LNG prices and higher BG related expenses 
Cash Flow
During the quarter under review  Shell generated cash flow from operations of  8 492 million  returned  3 800 million to shareholders through dividends and spent  7 700 million on capital projects

193232,414748,CVX,Q3 GDP Key Ahead Of Fed Meeting And US Election,opinion,"US third quarter GDP data will be a major focus for traders on Friday  coming days before the penultimate Fed meeting of the year  one which could deliver a very clear message of the central bank s intention to raise interest rates in December 
What makes today s GDP release all the more important is that is comes following two weak quarters of growth for the US economy which has already got people questioning whether the recovery has already stalled and if the Fed should be raising interest rates at this time  A third consecutive poor reading will only add to the voices calling for the Fed to hold off on hiking in December and with the markets having already heavily priced it in  I wonder whether it would also prompt some heavy selling in the dollar and spike in Treasuries 
While the polls may not look to close in the US Presidential race with only 11 days to go  I also wonder what another disappointing quarter of growth would do for Donald Trump s chances  Trump has repeatedly criticised the current government for how the economy has performed this year  promising to get the economy growing by 4  if elected  A third quarter of low growth coming days before people head to the polls may well sway some of the undecided voters and I m sure it will become a core message that Trump will want to drive home in the final days of the campaign

193245,414761,CVX,Chevron  CVX  To Report Q3 Earnings  What To Expect ,opinion,"U S  energy giant Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   is set to release its third quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Friday  Oct 28 
What Investors Need to Know
The company s stock performance has been pretty choppy lately  and it will be up to this coming release to set the trend heading into 2017 
However  the second largest U S  oil company by market value after Exxon Mobil Corp    NYSE XOM   has a good industry rank   in the top 38  overall  Chevron also has a  B  for its  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   so fundamentals are pretty strong for this stock as well 
But the company doesn t exactly have a great track record when it comes to earnings  as it has missed estimates in two of the last three quarters  as you can see in the chart below CHEVRON CORP Price and EPS Surprise

   Earnings estimates have also been sluggish for the stock  as the consensus estimate has been going down over the past few months  This is something that investors definitely don t want to see heading into a report 
Therefore  notwithstanding Chevron s  Buy  rating  the signals are mixed and it seems as if it could be a rockier report than one might think 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
Unlike the last quarter  where oil advanced more than 26  sequentially to notch up the best quarterly percentage gain in 7 years  the Jun Sep 2016 period turned out to be a rather flat one with crude barely advancing  In fact  the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures during the third quarter hovered around the  45 per barrel mark  flat from the second quarter and down from  46 50 in the same period last year  This does not bode well for Chevron   one of the most oil weighted majors 
Worryingly  there are signs of weakness in the refining business  suggesting that the unit   which saved Chevron when crude prices plunged   could now be a drag  The second quarter saw the integrated behemoth s downstream segment income erode on fuel oversupply and weak demand  With refined product inventories remaining at their maximum seasonal levels in at least 20 years and margins set to narrow  Chevron could be in for more trouble in the to be reported quarter 
Finally  disruptions and asset sales could hamper the company s production   as it did in the previous quarter 
However  to a large extent  Chevron s successful cost reduction initiatives are expected to cushion the results  At  12 billion  the company s capital and exploration expenditure for the first half of this year has run 31  lower than in the equivalent period of 2015 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Chevron will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises 
That is not the case here as you will see below      
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 40 cents 
Zacks Rank  Chevron has a Zacks Rank  2  Though a Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider

Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  SLB  HAL  SM  PBR  RDS A

	It was a week which saw oil prices hit a 15 month peak  while natural gas futures fell below the psychologically important  3 threshold 

	On the news front  oilfield service majors Schlumberger Ltd   NYSE     andHalliburton Company  NYSE      kicked off the energy earnings season with better than expected numbers  Importantly  both the companies indicated that their North American clients have returned to drilling this summer 

	Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures edged up 1  to close at  50 85 per barrel  natural gas prices plunged 8 9  to  2 993 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here     

	Oil prices notched up their fifth successive weekly gain as investors clung on to optimism generated by OPEC and non OPEC players  commitments to slash production targets next month 

	Apart from the OPEC announcement  oil prices were also supported by the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release  which showed that domestic crude stockpiles declined unexpectedly 

	To a large extent though  the optimism was tempered by the Baker Hughes report revealing an eighth straight rise in the U S  oil rig count and pointing to the resurgence in shale drilling activities

	Meanwhile  natural gas turned lower following a higher than expected build  The commodity has also been hampered by a warmer than normal autumn weather that translates into weak demand 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

	1  The world s largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger Ltd  reported third quarter 2016 earnings of 25 cents per share  excluding Cameron merger and integration charges   which came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents  Higher activities in the land market of the U S along with fracturing work recovery in North America led to the earnings beat  This clearly indicates that oil producers are putting more rigs in the continent again 

	However  the bottom line decreased substantially from 78 cents per share earned in the year earlier quarter  Continual decline in deepwater operations led to the year over year deterioration 

	Schlumberger expects the demand for oil to increase in 2017  According to the company the increase in demand as well as the OPEC s intention to cut crude production would lead to oil price recovery in the long run   Read more     

	2  Major oilfield services provider Halliburton Company reported surprise third quarter profit on the back of continued and effective cost management  The world s No  2 oilfield services company s ninth consecutive quarterly outperformance was also helped by improved utilization on the back of growing North American rig count  Halliburton currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see     

	Halliburton s net income per share came in at 1 cent  contrary to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 7 cents  However  revenues of  3 833 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 897 million amid the oil slump 

	Along the results  Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the current industry upturn will boost rig count further  As a proof of the recovery  Halliburton reported 9  sequential growth in North American sales  However  most of this bullish sentiment was offset by lower business in other parts of the world 

	Halliburton warned that fourth quarter activity is likely to be weak due to holiday and seasonal weather associated disruptions  Moreover  pricing pressure is expected to continue over the near term with international business set to be flat sequentially   Read more     

	3  Denver  CO based oil and gas producer SM Energy Co   NYSE      agreed to acquire almost 35 700 net acres in the Midland Basin of West Texas for a consideration of  1 6 billion in cash and stock  Simultaneously  the company decided to divest its resources in North Dakota s Williston Basin for roughly  785 million 

	The acquisition plan reflects SM Energy s focus on increasing its resources in the most productive properties so as to be able to earn significant cash flows for shareholders in the long run  Notably  the latest deal  which is anticipated to complete in December this year  will increase SM Energy s asset base in the Permian Basin to 82 450 net acres 

	We note that SM Energy has been selling assets that do not fit its portfolio to enhance its presence in the Permian Basin  In fact  a major part of the aforesaid Permian Basin acreage buyout will be funded using the proceeds generated from the sale of Williston Basin properties  The remainder will likely be financed from the company s revolving credit line   Read more     

	4  Brazil s state owned energy major Petrobras  NYSE      agreed to settle four lawsuits by investors in New York federal court  The lawsuits   led by PIMCO Total Return Fund  et al   Dodge   Cox International Stock Fund  et al   Janus Overseas Fund  et al   and Al Shams Investments  et al   claimed losses resulting from a vast corruption scandal that engulfed the Rio de Janeiro headquartered company  The plaintiffs alleged that Petrobras gave false information to investors about the scope and scale of the graft scheme that has wiped billions of dollars in value from the company s books 

	Following the settlement  Petrobras will include a  353 million provision in the third quarter to cover the costs  Denying all allegations of wrongdoing  Petrobras maintained that the settlement was meant at eliminating the uncertainties and costs associated with the litigations

	5  Integrated energy major Royal Dutch Shell plc  NYSE      recently announced that its affiliate  Shell Canada Energy  has entered into an agreement to divest around 206 000 net acres of non core oil and gas properties in Western Canada to local natural gas producer Tourmaline Oil Corp  This sale is expected to garner more than  1 billion 

	Per the Anglo Dutch energy giant  the proceeds comprise  758 million in cash and Tourmaline shares valued at  279 million  The deal is effective Nov 1 and expected is to close at the end of 2016 

	This sale is part of the Shell s plan to raise around  30 billion from assets sales in the three years through 2018 to help shore up its finances following its mega merger with BG Group  Notably  the merger with BG Group raised Shell s total debt level to  90 3 billion from  52 9 billion a year earlier   Read more

193257,414773,CVX,4 Energy Stocks With Value That Can Grow Earnings 20 ,opinion,"Oil prices held above the  50 threshold as government figures continue to show large drawdowns  while investors bet on commitments by OPEC and non OPEC players to slash production targets 
Encouraging Trends
OPEC Agreement The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   whose member nations supply around 40  of the world s crude  said it would cut production by as much as 750 000 barrels a day starting in November in order to keep oil prices from falling further  Most industry observers didn t have high expectations from the meeting 
OPEC s decision to cut oil production   made in a meeting in Algiers last Wednesday  Sep 28   took most analysts by surprise  The move  led by Saudi Arabia  aims to trim output to 32 5 33 0 million barrels per day from the current 33 5 million barrels per day 
The group  which includes member countries from the Middle East  Africa and Latin America  also claims to have firm commitments from non OPEC biggies like Russia to participate in a collective effort to cut the supply glut 
Bullish EIA Numbers The U S  Energy Department s inventory release showed that crude stockpiles declined for the fifth straight week  continuing to drag down the overall surplus 
The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 2 98 million barrels for the week ending Sep 30  2016  following a decline of 1 88 million barrels in the previous week 
The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go up some 2 million barrels  A drop in imports and production led to the surprise stockpile draw with the world s biggest oil consumer even as refinery activity slowed 
Following the fifth straight inventory reduction  the year over year storage surplus has narrowed down considerably 
Energy Stocks Gain
Year to date   The Energy Select Sector SPDR  has gained an impressive 17 54   easily outperforming the broad based Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S P 500 index  which gained just 4 04  and 4 54   respectively  Most major oil stocks   including mega caps Exxon Mobil Corp    NYSE XOM    Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   and Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc    relocated in the green with gains of 12 56   14 54  and 11 86   respectively 
Upbeat Outlook
It s true that record high inventories and tepid demand growth could still push the commodity to the depths of multiyear lows  But signs are emerging that oil prices are likely to stabilize and gradually pick up  Not only is global demand expanding but energy companies have significantly scaled back on plans to explore for and bring out more oil  This should lead to lower future production and supply demand rebalancing 
Secondly  while analysts remain deeply skeptical that the OPEC output curb would be carried through  the early reaction in energy stocks has been positive  Oil prices have jumped more than 10  since the members  meeting in Algeria  and should the ministers agree on production levels in Nov  even higher prices are a likely outcome 
Even as we cannot run down the chances of the market moving sideways and seeing high volatility  many analysts are not too bearish about oil in the remainder of 2016  In fact  some industry observers are of the view that crude prices would break through  55 per barrel before then year end 
Opt for Value Picks with Earnings Growth
Since the long term landscape holds well for energy stocks  despite certain bottlenecks  it will be a wise decision to invest in value stocks 
Value investing offers an opportunity to enter the market and grab stocks that have otherwise been overlooked by a majority of investors  and are thus trading at cheap multiples 
Thanks to our new   we have been able to identify value stocks which have incredible potential in the near term  Our research shows that stocks with Value Style Scores of  A  or  B  when combined with Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer great investment opportunities  You can see  Further  we have chosen those value stocks that have an estimated growth rate of more than 20  this year

193260,414776,CVX,5 Energy Stocks That Doubled In  16   And Keep Going Up,opinion,"We are almost at the last leg of 2016  a year that was marked by unprecedented energy market volatility 
The Story So Far
The year started on a disappointing note with crude prices falling to a 12 year low of  26 21 in Feb as investors worried about the oversupplied market  The commodity s collapse threatened the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and pummeling producer s profit margins 
However  indications that supply was easing helped oil prices rebound to  50 barrel mark in early Jun  The surge was driven by outages in Nigeria  Libya  Venezuela and Canada   countries that hold some of the world s major sources of crude  The upward pressure in oil prices also reflected the U S  Energy Department s inventory releases that showed crude stockpile builds turning into draws  Things were further helped by a continued decline in U S  crude production 
With factors like Canadian wildfires  Nigerian outages disruptions  production issues in Venezuela and a strike by Kuwaiti oil workers vanishing from the market  oil slipped back under  40 in the first week of Aug  A glut of refined products also kept the commodity under pressure 
The volatility in oil prices continued with the benchmark touching the  50 threshold again last week  In fact  crude has managed to stay above the psychologically important mark since then  buoyed by government figures that continue to show large drawdowns  while investors bet on commitments by OPEC and non OPEC players to slash production targets 
Energy Sector Performance
Despite the instability  the energy sector continued to be an outperformer  The  The Energy Select Sector SPDR  has grown 17 04  year to date  Analysts attribute the strong performance to the buzz surrounding the OPEC announcement of a plan to cut output  All the sector behemoths right from Exxon Mobil Corp    NYSE XOM    Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX    Anadarko Petroleum Corp    NYSE APC   to Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  have been making giant strides  thereby giving a boost to the overall energy sector 
However  record high inventories and tepid demand growth could still push the commodity to the depths of multiyear lows  But signs are emerging that oil prices are likely to stabilize and gradually pick up  Not only is global demand expanding but energy companies have significantly scaled back on plans to explore for and bring out more oil  This should lead to lower future production and supply demand rebalancing

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  RSPP  CVX BP  PSX  E

	It was a week which saw oil prices hit 1 year peak  while natural gas futures soared to their highest level since Dec 2014 

	On the news front  independent oil and gas player RSP Permian Inc   NYSE      agreed to acquire private equity backed producer Silver Hill Energy Partners for  2 4 billion in cash and stock  while supermajor Chevron Corp   NYSE      is looking to raise around  2 billion by selling its Bangladesh natural gas assets 

	Overall  it was a good week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures added 1 1  to close at  50 35 per barrel  while natural gas prices rallied 2 9  to  3 285 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here     

	Oil prices notched up their fourth successive weekly gain as investors clung on to optimism generated by OPEC and non OPEC players  commitments to slash production targets 

	The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   whose member nations supply around 40  of the world s crude  said it would cut production by as much as 750 000 barrels a day starting in November in order to keep oil prices from falling further  The group also claims to have firm commitments from non OPEC biggies like Russia to participate in a collective effort to cut the supply glut 

	Apart from the OPEC announcement  oil prices were also supported by the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release  which showed that domestic crude production declined to a level not seen since Jun 2014 

	Meanwhile  natural gas raced to a 22 month high following another thinner than expected build   the 23rd in a row  The commodity was also buoyed by a government report that lifted price forecast for 2016 and 2017 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

	1  Upstream energy player RSP Permian Inc  announced its decision to acquire Silver Hill Energy Partners  The transaction value has been estimated at roughly  2 4 billion that includes both cash and stocks  The move reflects RSP Permian s intention to expand its resources in the Permian Basin in Texas  RSP Permian currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see     

	Silver Hill Energy has controlling interest in 68 000 gross  41 000 net  acres within the Delaware basin that contributes to about 15 000 net barrels of oil equivalent every day  BOE D   RSP Permian already operates huge acreages in the Midland Basin that cover almost 63 000 net acres of land  The acquisition will now give the company access to 3 200 gross undeveloped areas in the Delaware  Silver Hill Energy also owns 58 producing wells  of which 49 are horizontal 

	The Permian Basin acreage is one of the cheapest for developing U S  onshore oil fields  Hence  RSP Permian s decision to acquire more properties in the region is undoubtedly a prudent one  According to media reports  this deal will likely boost production of RSP Permian by almost 50    Read more     

	2  Chevron Corp   the second largest U S  oil producer  confirmed that it is contemplating the sale of its natural gas assets in Bangladesh to counter weak commodity prices  The assets that are likely to be sold produce natural gas and condensate from three fields in the northeast of the country 

	In Bangladesh  Chevron operates the Bibiyana  Jalalabad and Moulavi Bazar fields  The company sells all the production to state oil company Petrobangla  Its net daily production last year averaged 720 million cubic feet of natural gas and 3 000 barrels of condensate 

	As per reports  Chevron is seeking about  2 billion from the potential sale of natural gas assets in Bangladesh  Notably  the proposed sale has drawn interest of several Indian and Chinese oil producers   Read more     

	3  British oil major BP plc  NYSE      announced its decision to discontinue exploration drilling program in the Great Australian Bight   GAB    offshore South Australia 

	The appraisal and evaluation of BP s upstream strategy in early 2016 led to this move  BP believes that  in the near future the GAB project will not be competitive enough for as much capital investment as other upstream opportunities in its global portfolio 

	BP has also discussed this with its joint venture partner Statoil  OL STL  ASA  The latter has displayed a complete understanding of BP s change in strategic direction and accepted its decision BP was rewarded exploration licenses for four blocks in the Ceduna area of the GAB in Jan 2011  The company acquired seismic data in the area in the period between late 2011 and early 2012  In 2013  Statoil farmed in 30  in the licenses  while BP remained the operator with an interest of 70    Read more     

	4  Downstream operator Phillips 66  NYSE      entered into an agreement with its master limited partnership Phillips 66 Partners L P  to drop down properties worth  1 3 billion to the latter 

	Phillips 66 would give 30 assets that comprise crude pipelines  refined products and natural gas liquids pipelines and terminal systems  The agreement includes units supporting the parent company s refineries in Bayway  New Jersey  Billings  Montana  Borger  Texas and Ponca City  Oklahoma 

	This apart  Phillips 66 will enter into a decade long terminaling and throughput agreements that will include minimum volume commitments covering about 85  of expected volumes  On completion of the deal   expected sometime in Oct   the partnership will be entitled to receive cash earnings related to the acquired assets as of Oct 1  2016   Read more     

	5  Italian energy company Eni SpA  NYSE      announced that the first batch of export crude oil has been dispatched from the onshore processing plant of the massive Kashagan oil field 

	The field was re opened a little while back  upon successful replacement of pipelines  Production is now estimated to increase up to a first level of 180 000 barrels per day  The consortium for the development of Kashagan aims for a production level of 370 000 barrels per day by the end of 2017 

	Located in the North Caspian Sea  the giant oilfield is about 80 kilometers southeast of Atyrau  in Kazakhstan  Kashagan is one of the largest oil fields discovered in the last four decades and is estimated to hold reserves of 35 billion barrels of oil in place  In fact  the oil field is considered to be one of the most complex and challenging industrial projects worldwide in terms of its size  the specifications  as well as the environmental and logistical characteristics involved 

	Kashagan is operated by NCOC  North Caspian Operating Company  which operates within the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement  NCSPSA   Eni has a stake of 16 81  in the project   Read more

5 Energy Stocks to Turn It Around in Q4

	Oil prices moved to the  50 threshold Thursday as government figures showed a draw in crude stocks for the fifth straight week and investors clung on to optimism generated by a decision from the world s largest oil cartel to slash production targets 

	Riding the bull run  West Texas Intermediate crude for Nov delivery gained  1 14  or 2 3   to settle at  49 83 a barrel in electronic trading yesterday   the best since Jun 29 

The Catalysts

OPEC Agreement  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC   whose member nations supply around 40  of the world s crude  said it would cut production by as much as 750 000 barrels a day starting in November in order to keep oil prices from falling further  Most industry observers didn t have high expectations from the meeting 

	OPEC s decision to cut oil production   made in a meeting in Algiers last Wednesday  Sep 28   took most analysts by surprise  The move  led by Saudi Arabia  aims to trim output to 32 5 33 0 million barrels per day from the current 33 5 million barrels per day 

Bullish EIA Numbers  The U S  Energy Department s inventory release showed that crude stockpiles declined for the fifth straight week  continuing to drag down the overall surplus 

	The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 2 98 million barrels for the week ending Sep 30  2016  following a decline of 1 88 million barrels in the previous week 

	The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go up some 2 million barrels  A drop in imports and production led to the surprise stockpile draw with the world s biggest oil consumer even as refinery activity slowed 

	Following the fifth straight inventory reduction  the year over year storage surplus has narrowed down considerably 

Supportive for Stocks

	Year to date   The Energy Select Sector SPDR  has gained an impressive 17 56   easily outperforming the broad based Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S P 500 index  which gained just 4 91  and 5 67   respectively  Most major oil stocks   including mega caps Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX  and Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa    relocated in the green with gains of 11 61   13 64  and 12 49   respectively 

There s Still Room for Upside

	It s true that record high inventories and tepid demand growth could still push the commodity to the depths of multiyear lows  But signs are emerging that oil prices are likely to stabilize and gradually pick up  Not only is global demand expanding but energy companies have significantly scaled back on plans to explore for and bring out more oil  This should lead to lower future production and supply demand rebalancing 

	Secondly  while analysts remain deeply skeptical that the OPEC output curb would be carried through  the early reaction in energy stocks has been positive  Oil prices have jumped more than 10  since the members  meeting in Algeria  and should the ministers agree on production levels in Nov  even higher prices are a likely outcome 

	Even as we cannot run down the chances of the market moving sideways and seeing high volatility  many analysts are not too bearish about oil in the remainder of 2016  In fact  some industry observers are of the view that crude prices would break through  50 per barrel yet again before then year end 

Look for Bargain Buys with Strong Fundamentals

	If investors are eager to lap up opportunities  a prudent move would be to buy the beaten down stocks with encouraging fundamentals  Stressed valuations do not always indicate that the stock has lost all potential  In fact  some could actually make a great buy  But prospective investors need to do adequate research before betting one s hard earned money on such stocks 

	To guide investors to the right picks  we highlight 5 stocks that carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   You can see     

	The Zacks Rank is a reliable tool that helps you to trade with confidence regardless of your trading style and risk tolerance  To learn more about how you can use this proven system for market beating gains  visit  

	The stocks  which we shall cherry pick  currently come at a bargain price after declining at least 15  in the first 9 months of the year  but have the potential to turn around in the fourth quarter

193275,414791,CVX,Azerbaijan s ruling party seen easily winning election,news,"By Nailia Bagirova
BAKU  Reuters    Azeri voters headed to the polls on Sunday for a parliamentary election which Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev s ruling party is widely expected to win  and which mainstream opposition and international monitors are shunning 
Aliyev has consolidated his power since succeeding his father and long serving leader Heydar in 2003  presiding over a period when officials say revenues from rising oil and gas exports have delivered better living standards 
Rights groups accuse the government of curbing freedoms and of silencing dissent  while the opposition complains of harassment  a lack of access to broadcasting  and draconian restrictions on campaigning 
The government denies wrongdoing  and Western governments  who are courting Azerbaijan as an alternative source of oil and gas to Russia  balance their criticism over human rights with strategic considerations 
Azerbaijan is host to oil majors including  BP   L BP  PLC   Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM  and  Chevron  Corp   N CVX 
 We got 71  out of 125  seats at the previous election and we have every chance to repeat that victory this time   Ali Akhmedov  the executive secretary of the ruling Yeni Azerbaijan  New Azerbaijan  Party  said 
The mainstream opposition in Azerbaijan  a mainly Muslim country of about 9 million people between Iran  Russia and Turkey  is boycotting the poll 
 The pre election period was marred by massive violations  That s why we decided not to participate   opposition Musavat Party leader  Arif Gajily  told Reuters 
All 125 seats in the single chamber parliament  which is elected every five years  will be filled through voting for individual candidates in electoral districts 
Human Rights Watch said this week that Azeri authorities had convicted or imprisoned at least 35 journalists and rights and political activists in 2014 and that  the crackdown continued at a dizzying pace  
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe  OSCE  said it would not monitor the election because restrictions imposed on it by the authorities made credible poll monitoring impossible 
 I urge Azerbaijan s leaders to engage with their citizens and with the international community in an open and honest dialogue aimed at bringing human rights and rule of law back to the country   the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly s democracy and human rights chairperson  Isabel Santos  said earlier this week 
Some foreign journalists  including reporters from Reuters  were not issued with accreditation to cover the election  The foreign ministry cited technical difficulties 

Polls close at 7 p m   1500 GMT  and official preliminary results are expected to follow within hours

OPEC Surprises with Production Cut  Energy ETFs to Soar

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  unexpectedly agreed to cap its oil production for the first time in eight years at a meeting in Algiers  infusing optimism into the energy sector  This is especially true as oil price jumped almost 6  immediately after the news  This would be the first historic deal between the OPEC and non OPEC producers in over a decade  read    

Proposed Deal
	The 14 member cartel proposed to cut oil output by about a million barrels per day to 32 5 33 million barrels per day from the current 33 2 million barrels per day  Saudi Arabia  the largest oil producer  will likely curtail its production by 350 000 barrel a day while the full details of output cut by each country will be finalized in the next meeting on November 30  in Vienna 
	Investors should note that Iran  Libya and Nigeria will not be part of the agreement and will continue to increase their production by as much as 1 5 million barrels a day collectively 
	As per the International Energy Agency  IEA   the production cut of 200 000 to 33 million barrels per day will have a limited impact on global supply and markets are unlikely to rebalance until the second half of 2017  But if OPEC cuts 700 000 barrels per day of oil  then it would take care of the global supply glut issue as soon as the end of this year 
	The move would be a huge boon to the energy sector  as it will end the two year crude oil rout and stabilize the oil market  It will revitalize growth in the battered energy sector and lift the economies of the oil rich countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia  read     Global Oil Stocks Surge

193302,414818,CVX,How To Invest In The Commodities Turnaround ,opinion,"It s been a rough couple of years for the commodities group 

Investors nearly abandoned most of the sector during this time  leaving energy and fertilizer stocks in the dust  

But in 2016  there was some relief  

Gold has rebounded and is up 20  year to date  Oil hit lows in February but has bounced off that level and hasn t re visited it  Fertilizer prices  however  continue to struggle but analysts see a turnaround coming in 2017 

Is this the time to get into the commodities as a play on the turnaround 

It s a risky proposition  Commodities are still clearly out of favor  

The Zacks Market Edge Podcast looked into the three key commodities areas earlier this year and asked  should you be investing now 
Should You Take a Chance on the Fertilizer Stocks 

The agriculture industry continues to struggle as farming incomes have fallen three straight years  

Fertilizer demand has softened  and prices have fallen too  That leaves the fertilizer giants in a tough place  with declining earnings 

Tracey Ryniec and Jeremy Mullin explore the biggest names including Potash    and Agrium     which just agreed to merge in 2017  

Are the fertilizer stocks cheap  Are there opportunities here  

Tracey and Jeremy will fill you in  

Is the Worst Over for Energy 

Tracey and Sheraz Mian have talked about the energy market several times in 2016  

In August  though  it appeared that things were turning around  Instead of being cut  earnings estimates were back on the move higher again  

Crude also seemed to have stabilized and oil inventories were dropping  indicating that supply and demand were re balancing 
The Top Energy Stocks to Buy Now

Not every energy stock is created equal  however  They all have their niches  

Sheraz is still a fan of the big integrated oil companies like Exxon  NYSE XOM     and Chevron  NYSE CVX      But if you like a little more risk  then the E Ps are where you should be  Sheraz s favorite is Pioneer Natural Resources     

Tracey has her favorite picks as well  

But what about the energy service companies and the MLPs  Should investors be considering them in 2016

The Commodity With the Golden Touch

Gold has been among the hottest commodities this year  It s actually out performing the S P 500  

Tracey and Jeremy drill down into the reasons gold has been so hot including the fear trade  both about Brexit and now about the US Presidential Election  and negative bond yields forcing investors to look for returns elsewhere  

The easiest way to invest directly in gold is through the Gold ETF  NYSE GLD      But investors can also play the gold miners through triple ETFs such as the Gold Miners Triple ETF     

What do Jeremy and Tracey think about gold going forward 

Should you be investing now  if you aren t already in it  Or is it too late

193308,414824,CVX,3 Energy ETFs At 52 Week Highs On Huge Inventory Drop,opinion,"U S  crude inventories plunged more than 14 million barrels last week ending September 2  2016  thanks to the tropical storm Hermine  This represented the steepest weekly inventory drop   Analysts were expecting a 225 000 barrel rise 
A significant fall in imports into the Gulf of Mexico and the U S  East Coast due to the storms led to this huge drawdown  Imports into the U S  Gulf Coast dropped to about a 26 year low at  barrels per day 
Analysts said that the storms obstructed cargo ships on the way to U S  refineries  causing a drop in U S  imports of 1 8 million barrels a day  The hurricane compelled the evacuation of  and resulted in the shutdown of 12  of U S  oil drilling in the Gulf   
Needless to say  such a massive inventory drop resolves the oversupply issue in the oil patch  at least for the time being  United States Oil Fund  NYSE USO    V USO    which looks to track the daily changes of the WTI crude  added over 4 1  on September 8  following the release of the inventory data  United States Brent Oil   AX BNO    which aims to track the daily changes in the spot price of Brent crude oil  also advanced over 3 8  on the day  read    
Along with oil price  several energy equity ETFs recorded smart gains following the release of the stockpile data  Below  we highlight a few ETFs that hit a 52 week high on September 8  see  here  
S P 500 Energy Equal Weight Guggenheim   V RYE  
The 37 stock fund puts as much as 80 52  weight in the oil gas and consumable gas segment followed by 19 2  in energy equipment and services  Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK  Co   4 28    Williams Companies Inc  NYSE WMB    3 46   and Spectra Energy Corp  NYSE SE   3 22   are the top three holdings of the fund  The fund charges 40 bps in fees and added about 3 3  on September 8  read    
PowerShares DWA Energy Momentum ETF   HN PXI  
The underlying index of the fund focuses on companies with relative strength  The 35 stock fund invests about 86 2  in oil  gas   consumable fuels while energy equipment   services account for the rest  Pioneer Natural Resources  6 28    Concho Resources  5 89   and Diamondback Energy  5 49   are the top three holdings of the fund  The fund charges about 60 bps in fees and tacked on over 2  gains on September 8 
Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLE  
The 39 stock fund invests about 83 5  in oil  gas   consumable fuels followed by 16 4  in energy equipment   services  Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   17 76    Chevron  NYSE CVX   14 24   and Schlumberger  8 2   are the fund s top three holdings  The fund charges 14 bps in fees and yields about 2 76  annually  It added about 1 9  on September 8 
Can the Surge Last  
Since the move is the result of a one time event  the upcoming weeks may see a rise in inventories  Higher imports and normalization in offshore drilling activities in the Gulf will likely result in increased inventory built up in the coming weeks  Notably  at 511 4 million barrels  U S  crude oil inventories are presently at a record high for this time of the year   
In any case  oil investors are eagerly looking forward to the oil producer meeting to be held during September 26 28 on possibilities of output control talks  Though chances of a deal are feeble  oil as well as energy ETFs may see an uptrend in the near term on increased optimism  So  investors can play the above mentioned ETFs as long as the bullish trend remains  read

193323,414839,CVX,Oil Prices Remain Under Pressure ,opinion,"Storm Chasing
The National Hurricane Center is warning that interests in the northwestern Bahamas and Florida should monitor the progress of a tropical wave disturbance known as Invest 99 L and already there are signs in the oil market that oil companies are heeding the warning  Strong product buying on the Gulf Coast ahead of what could be a major storm for contractual buyers and sellers is the prudent thing to do  While the National Hurricane Center says that there are large uncertainties regarding this system s development and future track  it is too early to speculate on what specific impacts might occur in the northwestern Bahamas  Florida or beyond 
Oil traders and commodity traders won t wait around  Speculate is what they do  We have already seen significant buying in natural gas and unwinding of spreads on the rumors of the storm as well as positioning in cash and other markets  Talk of big call option buying from the trading floor in oil was reported  That may accelerate as the storm details continue 
Dave Tolleris  meteorologist  has been watching this tropical disturbance from the beginning  He is warning that this storm based on his tracking has the possibility of being a major hurricane that could reach the Gulf of Mexico  Overnight he said that the early Thursday morning European storm models show that the storm becomes a hurricane that will go across South Florida as a tropical storm  Then the storm at that point will be named Hermine and parallel the West Coast of Florida  Its track then puts it in the Florida panhandle on August 31st  That will put the storm at a category 2 strength  That would flood already rain battered areas of the Gulf Coast and cause problems for refiners as well as producers and transport 
Mr  Tolleris says that he expects that when the European ensembles tracking comes out later in the day  it may take the storm track significantly to the West which could increase the chances for a much stronger storm  He says the risk is still quite high that this storm will swing out to the western gulf and become a much more powerful hurricane that could reach a category 4 or higher 
Tolleris warns that the GFS storm model that takes the system over Eastern Florida and then out to sea is a  meteorological impossibility   He also says that some people will look at the European Model and dismiss this storm as a moderate hurricane in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico which may be true but he says that the risk is quite high that this storm could become a more powerful hurricane 
Right now the National Hurricane Center gives the feature a 50  chance of becoming at least a tropical depression in the next two days and an 80  chance in the next five days  The USA Today reported   if it hits Florida as a hurricane  it would be the first hurricane to strike the Florida Peninsula since Wilma in October 2005   according to AccuWeather hurricane expert Dan Kottlowski 
Oil prices are still under pressure as the market has more evidence of abundant supply and the risk that this storm will give the demand side a hit  We saw the Energy Information Administration report a larger than expected increase in U S  commercial crude oil inventories which rose by 2 5 million barrels from the previous week  Part of the increase was because of a sharp drop in refinery runs to 92 5  of capacity even though that is a high number for this year  Floods in Louisiana probably helped Gulf Coast gasoline stocks rise  Over all the EIA said that total motor gasoline inventories remained unchanged last week and are well above the upper limit of the average range  Finished gasoline inventories increased while blending components inventories decreased last week  Distillate fuel inventories increase d by 0 1 million barrels last week and are near the upper limit of the average range for this time of year 
Supply glut notwithstanding the long term outlook for global oil markets  are in for a dramatic tightening in the next few years  As global demand is going to shatter all time records next year  Big Oil companies do not have the money to invest to keep up with that demand  Case in point  yesterday a story in the Wall Street Journal reported that big oil debt loads are at an all time record high  The Journal reports that   Some of the world s largest energy companies are saddled with their highest debt levels ever as they struggle with low crude prices  raising worries about their ability to pay dividends and find new barrels  Exxon Mobil Corp  NYSE XOM    Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  PLC  BP  LON BP  and Chevron Corp   NYSE CVX  hold a combined net debt of  184 billion more than double their debt levels in 2014  when oil prices began a steep descent that eventually bottomed out at  27 a barrel earlier this year  Crude prices have rebounded since  but still hover near  50 a barrel   The Journal warns that   The debt is piling up despite cuts of billions of dollars on new projects and current operations  Repaying the loans could weigh the companies down for years  crimping their ability to make investments elsewhere and keep pumping ever more oil and gas 
The companies spent more than 100  of their profits on dividends last year  This year  the problem got worse  In the April to June period  Exxon paid  3 1 billion in dividends and had just  1 7 billion in net income  according to S P Global Market Intelligence  Shell paid  1 26 billion in interest in the first half of 2016  compared with  726 million in the same period a year earlier   They are just not spending enough to boost production   said Jonathan Waghorn  co portfolio manager in London at Guinness Atkinson Asset Management Inc  who helps oversee more than  400 million across a range of energy funds  including shares in Exxon  BP  Chevron and Shell  
As far as I am concerned  we are seeing complacency in the market when it comes to supply and demand balance the way we did back in the last decade  Long term the lack of investment will make it hard to meet future demand  Whenever we have seen this in the history of oil markets going back as far as  Spindle Top   it has meant sharply higher prices in the future ",2016-08-25,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-08-25-16-200149986,200149986
193324,414840,CVX,What To Make Of The Energy Sector  Including And Excluding Exxon,opinion,"Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  are the two big giants in the Energy sector  Both companies combine for a whopping 33  weighting within the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLE  and 28  weighting within the iShares US Energy ETF  NYSE IYE  
Of the two stocks  Exxon has always been preferred for client accounts  given that the company has remained free cash flow positive throughout what has been a brutal downturn in the price of crude oil and natural gas  while Chevron has not 
Exxon however did not report a particularly good 2nd quarter  2016  missing both EPS and revenue estimates by a mile  Exxon reported actual EPS of  0 41 vs a  0 64 consensus while revenue missed by a whopping 10   printing  57 6 billion versus the consensus Street estimate of  64 billion even 

According to Greg Harrison at Thomson Reuters  because of the collapse in Energy earnings  Exxon and Chevron today constitute 86  and 33  of the earnings weight of the sector  while revenue weights represent 28  and 14  respectively  with the point being that Exxon and Chevron are accounting for all of the net income for the Energy sector and almost half   42    of the sector s revenue 
Of the 37 Energy companies in the S P 500 today  roughly half are not currently profitable  i e  negative earnings weight in the index  
Bespoke noted in their weekly Bespoke Report tonight  that while crude oil is up roughly 12  in August  16  the sector is up just 3  on the month 
While I never expect to see  100 crude oil again in my lifetime  I do think crude can push toward  60 and maybe  70  recovering half its peak price near  140    145 from 2007 
Conclusion  The point of the article was to see if Exxon was having a substantial negative impact on the expected EPS and revenue growth of the Energy sector since its Q2  16 earnings report  and in fact  Exxon is not a drag on the sector s expected growth  and is still contributing positively to the sector  Looking at the above sector and Exxon s expected growth rates versus  Energy  Ex Exxon  the oil giant is still showing better expected growth than the rest of the sector  until Q3  17 
But here is the caveat for readers  these are still forecasts  and although they are based on the expectations of the sector experts  these consensus estimates are just that   estimates  They change daily and they will change again in late October  early November  when Exxon and Chevron report Q3  16 results 
Revenue growth has started to improve for the sector  but EPS growth is lagging revenue growth 
  Q3  16 should start to show better results across the broad sector  and really I m focused on Q4  16 through Q1  17 in terms of results and forward revisions 
In the first quarter of 2016  basically all the profits of the energy sector were wiped out   just like the Financials in Q3  07   so even if a reader is skeptical of the long run prospects of fossil fuels and crude oil and gasoline prospects  the sector should outperform   in my opinion   for at least the next 6   9 months 
A crude oil  WTI  trade through  50    51 decisively would only help the sector 
Exxon Mobil is oversold on the daily chart  and likely due for a nice bounce 

Some thoughtful readers have a real issue with the long term viability of the fossil fuels  A trade in XOM back through  95 to the upside would be a welcome occasion for the Energy bulls 
Disclosure  Remember  estimates and forecasts can change at any time  Positions can change at any time  Long a small position on XOM  mostly long IYE  XLE  OIH for clients  May add to XOM for a trade ",2016-08-28,Brian Gilmartin,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-sector,-including-and-excluding-exxon-200150359",200150359

193332,414848,CVX,Chevron Vs  Exxon  Which Is Better Positioned Post Q2 ,opinion,"Exxon Mobil Corp    NYSE XOM   and Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX     with their massive market capitalizations of  360 billion and  190 billion  respectively   dominate and define the U S  energy industry 
Both these companies are engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas  refining and marketing of petroleum products  manufacturing of chemicals  and other energy related businesses 
But how do you choose between the two supermajors  Here s a look at Exxon Mobil and Chevron stocks  performances in 2016 
Stock Performance
Both Exxon Mobil and Chevron have handily outperformed the S P 500 in the current year  with Exxon Mobil stock rising 11  to Chevron s 13   compared to the S P 500 s gain of just 7   Of course  these are numbers at a time when oil prices recovered from a 12 year low of  26 21 a barrel in Feb to  50 barrel mark in early Jun and then slipping again to the low  40s 
Exxon Mobil stock now trades at about 34 times trailing twelve months earnings and 35 times forward earnings for 2016  while Chevron stock is valued at 115 times trailing twelve months earnings and about 73 times forward earnings 
Being much more expensive  Chevron shares are primed for a fall 
Recent Earnings
In an indication of the toll that low commodity prices are taking on the industry  Chevron swung to a loss  including impairments and charges  for the three months ended Jun 30  while Exxon Mobil s earnings per share were down 59  
Moreover  the two largest U S  energy companies by market value are experiencing signs of weakness in the refining business  suggesting that the units   which had saved them when crude prices plunged   could now be a drag  Both Exxon Mobil and Chevron s  downstream  unit profits halved from the comparable period of 2015 
The deteriorating downstream results could be attributed to a fall in refining margins as the cost of gasoline  heating oil  and other refined products catches up on the beaten down crude price  Following a prolonged period of high differentials  crack spreads have weakened  which lead to deteriorating earnings and cash flows 
As it is  the companies are struggling with faltering sales of their exploration and production businesses amid plunging commodity prices 
Production   Capital Expenditure
Exxon Mobil and Chevron are suffering from marginal or falling returns  reflecting their struggle to replace reserves  as access to new energy resources becomes more difficult  Given their large base  achieving growth in oil and natural gas production is anyways a challenge for these companies over the last many years 
During the Jan Jun period  the Irving  TX based oil and natural gas powerhouse Exxon Mobil s production averaged 4 141 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day  MBOE d   essentially unchanged from the first six months of 2015  For another domestic behemoth Chevron  total volume of crude oil and natural gas was down 1 6  from the year earlier level at 2 597 MBOE d 
At  10 3 billion  Exxon Mobil s capital and exploration expenditure for the first half of this year has run 36  lower than in the equivalent period of 2015  Chevron managed to reduce its outlay by 31  to  12 billion 
Shareholder Value
Despite the bloodbath  both Exxon Mobil and Chevron have continued to reward shareholders with large annual dividends of  3 00 and  4 28 per share   currently yielding 3 5  and 4 2   respectively  In Apr  Exxon Mobil boosted its quarterly payout for the 34th consecutive year  Though Chevron has not raised its dividend this year  it has raised dividend for 28 straight years 
However  in a move designed to conserve cash amid the energy price rout  the companies have stopped pouring money into their once vigorous stock buyback programs  While Chevron have scrapped its share repurchase scheme  Exxon Mobil has trimmed its buybacks program by around 50  
Through the year s first half  Exxon Mobil spent  6 2 billion in dividends  while shelling out  726 million on share buybacks  no purchases in the second quarter   Meanwhile  Chevron paid out  4 billion in dividends 
Cash Flow from Operations
Leaving aside dividends and repurchases  Exxon Mobil s cash flow from operations and asset sales came in at  10 5 billion in the first six months of the year  Importantly  this was almost the same as its capital spending  a testament to the company s solid operations and cost discipline 
In contrast  Chevron s cash from operations was  3 7 billion  more than  8 billion short of its capital spending 
Bottom Line
Exxon Mobil and Chevron are two of the best run companies among the global oil majors  consistently producing industry leading financial returns  Both are still sound financially  In fact  their financial flexibility and strong balance sheets are real assets in this highly uncertain period for the economy  Both remain in excellent financial health  with enough in cash on hand and a very manageable debt to capitalization ratio  Exxon Mobil  though  with a lower ratio of 14 3  scores over Chevron s 21 1  
Nevertheless  neither Exxon Mobil nor Chevron   both carrying Zacks Rank  3  Hold    has been spared the effects of the rout in crude prices  But going by their performance thus far in 2016  Exxon Mobil seems to be in relatively better shape 
The most notable victim of the commodity meltdown has been share buybacks   gone for Chevron  Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  and BP plc   NYSE BP    Despite trimming significantly  Exxon Mobil till recently managed to spend  500 million a quarter to purchase shares  However  the company elected not to repurchase any common stocks under its repurchase program during the second quarter 
Next is the dividend  Exxon Mobil   a double A credit rated company   hiked its dividend in April by 3  to 75 cents  The same can t be said for Chevron  which kept it the same at  1 07 a share 
The most important advantage for Exxon Mobil over Chevron  though  lies in its ability to generate free cash flow  In fact  the company has done a far better job at preserving cash than Chevron that has been free cash flow negative for a few years 
Such has been the repercussions on Chevron that it has scaled back its production growth target over the next two years and is cutting up to 8 000 jobs  or 12  of its workforce 
Finally  Exxon Mobil s business is roughly twice the size of Chevron s  which gives it the gargantuan scale to stand up a bit better to industry headwinds ",2016-08-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chevron-vs.-exxon:-which-is-better-positioned-post-q2-200147745,200147745

193338,414854,CVX,Chevron  Exxon Face Shareholder Pressure On Climate Concerns,news,"By   

 Exxon Mobil  Corp  NYSE XOM   and  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  are facing pressure from environmentally focused shareholders  At the U S  oil giants  annual meetings Wednesday  shareholders are set to vote on a handful of progressive resolutions  including a measure to add a climate change expert to their boards of directors and an initiative to steer investment away from risky and carbon intensive projects like Arctic oil and gas drilling 
The resolutions are part of a larger movement by sustainability advocates to push energy giants to acknowledge their role in contributing to harmful greenhouse gas emissions and to assess the risks companies face if low carbon policies force them to leave oil  coal and natural gas in the ground  In January  Royal Dutch Shell  LONDON RDSa  PLC recommended that its investors approve a resolution requiring the company to disclose its  stranded asset  risks    a move that environmental groups say validates their years long efforts 
 Big Oil will not make money the same way it did last century   Natasha Lamb  director of equity research and shareholder engagement at wealth manager Arjuna Capital  said in a statement   Chevron faces two physical truths  There is only so much easy to get oil in the ground and only so much carbon we can pump into the air  
Arjuna Capital and As You Sow  a shareholder advocacy organization  filed a resolution calling on Chevron to ditch its plans for  unconventional  drilling projects  including in the Canadian tar sands and Arctic waters  and instead return the capital to shareholders   The next hundred years will be defined by these limits   Lamb said   Winning companies will focus on shareholder value  returning a greater percentage of profits to shareholders rather than risk investor capital chasing every last drop  
Separate shareholder groups filed resolutions with Exxon and Chevron to push the largest U S  oil companies to add directors with deep knowledge of environmental and climate change issues to their boards  Boards of both energy companies have opposed the effort  Reuters reported Wednesday 
 Just one authoritative figure with acknowledged expertise and standing could perform a valuable role in ways that would enable the board to more effectively address the environmental issues and risks inherent in its present business model regarding climate change   according to the Exxon proposal cited by Reuters 
Exxon and Chevron said in their respective proxy filings that their board members have sufficient expertise to confront the challenges of climate change and potential carbon reduction efforts by the U S  and other governments ",2015-05-27,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chevron,-exxon-face-shareholder-pressure-on-climate-concerns-343717",343717

193342,414858,CVX,Tuesday Uncertain,opinion,"The Hoot  Actionable ideas for the busy trader delivered daily right up front 

Tuesday uncertain 
S P 500 pivot 2165 83  Holding above is bullish  
Rest of week bias uncertain technically 
Monthly outlook  bias lower 
YM futures trader  short at 17 670 

Well I sure didn t figure that  Last night it really looked like we were going higher on Monday  including oil  But the oil tanked and that took with it the enrgey sector including Dow component Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  which ended down just over 3 and a quarter percent and that s all it took to send the Dow lower by 28 points  And so the Dow continues its recent shallow slide with five reversal candles in a row  none of which have panned out  With a six in a row losing streak hoing  will the Dow ever move higher again  We consult the charts  for what little good they seem to be lately 
The technicals
Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are higher at 12 35 AM EDT with ES up 0 16   Last night s breakout was a total flop leaving us right back in the middle of a two week congestion zone 
ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot bumps up from 2165 83 to 2167 33  With a bounce off its new pivot right at midnight  ES remains above that level and so this indicator continues bullish 

Monday was really a mystery to me  Last night everything sure looked like we were posied to go higher  but we didn t  This sort of bearish dsivergence gives one pause  I don t recall another instance where things have gone so badly wrong technically in one day  For instnace  after a giant bearish engulfing candle on Friday plus a bearish stochastic crossover  the VIX rose nearly 5  on Monday  This is the sort of thing that makes me think that things may not be quite so good as they appear to be and is a reason I switched my vote in the Ticker Sens epoll from bullish to bearish this week 
In any case  what was looking like an ES breakout above its two week resistance turned out to be more of a fake out leaving us exactly at a level we ve visited eight days running now  I might as well jsut admit I have no way of calling the current market  Until we see some real action here  I think ES will continue to jiggle sideways while the Dow continues its apparently oil induced drift lower  Accordingly I ll just have to call Tuesday uncertain

193345,414861,CVX,Investing In Cheap Latin American Oil Production Through GeoPark Limited,opinion,"In the current oil market  investors must look into exploration and production companies operating in the utmost of efficiencies with little to no downside projects  GeoPark Limited    is an explorer  operator and consolidator of oil and gas currently standing up to the poor oil market with strong finances and impressive operational efficiencies made possible by the inexpensive nature of Latin America 
Their operations primarily take place in low cost countries such as Colombia  Peru  Chile and Brazil  Latin America remains one of the most underexplored and technically capable oil destinations in the world  The region s competitive advantage has allowed GeoPark to achieve profits in the majority of its operations through the oil slump  85  of the company s projects have remained cash flow positive maintaining profits at  25  30 bbl  The remaining production sees profitable returns at a very reasonable  40 bbl price level  To put this into perspective  consider the major oil players  struggle to get anywhere near these numbers  Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa     reported a breakeven price point of  55 bbl  Brazil based Petrobas    targets a breakeven in the range of  45  52  Meanwhile  BP  LON BP     is banking on  60 oil as they struggle to achieve profits at lower oil prices 
Their overall financial position substantially beats competitors through the industry downturn  GeoPark has  72 million in cash on hand with an additional  141 million in secured credit lines   the majority of which was generated from its Colombian crude oil sale to the Swiss commodity trader Trafigura at the end of 2015  Excess cash flow allows them flexibility to immediately add or expand projects pending on upward trends in the oil market  GeoPark has been able to increase cash flows year to year and we can expect this trend to continue 
Operational expenses have been slashed by 43  with drilling costs dropping by upwards of 25   The company s healthy financial position is defined by management s tendency to heavily rely on internal self funding in order to expand drilling and exploration projects  Projects continue to deliver quick sources of cash flow while enabling a capital expenditure cut of 80   
GeoPark has an impressive track record of consistent and conservative low risk growth in production and reserves  Starting from nothing  in the last 10 years the oil producer has steadily ramped up daily production and expects to hit an all time high of 22 500 boe d this year  The company has seen its strongest historical growth in proven and probable reserves  rising from 92 million boe in 2014 to 125 million boe last year  The net present value of this reserve base is estimated at  1 6 billion 
The Latin based explorer continues to find success in its exploration projects as they recently expanded drilling in the Janaca Oil Field part of Colombia s Llanos 34 Block acquired in 2012  The company currently holds 45  interest in Llanos 34  Since the acquisition four years ago  GeoPark has taken the once unproductive oil field to 34 000 boe d of output through cost effective innovations in drilling technology combined with efficient facilities and infrastructure  At  40 bbl  the oil producer has seen paybacks on Llanos 34 operations within 12 months and this expansion is likely to be no different  GeoPark s continued display of efficiency suggests geological expertise and improving technologies will likely extend the company s running trend of year over year cost cutting to drive margin growth 
Analysts have upped their F1 earnings estimates by 15 5  following the Llanos 34 drilling success  2016 first quarter earnings produced a  44  EPS surprise  GeoPark is part of Zacks  1 Rank and the target price stands at  3 75 
Rex Energy Corporation    and Abraxas Petroleum    are other Zacks  1 Rank oil producers with similar market caps

	While the Consumer side performed admirably at  4 2   even though this was slightly below expectations  as well   we saw a 6 1  drop in Housing  Business Investment was down 2 2  and Government Purchases fell 0 9  

	Again  not good by any stretch  and if 2016 is going to be where the U S  economy gains serious traction  it s going to have to outperform expectations just to get us where we thought we d be at the start of the year  Overall  we see a     1 3  rate on subsequent revisions for full year 2016 

	Here s the latest run down on earnings reports released prior to Friday s opening bell 

	Exxon   formerly the largest corporation on earth  missed badly on both top and bottom lines  Earnings of 41 cents per share was far below the 64 cents analysts had expected  and revenues of  57 7 billion missed the  60 1 billion expected  and a far cry from a decade ago  when Exxon  NYSE XOM  was pulling in  100 billion in revenues per quarter   Sharply lower commodity prices were largely at fault  along with weaker refining margins 

	Another super major integrated oil company  Chevron  NYSE CVX    beat sales expectations of  29 2 billion versus the  28 5 billion estimate  However  the company posted a big earnings loss on a  2 1 billion write down in the quarter  This was the company s worse loss since 2001

193357,414873,CVX,Oil Stock Earnings Reports  Chevron  CVX  VS  Exxon Mobil  XOM ,opinion,"This last week has been a busy one in regards to earnings  with over 1 000 public companies releasing their financial results from their most recent quarter  Friday saw a smaller amount of earnings reports  though there were still a multitude of companies that released financial results before the bell 
Two companies on the list of those that reported come from the oil producing industry  which has seen its fair share of struggles as of late on low world oil prices  Below are the two oil producers who reported their latest quarter s financial results  which were considered to be mixed by most 
Chevron Corporation   NYSE CVX  
San Ramon  California based Chevron Corporation   NYSE CVX   reported its second quarter 2016 financial results before the bell  posting adjusted EPS that was above estimates  though revenue was lower than expected  CVX posted EPS of  0 49  excluding special items   much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 31  Revenues came in at  29 3 billion for the second quarter  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  29 8 billion 
Including impairments and charges for the quarter  Chevron actually posted a loss of  1 5 billion  or EPS of   0 78  The company recorded impairments and other charges of  2 8 billion  on assets in its upstream exploration and production business that were expected to produce revenues insufficient to cover costs  Chairman and CEO John Watson said in a statement 
Watson also added   The second quarter results reflected lower oil prices and our ongoing adjustment to a lower oil price world   Losses in the company s US and international upstream operation widened from the year earlier period 
Chevron also left its quarterly dividend unchanged at  1 07 ahead of earnings on Wednesday  The company has not raised its dividend since the second quarter of 2014  In the first half of 2016  cash flow from operations has fallen more than 60  year over year to  3 7 billion 
CVX was trading around 1  lower to just over  100 a share early Friday morning  Chevron is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    CHEVRON CORP Price and EPS Surprise   Exxon Mobil Corporation   NYSE XOM  
The other oil producer to reports its latest quarter s financial results was Irving  Texas based Exxon Mobil Corporation   NYSE XOM    which posted lower than expected earnings and revenues  XOM reported EPS of  0 41  excluding special items   much lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 64  Revenues came in at  57 694 billion  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  59 834 
Exxon Mobil s profits were the smallest they have been since 1999  and were down 59  lower than for the same quarter last year  The EPS the company posted was  1 lower than it was in Q2 last year  Posted revenues were 22  lower than Q2 last year  Oil production remained flat compared to last year  at 4 1 billion barrels a day  partly because of recent Canadian wildfires 
 While our financial results reflect a volatile industry environment  Exxon Mobil remains focused on business fundamentals  cost discipline and advancing selective new investments across the value chain to extend our competitive advantage   said Rex Tillerson  Exxon Mobil Chairman and CEO said in a prepared statement   
Exxon Mobil announced last week it had acquired InternOil  a Papa New Guinea company  for  2 5 billion  This gives Exxon Mobil the largest publicly traded oil company  the Elk Antelope oil field  one of the largest in Asia

The oil industry has seen its fair share of troubles as of late  and the companies in the industry continue to be affected by the world s low oil price environment  Oil prices have come up since their lowest levels a short time ago  but prices will likely remain low as the world s oil supply is set to remain high in the coming months  With the low oil price environment set to continue  companies like CVX and XOM will need to continue to adjust in order to succeed ",2016-07-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-stock-earnings-reports:-chevron-(cvx)-vs.-exxon-mobil-(xom)-200145036,200145036
193358,414874,CVX,The State Of Earnings In The Oil Industry,opinion,"Investors hoping for a recovery in the oil market this year will have to wait  After bouncing off its lows in February  oil has started to slump back down with no signs of abating  Just yesterday oil prices struck a new three month low  having fallen almost 20  from its 2016 intradays highs 
The biggest concern is that production levels still remain high despite waning demand  This has been one of the primary contributors of cheap oil and weakness in the industry  Earnings have been just as bad for the huge refineries which were once viewed as blue chip stocks 
Weak quarterly reports from BP  LON BP  NYSE BP  and Shell  LON RDSa  NYSE RDSa  this week indicate weak oil prices will be a problem for the remainder of the year  Both companies pointed to significant challenges across the business that could become worse in light of increasing global uncertainty  Brexit  in particular  is one of the biggest risks to the price of oil 
Today we cap off earnings from large cap oil companies with results from Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  and Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX   Neither company has been able to shake off the weakness caused by low oil prices  According to the Estimize community both companies are well on their way to another bleak report 
 Exxon Mobil Corporation    Energy   Oil  Gas and Consumable Fuels
Analysts are calling for earnings per share of  0 65  down 37  from the same period last year  That estimate has dropped 2  since its last report in April  Revenue for the period is expected to drop 20  to  60 09 billion  marking another quarter of significant losses 

From a financial standpoint  ExxonMobil is still one of the premier companies to own  Its buyback programs and robust dividends have attracted investors even when the stock was down  Its strength lies in its balance operating  financial flexibility and efforts to cut costs and improve operationally 
Upstream earnings should show improvements after modest rise in oil prices and a production resurgence in key projects  Downstream operations  on the other hand  are likely to come in even lower 
Weak refined margins weighed down BP s earnings and should also take its toll on Exxon  Earlier this year management indicated slim growth in the medium term but for what it s worth  this quarter should be better than the last 
Chevron Corporation    Energy   Oil  Gas and Consumable Fuels
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  0 28  down 50  from the same period last year  That estimate has rise nearly 50  since Chevron s last report in April  Revenue is anticipated down 27  to  29 59 billion  marking the 7 consecutive quarters of double digit declines 

Chevron is coming off an abysmal first quarter which saw profits dip over 100  and revenue slip by 32   Its upstream segment was primarily to blame  reporting a plunge in earnings to   1 5 billion  Upstream services accounted for 61  of earnings in the quarter so it s not surprising Chevron turned a huge loss  Naturally the steep fall was due to a fall in oil and natural gas prices 
The downstream segment performed just as poorly  declining nearly 50  in the quarter  Chevron should expect some of that pressure to subside given the slight oil price appreciation during the quarter  Similar to its peer  Chevron also has strong financial flexibility  a strong balance sheet and a track record for rewarding its shareholders

exposed than it should be in that environment because of the types of contracts we had in place   he said  Shell made the decision in the early 2000s and it took around a decade for that to have a real impact on the company s bottom line  Henry said   In 2009  Shell s then CEO Peter Voser said a  1 move in the crude price would shift earnings up or down by around  200 million  In January  Henry estimated the impact of a dollar move on earnings was around  330 million and increasing  Brent crude averaged  54 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015   half of what it was in the same period last year  If the current price holds  the hit to Shell s pre tax earnings from the increased sensitivity alone could run to billions of dollars a year compared to what it would have been if the 2009 linkage between profits and oil prices had held steady  Filings from Europe s second and third largest oil groups  London based BP and Paris based Total  show a similar trend  In early 2013  London based BP said a  1 change in the oil price would lead to a  250 million change in annual pre tax replacement cost operating profit in its oil and gas production division  In March  the company said on its website that a  1 movement in Brent would change earnings by  300 million  Total said in 2013 that a  1 rise in Brent would lift adjusted net operating income by  140 million  Earlier this year  it said the impact would be  170 million   The increase in sensitivity is despite the fact that production levels   the main determinant of how much oil prices hit earnings   have fallen at all three companies  SLOW TURNAROUND Many oil companies missed out on much of the benefit of the oil price surge from 2004 to 2008  Instead governments grabbed most of the gains  in part due to the contracts the companies had signed years earlier  Historically  companies bought exploration licenses and agreed that  if they struck oil  they would pay governments a royalty   often a share of output   even if no profit was declared  During the 1990s  when oil prices were low and profit margins tight  companies signed an increasing number of Production Sharing Agreements  PSAs   which offered returns based on the cash they invested  That meant companies had a better chance of getting their money back  But the safety came at a cost   You re protected on the downside  but you lose some of the upside   said Neill Morton  oil analyst with Investec  Morton said the contracts became less popular with investors as oil prices soared in the mid 2000s  Shell was one of the first companies to make the shift to projects with greater oil price sensitivity  It increased investments in OECD countries  which do not typically offer PSAs  and  where it did sign PSAs  it sought to link the returns to prices rather than accept a fixed return on money invested  Others followed its lead   It was a general trend  Companies were keen to capture the upside from oil prices   said Tom Ellacott  at consultants Wood Mackenzie  In February 2008  Philippe Boisseau  president for Gas   Power at Total  told investors that his company was reducing the share of its production that came from production sharing contracts that only offered a fixed return   In July 2008  BP s then CFO Byron Grote told investors the group was accelerating its exploration program and looking for opportunities  especially in our key tax and royalty areas  that allow us to capture price upside   Total declined to comment on its current strategy in respect to oil price exposure  BP said the company didn t target a specific exposure but rather managed its portfolio over time to maximize returns and balanced investments between PSAs and tax and royalty regimes   BG Group  LONDON BG   which last week agreed a  70 billion takeover by Shell  said its oil price sensitivity increased simply because the historically gas focused company discovered a lot of oil  The world s largest oil company by market value   Exxon Mobil   N XOM  has seen no change in its sensitivity to oil prices in recent years  while  Chevron   NYSE CVX  does not publish figures  Both declined comment  Ellacott said that while the strategy of gaining more exposure to oil prices may hurt today  oil projects had a long life and most oil companies remain optimistic about long term oil prices  Shell is unapologetic about its decisions  CFO Henry said the world s growing energy needs would support crude prices in the years to come

193370,414886,CVX,Crude prices fall slightly  as strong CPI spurs dollar rally,news,"Investing com    Crude futures fell slightly on Tuesday  as strong consumer prices for the month of February halted the dollar s rapid depreciation against the euro 
During an extremely volatile month of March  analysts have viewed the strength of the dollar as one of the main indicators of the fluctuations in oil prices  In recent days  energy traders have used a weaker dollar to hedge their positions in crude oil

The U S  Department of Labor on Tuesday said its Consumer Price Index  CPI  rose 0 2  for February  one month after declining 0 1   The slight uptick last month ended a three month streak of declines  On a year over year basis the CPI remained unchanged from its February 2014 level  though analysts had forecasted it to slip by 0 1  from last year s figure 
Additionally  the Labor Department said gasoline prices for February rose 2 4   one month after the prices dove 18 7  in January  The increases last month ended a streak of seven straight months of declines  Shares in  Exxon Mobil  Corporation  NYSE XOM  and  Chevron  Corporation  NYSE CVX  were each down 0 75  for the day in U S  afternoon trading

193390,414906,CVX,Exxon Refinery Blast Sign Of Bigger Industry Woes,news,"By    
Exxon Mobil Corp  NYSE XOM   s refinery in Torrance  California  is raising new concerns about high risks  weak standards and lax regulatory oversight in the oil refining sector  
An explosion this week at an Exxon Mobil Corp  refinery near Los Angeles is the latest in a spate of blazes to strike U S  oil plants in the past few years  The refining sector is grappling with high risks  weak standards and lax regulatory oversight  labor and environmental groups claim  despite recent efforts by U S  and California officials to clamp down on safety concerns   There are inherent hazards in a refinery  but the idea is to keep the risks  of accidents  as low as possible  We don t think that s happening sufficiently in the industry   said Michael Wright  director of health  safety and environment for the United Steelworkers  The Pittsburgh based union is leading the weeks long refinery strike over safety and pay related disputes  The Feb  18 blast at Exxon s refinery in Torrance shattered a section of the facility  rained down ash and rattled nearby homes with earthquake like tremors  Four contract workers suffered minor injuries  The company said it is still investigating the cause of the accident  though initial reports suggest the problem might have started in an ultra hot cracking unit  which turns crude oil into gasoline   The safety and health of our employees  contractors and neighbors remain our top priority   Todd Spitler  an Exxon spokesman  said in an emailed statement   We are cooperating fully with the appropriate agencies to assess the impact and determine the cause of the incident  We learn from all incidents and will use information from this incident to reinforce our commitment to continued improvement   A full assessment of the Torrance explosion could be months away  But following separate refinery accidents  government reports suggested that fires  leaks and ruptures could have been avoided if regulators stepped in  Take  for instance  the August 2012 blast at Chevron Corp  NYSE CVX   s refinery in Richmond  California  which caused respiratory problems in more than 15 000 people  The U S  Chemical Safety Board  a federal advisory agency  found that before the accident  refinery workers had considered the plant s mechanical integrity programs to be deficient  At the same time  workers reported that they felt pressured to stay quiet if they saw unsafe acts  Then  on Aug  6  a pipe ruptured and released highly flammable fuel that quickly ignited  The chemical board charged that city and county regulators  did not require the Chevron Richmond Refinery to take quality  constructive steps to improve these areas   according to a report released last month   Had steps been taken before the incident   the pipe rupture might have been prevented   Regulatory weakness is cited across the industrial sector  including in the deadly 2013 fertilizer plant explosion in West  Texas  The Chemical Safety Board determined that lack of rules and oversight were partly to blame for the chemical blast that killed 14 people  wounded more than 200 others and destroyed or damaged hundreds of homes in West  Federal regulators could have prevented the accident by adopting stricter requirements on chemical handling and storage  according to the board s preliminary findings  America s nearly 150 oil refineries are overseen by both the U S  Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Labor  as well as their respective state level counterparts  By contrast  other hazardous industries like nuclear power and oil pipelines are regulated by a single  dedicated agency  This divided system appears to create huge gaps in oversight  A 2013 investigation by the San Francisco Chronicle found that the agencies have limited staffing and funding resources to regulate refineries  and they often lack staff with refinery expertise  As a result  federal regulators tend to step in only after accidents have occurred  rather than take preventive measures  Yet refineries like the one in Torrance are capable of causing far more destruction than seen in recent fires and blasts  About one third of America s 150 oil refineries use a highly volatile refining process that  in a worst case explosion  could harm or kill up to a million people  by EPA estimates   We ve just been skating along on good luck  in most cases   said Rick Hind  a legislative director at Greenpeace and an expert on toxics and chemical security issues   Everything about this should have been done yesterday   The oil industry insists refiners are working to diminish the dangers   The refining industry s top priority is always safety   Carlton Carroll  a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute  an industry group  said in an emailed statement   We are proud of our strong safety record  but even one incident is too many  That s why we update our standards and best practices on a continuous basis to improve our record and protect employees  the communities surrounding refining facilities and the environment   In the wake of the 2012 Chevron fire and the 2013 fertilizer plant disaster  federal and state officials are attempting to improve their regulatory oversight  The EPA is proposing to strengthen risk management requirements for refineries and chemical plants and could finalize new federal rules in 2016  California s Gov  Jerry Brown created a permanent interagency task force to improve worker and public safety at the state s 18 refineries  Officials are in the process of revamping  process safety management  codes and have proposed new rules to require the adoption of  safer processes and equipment to the greatest extent feasible   Labor leaders are simultaneously pushing for stronger worker safety standards as part of the ongoing collective bargaining negotiations with refinery operators  More than 5 000 workers at nearly a dozen plants are still on strike as United Steelworkers and Royal Dutch Shell PLC negotiate a pay and safety agreement  Wright  the safety director at United Steelworkers  said the union is pushing for limits on consecutive work hours to  make sure that workers in the industry aren t stressed out or bone tired   He said refinery operators routinely work over 80 hours a week  raising the risk of mistakes that can lead to tragedy  The union also wants to limit the amount of work that is passed off to contract workers  who might not have the same training or expertise as staff employees   We believe that improved safety measures can significantly reduce explosions and fires at these dangerous facilities   Gary Beevers  who heads the union s national oil bargaining program   said ",2015-02-20,International Business

193392,414908,CVX,Its red shirts fading  Venezuela s oil giant embraces pragmatism,news,"By Alexandra Ulmer and Marianna Parraga CARACAS HOUSTON  Reuters    A subtle change in office attire may be the most telling symbol of a quiet revolution taking place inside Venezuela s troubled economic engine  giant oil firm PDVSA  For years  PDVSA employees were encouraged to wear red shirts in support of late President Hugo Chavez s socialist movement  Rafael Ramirez  the former oil czar famously vowed the state owned firm would be  redder than red  and sent workers to state rallies  Over the past few months  however  the company s new management   led by president Eulogio del Pino  a low profile Stanford educated engineer   has eased up on revolutionary garb and attendance at militant gatherings  according to sources within and outside the company  New posters inside its Caracas headquarters request employees don normal office wear  visitors say  a telltale sign of what could be the most sweeping changes in over a decade at a firm that controls the world s largest crude reserves and generated some  78 billion in exports in 2013   96 percent of Venezuela s hard currency revenue   The sartorial shift symbolizes the new management s effort to regain focus at a firm that has become a haven for political friends and operatives  according to people familiar with the strategy  It marks a sharp pivot after a decade under the helm of Ramirez as shoring up the nation s main cash cow trumps ideology in the face of the collapse in global crude prices  The changes go well beyond the symbolic  PDVSA is granting its minority partners more financial and operational sway in joint ventures  according to sources close to the company  A dozen of those foreign oil companies are also poised to tap the most favorable exchange rate of Venezuela s complex three tiered currency system  Some of the firm s roughly 150 000 employees have been laid off  particularly those with overt political roles  and hundreds of oil ministry staffers have also been let go  according to a union leader and a source close to the government   They re trying to find mechanisms to give people confidence in investing  and also trying to increase production   said one foreigner close to joint ventures  To be sure  success is by no means guaranteed  given that oil prices have halved in the past year  currency controls complicate even the most basic operations and the nation is stuck in an economic crisis  Del Pino walks a tightrope between managing government involvement and ploughing on with his business plans  and some industry analysts fear his hands may ultimately be tied  PDVSA and the oil ministry did not respond to requests for comments about changes in the sector s management  OUT WITH THE OLD  The first sign that PDVSA might be in for a revamp came last September when Ramirez  a former confidant of Chavez  was demoted from his triple role as head of PDVSA and the Oil Ministry  and vice president for the economy  Asdrubal Chavez  the former president s cousin and oil industry veteran  took over the oil portfolio  but Ramirez remain the head of Venezuela s OPEC delegation until late December when President Nicolas Maduro sent him off to New York as U N  envoy  Away from the limelight  Del Pino  until September in charge of PDVSA s exploration and production  has been revamping joint ventures  and refineries  operations  sources say  Minority partners are to garner more control over their oil fields  including hiring rigs themselves instead of relying on a PDVSA service unit  possibly saving tens of millions of dollars  people familiar with the matter say   PDVSA holds 60 percent stakes in joint ventures  and minority partners have long complained of delays in dividend payouts as well as complicated operations  in part due to lack of dollars for imports  The company is now offering some partners an increase in ownership  which could attract more much needed capital  PDVSA holds majority stakes in joint ventures with energy majors including  Chevron   N CVX   Repsol  MC REP   Eni  MI ENI   Rosneft  MM ROSN    Total   PA TOTF   ONGC  NS ONGC    Statoil   OL STL   and China National Petroleum Co  CNPET UL   CNPC   The government says production has already risen in the heavy crude Orinoco region  where the joint ventures operate  and forecasts output to reach 1 37 million barrels per day  bpd  by the end of the year compared with 1 25 million in 2014  ARRESTS AND LAYOFFS The new management has also started trimming PDVSA s workforce  which  including contractors  tripled between 2001 and 2013 to nearly 157 000 even as Venezuela s crude production has fallen to 2 899 million bpd from around 3 1 million  according to annual company reports   There are more arrests and layoffs coming  That s what we hear in all the offices   said Ivan Freites  a leader of the oil workers  union and a government critic   For example  there had been layoffs of people technically employed at the massive Paraguana refinery  but who actually performed political duties  Freites said   Hundreds of employees close to Ramirez are also being shown the door at the Oil Ministry and the oil giant  according to a former ministry employee and other people familiar with the matter  The most striking case of what some call a witch hunt is the arrest of PDVSA s regional production boss Jose Luis Parada and his sister Gladys Nubia Parada  a senior oil ministry official  for alleged corruption in distribution of highly subsidized gasoline   The powerful siblings were close to Ramirez  according to company insiders   Some recent appointments at the company also suggest Del Pino does not enjoy full autonomy  New Chief Financial Officer Carlos Malpica is a relative of Cilia Flores  Maduro s wife and close adviser  while some former members of the military have been tapped for posts in the supply and trade departments  Some experts also warn that despite his best intentions Del Pino s mission is doomed as low oil export prices depress the revenues and Maduro will look to tap the oil giant s resources to spend on parliamentary election campaigns this year

193395,414911,CVX,It Is Time To Short Oil ,opinion,"WTI crude oil has surged 80  from a low of  26 19 in January  The rise was mainly fueled by one off events such as the wildfires in Canada and attacks on oil production sites in Nigeria  which led to production being reduced by 3 5 million barrels per day in May itself  and thereby allowing the oil glut to ease 
Whilst these temporary factors have faded away and oil production has bounced back in both countries  some analysts argue that the upward price trend for crude oil will continue  However  there are some very bearish signals emerging from the oil market to suggest a different outlook  While oil has pulled back from highs in recent trading sessions  this is only the beginning of a notable swing downwards 
Technical Indicators
At its 2016 peak of  51 23  the Stochastic RSI has reached 95 16  indicating heavily overbought conditions  Thus it is natural to expect some form of pullback in prices 
Short term technical analysis is already signalling an initiation of a downward trend  The chart below shows how the 5 day moving average is about to cross over the 10 day moving average from above  This bearish signal is also backed up by a similar trend reflected by the MACD crossing below the signal line  Both indicators are demonstrated in the chart 

The Average Directional Index  ADX   as shown in the chart below  further reflects the downward pressure on oil  The chart demonstrates that while crude oil prices were rallying over the past 2 months  the ADX  red line  and Positive Directional Index  blue line  barely picked up  In fact  the ADX is currently at 21 40  A reading below 25 indicates a weak trend  This manifests a very bearish sign for oil 

While certain technical indicators are still hinting at a downturn  the Stochastic Oscillator has already confirmed the declining trend for crude oil 

Nonetheless  it is certainly not too late to enter into short positions right now  WTI crude oil is still currently at  45 17  relatively close to its 2016 high of  51 23 
US Production Bounces Back
Over the past few weeks  the number of oil rigs back online has been soaring  After reaching a bottom of 316 rigs on May 27th  it has climbed back to 351 rigs as producers attempt to exploit the higher oil prices 
In fact  after delaying oil drilling projects last year  large oil companies have announced big investments recently as confidence in the oil market is gradually being restored  Chevron  NYSE CVX  proclaimed a  37 billion project and BP  LON BP  announced an  8 billion investment over the past month 
Due to the flexibility of the labor market and lower cost of equipment  e g  oil rigs   the US is an adaptable swing producer  Hence rising oil prices can easily attract producers back into the market in a short space of time  This increases supply and will potentially bring oil prices back down 
The EIA is forecasting that the US will produce 8 6 million barrels per day in 2016  However  a surprising increase in production from these swing producers due to the current level of oil prices may lead to more supply coming into the market  which may cause crude oil to fall well below the  46 price level forecasted by the EIA for September 2016 
As energy agencies such as the EIA are forced to lower their current bullish price targets due to higher than forecasted production  investors will inevitably have to re adjust their perspectives towards a more bearish outlook as well  which will pressure crude oil prices downwards 
Rising demand from India and China also drove the rally in oil prices in the first half of 2016  China in particular has been engaged in  strategic reserve buying   whereby in March and April  China was importing 7 7 million b d  However  Chinese reserves are now almost full after  overbuying  earlier in the year  As a result  demand growth from Asia is likely to slow in the second half  leading to greater downward pressure on oil 
Still  oil bulls argue that the US driving season  between June and September  will increase oil demand to further ease the oversupply glut  While it is true that demand will rise  the US has already produced 8 9 b p and 8 7 b p in April and May respectively in anticipation of the driving season  Current inventory levels are at adequate levels to satisfy the rising demand from the driving season  and there is no need to produce more oil at this point  It is therefore unlikely to provide a meaningful boost to oil prices 
The simultaneous rising US production and subdued demand growth outlook is likely to cap the oil rally  In fact  both technical and fundamental factors are indicating that crude oil will dip lower over the next few months  Traders should take advantage of the recent oil rally  as prices are currently still at attractive levels for taking short selling positions for the medium term ",2016-07-11,Sankalp Soni,https://www.investing.com/analysis/it-is-time-to-short-oil-200141084,200141084

193399,414915,CVX,Cheap Oil Slams Gas To Liquids Market,news,"By    

When oil prices topped  100 a barrel  energy companies were eager to turn cheap natural gas into liquid fuels such as diesel  A gas to liquids facility would cost billions to build  but as long as oil stayed expensive and shale gas production flourished  the economics promised to pan out  Now  with crude prices plunging past  50 a barrel  the fledgling sector is in limbo   All the current projects that are being contemplated rely on quite a wide spread between the crude oil price and the price of natural gas for their financial economics   Sandy Fielden  an analyst with energy consultancy RBN Energy LLC in Austin  Texas told International Business Times   If the price of liquids falls by over 50 percent in six months  as it has  then obviously you re squeezing the margin   The latest casualty of cheaper crude is an  11 billion natural gas to diesel facility on Louisiana s Gulf Coast  Sasol Ltd   a South African energy giant  said Wednesday it was shelving the Lake Charles project indefinitely due to the steep decline in oil prices   This will allow us to evaluate the possibility of phasing in the project in the most pragmatic and effective manner   David Constable  Sasol s chief executive  said in a statement  Sasol s announcement comes just weeks after Royal Dutch Shell PLC dropped plans for a similar facility in natural gas rich Qatar  The Anglo Dutch energy firm abandoned its own Louisiana gas to liquids project in 2013  citing  uncertainties on long term oil and gas prices and differentials   At  100 a barrel    the price of oil last summer    a massive gas to liquids facility would have decent prospects for economic growth  said Henan Xu  an energy analyst with Platt s Bentek Energy in Colorado  At those prices  a facility could generate a 19 percent internal rate of return  But at current oil prices  those returns are  incalculable   because the projects now have a negative  net present value   meaning they cost more money than they take in  Xu said  Technology to turn natural gas into a liquid fuel has existed since before World War II  but fuels weren t produced commercially until the early 1990s  PetroSA  South Africa s national oil company  built the world s first plant in 1992 as part of an effort by the apartheid government to protect its fuel stocks from international sanctions  Shell built its first facility in Bintulu  Malaysia  in 1993  and has a second  19 billion plant in Qatar  called Pearl GTL  which is the largest facility of its kind  according to the company  Sasol also has a plant in Qatar  while Chevron Corp  opened its Escravos GTL plant last fall in a Nigerian swamp after a decade of delays  About half a dozen other gas to liquids projects are still in the works  including two pilot sized plants in Houston and projects in Uzbekistan  Russia and offshore Brazil  While most of the facilities are smaller than the monster plants already in operation  Xu said their developers will likely still struggle to secure financing at the current oil price   No matter if it s big or small  when the oil prices are  50 a barrel  it doesn t make sense at all   she said  However  there is a bright spot in the gas to liquids segment  A handful of small companies are using the technology to reduce air pollution caused by shale oil production  In areas like North Dakota s Bakken shale  natural gas often rises up with crude oil  and about a quarter of it is simply burned off  or  flared   Primus Green Energy in Hillsborough  New Jersey  has developed a system to capture flare gas and covert it to gasoline and methanol  which is sold for use in cars and chemicals  George Boyajian  Primus  vice president of business development  said the business is actually growing despite low oil prices  in large part because state regulators and the Obama administration are cracking down on air and methane pollution from oil and gas operations  forcing drillers to clean up their acts  He said the company s 500 barrel a day system costs  significantly less  than  50 million  the industry s price estimate for a system of that size  though he didn t give specific numbers   We feel we re in the worst case scenario right now  and we re still break even   Boyajian said   When oil prices rebound  our projects will actually produce an attractive return   He said Primus is in talks with potential clients for two commercial scale facilities  and its demonstration plant in Hillsborough came online in 2013  Fielden  the energy consultant in Austin  said he doesn t believe low oil prices will be the end of massive gas to liquids projects like the one shelved by Sasol in Louisiana  Such facilities are built to run for 20 to 30 years and could give operators an advantage should oil prices spike or rise over time   It s really a bet on longer term price differences   he said   The only time they re going to be competitive is when the price of liquids and gas is out of whack

193406,414922,CVX,Italian Bank Instability Raises Further Concerns Over Eurozone Future,opinion,"Worries Return
Did you think you could put Brexit behind you  Well you can t  especially when there are more worries in other EU economies  The market again is worried about the Brexit fallout as talk of bad loans in Italian banks raise concerns about the stability of the entire Eurozone 
The Wall Street Journal reports that 17  of bank loans in Italy are  sour   That is nearly 10 times the level in the U S  where  even at the worst of the 2008 09 financial crisis  it was only 5   Among publicly traded banks in the Eurozone  Italian lenders account for nearly half of total bad loans according to the Journal  There was also a FT report about a  leaked letter  from the European Central Bank insisting that the Monte dei Paschi di Siena s bank cut its gross bad loan exposure   which amounted to 47billion euro at the end of last year   by 30 per cent by 2018  MPS was already planning to dispose of  3 5bn in the worst performing loans by then  The ECB letter implies a deeper cut may be needed 
The concerns about financial stability in the Eurozone is causing another risk off sell off in oil to start the day while gold and silver soar in a bid for safety  The British pound has fallen to 31 year low as the UK faces economic and political uncertainty  Oil  which has been on a solid path towards rebalancing because of lower U S  output and stronger than expected global demand  may detour if more European banking problems develop 
Crude oil prices may have found some resistance in the fact that the Baker Hughes Rig Count survey had its biggest jump all year  On Friday Baker Hughes reported that drillers increased oil rigs by 11 rigs but reduced natural gas rigs by 1 
Still we have ongoing concerns about Nigerian production  Reports that rebels attacked another pipeline is raising concerns that Nigerian production might fall again  The Voice of America reports that militant group  the Niger Delta Avengers  is calling for greater development in the oil producing south and has vowed to reduce Nigeria s oil production to zero unless its demands are met  The group claims it attacked five oil installations in the past three days  3 owned by the Nigerian state oil company and two facilities owned by Chevron  NYSE CVX  
That offset news that rival oil company factions in Libya may work together to get more oil flowing  The deal may raise Libyan oil output by 700 000 barrels  These concerns should keep oil from falling too far as long as we don t see a total meltdown in global markets 
We should also see another drop in U S  oil inventory as we will continue to see the delayed impact of the Canadian wild wires and record demand for gas in the US  The inventory report will be delayed but should show a 3 million barrel drop in crude supply and a 2 5 million barrel drop in gas and distillate supply  Refiners should up run by 0 5  
Natural gas pulled back as we saw a cool down in the Midwest and the pacific  Yet the heat will return so use the weakness to position for the next price spike  Oil trades will be in a range  Stability in stocks mean stability in oil  Despite the jump in rig counts U S  oil output will slow further  While the market sentiment is weak  long term we still have a structural low in oil ",2016-07-05,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-07-05-16-200139956,200139956

193413,414929,CVX,4 Oil Stocks That Are Back Near 52 Week Highs,opinion,Oil prices are currently on the rise following a wider than expected fall in domestic crude inventories that made way for a nice weekly gain  However  the commodity might end the week on a slightly bearish note  This is owing to news trickling in of OPEC production reaching a record high in June alongside a rebound in production in Canada and Nigeria However  an overall weekly gain is expected from production disruption in Norway and Venezuela  Also  the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  reported that U S  commercial crude oil inventories fell by 4 1 million barrels to 526 6 million for the week ended Jun 24  marking the sixth straight weekly decline  This was wider than analysts  forecast of a decrease of 2 4 million barrels The bullish case for oil was ably supported by Norwegian oil workers  strikes affecting output  Also  refiners and oil producers in Venezuela struggled to maintain production following equipment shortages and power interruptions In addition to the above  investors  hopes were rekindled on oil and the commodity after the surprise Brexit decision  Both West Texas Intermediate  WTI  and Brent crude surged over the past fortnight by 7 9  and 7 3   respectively The Road Ahead for CrudeThe current change in demand supply dynamics put energy players on investors  radar after waiting long for a lift in the fortunes of the space  So long  the sector was ravaged by falling realizations from upstream operations which dragged down the overall picture  Now  investors can only hope that the decline in the production level does not end up being a mirage  Looking forward  EIA also expects strong growth in global consumption of petroleum and other liquid fuels in 2016  Per the agency  daily demand is expected to rise by 1 5 million barrels in 2016 Thus we expect upstream stocks to perform well in a period of rising oil prices as investors chase stocks with leverage to oil plays Buy Stocks on the MoveToday  we have screened stocks that are presently trading near their 52 week highs and look ready to break out and chart new year long highs  Moreover  in this brave new era when investing fundamentals have become quaint back seat notions  our stocks boast impressive fundamental metrics and a solid Zacks Rank Granted   old school  investors may be wary of getting into such stocks  citing high valuation and limited upside  However  at times  a strong price uptrend implies robust demand for a stock  which is often backed by either good earnings

193417,414933,CVX,A Bullish Case For Oil With No Production Growth In Sight,opinion,"Oil prices topped off at  50 last week after the International Energy Association released its monthly oil outlook report  which consisted of an increased forecast in world oil demand  With output and inventories steadily falling  we could see a continued wave of rising oil prices 
The IEA expects a demand growth of 1 3 million barrels a day in 2017  as the United States experiences record high gasoline consumption  The global demand for refining is also approaching record highs   On the supply side  the United States  annual production is expected to drop in both 2016 and 2017  IEA projects the United States to produce 830 000 less barrels per day than 2015 at a production of 8 60 million barrels  In 2017  oil companies are expected to restart more rig sites with higher oil prices  However  overall production will continually fall off by an estimated 410 000 barrels  The IEA adjusted its OPEC production forecast from its previous report by a decrease of 80 000 barrels per day in 2016 and 50 000 barrels per day in 2017  On the global scale  IEA s 2015 oil production estimate dropped by 30 000 barrels per day 
The figures of excess oil supply are now revised to reflect the disparities of altered demand and supply forecasts  The 2015 excess supply forecast dropped by 30 000 barrels per day and 20 000 barrels per day in 2016  Investors should be optimistic with excess supply numbers falling dramatically year to year  2015 s revised figure of 1 93 million barrels will drop to 970 000 in 2016 and to 290 000 in 2017 
The IEA s report consists of only small differences from its previous report  The slight adjustments illustrate a positive trend for investors in the oil market  as forecasts continue to lessen the existing imbalance  The report has reinforced the power of the IEA s previous estimates which leaves us with greater confidence in the organization s optimistic outlook for oil 
Oil prices have risen due to increasingly stronger demand  the weakening U S  dollar  and supply cuts through disruptions in Canadian and Nigerian oil production combined with American oil producers electing to decrease output  We are experiencing a tremendous pullback in oil production which is rapidly eradicating the global surplus  To add  oil inventories have continued to falter over the past few months  clarifying the market s upward direction  Domestic crude oil inventories fell by 3 2 million barrels last week  surpassing the market s expectations of 2 7 million 
Tom Ward  founder of Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK      backs the claim for a bullish oil market   Until the capital markets open up and allow U S  oil companies to spend outside of their cash flow  production will not increase and crude prices will continue to rise   until we have something fairly dramatic happen like maybe a doubling of the rig count  I don t think we can grow production   The aforementioned oil forecasts and rapidly declining inventories coincide with Ward s logic for increased oil prices  A dramatic increase in oil production in the current climate is very unlikely 
On the other hand  seeing unusually striking drops in production is an anticipated possibility that may arise with heated political scenes and weak infrastructure in African oil producing countries and the Middle East  Nigeria is currently experiencing troubles with rebel organizations sabotaging its oil rig and pipeline sites  Weekly bombings and thefts are deteriorating the nation s supply of oil by over 500 000 barrels per day  Chevron  NYSE CVX     has been forced to cease large scale operations in western Africa following persistent warnings and attacks  which have led to the loss of millions of barrels per day  In Iraq  security concerns over the highly disputed Kurdistan region have recently interrupted the production of 600 000 barrels per day  Iraqi oil production plunged another 320 000 barrels per day dealing with threats from ISIS militants  Algerian oil producers have experienced massive losses in production in 2016 due to attacks by terrorist groups as well  Libya is now producing only 360 000 barrels per day following the destruction of its marine exporting hubs  This is miniscule production relative to Libya s conventional output of 1 6 million barrels per day  Libyan production will not see any major improvement as five of the nation s seven onshore loading terminals are no longer operational 
The weak infrastructure in the region is equally subtracting oil output  Just earlier this week  Royal Dutch Shell s    Trans Niger Pipeline was shut down due to a major leak and as a result  130 000 barrels per day of production will be lost indefinitely  To make things worse for producers  oftentimes militant groups launch attacks on pipelines while repairs are being performed to further drawback efforts to revive production  In addition to Chevron and Shell  LON RDSa   there is strong potential in seeing the exit of Conoco Phillips     Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM      Petrobas     and other big oil companies to avoid the backlash of infrastructural problems and terrorism  The oil market has been riding these disruptions to ascended price levels in the recent recovery and we can expect that to continue with overseas withdrawals 
Depleting supplies and a record demand of oil products are likely to act cohesively and systematically bring balance to the market  As we approach the market balance  oil prices should continue to rise  Some institutional investors are betting on oil prices recovering to its pre crash levels of  100 and higher  The potential growth may be astronomical once inventories have diminished ",2016-06-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-bullish-case-for-oil-with-no-production-growth-in-sight-200136214,200136214
193418,414934,CVX,Being In A Position To Profit,opinion,"So much of trading is learning to position yourself for profit  and to position yourself for profit means to protect your existing capital  
That means when you buy a stock  you have to look at the bigger picture   you can t go about it blindly without taking into consideration the market s overall direction 
The same goes for shorting too 
Let me explain 
Yesterday  I was long Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX   ProShares UltraPro S P500  NYSE UPRO  and Red Hat Inc  NYSE RHT    the latter two were profitable for me  The market was rallying most of the day  even with the FOMC Statement release  Then 3 30pm hit   which is usually the notorious time for buyers to ramp the market higher  Instead the market dropped hard and fast  As this was unfolding  I discovered the change in character for the market and how it was rejected at price resistance and the 20 day moving average at 2085 
I dumped all three positions  two of them for profit  Essentially I managed the risk on the trade and in doing so  I managed my capital too 
It set me up to be in a position today to profit from the market  as there was a 21 point dump at the open today  I bought near the lows  not at the lows  but near it as in  63 29 on UPRO  
Because I didn t force my will on the market and chose to position myself to profit from the market when the opportunity arose today  instead of being stopped out of three positions this morning  I came in 100  cash and put the capital to work when the time was right 
Now here is the other side of the coin  In my Splash Zone Chat room this morning  30 minutes after the market opened   I told people this morning that   It seems to me that we are getting a lot of shorts and scared buyers selling   could setup for a squeeze or a bounce later today if the market takes a notion  
That did end up being the case  not because I willed it or was prophetic  but because the market decided it to be so  and I was in position to profit as a result 
But the bigger issue was the emotional shorting that was taking place at the open  When the market is down five straight days  that is not the time to start loading up on short positions in fear of missing a bigger market correction  Instead  you should be positioning yourself for the dead cat bounce  Doing so is the only prudent thing to do here 
So much of trading and even life in general is about putting yourself in the right position for when opportunity comes knocking  If you hold onto old ways and old trades that clearly are not working  the trades you could have had will blow right past you ",2016-06-17,Ryan Mallory,https://www.investing.com/analysis/being-in-a-position-to-profit-200136494,200136494
193419,414935,CVX,Crude Oil  Damage Already Done,opinion,"Senseless
Brexit worries turned into sorrow after the senseless  sad and tragic killing of Jo Cox  a member of the British Parliament  It was grievous respite to the increasingly emotional and heated debate over whether or not the UK will leave the Euro Zone  Helen Joanne  Jo  Cox was a British Labor Party MP who was vocal in the  stay campaign  but was remembered not only as a rising political star but also as wife and mother  Her death caused a suspension of both campaigns for the  Vote Leave  and  Britain Stronger  groups and in a lugubrious way  may turn the tide of the UK to vote to stay 
After it was reported that Mrs  Cox had died  we saw a reversal in market sentiment  Gold prices  that were on a manic run surging above 1300 an ounce and a two year high  retreated and actually went lower on the day  The stock market came back from an oversold condition and a time to try to put things in perspective reigned 
For crude oil it seemed that it wasn t enough as there was a sense that for that market  the damage was already done  The fear surrounding the vote may have already caused enough anxiety in the market that is on a teeter totter between oversupply and undersupply  The path to market balance was underway  Demand was exceeding expectations and production was falling  Yet any economic hiccups would stop that path to supply deficit into oversupply  With disruptions from the Canadian wildfires over and a supposed promise by Nigerian rebel Niger Delta Avengers to talk to the government about ending the attacks on oil infrastructure 
Yet that mood may start to change  Risk going back on the market with a report that overnight the Nigerian oil militants known as the Niger Delta Avengers are now saying that they claimed to have blown up a pipeline belonging to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp  That would be their first attack since they expressed a willingness to engage in talks with the government according to Bloomberg  but the police said the explosion was an accident and the militants weren t involved 
On the production side there are signs that oil companies are still in retreat mode  Reuters is reporting that   oil majors Chevron Corp  NYSE CVX  and Royal Dutch Shell Plc  LON RDSa  are putting small refineries on the auction block as they look to trim lower margin assets in the face of headwinds from rising crude oil prices   They report that Chevron  the second largest U S  oil company  is soliciting interest in its Burnaby  British Columbia  refinery and gasoline stations  Shell is looking for buyers for its Martinez  California refinery  two people familiar with the situation told Reuters  Shell declined to comment 
In the long term the market should still be shuttering from the Wood Mackenzie report that oil and gas companies will spend 1 trillion dollars less on exportation and development of new supply over the next 5 years  That is a historic cut back that will have huge ramifictions on supply in the future 
Those cut backs are already starting to be felt in natural gas  The Energy Information Administration reports an above expectation but below the five year average  69 injection  That puts working gas in storage at 3 041 bcf  Even while stocks are 633 bcf higher than last year at this time and 704 bcf above the five year average of 2 337 bcf  A gap of over supply will tighten as exports and demand in the U S  are at record highs  Andy Weissman of WBW Analetics says that although the front month natural gas contract has paused for consolidation this week  warming weather forecasts are priming the market for a further move higher  He says that June 2016 is currently in the running to become the hottest June on record and initial July forecasts suggest more hot weather ahead  At the same time the most recent Pennsylvania natural gas production data suggests a 0 8 bcf d decline in April  the latest indication of rapidly falling supply  He points out that the NERC s Summer Reliability Assessment shows generally declining reserve margins across the country  driven by increasing load and falling capacity  This comes as many plants have lost the ability or will to switch back to coal from gas  It should be a hot market ",2016-06-19,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-200136747,200136747

Chevron is partnering with Norway s Statoil  NYSE STO  to explore three prospects off the lightly explored south east coast of the North Island 
Statoil is already in New Zealand and has been awarded a further offshore block in its own right at the top northwest coast of the North Island 
The Indian government controlled ONGC Videsh Ltd has made its first foray into New Zealand with one offshore exploration permit in the Taranaki Basin  in the same region as several commercially successful oil and gas fields 
 New players continue to enter our market  and existing players cement and expand their work here   Energy Minister Simon Bridges said in a statement 
The government has changed the rules for the tendering and awarding of exploration permits to encourage foreign companies to explore the southern oceans around the country 
The awarding of the permits  which are open for between 10 and 15 years  comes at a time when major oil companies such as BP  Shell  Exxon Mobil  and Total are cutting back on exploration  laying off staff and selling assets globally to cope with sliding oil prices 
The permit recipients have committed to various work programs ranging from geological and seismic surveys through to drilling exploration wells 
Six of the permits awarded were for onshore blocks  including two on the west coast of the South Island  while nine were for offshore blocks  Of the total  seven permits were for exploration in the Taranaki region 
Other isolated finds have been made in the east of the North Island and the top of the South Island  but have not proved to be economic 
Austrian oil major OMV  which already has interests in commercial fields in New Zealand  has extended its involvement with two offshore permits 
Other permits were awarded to established explorer and producer Canada s TAG Oil  a joint venture of local Todd Exploration and Australia s Beach Petroleum  New Zealand owned Petrochem Ltd and British owned Mosman Oil and Gas Ltd

Oil ends a 3 day rally  by Yann Quelenn 
WTI oil s low 2016 prices now seem like a distant memory  On February 11 one barrel of WTI Crude oil was worth  26 05  Since then  the rise has been continuous despite some bearish retracement such as at the end of March when it dropped from  41 90 to  35 24 two weeks later  As long as crude prices increased  volatility also declined and while it was common to see 10  change in a single day  this is no longer the case as selling pressures grow 
Although the price of a barrel is now above  50 we believe that fundamentals at this level are quite fragile  Oversupply continues and an agreement from OPEC members to stop is not yet on the table  At the OPEC meeting on June 2  production levels were maintained as members claimed that the market is in a  rebalancing process   Yet at  50 a barrel  shale gas production is profitable again  For the time being the wildfires in Alberta  Canada as well as the attack on American producer Chevron  NYSE CVX  in Nigeria are reducing the supply  The loss from these two independents is assessed to be between 800 000 and one million barrels per day  From our vantage point  the  50 mark is a key price for OPEC as it would keep its market share intact and we should not see it going higher within the next few weeks  We would instead target a retracement towards  45

EUR USD s very short term move is bearish  Hourly resistance can be found at 1 1416  09 06 2016 high   Yet  the road is wide open for a stronger retracement at 1 1132  03 06 2016 low   The technical structure suggests further downside moves  In the longer term  the technical structure favours a very long term bearish bias as resistance at 1 1714  24 08 2015 high  holds  The pair is trading in range since the start of 2015  Strong support is given at 1 0458  16 03 2015 low   However  the current technical structure since last December implies a gradual increase 
GBP USD is trading lower  Hourly resistance is given at 1 4660  07 06 2016 high  and stronger resistance is located at 1 4770  03 05 2016 high   Expected to show renewed bullish momentum toward resistance at 1 4770  A break of support at 1 4300  21 04 2016 low  is needed to confirm deeper selling pressures which nonetheless seem slight  The long term technical pattern is negative and favours a further decline towards key support at 1 3503  23 01 2009 low   as long as prices remain below the resistance at 1 5340 64  04 11 2015 low see also the 200 day moving average   However  the general oversold conditions and the recent pick up in buying interest pave the way for a rebound 
USD JPY s selling pressures continue despite slowing down  Hourly support can be found at 106 25  04 05 2016 low  while hourly resistance is given at 107 89  intraday high   The medium term momentum is clearly oriented downwards  Expected to further weaken  We favour a long term bearish bias  Support at 105 23  15 10 2014 low  is on target  A gradual rise towards the major resistance at 135 15  01 02 2002 high  seems now less likely  Another key support can be found at 105 23  15 10 2014 low

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

OPEC Meeting Concludes  Crude May Touch  40

According to a well known adage   Today s pain will bring tomorrow s gain   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC    the international cartel of oil producers   seeming has blind faith in this belief  We say this because yesterday s OPEC meet came up with the consensus that today s low oil price will lead to a jump in the price of the commodity in the long run 

Although crude is walking on the bullish path  it is still way below the mid 2014 level  In fact  one analyst predicts that crude might touch  40 per barrel in the short term before improving in the long run OPEC Outcome
	At the OPEC meeting last December  the group had decided to raise the ceiling of daily production from the prior level of 30 million barrels to 31 5 million barrels 
	But after the latest meeting at the Austrian capital of Vienna  OPEC decided not to return to the output cap  In other word  the cartel has decided against freezing the level of production 
	The statement reveals that OPEC wants the market itself to balance the crude prices  In fact  the group stated that oil price has recovered more than 80  since the last meeting in December and that a declining crude inventory points to the fact that the market is rebalancing on its own  Improving global crude demand is also helping the price of the commodity to improve 
	Following the improvement  upstream energy players   whose business is positively correlated with oil   also witnessed a rise on the market  Among the energy majors that improved with the crude recovery after massive fall include Halliburton Co      Schlumberger Ltd      Chevron Corp      PetroChina Co  Ltd     and Marathon Oil Corp      What Lies Ahead
	It is to be noted that there is a possibility of a short term downside in oil price following the return of Canadian oil after a massive wildfire along with chances of the Nigerian conflict getting solved  Moreover  OPEC players like Iraq and Iran will go on producing more oil as the cartel has recently decided against production freeze 
	Most importantly  Nico Pantelis   head of the research team of Secular Investor   has said that oil could fall to the  40 per barrel level 

But eventually  the market should lead crude on its northward journey as it happened this year when West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude improved to  49 17 per barrel from the 12 year low mark of  26 05 per barrel in mid February

193435,414951,CVX,Yellen Says Nothing,opinion,"DOW   113   17 920SPX   10   2109NAS   26   496810 Y    02   1 72 OIL    01   49 68GOLD   1 20   1245 70
The S P 500 closed at a 7 month high and is now just 21 points from the record high back in May of last year 
Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen delivered a speech today in Philadelphia  The event was the last insight into Fed thinking before a media blackout takes effect ahead of the June 14 15 monetary policy meeting  One week ago  the market betting was on a June or July interest rate hike from the Fed  then Friday  we saw the very  very weak non farm payrolls report from the Labor Department  The economy added just 38 000 jobs in May  the smallest gain since September 2010  So  what did Yellen say about the Fed s stance on rate hikes now 
Well  it depends on what you wanted to hear  Yellen said the jobs report was disappointing  but she warned against attaching too much significance to it on its own  Yellen said   Other timely indicators from the labor market have been more positive   Amid the  countervailing forces   she said   I see good reasons to expect that the positive forces supporting employment growth and higher inflation will continue to outweigh the negative ones  As a result  I expect the economic expansion to continue  with the labor market improving further and GDP growing moderately  
Yellen listed four main risks to the U S  economy   slower demand and productivity  and inflation and overseas risks   before downplaying them all  Yellen told the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia   If incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening and inflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective  as I expect  further gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate  
So  if you think Yellen should be dovish  what you heard is that the Fed might hike rates in September or December  If you are more hawkishly inclined  then you are probably looking at July or September  plus December  Right now  market pricing doesn t give the Fed more than a 50  chance of raising rates until the December 14  2016  meeting  A rate hike in June is priced at just a 2  chance  July is at just 27 5  
And if you think Yellen was intentionally vague and is growing weary of all this guessing  and she might just flex some muscle and hike rates next week  just to end all the speculation  then this quote probably caught your attention   Because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag  steps to withdraw this monetary accommodation ought to be initiated before the FOMC s goals are fully reached  
Stocks  the dollar and bond yields all moved lower in the immediate aftermath of the speech  then recovered as if nothing happened  Lurking in the bond market is a  1 trillion reason for the Federal Reserve to go slow on interest rate increases  That s how much  if Treasury yields rise unexpectedly by 1 percentage point  according to a Goldman Sachs Group estimate 
With only a few weeks to go until Britain holds its referendum  fresh polls have shown an increase in support among voters for the U K  to leave the European Union  swinging toward a Brexit  Results from an online poll by ICM showed those wishing to leave the EU at 48   and those wanting to remain in at 43   with 9  undecided 
The International Monetary Fund says Brexit would either be pretty bad or very bad  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warns that there would be dire consequences not just for Britain  but for the rest of the world  The Bank of England says output would go down and inflation would go up  Of course  the IMF  the OECD  and the BOE have the prognostication skills of a brick 
Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Secretary of State John Kerry are in Beijing for the eighth round of the U S  China Strategic and Economic Dialogue as tensions simmer over Beijing s land reclamation in the South China Sea  Chinese authorities are likely to complain about recent anti dumping steel tariffs and ask that the U S  recognize its country as a market economy  while American officials want China to adopt further financial liberalization  address industrial overcapacity and refrain from more yuan devaluations  Dinner will be served  nothing will change  and everybody will go home 
Saudi Arabia plans to more than triple the government s non oil revenues and clamp down on public sector salaries over the next five years  ministers announced reforms designed to reduce the economy s dependence on oil  The plan is part of a wider  long term reform drive known as Vision 2030  which was announced by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in April  He aims to overhaul many aspects of Saudi Arabia s economy and society as the kingdom prepares for a future of shrunken oil revenues and a rising population 
Today the government announced they will cut public wages and borrow billions of dollars  Last week Saudi Arabia s sovereign wealth fund announced a  3 5 billion investment in Uber  It s one of the biggest venture capital investments in history and brings Uber s overall fundraising haul to  11 billion  Those investments might allow Uber to expand its share of the global ride hailing market and make big profits for its investors 
But money spent on money losing price competition isn t investment  Price wars do nothing to increase the world s productive capacity  So the fact that so much money is being invested in Uber  and in other companies deliberately losing millions in an effort to gain market share  could be an ominous sign  It suggests that it s getting harder and harder to spend money in ways that boost long term economic growth 
More than 25 European and Asian owned supertankers are now shipping Iranian crude  allowing the Islamic Republic to ramp up exports much faster than expected following the lifting of sanctions in January  Tehran was struggling as recently as April to find partners to ship its oil  but after an agreement on a temporary insurance fix  more than a third of Iran s crude shipments are now being handled by foreign vessels  Iran shipped   the highest level since 2012  These figures are 15 percent higher than the International Energy Agency forecast 
The Supreme Court today declined to hear GlaxoSmithKline s bid to throw out lawsuits by union health and welfare funds that said the company s misrepresentation of heart related risks of its diabetes medication Avandia caused them to pay too much for the drug for insured patients 
The court left in place a 2015 ruling by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals against GlaxoSmithKline that allowed the class action lawsuits to proceed  The suits were filed by three labor union funds that provide medical coverage  including the cost of prescription medications  to union members and their families 
The lawsuits filed between 2007 and 2010 allege that GSK violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act  or RICO  by fraudulently concealing the risk of cardiovascular injury  GSK has since settled claims by 46 U S  states and thousands of users  without admitting any wrongdoing 
 to throw out a class action lawsuit involving claims that the company deceived California advertisers about the placement of Internet ads through its Adwords service  The court s decision not to hear the case leaves in place a September 2015 ruling by the San Francisco based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that the litigation could move forward as a class action representing advertisers who used the service between 2004 and 2008 
A federal district court judge in 2012 ruled that the case could not move forward as a class action in part because each advertiser would receive different damages  Each advertiser would have paid a different sum for the ads in question  the judge said  The appeals court reversed the district court  prompting Google to ask the Supreme Court to intervene  which they did not 
The Supremes also rejected Ecuador s challenge to a  96 million international arbitration award in favor of energy company Chevron  NYSE CVX  Chevron  The dispute stems from a 1973 deal that called for Texaco Petroleum  later acquired by Chevron  to develop oil fields in exchange for selling oil to Ecuador s government at below market rates 
Texaco filed several lawsuits in the 1990s accusing Ecuador of violating the contract  The case is not part of a separate legal battle brought by a group of Ecuadorean villagers who claim Texaco caused billions of dollars in pollution damage when it began exploring oil deposits in the 1960s

193441,414957,CVX,Going out on a limb  North Dakota oil titan scraps hedges,news,"By Ernest Scheyder
WILLISTON N D   Reuters    Harold Hamm  chief executive of Continental Resources Inc  N CLR   stunned a bearish crude market by scrapping all of the North Dakota energy producer s oil hedges  betting that prices will recover soon after sinking 25 percent in recent months 
With the move  Hamm  who last month called OPEC a  toothless tiger   appears to be heading into a price war with Saudi Arabia  the world s biggest oil exporter  without any protection from a prolonged downturn that some analysts say is looming 
Saudi Arabia and 14 other OPEC members have shown no sign yet of moving to cut production  a step that would lift prices 
The conventional wisdom is that the country  frustrated by a global supply glut caused by soaring United States output  is prepared to let prices fall to squeeze U S  shale oil producers out of the market 
But Hamm  striking a defiant tone  told investors Thursday the U S  shale boom won t end any time soon 
 We see OPEC worried about that and want to slow down what we re doing   he said 
Indeed  North Dakota considers OPEC its  chief competitor   Lynn Helms  head of the state s Department of Mineral Resources  said last month 
PREMATURE VICTORY
The sale of all its crude oil hedge positions from October through 2016 netted Continental a  433 million one time gain for the current quarter  With the move  Continental is effectively declaring a premature victory over OPEC 
The company did not consult with credit rating agencies before pulling contracts and board members are confident about the move  Hamm said 
 We believe the recent pullback in oil prices will ultimately prove to be beneficial to Continental   he said  adding he believes prices will rebound to at least  85 per barrel in the near term 
Since they traded at more than  115 a barrel in mid June  benchmark Brent crude futures have plunged to levels not seen since October 2010  closing near  83 a barrel on Wednesday 
Still  Hamm showed at least part of his hand  admitting he would return to hedging production if prices returned to  100 per barrel 
 That would be nice in the next few years   he said 
Many energy experts said that when prices began falling in June  companies should have been carrying more hedging contracts that locked in high prices and protected them from low ones 
 It s pretty unusual for a company to monetize all of its hedges  The fact that they re going basically unhedged on oil suggests that they re going to take on a bit more risk   said Leo Mariani  an analyst at RBC Capital Markets 
SHORT TERM FLUKE 
The rout in the price of oil has punished drillers like Continental  whose shares have plummeted more than 30 percent since June  Many analysts have forecast even lower crude prices 
Hedging protects commodity producers from sharp price drops  though it can also limit profits if prices soar  By exiting the hedges  Hamm is effectively betting that the steep drop in oil prices is a short term fluke that s bound to reverse course 
To be sure  going  naked  without hedges is not unprecedented  Majors such as Chevron Corp  N CVX  and Exxon Mobil Corp  N XOM  do little hedging on their own production 
And Continental did maintain its hedges on natural gas production  given the even higher volatility in prices for that commodity 
Philip K  Verleger  president of consultancy PKVerleger LLC and a one time adviser to President Jimmy Carter  said Continental s decision on oil hedging may concern investors 
 My expectation is that Continental s investors will rue this decision because it changes the firm s business   he said   Hedging provides an assured cash flow  By dropping the hedges the firm is gambling that prices go up  If they go down  Continental will go bust  
Shares of Continental were down more than 3 percent in afternoon trading on Thursday  a probable sign of Wall Street s displeasure with the move

Yet  in a bit of a strategic hedge  Hamm slashed Continental s 2015 capital spending budget by  600 million  saying he would not put more drilling rigs in the field while prices are low  Given that  Continental doesn t expect its production to jump as much as previously forecast next year 
The company now expects a 2015 capital budget of  4 6 billion  down from a previous estimate of  5 2 billion 
Continental  the largest producer in North Dakota s Bakken field  trimmed its estimate for output next year and now expects a 23 29 percent jump from 2014 levels  Hamm had previously forecast a 26 32 percent jump in 2015 
The company runs 22 drilling rigs in North Dakota  a number that will drop to 19 next year due to various factors  executives said 
Hamm  who founded the Oklahoma City based company in 1967  is in the midst of a bitter divorce battle with his wife Sue Ann 

Since Hamm owns about 68 percent of the company  the divorce settlement holds vast implications  During much of August and September  the CEO spent most days in court for his divorce trial  which may result in one of the largest divorce judgments in U S  history

193442,414958,CVX,Chevron says yet to finish Romanian shale gas assessment,news,"BUCHAREST  Reuters    U S  energy major Chevron  N CVX  has yet to complete an assessment of Romania s natural gas potential from shale  it said  one day after the country s prime minister expressed doubt about the existence of shale gas reserves there 
Prime Minister Victor Ponta  in the middle of a presidential campaign ahead of a Nov  16 runoff which he is expected to win  said on Sunday that Romania had  fought very hard for something that we do not have   He did not elaborate 
Like its emerging European Union peer Poland  Romania has opened the door to firms seeking to discover shale gas  hoping to mirror a boom in cheap energy seen in the United States 
 Chevron is analysing the data gathered during its drilling and seismic operations to further understand the resource potential of natural gas from shale   Chevron told Reuters 
 When the analysis has been completed  the results will be provided to the National Agency of Mineral Resources  NAMR  and will remain in the  Romanian  state s custody  
Romania is the third most energy independent EU member 
Earlier this year  Chevron said it finalised exploration works at a well in the eastern Romanian village of Pungesti  after repeatedly postponing operations because of protests from local residents 
Chevron also has rights for three licence blocks in Romania near the Black Sea  supporting a drive to find alternative gas resources which has become more urgent since the conflict broke out in Ukraine  through which Russia sends half of its gas exports to the EU 

The U S  Energy Information Administration has estimated Romania could potentially hold 51 trillion cubic feet of shale gas  which would cover domestic demand for more than a century

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

1  U S  oil major Exxon Mobil has been relieved of the tremendous pressure to implement climate change policies  after its shareholders narrowly voted the resolutions down 

The policies  which necessitated limiting greenhouse gas emissions  reducing global warming  putting a climate expert on the board  reporting on fracking activities and even climate change impact assessments  were rejected at Exxon Mobil s annual meeting 

Notably  this is first time in the company s history that the climate related proposals have received so much support  Initial results showed 38  support from Exxon Mobil investors that cast ballots  This is a sign that more conventional shareholders like pension funds  sovereign wealth funds and asset managers are beginning to take the threat of a global warming from fossil fuels more seriously   See More     

2  Suncor Energy announced that its operations  which were halted due to the massive Canadian wildfire  have resumed 

The leading integrated player in Canada has restored its activities at its base plant and the MacKay River sites in Alberta  The initial production at the facilities will likely be started by this weekend 

Almost 4 000 employees and contractors of the company have returned to the areas  In fact  an additional 3 500 people will likely return to the region to shore up operations  This announcement shows that the oil sands  producers of Canada are gradually coming back to operations following the outage caused by the latest wildfire 

3  Europe s largest energy firm  Royal Dutch Shell plc     has decided to reduce its headcount further  This time  the company will eliminate a minimum of 2 200 jobs this year  of which 475 workers are attached to exploration and production activities in the U K  and Ireland 

Following this announcement  Shell is on the verge of slashing 5 000 jobs in 2016  while the total for 2015 16 will stand at 12 500  Energy companies around the world continue to slash jobs  defer cancel projects worth billions of dollars and renegotiate contracts with suppliers to help protect their balance sheets and cope with  lower for longer oil  

The contentious takeover of BG Group and integration of its business also contributed to the decision   See More     

4  Offshore contract driller SeaDrill Ltd     reported weak first quarter 2016 results owing to underperformances by Jack up Rigs and Floaters  This was partially offset by decreasing operating expenses 

Net operating income for the Jack up Rigs segment plummeted from the first quarter 2015 figure of  325 million to  86 million  while for Floaters the net operating profit came in at  237 million  significantly below the prior year quarter figure of  376 million  SeaDrill incurred operating expenses of  568 million in the reported quarter  reflecting a significant decline from the year ago quarter figure of  731 million 

The company projects second quarter 2016 operating income of almost  510 million  which is less than the first quarter level of  528 million   See More     

5  British oil and gas finder BP plc    has commenced a major water injection project at its Thunder Horse platform  one of the biggest deepwater fields in the U S  Gulf of Mexico  GoM   Located in a water depth of 6 000 feet  the Thunder Horse platform commenced production in Jun 2008 

BP has revamped the platform s existing topsides and subsea equipment over the last three years alongside drilling two water injection wells at the site  Water is expected to be injected into the reservoir from these wells to enhance pressure and augment production  Moving ahead  these developments are anticipated to help the Thunder Horse facility recover an extra 65 million barrels of oil equivalent  Thus  the water injection project will extend the production life of the platform 

Out of the five major upstream projects in 2016 that BP expects to commission  the aforesaid project is the second  BP intends to add new production of about 800 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day worldwide from projects commissioned between 2015 and 2020

A Game Changer for Mexico 
One of the world s largest energy markets  Mexico recently opened up the country s oil and natural gas fields to investment by foreign companies  The historic move   aimed to counter falling output   will see private entities operate in Mexico s vast energy sector for the first time since 1938  when the industry was nationalized  Latin America s No  2 economy is hoping to mop up investments up to  44 billion through all phases of the auction by luring multinationals like Exxon Mobil and Chevron to explore oil and gas in the country 
In fact  the winners of oil blocks from the first three bidding phases are looking to drill their first wells as early as the fourth quarter  Mexico feels that that it is necessary to attract state of the art technologies and the financial muscle of overseas players to arrest falling output at the existing wells as well as develop promising deepwater reserves in the Gulf of Mexico ",2016-06-02,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/exxon-mobil,-chevron-apply-to-bid-for-mexican-oil-blocks-200133735",200133735
193451,414967,CVX,Total CEO de Margerie killed in Moscow as jet hits snow plow,news,"By Vladimir Soldatkin and James Regan  MOSCOW PARIS  Reuters    Christophe de Margerie  the charismatic and outspoken chief executive of the French oil company Total  PA TOTF   was killed when his private jet hit a snow plow as it was taking off from Moscow s Vnukovo airport on Monday night   His death leaves a void at the top of one of the world s biggest listed oil firms at a difficult time for the industry as oil prices fall and state backed competitors keep them out of some of the best oil exploration territory   De Margerie  63  was a strong opponent of Western economic sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine  and had been attending a meeting on foreign investment with around 30 other foreign executives at Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev s country residence in Gorki near Moscow   The crash occurred around midnight Moscow time as his Dassault Falcon was taking off for Paris in poor visibility  The plane s three crew were also killed  but television footage showed the snowplow driver seemingly unhurt   Total is France s second biggest listed company  with a market value of 102 billion euros   130 billion  that makes it the fourth largest Western oil company  behind Exxon  N XOM   Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  and Chevron  N CVX    In a brief news conference on Tuesday  Total s secretary general  Jean Jacques Guilbaud  said its governance committee and board would meet  as soon as possible     Total will keep going   he said   The group is organized to ensure the continuity of its governance    With his distinctive bushy mustache and outspoken manner  de Margerie was one of the most recognizable of oil executives and a personal friend of French President Francois Hollande   Prime Minister Manuel Valls said France had lost  an extraordinary business leader who turned Total into a world giant    Ben van Beurden  chief executive of Total s rival Royal Dutch Shell  said de Margerie had been  a larger than life character  a leader respected across the energy industry and a friend    De Margerie ran Total s exploration and production division before becoming CEO in 2007  but only took full control with the additional role of chairman in May 2010   Known inside the company as  The Big Mustache   he said in July that he should be judged on the new projects launched on his watch  including a string of African fields   He also said then that Total  which has not announced any official succession plan  would name a successor from within   POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS  Philippe Boisseau  head of Total s renewable energy division  and Patrick Pouyanne  who was charged with reducing exposure to unprofitable European refining sectors  have long been seen as potential successors   By 9 20 a m  EDT  Total s share was up 2 6 percent at 44 05 euros  broadly in line with other European majors such as Shell and BP  L BP    Barclays France director Franklin Pichard said de Margerie s death  shouldn t trigger insurmountable management difficulties    Ion Marc Valahu  fund manager at Swiss investment firm Clairinvest  agreed   I think the Total management is pretty strong   he said   The board has been there for a long time    De Margerie was a staunch defender of Russia and its energy policies  as the conflict in Ukraine has raised tensions with the West to levels not seen since the Cold War  and triggered economic sanctions against Moscow   Total is one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia  where its output is due to double by 2020   De Margerie told Reuters in July that Europe should stop thinking about cutting its dependence on Russian gas and focus instead on making those deliveries safer   He said tensions between the West and Russia were pushing Moscow closer to China  as illustrated by a  400 billion deal to supply Beijing with gas that was clinched in May    Are we going to build a new Berlin Wall   he said   Russia is a partner and we shouldn t waste time protecting ourselves from a neighbor     What we are looking to do is not to be too dependent on any country  no matter which  Not from Russia  which has saved us on numerous occasions    Russian President Vladimir Putin sent condolences  praising de Margerie s commitment to Russian French relations Total said last month that sanctions would not stop it working on the Yamal project  a  27 billion joint venture to tap vast natural gas reserves in northwest Siberia that aims to double Russia s stake in the fast growing market for liquefied natural gas  De Margerie said then that Europe could not live without Russian gas  and that there was no reason to do so   Russia accounted for about 9 percent of Total s oil and gas output in 2013  The firm said in April that Russia would become its biggest source of oil and gas by 2020 due to Yamal  and its partnership with the Russian energy company Novatek  MM NVTK    De Margerie also worked to ensure that Total would be in pole position to return to Iran if Western economic sanctions there were lifted   However  Total s dealings with Iran and Iraq in the 1990s dogged de Margerie s tenure  Last year  the firm agreed to pay  398 million to settle U S  criminal and civil allegations that it had paid bribes to win oil and gas contracts in Iran   Separately  Total  de Margerie himself and 17 other executives were tried in France last year for corruption linked to the U N  oil for food program in Iraq  in which  1 8 billion flowed illicitly to Saddam Hussein s government  but all were cleared   Like other big oil companies  Total has been under pressure from shareholders to cut costs and raise dividends as rising costs and weaker oil prices have squeezed profitability   After struggling with production outages in Libya  Kazakhstan and Nigeria  it cut its oil output targets and said last month that it would step up asset sales   It also said it would overhaul its approach to exploration after a  high risk  high reward  drilling strategy  launched two years ago and generally welcomed by industry experts  failed to discover any large deposits   Russia s Investigative Committee said it had opened a criminal investigation into the crash   It said the driver had been found to be drunk  but that investigators were also examining the actions of the air traffic controllers and the flight crew  The driver s lawyer said the driver had been following instructions from air traffic control  and that his relatives had said he never drank alcohol   The airport  which is used by Putin and other government officials  said visibility had been down to 350 meters  1 150 feet  at the time of the crash   Russia s air safety record is patchy at best

193455,414971,CVX,Oil Hits  50 A Barrel  Will It Last  ,opinion,"In what could be an important milestone for the world energy markets  oil prices have crossed over the  50 per barrel threshold for the first time in over seven months  Fueled by lower than expected stockpiles and global supply outages  the recent jump in oil is providing much needed relief for an industry that has been wreaked by low prices 
U S  and Brent crude prices moved past the  50 point on Thursday  primarily in response to a report that showed U S  crude stockpiles were down more than anticipated  Furthermore  armed militants have slowed production in Nigeria  an electricity shortage has slowed production in Venezuela  and wildfires have taken a toll on production in Canada 
While  50 a barrel seems like a saving grace  especially when one considers that we were seeing  26 barrels as recently as February  it s a far cry from the  100 levels that were seen just a few years ago  The recent oil glut has put a serious damper on the economies of oil dependent nations like Saudi Arabia  as well as producers like Chevron   NYSE CVX   and BP   NYSE BP   
Of course  one should never underestimate the power of a psychological barrier  Perhaps reaching the  50 price point will inspire the oil market to push further  which could definitely be true if U S  production remains lower 
Interestingly enough  lower U S  production is exactly what Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries wanted when they decided to continue boosting production volume in the face of falling prices  Although it hurt OPEC in the near term  if U S  production stays down  OPEC members can regain valuable market share 
Unfortunately  some signs indicate that the  50 price may not stay for long  as much of the loss in production has come from temporary sources  The aforementioned political crises in Venezuela and Nigeria have made an impact  and pipeline explosions in Iraq and Colombia took oil out of the market in the first quarter 
Oil investors will now look to next week s OPEC meeting in Vienna  Tensions between member nations are extremely high  and the group is not expected to reach a new deal to lower or even freeze production ",2016-05-26,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-hits-$50-a-barrel,-will-it-last-200132493",200132493

193464,414980,CVX,Why You Should Be Paying Attention To Energy ETFs,opinion,"Everyone hated energy ETFs last year as plunging oil and natural gas prices eroded valuations of companies engaged in this sector  The weakening demand for global commodities wrought havoc among large oil producers  exploration companies  and even storage conglomerates 
Fast forward to 2016  and the narrative has turned from one of relative weakness to an important mainstay of broad market momentum  The Energy Select Sector SPDR  XLE  NYSE XLE   has ripped more than 20  from its lows and is now the second strongest sector on a year to date basis behind utility stocks 
XLE tracks 40 large cap oil and gas stocks that include recognizable mega companies Exxon Mobil Corp  NYSE XOM  and Chevron Corp  NYSE CVX   This ETF has  14 billion in total assets and charges an expense ratio of 0 14  
As you can see on the chart below  XLE has been consistently trending above its 50 day moving average  smooth blue line  since mid February  The solid strength behind this move has been driven by a resurgence in crude oil prices alongside a concomitant weakening of the U S  dollar  Both factors are supportive of the fundamental story behind oil stocks 

Furthermore  XLE has proven to be an important counter trend component of the more recent consolidation here in May  While many beloved areas of the market have stalled due to valuation concerns  energy stocks have continued to work under the radar  This is a significant change in character compared to the outsized volatility and  sell at any cost  mentality that this sector traded through last year 
Of course  moving forward  the story for energy ETFs is going to be driven heavily by their correlation with oil prices  The chart below shows just how correlated XLE has been with the United States Oil Fund  NYSE USO  over the last six months  A consolidation or weakening of the commodities trend may ultimately reign in the hard won momentum that these stocks have created 

The halo effect of energy stocks can be felt throughout many other areas of your portfolio as well  For example  dividend focused indexes are often loaded with energy companies  The iShares Core High Dividend  NYSE HDV  has 21  of its portfolio in the energy sector  Similarly  the master limited partnerships that make up the ALPS Alerian MLP  NYSE AMLP  will be  
This also extends to value centric indexes such as the iShares Russell 1000 Value  NYSE IWD   This ETF counts the energy sector as its second largest component with 13 51  of the total portfolio and XOM as its largest holding 
The Bottom Line
You can count on those who have direct exposure to energy stocks or energy ETFs to keep a close eye on this story  However  in my opinion  this sector represents a very key component of the  and will be a fundamental driver of where we end the year  That means it represents a more comprehensive catalyst for broad indexes and other related industry components

193468,414984,CVX,Nigerian Transparency Group Struggles To Rein In Oil Corruption,news,"By    Attempts to rein in corruption in Nigeria s oil sector are reportedly falling short  The head of a government run transparency initiative says officials have largely ignored his fact finding reports and made it difficult for his organization to effectively police Africa s biggest oil industry  Bloomberg News reported on Friday 
 Those who are benefiting from this forgery called Nigeria will like to keep it at all costs   Ledum Mitee  a lawyer and former activist  told the news agency from Abuja  the capital   All these people pilfering from the country are in bed together  
A spokesman for President Goodluck Jonathan did not return Bloomberg s repeated requests for comments  the news agency said 
Oil and gas exports account for close to 80 percent of government revenue in Nigeria  Allegations of missing oil funds date back to the 1970s  during the infancy of the state owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation  NPPC   In the 1990s  an official investigation found that  12 billion in oil revenue was unaccounted for under the government of military ruler Ibrahim Babandgida  Bloomberg noted 
Nigeria set up its Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative  NEITI  in 2004 after the government agreed to comply with international standards that require oil and mining companies and governments to publish all payments  Seven years ago  Nigeria passed a law that allows NEITI to collect and analyze payment data from all energy companies operating in the country  including Royal Dutch Shell PLC  NYSE RDS A   Exxon Mobil Corp  NYSE XOM  Chevron Corp  NYSE CVX  and Italy s Eni SpA BIT ENI 

Shell said this week it was selling its Nigerian assets    worth up to  5 2 billion    over concerns of theft and corruption in the Niger Delta region  Last February  the oil giant said it was forced to shut down one of its pipelines after thieves drilled holes through it  Eni and the French company Total SA NYSE TOT are also selling some of their shares in Nigerian oil infrastructure assets 
NEITI has audited oil and gas industry payments made from 1999 to 2011 and is now examining 2012 to 2013 oil industry payments and revenue  Mitee told Bloomberg  The latest audit report  which looked at 2009 to 2011  found that at least  23 2 billion of oil income wasn t deposited into the national accounts operated by the central bank and NNPC at JP Morgan Chase   Co  in New York  Bloomberg noted 
Mitee complained that his organization is only equipped to review old files for hints of past corruption  He said that NEITI should be allowed to monitor the oil industry in real time  including by installing meters at pipeline wellheads  which would indicate whether and where crude oil went missing on its way to the export terminal 
The chairman added that Nigerian lawmakers should advance a proposed Petroleum Industry Bill  which has been stuck in parliament for six years due to political wrangling with global oil companies over proposed tax and royalty terms  Bloomberg said  The measure would also help clear up NNPC s confusing role as industry regulator and national oil company  Mitee told the news agency ",2014-08-29,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/nigerian-transparency-group-struggles-to-rein-in-oil-corruption-306501,306501

Chevron  which acquired the subsidiary from PG E Energy Services in 2000  said the group had developed hundreds of renewable and energy efficiency projects that were  reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 3 million metric tons   Bloomberg noted 
In an email to International Business Times  Gareth Johnstone  a Chevron spokesman  confirmed that the company  has not exited or abandoned renewables    The sale of its subsidiary is  part of an internal strategic focus on supporting Chevron s upstream and downstream businesses   Johnstone said Chevron continues to operate  a portfolio of renewables  including wind  geothermal and solar  in the United States and internationally  which is listed on its website 
Earlier this year  Chevron sold its 48 person business unit that develops renewable power plants and energy savings projects for U S  federal agencies  The oil giant also pulled back funding for biofuel projects last year 
Royal Dutch Shell PLC  NYSE RDS A  and BP PLC NYSE BP have similarly scaled back investments in renewable biofuels  including cellulosic ethanol produced from woody plants and waste  The two companies stopped funding four projects last year because they said the technology will not be economically viable until 2020 or later  Environmental Leader reported at the time  That brought overall biofuel investments from a high of  7 6 billion in the last quarter of 2007 to a low of  57 million for the first quarter of 2013 

BP also divested its U S  wind farm division last year as the company narrowed its focus to high yield oil and gas projects  The British oil major dumped its solar business in 2011 after four decades in the game  saying the unit had become unprofitable  Shell suspended its wind  solar and hydrogen projects in 2009

193472,414988,CVX,Chevron Cuts Thailand Headcount By 800 Amid Low Oil Prices,opinion,"Chevron Corporation   NYSE CVX    one of the largest integrated energy companies in the world  announced that it is planning to reduce its workforce by 800 in the Thailand region amid low oil prices  The company intends to make savings of  500 million in costs so as to continue its operations in Thailand  This is in sync with the company s late last year s announcement of a significant headcount reduction plan at its upstream business 
The job cut  which is expected to be effective from Aug 1  is in addition to the layoff of around 100 employees earlier this year  In Thailand  Chevron has around 2 200 staff and 1 700 contractors  and caters to about half of the country s natural gas demand 
Persistent low oil price for a length of time is primarily behind this massive layoff  This is because the upstream and the integrated energy players are not being able to sell crude at attractive prices and are hence not generating significant cash flows for their shareholders  Hence  Chevron  like its peers  is trying to generate more profits by cutting its operating expenses 
Notably  Chevron is in discussions with the Thai government to extend concessions for several oil and gas license blocks which it operates in the Gulf of Thailand beyond the 2022 expiration date  Chevron expects the government to take a decision by early 2017 
San Ramon  CA based Chevron has an impressive business model  Its current oil and gas development project pipeline is among the best in the industry  boasting large  multi year projects  However  the oil price slump has affected the group s earnings and cash flows  particularly at its upstream unit 
Despite slashing costs worldwide  Chevron reported its biggest quarterly loss in 15 years in the first quarter of 2016  The company reported loss per share of 39 cents  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 18 cents  In the year ago quarter  Chevron had earned  1 37 per share 
As a result  the company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   implying that the stock will perform in line with the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months

193473,414989,CVX,Will Supply Disruptions Actually Dent The Global Oil Glut ,opinion,"The big question this week is whether supply disruptions will make a dent in the oil market s ever present global supply glut 
The answers in a nutshell  disruptions in Nigeria  Canada  and Libya are likely transient  whereas Venezuelan production poses a long term problem  U S  production will continue its slow decline  even if oil prices reach  50  On the other side  Iranian production will continue to increase slowly and Saudi Arabia will increase production rapidly  As for where the price of oil is headed   your guess is as good as mine 
Nigeria
The  generally produces about 2 5 mbpd  making it Africa s largest oil producer  However  recent acts of terrorism and sabotage have cut this number to   Both Shell  NYSE RDSa  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  have suspended oil production in areas affected by this activity 
 targeting Nigeria s oil production are not a new phenomenon  In fact  Nigeria s previous president  Jonathan Goodluck  pioneered a program in 2009 that provided former oil terrorists in the Niger Delta region with monthly stipends to keep them from attacking oil facilities  This seemed to keep a lid on violence in the region  Nigeria s new president  Muhammadu Buhair  recently reduced the program s funding by 70  and would like to cancel it entirely within two years  
  who perpetrated the most recent attack on an offshore oil platform  claim to be fighting for independence for the Niger Delta and also demand a larger share of oil profits  If Nigeria can clamp down on this latest wave of attacks   in a recent series of arrests  and placate the militant separatists  then the country should be able to recover production in the short term  The fact that the issues are political rather than structural suggests that oil investment and production should not suffer for long 
In fact  Exxon  NYSE XOM   plans to ramp up Nigeria crude production this week 
 Canada
Wildfires in the Alberta tar sands region caused about a 1 mbpd drop in Canadian oil production over the past two weeks  The EIA expects some delays and outages   but the EIA does expect production to recover by the fall  However  other sources say that Canadian production will recover much sooner    This is  to doubt the usefulness of the recent Goldman Sachs forecast  which cites supply disruptions in Canada as a significant factor in resolving the global oil glut 
 Libya
Production from Libya should be at about 1 5 mbpd  but attacks from Islamic militants and violent factional fighting throughout the country have caused significant disruptions  on the scale of 75   to that supply  In particular  a political rift has grown and caused a short term UN embargo when a faction in eastern Libya tried to illegally export oil outside of the   The UN blockaded oil from the eastern group s port  resulting in additional supply disruptions over the past two weeks  However  the blockade has since been partially lifted and the two factions appear to be  a compromise  Only 150 000 bpd remain embargoed   This is a miniscule amount  compared to the nearly 100 million bpd consumed globally     once the remaining ports are reopened  Libyan production could immediately grow by 700 000 bpd 
Venezuela
In 2015  Venezuela produced about 2 78 mbpd of oil  The country s economic woes  including significant outages in electricity production  Venezuela largely relies on hydroelectric for domestic power  not oil   by at least 188 000 bpd  The dire economic situation in Venezuela promises to exacerbate and prolong their production failures  There is no guessing how low Venezuela s production levels may get in the coming months due to extreme austerity and economic and political upheaval 
Of all the supply disruptions addressed here  Venezuela s will have the most significant impact on the market  because the problems facing its oil production are structural and have been brewing for many years  Other than securing a temporary bandage via an  oil for loans  deal with China for about  50 billion  the Maduro government does not seem to have any plans to alleviate the situation  Right now  estimates indicate Venezuela would need sustained prices of  80 per barrel just to get production back up to 2015 levels  Until Venezuela improves its production capacity  it cannot bring in the revenue it needs  and Venezuela cannot improve its production capacity until it brings in more revenue 
Iran
Iranian oil production appears to be up at 4 mbpd  but  have stymied the release of new terms for its foreign oil contracts  Since the New Year  Iran has increased its oil delivery contracts  signing new ones with   NYSE E     NYSE TOT  and   Iran hopes these contracts will lead to investment in Iran s aging oil industry  As of yet  only the  have been willing to return to Iranian oil development at pre sanction oil contract terms  However  the latest news is that Iran will have its foreign  ready in June   or perhaps July 
Saudi Arabia
Despite recent changes in the Saudi oil ministry  there are few questions about the world s largest oil producer s intentions   in Saudi Arabia is set to rise  Production in Saudi Arabia generally grows during the summer months to accommodate increased domestic electricity demands  but this planned expansion is more long lasting  Citing growing demand from India and   Aramco is planning to bring  online from its Shaybah field shortly and from its Khurais field in 2018  Shaybah alone will bring an additional 1 mbpd to the market 
United States
American oil production continues to slowly decline as additional shale oil companies file for bankruptcy    about 69 oil and gas producers in North America have filed for bankruptcy protection  Despite the recent rise in the price of oil  the financial troubles continue  Fourteen oil companies have filed for bankruptcy since April  some with debt in the billions of dollars  Even with oil prices edging towards  50  a price which may not be sustained   more firms are likely to file  leading to further decreases in production and the continued slow process of consolidation ",2016-05-17,"Ellen R.

193477,414993,CVX,Britain  New Zealand Luring Oil And Gas Drillers,news,"By    Big oil and gas companies are shifting their focus to wealthier countries after decades of exploring and producing in developing nations  lured by political stability and more predictable returns  At least two governments   Britain and New Zealand   are aiming to capitalize on the switch 
On Monday  the U K  opened up more than half of Britain to hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  in an effort to entice energy companies to explore the region s shale reserves  The Department for Energy and Climate Change said it will invite firms to bid for onshore oil and gas licenses for the first time in six years  according to media reports  The drilling zone will encompass 37 000 square miles of untouched parcels and stretch from central Scotland to the south coast 
Michael Fallon  the former UK energy minister  has previously called shale oil and gas as  an exciting prospect  which could bring growth  jobs and energy security   the Telegraph noted 
In New Zealand  energy officials are pushing a  Petroleum Action Plan  meant to lure oil companies to its millions of unexplored offshore acres  The government also hired an executive from oil and gas rich Oklahoma to sway prospectors  the Wall Street Journal said in a Sunday story 
Developments in the two countries underscore oil companies  rising interest in investing in safer and stabler nations  In recent years  violence  tension with governments and power struggles with state owned oil companies have weakened the allure of less developed nations in North Africa and Central Asia  where lax regulations and cheap labor costs once promised hefty profits for oil companies  the WSJ noted 
In 2013  the biggest global oil firms   Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM   Royal Dutch Shell  AMS RDSa  and Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX    spent about two thirds of their exploration and production budgets in OECD countries  up from 49 percent in 2003  estimated Sanford C  Bernstein Ltd   a U S  financial research company  the WSJ reported  Some of the spending reflects the North American shale gas boom  where fracking and horizontal drilling technologies are producing record amounts of fossil fuels  U S  production could climb even higher if President Obama opens the Atlantic seaboard to offshore exploration and drilling 
Norway s Statoil ASA  OSLO STL  is exploring in New Zealand for the first time because the company likes the  very attractive commercial regime   and the very stable political regime   Pal Haremo  Statoil s senior vice president of exploration  told the WSJ  The oil firm pulled out of an Iraq project in 2012 

The push in Norway  Britain and other oil rich developed nations like the United States is meeting staunch resistance from environmental groups and landowner advocates  who worry that ramping up oil and gas drilling will exacerbate global warming  increase air and water pollution  and invade citizens  private property rights 
Louise Hutchins  a U K  energy campaigner for the advocacy group Greenpeace  said the government s Monday announcement could mean millions of homeowners will be stripped of their right to stop companies from drilling under their property  the Guardian reported  Now communities will face a fracking  lottery   she said 
Thousands of protestors in New Zealand have taken to picketing the country s beaches to protest deep sea oil drilling  The group leading the pickets  Banners on the Beach  has argued that offshore drilling is too risky  a spill would destroy natural habitats and blanket New Zealand s shores with toxic oil 
Still  the payoffs may prove too promising for governments to pass up  Energy companies spent about  1 27 billion exploring New Zealand in 2012  up from  346 million a decade ago  the WSJ noted ",2014-07-28,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/britain,-new-zealand-luring-oil-and-gas-drillers-298496",298496

Although the company posted a significant loss in the quarter  it beat the adjusted earnings per share expectations by  0 09  45    Quarterly revenue fell 28  year over year to  23 553 million but was slightly higher than Street forecasts of  23 547 million  Chevron beat adjusted earnings per share estimates in six of its last nine quarters  as shown in the table below 

Data  Yahoo Finance
In the report  Chairman and CEO John Watson  said 

 First quarter results declined from a year ago  Our Upstream business was impacted by a more than 35 percent decline in crude oil prices  Our Downstream operations continued to perform well  although overall industry conditions and margins this quarter were weaker than a year ago  

To emphasize the dramatic change in Chevron s earnings due to the crash in oil prices  I put together  in the charts below  the upstream and the downstream earnings in the U S  and international in the last five quarters 
Total upstream earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were negative at   850 million in the U S  and   609 million international  In contrast to upstream operations profitability that is directly correlated to oil prices  downstream operations are benefiting from the high refining margins  even though lower in the last quarter and strong demand for refined products  Total downstream earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were at  247 million in the U S  and  488 million international 

Source  Company s reports
Crude Oil Market
Oil prices have shown a significant rebound in the last three and half months  which makes me think that the worst for oil prices is over 
As such  we can expect much better results for Chevron s upstream operations in the forward quarters  Brent crude oil last price of  45 37 per barrel is already up 47 1  from its 12 year low on January 20  of  30 84  while WTI crude oil last price of  44 66 per barrel is up 40 6  from its January 20 low of  31 77 
Last week the oil markets experienced major unexpected supply disruptions  The largest disruption came from Canada  where forest fires have torched large swathes of boreal forest near major oil sands operations 
Also last week  Nigerian militants attacked a platform operated by Chevron in the Niger Delta  The facility is currently shut in and according to Chevron  they are assessing the situation and have deployed resources to respond to a resulting spill 
According to   the collapse of the rig count and depressed drilling activity has already knocked about 700 000 barrels per day of oil production offline  However  the rig count could bottom out this year and begin climbing again  Nevertheless  the U S  Department of Energy  EIA  does not expect oil production to rise in the short run even if the rig count rebounds 
Oil production is expected to continue to fall through 2017 as too few new wells come online to replace rapidly falling shale output  Total U S  oil production is expected to decline from 9 43 million barrel per day in 2015 to 8 04 million barrel per day in 2017  a figure that includes rising output from the Gulf of Mexico 
According to   the sharp decline in oil prices since the fourth quarter of 2014 has had a significant effect on drilling in the United States  The number of active onshore drilling rigs in the Lower 48 states fell 78   from 1 876 to 412  between the weeks ending on October 31  2014  and April 15  2016  according to data from Baker Hughes  BHI   The decline in active rigs and well completions is projected to result in month over month onshore oil production declines of 120 000 barrel per day through September 2016 
All in all  market fundamentals continue to suggest that the combination of robust demand and weak supply growth will move global oil markets closer into balance by the end of the year 
Dividend
In its last quarter presentation  Chevron reiterated its priority to maintain and grow its dividend 

Source  2016 1Q Earnings Conference Call Presentation
While waiting for a significant rebound in the price of oil  investors can enjoy the generous dividend currently yielding 4 20  a year 
The company has been paying dividends since 1970  and it has a long record of 27 years of continued raising its dividend The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was at 6 8   over the past five years was at 8 5   and over the last ten years was at 9 4   Even during the global economic crisis of the years 2008 2009  the company continued to raise its dividend  As such  it is hard to believe that Chevron would break that many years tradition 
The inability of the company to generate positive free cash flow in the last few quarters could be a matter of concern to investors In the chart below  I have put together the total cash flow from operating activities  the capital expenditures  and the free cash flow for the last six quarters 

However  since maintaining and growing the dividend is the company s number one financial priority  it can fund the dividend by taking on additional debt  divesting assets  and drawing down its cash balance 
Chevron had cash and cash equivalents of  8 56 billion at the end of the first quarter  and total debt of 42 34 billion  Furthermore  the company has also suspended its  1 25 billion quarterly share buyback to conserve cash 
Also  the company expects to reduce capital expenditures in 2017 by about  4 billion due to completion projects under construction  According to the company  its efforts are focused on improving free cash flow  and it is controlling its spend and getting key projects under construction online  which will boost revenues

Summary
Chevron reported an adjusted earnings per share loss in the in the first quarter of 2016  Nevertheless  I believe that the company is poised to achieve higher price appreciation when oil prices recover than that of other super major oil   gas companies due to its bigger historical upstream contribution 
Oil prices will eventually recover sooner or later  Commodities prices are moving in cycles  and lower capital expenditures on exploration and production will eventually cause oil prices to rebound

Both these companies are engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas  refining and marketing of petroleum products  manufacturing of chemicals  and other energy related businesses 
But how do you choose between the two supermajors  Here s a look at Exxon Mobil and Chevron stocks  performance in 2016 
Stock Performance
Both Exxon Mobil and Chevron have handily outperformed the S P 500 in the current year  with Exxon Mobil stock rising 14 5  to Chevron s 12 6   compared to the S P 500 s gain of just 2   Of course  these are numbers at a time when oil prices have rebounded more than 70  since hitting a 12 year low of  26 21 a barrel in Feb 
Exxon Mobil stock now trades at about 29 times trailing twelve months earnings and 35 times forward earnings for 2016  while Chevron stock is valued at 145 times trailing twelve months earnings and about 93 times forward earnings 
Being much more expensive  Chevron shares are primed for a fall 
Recent Earnings
In an indication of the toll that low commodity prices are taking on the industry  Chevron  for the three months ended Mar 31  while Exxon Mobil s  
Moreover  the two largest U S  energy companies by market value are experiencing signs of unexpected weakness in the refining business  suggesting that the units   which had saved them when crude prices plunged   could now be a drag  Both Exxon Mobil and Chevron s  downstream  unit profits almost halved from   the comparable period of 2015 
The deteriorating downstream results could be attributed to a fall in refining margins as the cost of gasoline  heating oil  and other refined products catches up on the beaten down crude price 
As it is  the companies are struggling with faltering sales of their exploration and production businesses amid plunging commodity prices 
Production   Capital Expenditure
Exxon Mobil and Chevron are suffering from marginal or falling returns  reflecting their struggle to replace reserves  as access to new energy resources becomes more difficult  Given their large base  achieving growth in oil and natural gas production is anyways a challenge for these companies over the last many years 
During the Jan Mar period  the Irving  TX based oil and natural gas powerhouse Exxon Mobil s production averaged 4 325 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day  MBOE d   up 1 8  from the first three months of 2015  For another domestic behemoth Chevron  total volume of crude oil and natural gas remained essentially unchanged from the year earlier level at 2 666 MBOE d 
At  5 1 billion  Exxon Mobil s capital and exploration expenditure for the first quarter of this year has run 33  lower than in the equivalent period of 2015  Chevron managed to reduce its outlay by 25  to  6 5 billion 
Shareholder Value
Despite the bloodbath  both Exxon Mobil and Chevron have continued to reward shareholders with large annual dividends of  3 00 and  4 28 per share   currently yielding 3 4  and 4 2   respectively  In Apr  Exxon Mobil boosted its quarterly payout for the 34th consecutive year  Though Chevron has not raised its dividend this year  it has raised dividend for 28 straight years 
However  in a move designed to conserve cash amid the energy price rout  the companies have stopped pouring money into their once vigorous stock buyback programs  While Chevron have scrapped its share repurchase scheme  Exxon Mobil has trimmed its buybacks program by around 50  
Through the year s first quarter  Exxon Mobil spent  3 1 billion in dividends  while shelling out  726 million on share buybacks  Meanwhile  Chevron paid out  2 billion in dividends 
Cash Flow from Operations
Leaving aside dividends and repurchases  Exxon Mobil s cash flow from operations and asset sales came in at  5 billion in the first three months of the year  Importantly  this was almost the same as its capital spending  a testament to the company s solid operations and cost discipline 
In contrast  Chevron s cash from operations was  1 1 billion  more than  5 billion short of its capital spending 
Bottom Line
Exxon Mobil and Chevron are two of the best run companies among the global oil majors  consistently producing industry leading financial returns  Both are still sound financially  In fact  their financial flexibility and strong balance sheets are real assets in this highly uncertain period for the economy  Both remain in excellent financial health  with enough in cash on hand and a very manageable debt to capitalization ratio  Exxon Mobil  though  with a lower ratio of 17  scores over Chevron s 22   
Nevertheless  neither Exxon Mobil nor Chevron   both carrying Zacks Rank  3  Hold    has been spared the effects of the rout in crude prices  But going by their performance thus far in 2016  Exxon Mobil seems to be in relatively better shape 
The most notable victim of the commodity meltdown has been share buybacks   gone for Chevron  Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  and BP plc   NYSE BP    Despite trimming significantly  Exxon Mobil still manages to spend  500 million a quarter to purchase shares 
Next is the dividend  Exxon Mobil   a double A credit rated company   hiked its dividend in April by 3  to 75 cents  The same can t be said for Chevron  which kept it the same at  1 07 a share 
The most important advantage for Exxon Mobil over Chevron  though  lies in its ability to generate free cash flow  In fact  the company has done a far better job at preserving cash than Chevron that has been free cash flow negative for a few years 
Such has been the repercussions on Chevron that it has scaled back its production growth target over the next two years and is cutting up to 8 000 jobs  or 12  of its workforce 
Finally  Exxon Mobil s business is roughly twice the size of Chevron s  which gives it the gargantuan scale to stand up a bit better to industry headwinds

193485,415001,CVX,Oil  Supply Risks Are Back,opinion,"Oil prices rebounded yesterday as the global risk to supply is rising at a time when global production may start falling  Not only are markets trying to assess the long term impact from the Alberta Canadian wildfires but increasing risk to supply in Nigeria are making traders nervous  On top of that Iran is signaling that they are ready to talk about a production freeze and the Energy Information Administration raises its price forecast for crude and predicts record U S  gasoline demand 
Overnight  Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa  declared a force majeure on Nigerian bonny light crude after a pipeline was shut down as rebels threaten the oil rich state  Bloomberg reported that all Nigerian oil producers are evacuating non essential workers from the Niger Delta region because of the deteriorating security 
Recent attacks on oil infrastructure has caused Nigerian production to drop to the lowest in 20 years  Last week Nigeria saw a loss of 90 000 barrels a day of production after rebels attacked a Chevron  NYSE CVX  offshore platform  Now Shell will add to the lost barrels which puts Nigerian oil production below 1 7 million barrels a day the lowest since 1994  The Nigerian government is vowing to crush the rebels but the risk to supply will remain high 
Oil also is still worried about the long term impact from the Canadian wildfires  Oil prices found support after most of Alberta s oil sands production was shut down  Canadian Oil Sands production is down by over a million barrels a day at the peak and while some of that may be coming back on line it is unclear how long it will take to get back to full production 
Still a report from the American Petroleum Institute seemed to slow upward momentum by reporting that U S  crude supplies increased by 3 4m barrels last week  That increase was led by a 1 5 million barrel build in the all important NYMEX delivery point in Cushing Oklahoma  The API also reported that gasoline stocks increased by 300 000 barrels and distillates fell by 1 4 million barrels 
Still The Energy Information Administration  EIA  is raising their expectations for U S  oil demand as well as production and as well as predicting record US gasoline demand  The EIA says that gasoline demand will average 9 32 million barrels a day in 2016  The EIA says that  Rising crude oil prices are likely to be passed on to consumers at the pump  but U S  drivers are still expected to pay the lowest summer gasoline prices since 2004  and for all of 2016 the average household will spend  900 less on gasoline than it did two years ago  
For crude oil  they are predicting higher prices as higher oil demand in China and India will contribute to a drawdown in global oil inventories during the second half of 2017   But because of the increasing price U S  production may rebound  The IEA says that crude oil production in 2017 is expected to be more than 100 000 barrels per day higher than previously forecast in response to higher oil prices  
As for Natural Gas  the EIA says that low natural gas prices may slow the growth in U S  natural gas production for the next few months   Big builds in U S  natural gas inventories are expected during the months ahead  leaving inventories at a record high at the start of the heating season in November    The annual amount of electricity generated by natural gas will exceed the generation from coal fired power plants this year for the first time  Coal fired electricity generation will be 8  lower this year  while natural gas generation will increase by 4   High natural gas production and low natural gas prices are making coal a less competitive generating fuel for many U S  power plant operators  U S  coal production this year is expected to have the biggest volume decline in almost seven decades   Ethanol s share of U S  gasoline will average 10  this year and in 2017  
Oil run is not over  We still believe that we are seeing more risk to supply not only because of geo political events but because of a historic cut back in investment  Big Oil is walking away from the Arctic and every other high priced oil venture  Global demand is rising  and we continue to plan for the next super spike ",2016-05-11,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil:-supply-risks-are-back-200129404,200129404

Chevron vs  Exxon  Which Is Better Positioned Post Q1 

Exxon Mobil Corp     and Chevron Corp       with their massive market capitalizations of  370 billion and  191 billion  respectively   dominate and define the U S  energy industry 

Both these companies are engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas  refining and marketing of petroleum products  manufacturing of chemicals  and other energy related businesses 

But how do you choose between the two supermajors  Here s a look at Exxon Mobil and Chevron stocks  performance in 2016 

Stock Performance

Both Exxon Mobil and Chevron have handily outperformed the S P 500 in the current year  with Exxon Mobil stock rising 14 5  to Chevron s 12 6   compared to the S P 500 s gain of just 2   Of course  these are numbers at a time when oil prices have rebounded more than 70  since hitting a 12 year low of  26 21 a barrel in Feb 

Exxon Mobil stock now trades at about 29 times trailing twelve months earnings and 35 times forward earnings for 2016  while Chevron stock is valued at 145 times trailing twelve months earnings and about 93 times forward earnings 

Being much more expensive  Chevron shares are primed for a fall 

Recent Earnings

In an indication of the toll that low commodity prices are taking on the industry  Chevron  for the three months ended Mar 31  while Exxon Mobil s   

Moreover  the two largest U S  energy companies by market value are experiencing signs of unexpected weakness in the refining business  suggesting that the units   which had saved them when crude prices plunged   could now be a drag  Both Exxon Mobil and Chevron s  downstream  unit profits almost halved from   the comparable period of 2015 

The deteriorating downstream results could be attributed to a fall in refining margins as the cost of gasoline  heating oil  and other refined products catches up on the beaten down crude price 

As it is  the companies are struggling with faltering sales of their exploration and production businesses amid plunging commodity prices 

Production   Capital Expenditure

Exxon Mobil and Chevron are suffering from marginal or falling returns  reflecting their struggle to replace reserves  as access to new energy resources becomes more difficult  Given their large base  achieving growth in oil and natural gas production is anyways a challenge for these companies over the last many years

At  5 1 billion  Exxon Mobil s capital and exploration expenditure for the first quarter of this year has run 33  lower than in the equivalent period of 2015  Chevron managed to reduce its outlay by 25  to  6 5 billion

193489,415005,CVX,Devon  DVN  Q1 Loss Narrower Than Expected  2016 View Up,opinion,Devon Energy Corp    NYSE DVN   reported first quarter 2016 adjusted loss per share of 53 cents  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 60 cents  In first quarter 2015  the company reported earnings of 22 cents per share Lower than expected loss in the first quarter was primarily due to the cost saving initiatives undertaken by the company On a GAAP basis  the company reported a loss of  6 44 per share compared with a loss of  8 88 per share in the year ago quarter  The difference between operating and GAAP figures in the reported quarter was due to a non cash  asset impairment charge RevenuesDevon s quarterly revenues of  2 12 billion lagged year ago revenues of  3 26 billion by 34 9  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 58 billion by 17 8   The decline in revenues was due to lower contribution from all operating segments compared with the prior year quarter Highlights of the ReleaseIn the first quarter 2016  Devon s total production averaged 581 000 barrels of oil equivalent  boe  per day  surpassing the mid point of the guidance by 6 000 boe per day Total production during the reported quarter was primarily driven by a 10  year over year increase in oil production in the U S  Robust output from Devon s Delaware Basin and Rockies assets was particularly notable  In addition  performance from its Jackfish 3 Project in Canada was impressive At the field level  the company is effectively controlling its costs  Thanks to its initiatives  lease operating expenses  LOE  were down 21  year over year to  7 13 per boe  Realized PricesRealized oil prices in the quarter were  33 66 per barrel  down 31 1  from  48 87 per barrel in the year ago quarter  Realized prices

per boe  down 56 9  year over year due to lower commodities prices Financial HealthAs of Mar 31  2016  the company had a cash balance of  1 635 million  down from  2 310 million as of Dec 31  2015 Long term debt as of Mar 31  2016  was  12 195 million compared with  12 056 million as of Dec 31  2015 Devon s cash flow from operating activities in first quarter 2016 was  149 million compared with  1 648 million in first quarter 2015 Capital expenditure was  749 million  lower than  1 717 million a year ago GuidanceDevon Energy estimates total production from its core assets for the second quarter of 2016 in the range of 527 000 551 000 boe per day  The company now expects 2016 total daily production in the range of 531 000 555 000 boe  up 3  from the previous expectation of 516 000 540 000 boe Capital expenditure  capex  in the second quarter is expected in the range of  325  405 million  The company reiterated the 2016 capex guidance in the range of  1 170 million to  1 445 million Devon s 2016 E P capital investment is estimated in a  900 million to  1 1 billion range and  for the second quarter  it is expected in a range of  250 million to  300 million Devon Energy further lowered its 2016 LOE outlook by  50 million to a range of  1 75 billion to  1 85 billion  The company expects its field level costs  which include both LOE and production taxes  to decline by up to  400 million for 2016  Devon is also on track to lower general and administrative expenses by  500 million from 2015 levels Other Company ReleasesAnadarko Petroleum Corporation   NYSE APC   reported a first quarter 2016 adjusted loss of  1 12 per share  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  1 19 TOTAL S A    TO TOT   reported first quarter 2016 operating earnings of 68 cents per share  easily surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents by 54 6 Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   reported a loss per share of 39 cents  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 18 cents Our ViewWhile Devon Energy incurred a narrower than expected loss in the first quarter of 2016  revenues fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The persistent weakness in commodity prices has finally forced the company to incur a loss However  Devon s focus on high quality North American properties has led to increased oil output for six quarters in a row  We expect continued strong production from the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin assets and Canadian heavy oil operations to help it to maintain strong production levels Additionally  Devon continues to divest non core assets and focus on its high return core assets  In April  Devon announced a deal to sell its non core Mississippian assets in northern Oklahoma for  200 million  which is a step toward its planned divesture of  2 billion to  3 billion of non core E P properties  The proceeds from these divestments will help the company to lower its outstanding debt and maintain financial flexibility Oil prices have shown remarkable gains lately on a rise in gasoline consumption  lower rig usage in the U S  and worldwide outages  Cost saving initiatives of the company are also in full force and are expected to generate total savings of nearly  900 million from 2015 levels  a big positive amid challenging circumstances Devon Energy currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  ,2016-05-03,Zacks Investment

193490,415006,CVX,Oil On The Rise Amid Signs Of Production Destruction,opinion,"More Production Destruction
Oil prices are on the rise as traders are starting to see signs of production destruction  What is production destruction  It is the opposite of demand destruction  When prices go too high we see demand destruction or demand fall  When prices go too low we see cut backs in spending and investment that will call production to fall  We are now seeing the early stages of production destruction of a mammoth scale that will be felt for years to come 
While oil prices seemed to focus on the Energy Information Administration  EIA  report that showed that oil supply increased by 2 874 million barrels the real story was another drop in U S  oil output that fell for the eight week in a row  It seems that the trend of falling output may be accelerating  The EIA reported that U S  oil production fell to 8 825 million barrels a day  down from 8 938 million barrels a day last week 
This comes on the same day that Royal Dutch Shell A  NYSE RDSa  profit fell by about 83  and Shell s chief financial officer  Simon Henry  warned that  In very simple terms  we re taking costs out of projects  and projects out of the funnel   Shell said it cut its capital spending budget another 10   to  30 billion this year  which in turn will lead to less barrels down the road 
It is not just Shell  The Wall Street Journal is reporting that

 The world s largest energy companies are sidelining big ideas that they touted just a couple of years ago as the future of the industry  

The Journal says that

 From Australia to the U S  Gulf Coast  the casualties include ultra deep water drilling projects  huge boats that serve as floating liquefied natural gas factories and technology that could drastically reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels  Royal Dutch Shell PLC  Chevron Corp   NYSE CVX  and Australia s Woodside Petroleum Ltd  are among the big companies to pull back or delay ambitious projects 

The Journal says that

 According to information and analytics firm IHS Inc   the oil and gas industry spent about 15  less on research and development in 2015  when crude oil prices averaged roughly  50 a barrel  compared with 2014  when prices averaged close to  100 a barrel  

Without that research and spending it is clear that the innovation that has allowed the U S  to once again be a major force in global oil production will be put on hold  With less U S  output the price of oil will be more fearful of geopolitical risk factors  Risk factors that are on the rise  In Iraq the fight against ISIS is intensifying putting oil production at risk  We saw two wells controlled by ISIS up in flames yesterday  Reuters reported that explosions at two oil wells  near territory controlled by Islamic State in northern Iraq  halted production on Wednesday as firefighters worked to put out the flames  oil officials and security sources said  The field has a maximum production capacity of 15 000 barrels per day  bpd  but was producing around 10 000 bpd before the attack  said officials from the state run North Oil Company that operates the reservoir 
In the meantime  the oil market seemed to failed to focus on the fact that U S  oil demand and product demand is soaring and more on the crude oil build and worries about global economic growth  Refinery runs jumped to 89 7  of capacity up 88 5  from the year before  Gasoline demand rose to a whopping 9 811 million barrels a day  That is near a record high and up 5 8  from a year ago  Distillate demand came in at 4 59 million barrels of oil a day  Down from last week but trending higher up 4 3  from the same period last year  Yet overnight perhaps the actual demand numbers are overtaking slowing demand fears 
We continue to say as we have for months that we are at a generational low in the oil market  We are at what we believe is the bottom end of a historic bust cycle that will at some point be a new super spike  While the biggest risk to this call is another global economic crisis the reality is that the history of global oil prices suggests that prices will be substantially higher in the future  When you kill billions of barrels of future production we will see a shortage in the future  Plan for the future now by strategies that are long term in focus ",2016-05-05,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-5-05-16-200128183,200128183

At the beginning of the annual meeting  Watson bragged about Chevron s safety record  which has been the best in the industry for a few years   We lead the industry in safety   Watson said 

Then Watson moved on to global energy outlook   By 2030  global energy demand is expected to grow by about a third   he said 

Rising population and incomes are driving the growth  Chevron forecasts a more than 15 percent increase in demand for liquids and about a 35 percent increase in gas demand globally  
The outlook for oil is not as optomistic  Demand will persist  but  it will require enormous investment in people and capital to meet demand    about  7 trillion over this period   Watson said  That number could rise to  10 trillion  according to Chevron s estimates  

Oil and natural gas is expected to make up nearly half of energy demand going into 2030  Global demand for liquid natural gas  LNG  is expected to double by 2025  requiring over 100 million tonnes per annum  mtpa   

And finally  Watson discussed the company s earnings  In 2013  Chevron brought in  21 4 billion in earnings  with an 11 percent dividend increase and 12 1 percent year end debt ratio  
Chevron plans to increase production by 20 percent through 2017 from increased LNG  deepwater and shale or tight oil production  along with an expansion of the Tengizchevroil consortium  TCO   a project near the Caspian Sea with ExxonMobil  the Kazakhstan government and its oil company and Lukoil ",2014-03-11,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chevron's-annual-analyst-meeting-in-six-charts-271507,271507

The EPA and BP agreed earlier this month to lift a 16 month suspension from federal contracts that had blocked the British energy giant BP from bidding during the previous three auctions in the area 
The company joins 41 other oil and gas companies Wednesday morning in New Orleans to bid in the Department of the Interior s high stakes sale of tracts 
 
Eight of BP s 13 bids are for blocks near the site of Macondo well that exploded in April 2010  which killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the ocean 

During the last central Gulf sale in March 2013  the sale s highest bid was  81 8 million  offered by Statoil and Samson  High bids totaled  1 2 billion 
Most of the 380 bids filed before the auction are for deep water territory  according to pre sale figures released by the Department of Interior  In March 2013  52 companies filed 407 bids 
The auction was scheduled for 10 am EST but was then delayed about two hours

193501,415017,CVX,Is It Time To Exit Energy ,opinion,"Over the last several weeks I have been laying out the technical case for a breakout above the downtrend  I said that while such a breakout would demand a subsequent increase in equity risk in portfolios  I didn t like it  To wit 

First  let s remember that the current advance is not built on improving economic or fundamental data  It is built simply on  hope  
With valuations expensive  markets overbought  volatility low  and sentiment pushing back into more extreme territory  there are a lot of things that can go wrong  
As shown below  the recent surge in asset prices has also turned the 50 dma sharply higher and is in the position of crossing back above the 200 dma  It is worth noting that the last time this occurred  it did fail shortly thereafter  



I can t really explain the current rally  All I know is that prices are dictating policy at the moment  We can deny it  We can rail against it  We can call it a conspiracy 
But in the  other  famous words of Bill Clinton   What is is  
The markets are currently betting the economy will begin to accelerate later this year  The  hope  that Central Bank actions will indeed spark inflationary pressures and economic growth is a tall order to fill considering it hasn t worked anywhere previously  If Central Banks are indeed able to keep asset prices inflated long enough for the fundamentals to catch up with the  fantasy    it will be a first in recorded human history  
My logic suggests that sooner rather than later somebody will yell  fire  in this very crowded theater  When that will be is anyone s guess 
In other words  this is all probably a  trap  

While I did increase equity exposure following the breakout above 2080  I strongly remind you that I am keeping very close stops AND do expect to be  stopped out   
With the FOMC back on deck this week  it is quite likely that if Janet Yellen has another  When Dove s Cry  moment  stocks could push toward previous highs  We will re evaluate our equity exposure again at the point 
Time To Sell Oil 
While we wait  let s turn our attention to the recent surge in oil prices  Is it too late to buy into the Energy sector at this stage  Or  is it time to sell 
In a nutshell  the very easy near term gains have likely already been seen  As I will explain below  the fundamental and technical backdrop suggests that for patient  long term investors there will be plenty of opportunity to pick up oil energy exposure at cheaper levels in the months ahead 
First  let s take a look at the fundamental backdrop of oil   supply and demand 
Oil s Supply Still Outstripping Demand
Sheraz Mian at Zacks com recently penned 

Oil is a global commodity  it s price determined by the interplay of supply and demand forces worldwide  The demand side of the equation is relatively straight forward  driven as it is by global economic growth  This growth has been most visible over the past decade in the emerging world  particularly China 
Demand from the developed world as a whole  primarily the U S   Europe and Japan has largely been flat to down  For example  the consumption of oil from the OECD group  a developed world grouping that includes the U S   Europe  and Japan  in the 10 years through the end of 2015 dropped by a cumulative  4 7   A combination of efficiency gains for these economies and stricter fuel consumption standards drove this decline  a trend that will likely continue in the coming years as well  During that same time period  from 2005 through 2015   China s cumulative oil consumption experienced a  64 4  jump  making China the world s second largest consumer of oil behind the U S  Demand for other major emerging economies like India  Brazil and Indonesia similarly increased  With the Chinese economy now past its break neck speed phase  it s oil demand growth has started slowing down as a result 
The combined effect of this flat to down OECD demand and decelerating demand growth from China and other emerging economies has resulted in slower demand growth for oil 

The chart below shows the long term supply demand balance for oil going back to 1980 

The 12 month average rate of consumption has declined in recent months and  as Sheraz correctly stated  more fuel efficient cars  homes  transportation  etc   combined with weaker global growth rates  will likely continue to push demand lower in the future  
This slip in demand comes at a time when supplies have once again reached record levels  This surge in supply is a direct result of the innovations in oilfield extraction techniques   fracking   which was driven by a boom in liquidity provided by the Federal Reserve  The chart below shows the relationship between oil prices and the increase the in the Federal Reserve balance sheet 

 via ZeroHedge 
The induction of liquidity into the financial system by the Federal Reserve translated into an effective  land rush  for oil companies to form drilling partnerships  The inevitable consequence of a malinvestment boom are now being felt as roughly 1 3rd of the companies that leveraged up to chase speculative oil production fields will eventually go away  
With the shift in dynamics by the  fracking miracle  which began in 2009  the U S  in now able to economically produce more oil out of the Shale basins than ever before  Even with the decline in rig counts  the efficiency of oil extraction out of producing wells is keeping supplies still well elevated  


U S  oil production reached an all time low in late 2008 as the global financial crisis got underway  But volumes have steadily increased since the 2008 bottom  surpassing the peak reached in 1970 last year  Production peaked in 2015 and has been coming down since then  But the incremental jump in U S  production from the 2008 bottom to the 2015 peak is in excess of 5 million barrels per day of new oil  which is more than most OPEC members  total production  save for a few 


Take The Money And Run
With supply and demand imbalance likely to remain for years to come  it is very likely that we will once again return to a long period of volatile prices within a very confined range as seen during the 1980 1990 s  Therefore  for those wanting to invest in oil and energy related positions  the shorter term price dynamics are going to be substantially more important 
If we take a look at the  Commitment Of Traders  report we see that exuberance over the recent surge in energy prices has pushed the number of oil contracts back to the second highest levels on record 

As with the past  these surges in contracts have typically denoted short term peaks in oil prices  This time is likely going to be no different 
There is also a direct correlation between these oil contracts and the financial markets  As of late  it has truly been  so goes oil  so goes the market   

Furthermore  oil prices are now extremely extended on a price basis with prices now deviated more than 12  above their 60 day average 

The same is true if we step this out further to a 3 month basis and look at the rate of change in prices over that period  The current level is consistent with previous short term peaks in oil prices 

Lastly  on a purely technical basis  prices are now extremely overbought on WEEKLY measures  Such overbought conditions rarely last long and a correction is needed before a further price advance can be entertained 

What To Do Now
This brings us back to our question  Is it time to sell energy related exposure 
Given the fundamental weakness in the economic environment  an inability of suppliers to substantially reduce production as revenue is needed to meet debt servicing requirements  and a gross short term extension in prices   the answer is most likely  yes  
The recent run up in oil prices was a product of extreme oversold conditions and a massive short covering rally induced by the realization that the Federal Reserve will not  as expected  raise interest rates at any point this year  The decline in the US dollar also provided a substantial tailwind 
However  with the dollar now over as well  short covering completed as oil contracts have surged to near all time highs  there is a distinct possibility of a decline in oil energy related positions as we head into the summer months 
Given the fundamental weakness in energy related companies  in terms of earnings and profits  the safest place to  hide  in the sector  if you must have exposure to energy  is in the mega cap refiners such as Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX   However  even these companies will suffer a price decline when oil prices revert back towards  30 bbl this summer 
Oil drilling companies are the most susceptible to price volatility and many in this space will likely face bankruptcy risks in the months ahead  There is also substantial risk of  reversions  in the Master Limited Partnership space as parent companies reacquire their pipelines for the much needed cash flows  We just saw this earlier this year with Linn Energy and should expect to see more in the future 
Be careful of what you own and where 
There is still risk in the sector longer term as hopes of a quick return to  80 bbl fades into a reality the  new normal  may be much lower 
Lastly  and most importantly  if you are still holding onto energy related positions at a 30 60  loss or more  sell them for the loss and re evaluate what you are doing  
If you have an advisor  then it may be time to find a new one that actually understands the importance of  capital preservation   The excuse of  we like energy and think it will come back  is not money management   it is  hope  and  getting back to even  is not an investment strategy that will work out for you longer term  
There is one simple truth about investing in anything long term   you want to  buy it  when nobody else  wants it  
That is not the case currently as too many investors are still operating on a  recency bias  hoping that with oil today at a level last seen following the financial crisis will result in a similar outcome  That is extremely wishful thinking given the completely inverted supply demand dynamics  global economic weakness  and a pending economic recession ",2016-04-27,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/technically-speaking:-time-to-sell-oil-energy-200126538,200126538
193502,415018,CVX,Earnings Watch  Big Oil Reports Friday,opinion,"After a tumultuous 2015 for the energy sector  prices are starting to stabilize in the new year  After the Fed s announcement this week to leave rates unchanged  oil surged to 2016 highs  Crude Brent reached a year to date high of  47 18 while WTI pushed over  45 for the second time this year  Oil has rebounded since slumping to its lowest levels since 2003  A large portion of oil s recent gains is fueled by weakness in the U S  dollar  As oil continues to pick up steam  producers such as Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  should start to see earnings bounce back  While the recent turnaround won t impact Friday s earnings  it will play a large role on the outlook for the remainder of the year 

Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  Energy   Oil  Gas   Consumable Fuels   Reports April 29  Before Market Opens 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  0 34 on  49 76 billion in revenue  3 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom and  1 6 billion on the top  Since its last report per share estimates have been cut by 49  with sales revised down 14   Compared to a year earlier this reflects a 67  decline in profitability while revenue could plunge as much as 26   Given Exxon s recent track record it s almost shocking that the stock is unscathed leading up and through earnings season  
What to Watch  Last quarter featured a number of declines in key financial metrics  Both earnings per share and revenue hit a new low for the last 2 years  The company s three main reporting segments were largely mixed with upstream earnings underperforming and downstream and chemical earnings up from the year prior  Meanwhile  Exxon continues to cut capital spending and expenditures as a measure to tackle the weak commodities environment  Unfortunately  fourth quarter lows are only expected to get worse this quarter  Upstream and downstream earnings are forecasted to decline on a sequential and year over year basis while chemical earnings are expected to increase  Just days ahead of earnings  S P downgraded Exxon s AAA ratings  leaving just two non financial companies with the highly coveted rating  From an investor s perspective  all the hoopla has had a minimal impact on the stock  Share prices have been flat from a year earlier and up 17  in the past 3 months 
Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  Energy   Oil  Gas   Consumable Fuels   Reports April 29  Before Market Opens 
The Estimize community is looking for a 10 cent loss on  23 87 billion in revenue  8 cents higher that Wall Street on EPS and nearly  320 in revenue  Estimates have been frantically falling in the past 3 months as per share estimates have been cut over 150   Compared to the same period last year  earnings per share are predicted to fall 104  on a 31  decline in sales  Shockingly  like Exxon  Chevron shares have been unharmed from weak earnings 
What to Watch  For Chevron  oil prices have led to a steep declines in both its upstream and downstream services  Last quarter featured a  1 3 billion decline in upstream earnings   500 million decline in downstream earnings and  240 million loss in all its other business segments  Meanwhile  Chevron capped off 2015 with a shrinking cash position and total debt that increased  10 8 billion over the year  Consequently  Chevron has begun implementing cost saving initiatives to sustain operations until the oil turnaround is validated  This includes cutting its relatively high level of capital spending and workforce reductions  That said  investors have been rewarded so far this year  with shares up nearly 25  in the past 3 months
Given what appears to be a turnaround in oil and strong earnings from British Petroleum earlier this week  Exxon and Chevron can only hope earnings will rebound during the second half of the year

Poland has some of the most promising sites for shale gas exploration in the European Union  The Polish Geological Institute estimates the country has reserves of between 346 billion and 768 billion cubic meters of recoverable shale gas 
But so far  Poland only has about 50 wells  too few to evaluate its shale gas potential more precisely 
Poland s Environmental Minister Maciej Grabowski said Wednesday he expects a  year of true breakthrough  and about 30 new shale gas drillings this year after introducing the new regulations 
Currently  Poland depends on its past communist big brother Russia for 60 percent of its gas

But Chevron Corp   NYSE  CVX  is already poised to benefit from the new regulations  having signed a deal in December with Poland s most popular gas company  PGNiG SA  on shale gas exploration 
The new bill describing the regulations is not yet published  but contains a plan to create a national regulator and make licensing procedures less of a hassle  Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Wednesday

193511,415027,CVX,Why Russia Wants American Oil Companies To Work Its Prospects,news,"By    The Russian American Chamber of Commerce is the only American sponsor of the second annual Russian Oil and Gas Forum  happening March 18 20 in Moscow 
Sergio Millian  president of the chamber  is flying to Moscow early to prepare  stopping in Kiev  Ukraine  along the way  He talked to the IBTimes Wednesday about the upcoming forum and why the Russian Oil Ministry wants U S  technology to extract oil and gas in previously unreachable areas 
What s on the agenda for the oil and gas forum 
It s a three day conference on Russian energy strategy and energy efficiency  Several weeks ago  we met with several top officials from the U S  Department of Energy about the conference  and we have received some other relevant information about the successful cooperation 
We hope that trade will increase between Russia and the U S  We re hoping to attract investment of about half a billion into Russian exploration and investment into American refineries 
Who s going to be at the forum 
Several companies  Chevron confirmed  Exxon Mobil confirmed participation in the forum  We re talking to about 10 more companies  I m flying this weekend to Moscow and will continue talking to them 
Exxon Mobil has a contract already and is an example of successful cooperation with Russia  Rosneft is working with Exxon  They signed an official agreement two years ago for several billion dollars  They re the most successful recent example  and really the only example  of Russian American cooperation in oil 
Is the Russian government looking to U S  companies to invest in oil exploration in Russia  
Yes  basically the Russian government for the second time   is hosting the oil and gas forum  which means that since it s conducted by the  Russian  Minister of Energy  the idea is make sure they  U S  companies  understand the guidelines after the year 2013  Some projects will be discussed with substantial investments  American companies can benefit greatly 
Why does Russia s energy ministry want help from American companies 
They would like to partner with the American companies because technologies from the shale revolution have been developed here  and most of the European countries don t have this technology yet  They want to explore the Arctic Sea and Eastern Siberia 
American companies may not enter into any significant deals  They have to get an okay from the Russian government  This forum represents the platform where business execs and Russian officials can reach agreements 
What concerns would U S  companies have about working with Russia 
Most of the time concerns voiced from American companies are about energy security and not understanding Russian tax law and fiscal policy  Many companies have voiced concerns about terrorism  Chechnyan terrorists  It hasn t happened yet  but they are still concerned it might 
Some of the world s largest oil companies like Chevron  NYSE  CVX   Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE  RDS A  and Exxon Mobil  NYSE  XOM  have signed agreements or nearly signed agreements for oil exploration in Ukraine and the Black Sea  With the Ukrainian crisis  what do you think will happen with oil companies  operations in Ukraine

193516,415032,CVX,S P 500 Earnings  Not As Bleak As They Seem,opinion,"Thomson Reuters S P 500 Earnings data  by the numbers  
Forward 4 quarter estimate increased this week to  124 78 versus last week s  estimated   123 50 
P E ratio  16 4 x 
PEG ratio  17 3 x  finally positive but not really indicative of core earnings growth 
S P 500 earnings yield  6 09  versus last week s 5 96   The market seems to struggle anytime the SP 500 earnings yield dips under 6  
Year over year growth rate of forward estimate   0 95  versus last week s  0 35   estimated 
The reason the Thomson earnings data led off this week s post was I wanted readers to note the increase in the  forward 4 quarter estimate   last week I estimated that increase to be  123 50 and in fact it was  1 higher  which is a good sign 
The other point to make is that although the data set is small  Thomson Reuters noted that of the 22 companies that have reported Q1  16 earnings to date  the  beat rates   i e  upside surprises in EPS and revenue  have been substantial  and listed the actual companies  Readers might consider this  grasping for straws  so to speak  but the one spreadsheet I keep on  analyst revisions   see spreadsheet linked below  supports the fact that Q1  16 earnings will likely be better than the Street is expecting 
First Call EPS estimate revisions  
If you look at the revisions data  upward EPS revisions remained between 30    40  outside of the peak earnings period in January  16  until early March  when the upward revisions moved into the mid 40  range  It is an educated guess but with the bottom in Energy and Commodities in mid February  16   which sectors are still less than 10  of the market cap of the S P 500   the analysts started moving numbers up once the rebound in various commodities looked sustainable 
Looking at the asset return tables since 2000  commodities have been at the absolute bottom of the asset class return table for 4 years running  until Q1  16 
Look for  core  S P 500 earnings growth of low single digits for Q1  16  but how the dollar continues to trade and how a lot of the multinational large caps react to earnings will be more telling 
Thomson is currently expecting the S P 500 earnings to fall  7 6   while Factset expects S P 500 earnings to decline  9 1  
One last link   it was noted on this blog the importance of Energy  in my opinion  to the S P 500 
This link    quarterly historical earnings and revenue growth by sector for the S P 500   Q4  15 s results are now final per Thomson and Factset  
In the black box I ve highlighted Energy s historical and expected revenue growth as of Thomson s and Factset s April 8  16 reports  Note the Energy revenue growth estimate relative to historical  The issue with forecasting Energy revenue is that Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX   the Energy sector s two largest components by far  have  revenue  that includes asset sales  which means that Exxon and Chevron can have huge upside surprises or misses based on transactions outside the typical  revenue  accounting standard 
Also note how Financial s are expected to have their worst quarter of EPS growth in two years 
In my opinion Q1  16 will mark the bottom for S P 500 revenue and EPS growth  Part of that forecast is sentiment   too many on CNBC and Bloomberg toss out  S P 500 earnings growth  as a market negative without any consideration of history or trends ",2016-04-11,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-earnings:-not-as-bleak-as-they-seem.-200124585,200124585

So far today  the gains the market is experiencing looks to be on the heals of those being forced to cover their short positions 
However  the market is running slap into heavy resistance here  and I m not one that is looking to suddenly buy into this market rally  Instead  with the market hitting its head on declining resistance off of the July highs  and not able to push through the upper bollinger band  a theme going back to July of 2014   I would suggest that the market has limited upside  and far greater downside 
The problem with that  is that you can only test this theory slowly   get extremely short right here  right now  you are looking at a random 20 point gain in the market that flushes you out a whole host of short positions  Test the short side with just a small amount of capital  you can get out if the trade doesn t work with relative ease 
That is what I am attempting to do here

193522,415038,CVX,Will Q1  16 Earnings Be The Low For The Year  Is Energy Stabilizing ,opinion,"Are Energy and Financials tied at the hip now in terms of sector performance  If crude oil trades below  28 again  and makes a run for  20  does that mean the Financial sector sees another 10  drawdown 
Could Energy  and crude oil  actually be in the process of bottoming  
Both Thomson and Factset now predict  low single digit  S P 500 earnings growth for 2016 
Check the spreadsheet here    Both historical and projeced EPS and revenue data are provided 
Note how both Thomson and Factset show that Energy revenue was ugly in both Q3 and Q4  15  but Q4  15 wasn t any worse than Q3  15   See spreadsheet lines 24 and 52   Thomson does not give forward quarter revenue estimates but   to their credit   Factset does  and note that Energy sector revenue is estimated to be still ugly in Q1  16  but not as negative as Q3 and Q4  15 
Because Exxon Mobil  N XOM  and Chevron  N CVX  revenues can deviate substantially from consensus thanks to asset sales  etc  it might be too early to call the two quarters of identical revenue decline a trend in Energy  but it is worth noting  It is the one positive data point I can find in Energy at all for the last 6 months  outside of the fact that the Energy ETFs have not made a new low since January 20th  16  Does that date ring a bell 
With Energy  Basic Materials and now Financials weighing on the S P 500  it is no surprise the S P 500 and the major indices are struggling this year 
Could Q1  16 be the bottom for S P 500 earnings growth 
S P 500 earnings data by the numbers  
Forward 4 quarter estimate   121 23 this week versus last week s  121 74
P E ratio  16 x 
PEG ratio  16 divided by  low single digits  spells  overvalued  on a P E basis
S P 500 earnings yield  6 22  vs 6 35  last week  If the PEG ratio has been consistently cited as a reason to be cautious on the S P 500  then the  earnings yield  metric should be consistently cited by the bulls 
Year over year growth rate of forward estimate   1 33  vs last week s  1 15   Still positive and moved higher last week  but not a trend yet  At least it is positive 
Analysis   conclusion  Clients  exposure to Energy was lifted to 3  5  this week  which is probably the heaviest weighting in the sector in years  Crude oil has been on a glide path lower since September 1  14  but the last 30 days it hasn t traded materially lower  and in fact I think it is up  1  2  Per some of our technical analysis   Chris Kimble of Kimble Charting Solutions   crude oil is sitting at a 25 year support level  Sentiment is horrid  There was one bullish Energy analyst this week on CNBC   an Eastern European kid   and the CNBC anchors were incredulous at his bullish stance  Besides a 3  5  weighting in Energy  clients have also seen their first ever Emerging Markets exposure  1  2   and we are looking at the other sectors that have gotten run over the last 12 months like Transports  biotech  Russell 2000  and maybe the industrial metals  steel and copper  
When the S P 500 does right itself  expect market leadership to be different  Commodities have been down for 5 straight years that will end  Commodity businesses are notorious for having low returns on capital  so commodities aren t FANG with wide moats  sustainable margins  above average growth  etc 
2016 looks back end loaded in terms of earnings growth  If crude can stabilize  the dollar weaken a little  and maybe we see a little inflation  would certainly be great for retail   the psychology of this market could break

193524,415040,CVX,Profiting In Bear And Bull Oil Markets,opinion,"Oil prices have been falling since June 2014 as increasing supply of crude oil by major producers exceeded global demand for the commodity  Brent crude oil prices are down more than 64  since June 20  2014 causing great strain for oil producers who have to repay debts taken when no such downturn was expected  US oil rig count fell by 703 since March 2015 as lower prices led to falling earnings  Since the start of 2015 more than 40 US energy companies have declared bankruptcy  Energy Information Administration estimates in its March  2016 monthly report that US shale oil output will fall 106 000 barrels per day  bpd  in April from March to total 4 871 million bpd  Major oil producers Saudi Arabia  Russia  Qatar and Venezuela agreed last month to freeze crude oil output at January levels in an attempt to stem the global glut on condition other producers will join the agreement  Oil prices have reversed after that on expectations that rising demand will clear the global overhang of stockpiles with output kept steady  Data from China s General Administration of Customs seem to support this expectations at least for the world s second largest oil consumer  China s crude oil imports in February jumped 20  on year to 8 0 million barrels per day  to highest ever on a daily basis 
While the recent advance in prices has resulted in more than 7  gain in Brent crude price year to date  many analysts have rightfully noted that the oil market is still oversupplied and prices have to remain lower to help rebalance the market as supplies fall  Increasing output by Iran is a major factor which may contribute to continued downward pressure on prices as Iran increases its crude oil output to pre sanction level of 4 million bpd and ramps up its exports to regain lost market share as Tehran has said repeatedly it intends to do 
Stock prices of major energy companies are correlated with crude oil  they change as crude oil prices fluctuate but over time these changes are usually smaller than underlying fluctuations in oil prices  This is largely the result of integrated business model of major energy companies with operations involving both upstream exploration and production of crude oil  as well as downstream refining of crude oil and marketing of refined oil products  Such an integrated model makes earnings less sensitive to changes in crude oil prices  while earnings from crude oil sale fall as oil prices fall  with falling input costs earnings from refining business units rise helping to compensate partially for declining upstream earnings  Thus stock prices of major energy companies tend to fall less for a given decline in oil prices  and tend to advance less than a given rise in underlying oil prices  A comparison of asset performances in the table below verifies that changes in stock prices of major oil companies   Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX  and BP  LON BP  were smaller in magnitude than changes in underlying oil prices in recent periods 
Period Brent Price Change    XOM Price Change    CVX Price Change   BP  Price Change    June 20  2014   January 14  2015  56 54  13 63  21 51  32 41 January 14  2015   May 6  2015  34 87  2 01  2 07  18 76 May 6  2015   August 24  2015  36 52  21 53  32 19  26 01 August 24  2015   January 20  2016  37 44  4 04  7 42  9 92
A trading strategy of combining long and short positions in stocks of major oil companies and oil can be employed to take advantage of differences in rates of change of these instrument prices  In essence this strategy of taking opposite positions in oil and stocks of major energy companies is similar to pairs trading  For example  in the first period from June 20  2014 to January 14  2015 the profitable trading strategy would be taking a short position in Brent oil and long position in any of the major energy company stocks  In the second period from January 14  2015 to May 6  2015 going long in Brent oil and short in any of three stocks would be the winning strategy  And in the next two periods of falling oil prices shorting the Brent oil again and going long in stocks would generate positive returns 
Figure 1   XOM Brent PCI Weekly Chart 
Figure 2  Brent Weekly Chart

To understand what the PCI chart is telling about the relative performance of the Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  stock and Brent crude oil it should be noted that the price of our PCI is equal to the ratio of the dollar values of 123 shares of Exxon Mobil and 274 barrels of Brent crude oil  The charts look like the inverse version of each other  while Brent fell steeply in summer winter period of 2008 the PCI rose sharply  And as Brent rebounded in 2009 2010 period the PCI fell  This means that Exxon Mobil stock  which is in the numerator for the PCI price ratio  fell less in summer winter period of 2008 than Brent  And in the subsequent period as Brent rebounded Exxon Mobil stock recorded smaller gains  This pattern allows to trade two assets by taking opposite positions in them  which is what our PCI allows to do 
Let us have a look at the daily candlestick chart of  XOM Brent below in the Figure 3 
Figure 3   XOM Brent PCI Daily Chart

The PCI price had been rising since May 2015  hit the highest in mid January 2016 and is retracing lower since then  It breached below the neckline of the head and shoulder chart pattern formed in the last three months  This is a bearish development  The price has breached the support line of the uptrend and closed below it  which is clearly a bearish development  The RSI indicator has reached the oversold zone and is edging up  The MACD signal line has breached below the zero level  the indicator is below the signal line  and the gap with the signal line is widening  This is also a bearish signal  The Parabolic indicator also gives a sell signal  The overall signal is bearish which is indicated by the red down arrow on the PCI chart  We can go short on the PCI right away by placing a limit order to sell with an entry point below the support line  and limit the risk by placing the stop loss above last fractal high at 1 0172  The result of the  XOM Brent PCI technical analysis is straightforward  sell the PCI  which will result in selling the Exxon Mobil stock and buying the Brent crude oil  just what would be expected when oil prices were trending upward ",2016-03-09,IFC Markets,https://www.investing.com/analysis/profiting-in-bear-and-bull-oil-markets-200120976,200120976

193526,415042,CVX,U S  LNG Shale Gas Exports Likely To Face Headwinds,opinion,"In many debates about energy costs we tend to lump crude oil and natural gas together 
Indeed  they are pumped out of the ground in a similar way  They come from the same or similar regions and formations and are extracted  processed and sold by many of the same firms  Both are intrinsically  energy  products and these similarities explain why most people expect them to behave similarly in relation to each other when it comes to price 
But  in fact  the correlation is  historically  not close  For long periods of time  the correlation in price movements was little better than 25  but in periods of price spikes for crude oil  natural gas prices have also spiked bringing their aligned movements up to a 60 70  correlation 
Not Birds of a Feather
In reality  though  there is little reason why they should or would follow one another  Oil has been a freely traded and easily transported product making price arbitrage opportunities limited and tending to smooth out regional differences  Natural gas  on the other hand  is highly regional needing pipelines to transport it even modest distances of a few hundred kilometers and it needs to be converted into liquefied natural gas  LNG  to be transported globally 
Increasingly  though  lower LNG prices are making power generation more attractive and a global drive for less carbon intensive fuels has encouraged massive investment in LNG processing facilities and transport vessels  At one time Qatar was the undisputed LNG king even though other countries had larger gas reserves and pumped more from the ground  but for historical reasons had invested in pipelines rather than LNG  Russia is a prime example 
Power Generation Demand
It was feared by industrial consumers in the US that historically low domestic natural gas prices would be undermined if shale gas firms were allowed to export LNG in volume  but   unfortunately for the firms that have invested billions in refitting import LNG terminals to make them export terminals   they are coming onstream at a time of oversupply and weak prices 
So badly has the landscape for LNG deteriorated that Woodside Petroleum  OTC WOPEY    along with its partners Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   BP  LON BP  and Japan Australia LNG   has shelved its  40 billion Browse LNG project off western Australia  Asian LNG prices have collapsed  falling 45  over the past year according to a  in the face of new supply and softening demand 
Woodside s competitor Chevron  NYSE CVX  is just completing its massive  54 billion Gorgon project  also off western Australia  and is poised to ship its first cargo  Australia was positioned to overtake Qatar as the world s largest LNG producer  but the raft of postponements and project cancellations will delay that achievement  Meanwhile  new entrants are joining the market 
Export Competition
Qatar s neighbor Oman has not one but two projects about to add to global supply  One is maximizing the capacity of it s three train 10 4 million metric ton per year LNG plant by taking 1 5 million tons of natural gas 400 kilometers by pipeline from Iran and maxing out the liquefaction capacity 
Iran has the worlds largest gas reserves and the potential  with foreign investment now that sanctions are being lifted  to swamp supply  Oman s second project is BP s development of the Khazzan shale gas resource  the project is currently 65  of the way to completion according to oilprice com and when completed will boost Oman s reserves by as much as 40   Khazzan s estimated 24 9 trillion cubic feet of reserves  though pale in comparison to Iran s 1 046 trillion cubic feet of proven reserves 
With so much capacity coming onstream in Australia  with the Middle East adding further capacity to its already leading position  with Iran just a few years away from adding further supply and with Asian demand softening  maybe U S  consumers do not have too much to worry about domestic prices being raised by a flood of LNG leaving the country 
America s liquefaction export plants will find markets willing to take their cargo  The UK already says its domestic market price has fallen in response to potential supply from U S  shale producers encouraging suppliers to moderate prices in the face of the threat  but the world is not screaming out for LNG supplies today in the way it was a at the end of the last decade  Does that suggest both LNG and crude prices are set to fall  Probably  yes  and for similar reasons of oversupply and a softening market ",2016-03-28,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-lng-shale-gas-exports-likely-to-face-headwinds-200122980,200122980

On the Natural Gas front the market is flying high with more production cuts at these price levels and February weather we are accustomed to is back  In the overnight electronic session the March contract is currently trading at 2 137 which is  074 cents higher  The trading range has been 2 156 to 2 105 so far  We may test the 2 200 to 2 220 level in today s session

Exxon Mobil  N XOM  management has set a  34 billion capex limit for fiscal 2016
The firm s profitable downstream sector will help mitigate losses from oil related operations
Energy giant  Exxon Mobil Corporation  is scheduled to report Q4 2015 earnings tomorrow morning before the market opens  Despite posting a positive EPS surprise in 5 of the past 7 quarters  analyst expectations remain bleak as the price of Brent Crude Oil and WTI continue to decline  Chevron  N CVX  released mixed results on Friday  with EPS coming in well below the consensus  but reported revenues beating expectations by  140M 
This quarter  the Estimize community is expecting revenue of  53 9 billion  a stark contrast from Q4 2014 when XOM posted revenue of  87 3 billion  Earnings expectations are less than half of what they were a year ago  with Estimize calling for EPS of  0 70  still above Wall Street s  0 65  but 86 cents lower than the Q4 2014 report 
Compared to other industry players  Exxon has done a remarkable job weathering the recent oil related downturns  The energy giant has leaned heavily on its robust downstream earnings to provide a cushion  As an industry leader and the largest US oil company by market cap  XOM has the financial resources to quell losses from its chemical and refining branches  which have faltered from increased demand for refined fuels 

Since July  crude oil has fallen from  50 barrel to where it currently resides at  30 barrel  Major competitors  such as Chevron  have posted significant EPS and Revenue losses for the first time since 2002  To combat the adverse effects of falling oil prices  companies are poised to cut jobs and reduce capital expenditures  Cost cutting initiatives will allow XOM to issue regular dividend payments and survive in the struggling environment  Last quarter  Exxon cut capital expenditures by 22  from the same quarter a year ago and has now issued a CAPEX ceiling of  34 billion for fiscal 2016 ",2016-02-01,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-watch:-cheap-oil-and-exxon-382721,382721

193567,415083,CVX,10 Dividends About To Get Cut,opinion,"Dividend darling Kinder Morgan  N KMI  just reminded us why we need to know what s funding that payout we love receiving every quarter 
KMI investors who didn t see the dividend cut coming were flying blissfully blind  Everyone else  meanwhile  saw the business problems from a mile away  They sold the stock down 58  in the six months prior to the actual announcement 
Mr  Market Sniffs Out KMI s Dividend Cut
This is the problem with  first level  income investing  We can t just buy a stated dividend and trust that it will be there next quarter  Instead  we must employ more nuanced second level thinking to look beyond the obvious  This way  we can buy bargains the market is missing  and avoid time bombs like KMI 
I ve got some high yielding bargains that I ll share with you in a bit  Investors have mistakenly sold some high quality  growing payers down to levels that we can take advantage of 
But first  let s free up some capital and talk about 10 dividend disasters waiting to happen  If you own any of these stocks  you should sell them right now  And if you hold related issues  take a close look at the underlying business fundamentals   because there are macro factors that are undermining entire sectors 
Such as  35 oil 
4 Energy Traps  Oil is Going Sub  30
In April 2014  I warned that then  103 crude oil was due for a drop  U S  crude oil inventories were at 5 year highs  yet money managers were net long 319 000 contracts on crude oil futures  They were betting heavily that prices would continue higher in the face of record supply and stagnant demand 
They were wrong  of course  Then again in September  I warned that big oil remained a big dividend trap  Oil was at  45  and my publisher wondered if I had mistyped my forecast for sub  30 oil 
But money managers remained net long oil by 110 000 contracts  That was enough fuel to drive crude s continued crash  We re 20  lower today  and these contrarian indicators are still net long 79 000 contracts 
Oil s going below  30   and it s going to take down many energy dividend payers with it  Let s discuss four in particular that are in trouble 
A low payout ratio   the percentage of earnings a company pays out to investors   is generally a good thing  I like to see this below 50   the lower the better  Until that number turns negative  that is 
The only way to get a negative payout ratio is with negative earnings   in which case  management should be suspending its dividend  But that didn t happen with BP plc  L BP   which lost  2 49 per share over the last 12 months while stubbornly paying out  2 40 in dividends for a big yet unsustainable current yield of 7 8  
How d it fill the gap  Almost  5 billion in additional long term debt 
Meanwhile Chevron  N CVX  and Exxon Mobil  N XOM    paying 5  and 3 9  respectively   are  to their credit  making money  But Chevron s payout ratio has ballooned to 94  over the past year  and Exxon s has increased to an uncomfortable 61   Considering that these ratios were below 35  for most of the last decade  income investors should be wary 
Chevron and Exxon Payout Ratios  Go Parabolic 
Chevron CEO John Watson says that paying a dividend is his number one priority  He may be able to achieve this   but it ll be at the expense of all other business priorities 
Marathon Oil  N MRO  wraps up the negative payout ratio club here  The company has lost  0 73 per share over the last 12 months  yet continues to pay an annual dividend of  0 84 per share  Unless oil delivers a surprise rally soon  MRO is racing BP to be the  next Kinder  and cut its 5 5  yield 
Choose Your REITs Wisely
Frantic first level investors  worried about rising rates  have sold all REITs all year long  I believe they re dead wrong about healthcare REITs  which currently have sky high yields and a great track record during previous rising rate environments 
Mortgage REITs  on the other hand  should be sold immediately  If history is any guide  rising rates are not actually priced into share prices of these issues sufficiently  Here s what I mean 
From June 2004 to June 2006  Alan Greenspan boosted rates from 1  to 5 25   Everyone knew that higher rates would hurt mortgage REITs like Annaly Capital  N NLY  because they hold fixed rate securities that decline in price when rates rise 
However  unlike the forward looking investors who sold KMI well in advance of its actual dividend cut  they didn t run for the exits on NLY until after it actually chopped its payout in mid 2005 
Higher Rates Didn t Hurt Annaly Until After It Cut Its Dividend
If you own Annaly Capital  NLY   American Capital Agency  O AGNC   Redwood Trust  N RWT   Capstead Mortgage  N CMO  or MFA Financial  N MFA  for their double digit yields  you should sell them right now  You don t want to hold these issues through an actual payout reduction 
And 1 Business Development Company  BDC  to Avoid
Like mortgage REITs  BDCs build and manage portfolios of investments that they hold privately  while their stocks trade publically   They re also required to distribute most of their income to shareholders  so their yields are often in the double digits 
As we discussed  not all REITs are created equal  and the same goes for BDCs  One is looking particularly shaky according to the DIVCON screen put together by the income strategy gurus at Reality Shares Advisors 
I interviewed company principals Eric Ervin and Ted Meyer a few months back  They explained to me that according to backtests of their screen  stocks identified as  DIVCON 1  are more likely to cut their payouts than increase them 
Today their screen is flashing red for one BDC  Prospect Capital  O PSEC   which yields nearly 17  
Its down 22  in the last 3 months  And there s an obvious problem  PSEC s payout ratio has swelled to 135   more than double where it was at the start of 2012 
PSEC s Payout Ratio Swells Beyond 100 ",2015-12-16,Brett Owens,https://www.investing.com/analysis/10-dividends-about-to-get-cut-376104,376104

193569,415085,CVX,Oil  Forget The Past ,opinion,"Should auld markets be forgot and never brought to mind  Should auld markets be forgot and auld lang sine 
Not on you life  Oil put in its second back to back losing years since the eighties but perhaps its time to remember what happened the year after that first loser  The last time oil put back to back losing years in in 1997 and 1998  the following year of 1999 gave a historic comeback and cemented a bottom in oil prices for a generation  After falling over 30  in 1997 and 1998  in 1999 the oil market rebounded almost 107   That s why this year  as I have written before  crude oil is getting ready to party like its 1999 
The comparisons to what happened in the late 1990 s and what is happening now are almost uncanny  Energy companies were bleeding cash and it set of merger mania as energy companies big and small had to do whatever it took to stay alive  In 1999 Exxon Corp  and Mobil Corp  agreed to an  82 billion merger that created the world s largest publicly traded oil company  N XOM   which sounds kind of cheap in this day and age  Not long after in 2001  Chevron Corp  and Texaco Inc  merged to create the world s fourth largest investor owned oil company  known as ChevronTexaco  N CVX  for a mere  45 billion dollars 
Fast forward to today  The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Tudor  Pickering   Holt  an energy focused investment bank  has tallied 150 projects that have been delayed  resulting in an estimated 13 million barrels a day of oil production deferred indefinitely  That is equal to 15  of total global output 
This year has been the year of the double dip for crude oil  Prices were recovering until Greece voted to leave the eurozone for a few minutes  Then after their banks were drained  they voted for it before they voted against it or something like that  You also had the China stock market crash which also raised fears and the supposed return of Iranian oil as sanction are supposed to be lifted  But hold on  is it a done deal 
The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the U S  is going to put more sanctions on Iran  which may cause some problems for the return of Iranian oil back to the market  The Journal reports   The Obama administration is preparing to impose its first financial sanctions on Iran since it forged a landmark nuclear agreement in July  presenting a major test for whether Tehran will stay committed to the deal  The planned action by the Treasury Department  U S  officials told The Wall Street Journal  is directed at nearly a dozen companies and individuals in Iran  Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates for their alleged role in developing Iran s ballistic missile program  Iranian officials have warned the White House in recent months that any such financial penalties would be viewed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a violation of the nuclear accord  So if the deal falls apart that may be another catalyst for oil to try to repeat its comeback of 1999   That along with more pain with energy bankruptcies continues to bombard the oil market  Capital spending cuts as well as the normal rate of production decline is hitting the market  The Wall Street Journal today reports that the oil industry needs to replace 34 billion barrels of crude every year to satisfy expected consumption growth  according to Rystad 
I also think that many people are underestimating demand growth next year  This year we saw demand growth globally  the strangest in over a decade  We saw gasoline growth in the U S  the strongest in 30 years  Demand growth in China may double next year as they fill their strategic reserves and stimulus give oil demand a boost  And all of that manufacturing that China wants to get rid of  will be picked up in India and Vietnam and other Asian countries  European demand should also rebound 
While there is no doubt that today the oil glut seems insurmountable  history shows us that a new year brings new hope and after back to back down years  higher prices

193575,415091,CVX,Challenges Ahead For Chevron And Exxon Mobil,opinion,"About 14 months back  no one would have ever thought that the oil price would plummet as it did during the same period  In fact  even the oil firms  Chevron Corporation  NYSE N CVX  and Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE N XOM   would not have thought that the worldwide oil will drop down to below  50 per barrel a year ago  One of the reasons for oil to cross even the  100 mark or  125 mark was the absence of a strong catalyst to invest in any financial instruments that will provide decent returns  That was because of the impact of the financial turmoil apart from the lower interest rates  Now  that the stock market has been providing steady returns  oil prices returning to even  50 would become a big factor to boost the sentiments on oil stocks  Also  there are bleak chances of oil staging a strong recovery in the immediate term throwing the plans of oil companies to the winds 
Drop In Production Fails To Have Impact
There is nothing about Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  and Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  s business performances to blame for their troubles  As leaders  they have been taking every step that is possible to face the challenges ahead of them  The sharp drop in worldwide oil price would result in steep fall in price realization per barrel  The global oil cartel tried to impress upon the Oil Producing Export Countries  OPEC  to slash the production of oil so as to enable oil price to stabilize  However  OPEC was not convinced and refused to cut production as they were not happy with the development of alternate fuels like Shale gas 
That left both Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  and Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  with little alternative but to slash oil production  For instance  Chevron s worldwide net oil and gas production slipped to 2 539 MBOED in the third quarter from 2 596 MBOED in the second quarter of the current year and from 2 568 MBOED in the last year  Not only these two firms  but others have also followed suit  The oil firms  move reflected in the drop in oil production in the United States in the recent months  However  the move failed to have an impact on the global oil price since crude continued to remain oversupplied  It was a common feature that tankers loaded with crude have lined up at ports throughout the world waiting to unload 
Oversupply Can Lead To A Worse Position
It is quite obvious that the current situation gives enough alarm bells for the oil companies  Both Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  and Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  are a worried about the possibilities of an oversupply of oil leading to a worse situation in the coming weeks  Energy brokerage  CEO  Al Levine  said that it was not an easy task to ignore the amount of oil around  While the Brent oil is around  44 or  45 level per barrel  oil prices were hovering around  42 in the NYMEX  The global supply of oil could rise further in the coming months once Iran enters the markets with its production of several hundred thousands of barrels a day crude oil  The country has already indicated its intention that it would boost its exports once the sanctions are removed 
These series of unfavorable developments to oil firms effectively seal any rally in the current year  If Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  and Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  manage to post profits  it was because of their size of operations and the focus on both downstream  as well as  upstream  However  they cannot escape from the challenges ahead of them though they have the wherewithal to manage them effectively  There are indications that developed economies have record high commercial stockpiles  That would be like a cushion to any shock in supply  Aside from that  some countries have tactical inventories to face any eventualities  These factors meant that there are no chances of demand picking up in the near term 
Jet Fuel and Gasoline Consumption To Gain
Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  and Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  could derive some solace from the comments made by the International Energy Agency  The agency sees international demand growth to reach a five year high in the current year  That was primarily because of the gains witnessed in gasoline and jet fuel consumption  The drop in oil price has made people take the flight route resulting in improved demand from the airline firms  However  that was not enough to offset the overall weakness witnessed in other space 
Aside from these  the weather also plays its part in dictating the oil and gas prices  The mild start to winter in the Europe  as well as  the United States has resulted in a subdued demand for heating oil  which is an important factor to drive the oil demand at this time around  It was quite possible that Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  and Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  would have expected these unfavorable conditions to impact the demand  However  they might be worried over the prolonged moderate temperatures  That was because it would only boost the stockpiles of heating oil and other distillates thus impacting on refinery margins besides a drop in crude oil demand 
Analysts Comments
Goldman Sachs Group Inc has already issued warnings that distillates storage tanks reaching its capacity would only hurt the oil price  That further drives down the global oil price to  20 per barrel  That would be the biggest worry for Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  and Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  to encounter in the days to come  Another brokerage  JPMorgan Chase   Co  said that oil markets would remain weak in the near term as warm weather adds to the woes  The financial firm reduced its oil price futures target to  44 a barrel 
If the global oil price needs to cross the  50 per barrel mark  then the weather and OPEC should act as catalysts  Currently  indications are that America will witness warmer than normal temperatures  OPEC is unlikely to change its stance  Therefore  the prolonged spell of oil price remaining weak is seen 
Conclusion
It is a known fact that both Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  and Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  are well managed companies  Therefore  they could manage the situation arising out of the long spell of weak oil price  While it is tough to suggest any price target for the two stocks  investors can only take short term calls based on the global oil price movement  Also  dividend investors  can expect the stock to provide better yields

193576,415092,CVX,Mega Caps Driving Market Returns  Growth Outperforming Value Stocks,opinion,"One aspect of the market recovery since the August September lows has been the narrow market breadth  The Russell 1000 Index return has been held up by the large mega cap stocks within the index  This has been the case for the S P 500 Index as well  As the below chart shows  the yellow line representing the year to date return for the Guggenheim Russell Top 50 Index  N XLG  has outpaced both the iShares Russell 1000 Index  N IWB  return and the Guggenheim S P 500 Equal Weight Index  N RSP  return 

The other phenomenon occurring this year is the wide disparity in performance of growth and value stocks  The below chart shows growth stocks within the S P 500 Index are outperforming the value stocks within the index by nearly ten percentage points 
The value index is being weighed down by several of its top weighted sectors like energy and industrials  Additionally  both Exxon Mobil  N XOM  and Chevron  N CVX are represented in the top 10 holdings in the iShares S P 500 Value Index  N IVE  and energy broadly has been one of the weakest market sectors 

It seems one can not give away some of the industrial and energy companies 
Recent headwinds of a strong US dollar and low energy prices have negatively impacted many industrial and energy stocks  With the Fed seemingly near liftoff for interest rates  further dollar strength is likely and will continue to pressure multinational companies like industrial and energy firms 
A silver lining is the fact that year  over year comparisons for energy prices and the dollar begin to get easier starting in the first quarter of 2016  This would put less negative pressure on earnings growth for some of these companies through 2016  all else being equal ",2015-12-06,Blog of HORAN Capital Advisors,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mega-cap-stocks-driving-market-returns-374594,374594

Strong US Q3 GDP numbers and Case Shiller House Prices served to push the WIRP bond market probability of a December Fed rate hike up to 74   Despite this  the US dollar has been seeing a pullback  During the Asian session almost all Asia Pacific currencies have gained during the session with the Malaysian ringgit  Korean won and Taiwanese dollar seeing the strongest performances

China
Nervousness around China s forthcoming PMI releases was heightened today with the release with the little known Minxin PMI pointing to a decline in November from October  Were this result to be borne out in the Caixin and NBS PMIs next week  it could have a major repercussions in global equity and commodity markets as concerns that Chinese has not done enough to ease its slowdown continue to mount 
However  the key growth engine of the  New Normal  Chinese economy   consumption   was given a boost today as the Westpac MNI consumer sentiment indicator bounced back in November  While China s secondary sector continues to slow  a collapse in consumption or tertiary sector growth would really start to ring warning bells about a potential financial crisis 

Japan

The Bank of Japan  BoJ  minutes further underlined the BoJ s reluctance to further extend their QQE monetary easing policy  BoJ members were keen to emphasise positives around the economy  while little notice was paid to the fact that Japan entered a technical recession in Q3  Japanese services PPI held steady at 0 5  year on year expansion 
Australia
Australia Q3 construction activity came in below expectations for 2  quarter on quarter  QoQ  decline  falling 3 6   This partly looks to have been driven by a drop back in Western Australia activity after the installation of Chevron s  N CVX  37 000 tonne gas processing platform  Despite the poor number  the different accounting methodologies between the construction activity quarterly index and Australia s GDP means this number is unlikely to materially alter expectations for Australian Q3 GDP due out next week

193599,415115,CVX,Chevron Has Long Fall  With 50  Retracement,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Chevron  N CVX  had a long fall from a high over 128 in July 2014  losing nearly half of its value to the low at 69 59 in August  The last drop began in April from about 112  That has now seen a 50  retracement and consolidation for nearly a month 
The price action since April has exhibited a bearish Bat harmonic as well with a Potential Reversal Zone  PRZ  above at 107  This is very close to the Measured Move out of the current consolidation should it break to the upside  Momentum indicators are mixed with the RSI bullish and rising while the MACD is in a slight decline but kind of flat  The Bollinger Bands  are squeezing hard  often a precursor to a move 
There is resistance above at 91 85 and 95 85 followed by 98 90 and 101 before 104 and 107  Support lower comes at 87 25 and 83 20 followed by 80 70 and 74 70  Short interest is low under 2   The company is not expected to report earnings again until January 30th 2016 
Checking the options chains shows that this week there is large open interest at the 87 Strike below on the Put side and the 93 Strike above on the Call side  Further out in the November monthly options  the 89 5 and 90 Strike have very large open interest on the Put side and the Call side is doubly large at 90 and then double again at 95 
Chevron  Ticker  CVX
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 92 with a stop at 88  A straight stock trade 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock with a November 90 85 Put Spread and sell the December 95 Calls  45 cents for the collar   Adding a collar to the stock to protect the downside and allow some upside room 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the January 90 November 92 5 Call Diagonal   2 80   A longer term options strategy  buying the January option and selling November  The plan would be to sell December as the November expire 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the January 90 November 92 5 Call Diagonal and sell the November 85 Put   2 10   Adds leverage to the diagonal above and another leg to the plan  As the November Puts expire sell longer puts as well 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into November sees the equity markets have regained a lot of ground lost over the summer but remain mixed 
Elsewhere look for gold to move lower while crude oil consolidates with an upward bias  The US Dollar Index is biased to the upside in consolidation while US Treasuries look to mark time sideways  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue consolidation around 3400 with an upward bias while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain subdued  keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETFs N SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  Their charts are mixed though  The QQQ remains the strongest and within a day s move to new all time highs  while the SPY seems extended and may need to consolidate or pullback first  The IWM continues to lag and is mired in consolidation  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

193600,415116,CVX,Want Oil Patch Value  Sell Shell And Get These 3 Stocks Instead,opinion,"There are 3 quality energy companies I want to buy yet I don t want to add to our overall energy exposure  Coincidentally  Shell  N RDSb  has made some recent decisions I believe to be foolish  What to do  Bite the bullet  Sell the one making mistakes  and buy others that are down the same amount   but have considerably more favorable prospects  Impact to the portfolio  None today  But if these 3 do better than RDS B  very favorable for tomorrow 
Shell s economic mistakes of paying top dollar for BG and insisting on continuing to pursue the high cost deepwater drilling in the Arctic  just ended  and spending  2 billion on heavy oil in Amberta only to shut it down  show a management that has lost its way in search of The Big Score  We aren t  big score  portfolio managers  We are slow and steady advisors that like to see incremental gains during bull markets but buy big when we see serious value  typically after a market or individual stock decline  Shell started out just fine but they are no longer thinking protection and steady growth 
With these recent mis steps and a return on invested capital that has recently declined to 7 3   I believe that Shell s marvelous 7 5  dividend is now in jeopardy  We will sell our RDS B but retain exposure to the oil and gas industry by buying firms that are even cheaper in price per revenues and earnings  Because  in 2 of the 3 cases  they have a lower profile to most investors  they are actually down a greater percentage than Shell  All enjoy the same or better credit quality 
We will anchor this trio with Chevron  N CVX   Unlike Shell  Chevron continues to be a company that moves slowly and inexorably toward better returns  Almost alone among the major international energy firms  CVX did not rush into Iraq  Burma  Russia et al during the boom times for oil and gas  The company picks its geopolitical partners well  perhaps because it was burned once in Ecuador it is now twice shy   Like us  Chevron chooses steady returns over Big Scores  which often aren t   This is reflected in its return on capital  which is among the highest in the energy sector 
Also like us  CVX takes the long view  Its new production  particularly from the Gulf of Mexico and western Australia will provide a growth engine for Chevron for years to come  In fact  two liquefied natural gas  LNG  projects in Australia  Gorgon and Wheatstone  will be the primary drivers of Chevron s international growth in the coming years  These two projects will marry CVX s massive natural gas finds offshore Australia with the insatiable demand for LNG in Japan and other Pacific rim nations  lessening their dependence on Russian or Middle Eastern oil and gas  LNG  with both a high  and a long plateau production profile  and little capital expenditure  will provide significant cash flow to support reinvestment or increased shareholder returns 
We ll also place in this troika two less well known firms  both on the NYSE  that have fallen considerably more than Shell  giving us the opportunity for an even greater rebound when oil and gas firms spring to life again   P S  No matter what the prevailing opinion  we don t know if that day will come in 2016  the current consensus  or tomorrow  if terrorists take production offline in one of the top producer nations  That s why we buy at least some positions today  
The first of these is Range Resources  N RRC   The biggest risk I see to Range is the Pennsylvania legal and regulatory environment  Pennsylvania has had declining manufacturing revenues for years and is currently facing an underfunded pension plan crisis  By fortuitous happenstance  however  it was discovered a few years back to rest above what may be the most valuable of all the shale oil and gas formations in the country  Rather than say  Thank you  Mother Nature  for this windfall and the high paying jobs it creates  local regulators have slow rolled many projects and local governments have banned drilling outright 
They ll catch on   or be forced from office  In my opinion  Range has the best position of any energy company in the Marcellus and other smaller formations in PA 
As fracturing and drilling become more sophisticated  I believe these local objections will wither as they realize the safety of these operations is high  the jobs created are a windfall  and the returns will allow them to bail themselves out of their pension difficulties  Plus  Range has the highest number of the lowest cost  multi year leases of any major firm in the Marcellus shale region  With drilling inventory lasting at least through the year 2035  Range has large blocked together acreage with low royalty  operating  and development costs  Range will be in the catbird seat as oil and gas prices recover 
Antero Resources  N AR  is also a big player in the Marcellus formation  including that portion which sits under West Virginia  as well as in the Utica formation in eastern Ohio  Just as CVX has positioned itself for LNG sales to the Pacific rim from its facilities in Oz  the major players in the Utica and Marcellus stand to benefit in coming years from LNG deliveries to Europe  Europeans currently get most of their natural gas from Russia  If you are a German or Latvian or Bulgarian shivering in the winter  who would you rather depend upon for a dependable supply without geopolitical demands attached  US companies or the bullying and capricious Russian government 
Production costs are quite low for Antero  In fact  Morningstar estimates that AR s natgas production is still quite profitable at  2 50 per mcf  and break even at the current pre winter spot price  As we approach winter in the upper Midwest and Northeast  of course  that price typically rises  I think it is likely to do so this winter  in particular  with so little new drilling and so many operations shut in  Antero will benefit  In times of pricing pressure  the lowest cost producers always benefit  I believe the quality of Antero s assets  coupled with management that holds a slow and steady hand in production as well as new exploration  assures them of continued success 
Please note  My expectations for increased revenue  earnings and stock price are not based on higher oil and gas prices  but upon the lower costs I see as shale  exploration  and transport technologies reduce expenses

193608,415124,CVX,Is BP A Bargain After The  20 8 Billion Settlement ,opinion,"Early this week  the Obama Administration announced that it had finalized the terms of its settlement with BP  L BP \ stemming from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill  The final price tag will come in at  20 8 billion  which was higher than the  18 7 billion announced as recently as July  Nevertheless  this removes a major source of open ended uncertainty for BP  Though it s been a long road to get here  long suffering BP investors should be relieved that the ordeal is finally over 
I should probably put  over  in quotation marks because there may still be some private claims from individuals and companies that could pop up  But the biggest potential liability   the federal  state and local government lawsuit against BP for its violations of the Clean Water Act and other environmental regulations  is now over and done with  Any new claims to come along should be minor 
So  with the financial fallout now behind the company  what does this mean for BP and  the question that every investor wants to know  the BP dividend 
Let s dig into the details 
BP currently yields a fat 7 0   the highest among oil majors  And despite the barrage of legal setbacks   not to mention the plummeting price of crude oil over the past year   BP has continued to raise its dividend  Last year  BP raised its quarterly payout from  0 585 to  0 60  And BP has hiked its dividend by a cumulative 45  since reinstating it 
The BP dividend currently costs the company about  6 9 billion per year  That s considerable higher than the  4 5 billion in free cash flow that BP has generated over the trailing 12 months   Free cash flow is operating cash flows minus capital expenditures   So as things stand now  BP has more cash going out the door in the form of dividends than it is taking in from current operations  That doesn t give much confidence that the dividend is safe 
But it also ignores BP s massive cash hoard  BP had  32 billion in cash and marketable securities as of the most recent quarter  and has a high credit rating that allows for additional borrowing  So  BP has plenty of cash on hand to pay the dividend at current levels for the foreseeable future 
Does the  20 8 billion settlement change this calculus 
Not really  To start  the damages are to be paid out over the next 15 18 years  So while the settlement represents a cash drain of a good billion or two per year for a long time to come  we re not talking about a debilitating expense  It s just a cost of continuing to do business in America 
Furthermore  BP knew this day was coming  and has already prepared for it  Through July of this year  BP had already taken  54 6 billion in pre tax charges related to the spill  That s an amount roughly equal to its gross profit for all of 2013  before the slide in the price of crude oil started   If we want to make lemonade out of lemons  it also represents an asset in the form of tax write offs  According to Forbes estimates   15 3 billion of the  20 8 billion owed to the federal  state  and local governments is fully tax deductible  And BP has already taken  32 billion in tax deductions related to the cleanup of the oil spill itself 
The damages to be paid are a real cash expense  not a phantom expense like depreciation  so they won t necessarily free up cash flow for the BP dividend  But think about how much worse this situation would have been for BP had the tax deductions been disallowed 
Finally  let s look at valuation 

Looking at the price sales ratio  BP trades at a massive discount to its Big Oil peers ExxonMobil  N XOM  and Chevron  N CVX   But prior to the 2010 disaster  this wasn t the case  With Deepwater Horizon drifting further and further into the past  this gulf should gradually narrow  It may never fully close  but it doesn t necessarily have to  BP doesn t have to rival Exxon in order to be a fantastic investment at current prices 
There is a lot of pessimism built into BP stock s price right now  That s a good thing  With the overall market still looking very pricey  a 7  yielder would seem like an attractive bet

193609,415125,CVX,The End Of The Oil Major  ,opinion,"A new report finds that the largest oil companies are set to cut spending on exploration by at least half  potentially leading to very few new oil discoveries in the years ahead 
The report from investment bank Tudor  Pickering  Hold   Co   and reported by Fuel Fix  estimates that exploration budgets among the oil majors will drop to  25 billion in 2016  down from  50 billion from just a few years ago  Obviously  low oil prices are taking their toll  forcing deep spending cuts in a desperate attempt to shore up profitability  But the cuts have large implications for the energy sector  increasing the chances that some large oil fields remain undeveloped for years 
 Many  exploration and production  companies are virtually abandoning exploration altogether  especially in the U S    the report concluded 
Several once promising frontiers for exploration have failed to attract the oil majors  Mexico s two auctions this year for acreage in the Gulf of Mexico have largely disappointed  An auction held by the U S  government earlier this year for Gulf of Mexico holdings in American waters also saw scant interest from the industry  the worst showing for the region in three decades  And last week  Brazil held an auction for some offshore blocks in the Atlantic Ocean  once a highly sought after region  and the results were an utter   Despite the fact that Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa   Total  N TSS   Statoil  N STO   ExxonMobil  N XOM   and BP  L BP  were all registered for Brazil s auction  none submitted bids 
Shell also withdrew from the Arctic in late September  another area that the industry had believed would be a huge source of new supply  Shell decided to   potentially killing off Arctic oil for decades 
Cuts to spending make sense in the short run  but they also set up the oil industry for stagnant production in the years ahead  Once the backlog of projects currently under development begins to clear  there will be very few  if any  major sources of new supply to replace them  The Gulf of Mexico  the Arctic  and offshore Brazil   that is to say  deepwater projects   take years to develop  Not drilling now means oil won t be coming online in 2020 or 2025 
Add to that the natural decline of existing oil fields  which will cut into supplies on an ongoing basis  depleting production by an average of around  say  5 percent per year  with wildly different decline rates depending on where the oil is being extracted   Despite the seemingly unending glut in supplies  the markets could tighten pretty significantly in the years ahead 
The current market turmoil has created a once in a generation opportunity for savvy energy investors  Whilst the mainstream media prints scare stories of oil prices falling through the floor smart investors are setting up their next winning oil plays 
There is an argument that says that shale resources  so abundant around the world  could provide enough new sources of supply for a very long time  As soon as oil prices rise  new shale projects will come online   than the conventional fields of the past 
But even if that is true   and the extent of shale potential over the long term is up for debate   it is not necessarily good news for the oil majors themselves  The largest companies  such as ExxonMobil  Shell  Chevron  N CVX   or BP  N BP   thrive in areas that are difficult for smaller companies  such as deep offshore  Shale production  on the other hand  can be done by hundreds of smaller drillers 
The oil majors have had mixed experiences with North American shale  Shell had to write down some of its shale assets in the U S   after spending  24 billion on a bet that failed to pay off  with company executives regretting ever having made the investment  ExxonMobil was late to the shale gas party  overpaying for XTO Energy when it bought the company for  41 billion in 2010  And the experiences in shale basins outside of North America  Poland  for example  have also disappointed 
In short  the prospects for the oil majors are uncertain  Megaprojects are no longer in fashion  with costs that are unjustifiable  Shale projects  with shorter time horizons and lower upfront costs  are not the exclusive purview of the oil major  Deep offshore  where these companies have traditionally excelled  appears to be too expensive at this point 
How the oil majors pivot going forward is unclear  Meanwhile  low oil prices are putting significant pressure on these companies  potentially threatening their coveted dividend policies  Slashing dividends  which could become unavoidable if oil prices remain low  will tarnish the oil majors  reputation with Wall Street  There are few good options right now ",2015-10-22,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-end-of-the-oil-major-268867,268867
193610,415126,CVX,Make Oil s Pain Your Gain,opinion,"Following a 37  decline this summer  crude oil has shown signs of recovery 
Since August 24  crude has rallied 19  on declining global rig counts  Many investors believe we ve seen the bottom  and they re loading up on energy stocks 
Not so fast 
Crude inventories are approaching maximum capacity  and the International Monetary Fund just downgraded its 2016 outlook on global growth 
We re certainly closer to oil s bottom than its top  but a large number of oil companies are overbought on weak fundamentals 
Don t Fall for the False Signal
The Energy Select Sector SPDR  N XLE    the exchange traded fund that tracks the average movement of the S P 500 Energy Index   has lagged the S P 500 for most of the year 
But over the last month  XLE has outperformed the S P 500 by more than double  as you can see in the following chart 

This outperformance can be attributed to several factors 
First  global rig utilization is down 71  year over year  and production declines have elevated the price of crude oil  Eyeing a bottom  many investors have taken long energy positions 
The resulting rally has forced a large number of hedge funds to close out massive short positions to cover losses  This is known in the financial markets as a short squeeze 
But oil demand has declined even faster than production 
According to a U S  Energy Information Administration report released on Wednesday  crude inventories rose by 8 million barrels  Analysts  on the other hand  expected an increase of just 3 9 million barrels  according to Reuters 
In short  oil s momentum is topping out  and now it s time to get short 
The Short Before the Storm
It s too early to call the bottom  but there s little doubt that the short term rally in oil stocks is unsustainable 
Plus  the long term downtrend in oil stocks has yet to be broken 
A closer look at the XLE s constituents reveals Chevron Corp   N CVX  as the biggest gainer   as well as the most likely to fall in the near term  based on the company s relative strength index  RSI  
Chevron s RSI just crossed below the overbought threshold of 70 from a high of 72 last week  And the stock has met resistance at a 12 year support line   another bearish indicator 

Fundamentally  the company is trading at 25 times earnings   a 41  premium to both its peers and the S P 500 
This makes Chevron a juicy short term target for short sellers 
While volatility remains low  options are also a cheap and viable play on shares  Bearish speculators might consider near dated out of money put options to accelerate returns 
Bottom line  oil stocks will recover sooner than later  but not before another big spill  Profit on their downside before you get long

193623,415139,CVX,The Mirage Of An Iranian Oil Bonanza,opinion,"The P5 1 agreement with Iran on Iran s nuclear program has generated  sometimes fevered  anticipation of an Iranian oil bonanza at the end of the nuclear agreement rainbow  both in terms of the increase in Iranian crude output and the business opportunities for foreign firms in driving the increase 
The anticipation comes from several sources  Iran s crude potential is one  According to the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   Iran s proven crude reserves  158 billion barrels  are the world s fourth largest  and among the cheapest to produce at  8 to  17 barrel   on the     Iranian public statements expressing determination to increase crude output significantly are another  to 5 7 mmbl day  according to Mehdi Hosseini  chairman of Iran s oil contracts restructuring committee   The third is the value of potential contracts for foreign suppliers  Hossein Zamaninia  Iran s deputy oil minister for commerce and international affairs  indicated the government hoped to conclude nearly 50 oil and gas projects worth  by 2020 
Projected Output and Exports to 2020
Projecting from International Energy Agency  IEA  data  Iran is on track to produce an average  2 85 mmbl day of crude in 2015  The IEA puts Iran s current sustainable capacity at 3 6 mmbl day  defined as a level achievable in 90 days and sustainable for an extended period   This is roughly comparable to Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh s assertion Iran could increase output 500 000 barrels per day within a few months after international sanctions on Iran s economy are lifted and another 500 000 barrels per day in the following months  
The IEA estimates Iran could  push capacity back up to 4 mmbl d mark towards by the end of the decade   a level which it says Iran last reached in 2008   For discussion purposes  the table below offers a scenario to arrive at output of 4 mmbl day by 2020  It also shows projected revenue  assuming constant  55 barrel price   12 50 barrel production cost  and constant exports at 91 000 barrels per day  Base case   constant  55 price   12 50 barrel production cost  and increasing exports  Case 1   and  5 annual increase in price   12 50 barrel production cost  and increasing exports  Case 2  

Sources and Amount of Necessary Foreign Investment
The IEA believes 4 mmbl day is attainable  with the help of foreign cash and cutting edge technology   Saeed Ghavampour  the oil ministry s general manager of strategic planning  puts the total investment needed in the Iranian energy industry through 2020 at  100 billion to  500 billion through 2020 
How much foreign investment is necessary to maintain current output and to add the 1 15 mmbl day incremental capacity necessary to reach 4 mmbl day  Assuming Zamaninia s  185 billion is the minimum investment the Iranian oil industry requires over the next five years  and the maximum is  300 billion half the difference between Ghavampour s high and low estimate Iran would need to invest between  35 billion to  60 billion annually 
Iran won t be able to finance this on its own  It has three  internal  sources of investment frozen Iranian funds in foreign accounts  government budget resources  oil revenues flow to the Iranian government  a portion of which the government returns to the industry   and oil in storage   Iranian banks evidently    Rough conjectures of the investment Iran could generate from these three sources in current low price environment are as follows 
  Perhaps  2  4 billion annually through 2020 from  in foreign accounts  Some estimates put the total at  100 billion  or  20 billion annually   U S  Treasury Secretary Lew  in testimony before Congress  put the available funds at  50 billion   10 billion annually   Since Iran s oil industry is only one of many claimants on the frozen funds  including the natural gas industry  the Iranian military  Iran s proxy clients in Lebanon  the Gaza Strip  Syria  Iraq  and Yemen  the commercial aviation industry  replacing the passenger jet fleet   other industries  and the Iranian people  maybe it will receive 20 percent of the frozen funds  or between  2 and  4 billion annually 
  For the sake of argument   10 billion annually through 2020 from government budget resources  which is very generous given the share of crude export revenues this level of support would consume  see last row of above table   the demands from other Iranian claimants  and Zanganeh s data  investment fell from an average  20 annually in 2011 and 2012  when the OPEC basket crude averaged  107 46 and  109 45 per barrel respectively  to  6 billion in 2014  when it averaged  96 29  and virtually nothing this year  when it averaged  53 97 through August  
  Perhaps  1  1 5 billion as a one time contribution from oil currently in storage  Estimates of this amount vary from less than 10 million barrels to over 30 million barrels  Assuming an OPEC basket price of  54 barrel  production costs of  8  17 barrel  and 35 million barrels in storage  Iran would net between  1 3 billion  or  260 million annually  if sold in equal tranches over five years  and  1 6 billion  or  320 million annually  

Even doubling the maximum and minimum domestic annual contribution to  28 58 billion or  24 58 billion respectively  Iran would still need substantial foreign investment   31 42 and  12 42 respectively  
Investment Case for Investment in Iranian Oil Industry
Their size  their long life  and their relatively low production cost make Iran s crude resources attractive 
A number of factors take the gloss off investing in these resources  however  The UN and U S  economic sanctions on Iran are one  in addition to observing UN sanctions  the U S  has enacted and observes its own  which are stricter and more extensive   Lifting both the international and U S  sanctions would require Iran to meet certain milestones and remain in compliance with the terms of the nuclear agreement  At least until U S  presidential and Congressional elections in November 2016  the U S  position on both sets of sanctions is subject to change  Domestic political dynamics may cause the U S  to back away from lifting sanctions  as could Iranian actions  such as aggression  directly or indirectly through proxies  against Israel  Saudi Arabia  and other U S  allies  Even if UN sanctions are lifted  foreign companies may not want to risk violating U S  sanctions 
The possibility of direct military conflict between Iran on the one hand and Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies on the other is another factor  The two sides are already essentially at war indirectly in Yemen  Iraq  Lebanon  and Syria  Moreover  just the threat of direct military conflict or an increase in regional tensions is enough to cause foreigners anxiety 
The deal structure the Iranians will offer foreign companies Hosseini described it as a  risk service contract  will increase rather than mitigate risk  Given their lack of capital  the Iranians will be asking foreigners to bear the upfront investment burden in return for payment  cash and or crude  in the  perhaps distant  future  Foreigners must take into account the possibility that negative changes in the internal and or external environment will damage the value of their investment 
Foreign investors cannot be confident Iran s internal political dynamics will be conducive to foreign investment  Not all influential Iranians or Iranian interest groups  for example  the powerful Revolutionary Guards  welcome the nuclear agreement and d tente with the United States and Europe  Should the balance of power tip in their favor or further in their favor foreign investments could face anything from unpleasant pressure to expropriation 
Moreover  absent a binding agreement within OPEC and between OPEC and Russia on production levels  Saudi and Gulf Arab production policies will threaten the value of foreign investment in the Iranian crude industry  Saudi Arabia s sustainable capacity is 2 5 mmbl day more than its average 10 01 mmbl daily output in 1H 2015  while the UAE has announced plans to increase output 600 000 barrels per day in the next few years  and Kuwait by 1 4 mmbl day by 2020 
Finally  Iran will have to compete with other countries for scarce oil investment funds 
Country and Company Potential
The situations of Individual countries and companies  summarized below  imply limited foreign investment in the Iranian industry in the current environment 
  China  Investing in Iran would reduce dependence on Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies and increase China s leverage in negotiations with these countries on price and volumes  However  China already has substantial financial commitments and exposure to Venezuela and its oil industry and to Russia and its energy industry  Its national oil companies  CNOOC Ltd  HK 0883   Petrochina SS  SS 601857   and Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Co Ltd  NYSE SHI  face    while Canadian regulators have ordered CNOOC s Nexen unit to  its oil sands pipelines  Any negotiations with Iran are likely to be protracted  using China s years  long negotiations with Russia natural gas pricing as a recent example   Also  China cannot risk alienating Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Arab countries on which China will remain highly dependent for crude supplies for the foreseeable future 
  Russia  Russian government finances are stretched  as are the finances of its energy majors  Gazprom  MCX GAZP   NOVATEK  MCX NVTK   and Rosneft  MCX ROSN   from low energy prices  a depreciating ruble  Chinese currency and stock market troubles  In any case  while Russia will finance Iran s purchase of Russian nuclear power plants  Russia is unlikely to invest substantial amounts in the Iranian oil industry  a major competitor for Asian market share 
  Western countries  If their companies develop proposals to invest in the Iranian energy industry  the UK and France might be willing to approve them  while the U S  and Canada are not likely to encourage such investment in a direct competitor for market share 
  Western oil majors  Even if their governments are willing to bless projects  Western oil majors Exxon  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX   Shell  NYSE RDSa   BP  NYSE BP   Total SA  NYSE TOT   ENI  NYSE E  are unlikely to make major commitments to Iran in the current environment  Exxon and BP are already exposed to substantial political risk with their investments in Iraq and Russia  Shell must fund its  70 billion acquisition of BG Group  LONDON BG   All are slashing investment budgets  Some  if not all  have committed to maintaining their dividends  and to maintain dividends and fund investment  some may have to borrow  It is likely their banks will be reluctant to lend significant amounts for projects in Iran  given the risks involved and tighter regulatory standards requiring bank reserves to match loan risks 
In Sum
While it is likely Iran will increase crude output once sanctions are lifted  it is possible that Iran will lack the domestic and foreign resources necessary to increase crude output to and over 4 mmbls day by 2020  Absent a thaw in its relations with Saudi Arabia  the Gulf Arab states  and the West  higher and more stable crude prices  and initial positive experience for foreign companies in negotiating and implementing projects  it is more likely foreign investment will trickle into the Iranian energy industry than gush into it ",2015-09-03,OilPrice.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-mirage-of-an-iranian-oil-bonanza-263880,263880

193625,415141,CVX,A Bear Is More Likely Than Not,opinion,"A Bear market from this Correction is more likely than not
Yield Curve suggests Bull has further to go
Breadth measures suggest Bull is exhausted
Triple top and Head   Shoulders pattern suggests breakout to the downside
4 Factor Technical indicator suggests Bear is around the corner
The stock market does stink right now 
How do I know  Well  stocks are in a correction and gyrating up and down by large percentages  with a massive trading and investment press opinion tug of war on whether we are OK to return to S P 500 price growth  or heading for a significant Bear market 
I also know because last Friday  Jim Cramer said   This market stinks   So there it is 
But let s look at some data instead of headlines and 30 second interviews  The evidence is split  but mounting on the side of more pain to come 
First  here is our table of market indicators that we have been updating for you over the last several weeks  It has some positive items  but a lot more negative items  and the negatives are a bit more negative than before  while the positives are about the same magnitude 

THE POSITIVE DATA 
The yield curve is still steep  more specifically the 10 year Treasury rate minus various shorter term Treasury rates is still positive  In prior letter to you  we have shown that virtually all recessions are preceded by the yield going flat and then inverting  the spread between the longer and shorter rates going to zero  and then the shorter rates rising above the longer rates    the New York Federal Reserve confirms that with their research 
Stock markets tend to go into Bears before recessions  and after  or coincidentally with  the yield curve going flat or inverted   The yield curve is still steep  and that is Bullish 
An argument could be made that in this artificially controlled interest rate market the yield spread is of little predictive value  Recognizing that  we are prepared to say the 3 mo 10 year spread may have no current meaning  However  the 2 year 10 year and the  5 yr 10 year is not Fed controlled  Fed influenced YES  but still in the domain of market forces  not just Fed decisions   so we think they have some predictive value 
The 2016 consensus earnings growth analyst forecast is nearly 10  higher than estimated 2015 operating earnings  That is good  but analysts tend to modify their estimate regularly and it s hard to know what they will think 3 months from now  or how energy earnings as a major wild card will change their estimates 
The Saint Louis Fed Financial Stress Index is on the low side of a     1 standard deviation   normal   level  That is positive  but the different parameters measured by the Cleveland Fed for their stress index are at the high side of normal 
Those are the good things in our regular data set that suggest the Bull will continue 
THE NEGATIVE DATA 
Breadth is down 
Cumulative net new highs are down
Cumulative net advancing issues are down
Cumulative net advancing volume is down
Equal weight indexes are underperforming market cap indexes 
Price chart conditions are negative 
Prices are below moving trend line  200 day  moving averages
Trend line leading edges are moving down
Retracement from Aug low to July high is low 
Near term earnings are down 
Reported GAAP earnings for trailing 4 quarters is lower than the 4 quarters before that
Operating earnings for 2015 over 2014 are down 
I am glad you asked  because there is more on the negative side 
Clearly  there are plenty of positive stock stories  and in the long term it is not a good idea to bet against American industry or the stock market 
However  in the shorter term  sometimes a year or two  earnings  valuations and stock prices can take a big hit  before resuming their historic rise 
Let s look at some immediate stock market behavior that is concerning  and tilting very close to an outright Bear call   not totally yet  but it certainly starts to smell that way 
We look at four technical factors that  taken together  did a great job of calling the market tops in 2000 and 2007 2008  while at the same time they did not suggest jumping in and out of the market over common bumps in the road 
They were not as effective in the period 1980 through 1993  however  so maybe they have had their day  On the other hand  what has worked recently is likely to work in the present 
We have written about those factors and provided back testing data from 1980 August 2015 on our blog  When those 4 factors confirmed each other in 2000 and 2007  they did so at the market tops 
We look at monthly data to see 
Whether the price is above or below the 12 month moving average  same length as the daily 200 day average 
Whether the leading edge of the 12 month average is tilted up or down versus the prior month
Whether the price is moving up at a reasonable pace  a time based indicator called the parabolic stop   reverse 
Whether the volume of trades is more at the upper end of daily price ranges or at the bottom end of daily price ranges  the money flow index  
The first two factors are necessary  but not sufficient  to trigger a major reversal alert   because alone they are prone to whipsaw 
The third and fourth factors measure different things than the first and second  and are necessary to confirm the alerts from the first and second to minimize whipsaw risk 
Here is a chart for the two most recent major market tops  our blog reviews all the trend reversals from 1980  

No method works all of the time  and this one has worked better since 1993 that before  but we think it still has utility 
You can see from this chart it did a great job at signaling reversals to the down side  It did a pretty good job on alerting reversals to the upside  but that is not our concern today  All eyes are on the lookout for a top  and one seems to be near 
Because the method is monthly  the data in the chart above is through August  and in three days we will have September 
In the meantime  let s try to peak around the corner by running the same data through a weekly filter  Weekly data is not as reliable at monthly data  and has lots of whipsaws  but that said  it forecasts a fully confirmed trend reversal come next Wednesday 

There is one more negative item  that deserves attention in this letter  It concerns a specific  actually two specific  chart patterns that are each typically indicative of a trend reversal 
One is called a Triple Top  and the other is called a Head   Shoulders Top  we have a detailed article about them on our blog   but here are the key points 
StockCharts com describes Triple Tops this way 
 The Triple Top Reversal is a bearish reversal pattern   There are three equal highs followed by a break below support  As major reversal patterns  these patterns usually form over a 3 to 6 month period 
Here is a recent example of a Triple Top in Chevron  NYSE CVX    just to show you in isolation what one looks like 

This is what StockCharts com says about Head   Shoulders patterns 
 A Head and Shoulders reversal pattern forms after an uptrend  and its completion marks a trend reversal  The pattern contains three successive peaks with the middle peak  head  being the highest and the two outside peaks  shoulders  being low and roughly equal  The reaction lows of each peak can be connected to form support  or a neckline    The head and shoulders pattern is one of the most common reversal formations  It is important to remember that it occurs after an uptrend and usually marks a major trend reversal when complete  
And here is what a Head   Shoulders looks like  in hypothetical form 

Well  we think we see both patterns in this noise cancelled 3 year daily Renko chart of the S P 500 

Once again  no chart analysis is perfect or consistently correct  but when you add all of the stuff above  including our major trend reversal indicator with this specific trend reversal chart pattern  it gets really hard to be warm to stocks at this time 
What you should know is that a major draw down has a high probability of occurring  based on the evidence presented here 
What you should do depends on 
when and if you will rely on your portfolio to support your lifestyle
whether you have near term capital expenditure commitments
how long you think you are willing and able to emotionally wait for a major market draw down to fully recover
how you would feel if you experienced a major draw down  even if you knew it would come back 
whether your money is in a tax deferred or exempt account  where there would be no tax cost for making changes vs a regular account where embedded gains might be taxed more than the market may take 
how you balance in your own mind the possibility of missing out on some capital appreciation if a Bear does not materialize versus the comfort that may come from getting out of the way
and other thing 
Most of you are either near retirement or currently living out of your portfolio  and most of you have limited ability to sleep well if another Bear comes along 
I don t believe in market timing  which I view as quite different from gauging major trend direction 
If it s raining or snowing with lots of wind  I am willing to be outside or on the road  but if there are public safety announcements of an approaching tornado or hurricane  I stay inside  off the road  and out of the weather  The same holds true  in my view  for investing 
Volatility comes and goes  Corrections come and go  It makes sense to stay fully invested for those  but for major trend reversals for those in or near retirement  without excess assets  and without an iron stomach  taking some money off the table makes sense to me  There will probably be attractive re entry points later 
With a few exceptions  most of you have 40  to 100  of your equity allocation in cash at this time  That was accomplished over a period or weeks or months  I personally have about 75  of my equity allocation in cash 
I could be wrong  but personally value the peace of mind and capital protection more than the opportunity cost if this is a whipsaw and I must re enter at a higher price 
How do you balance capital protection and peace of mind versus potential opportunity cost in this situation 
If you feel differently  let me know so I can adjust your allocations 
If you agree  look over your other assets you manage yourself  or that you have with other advisors  to see how they are positioned for a Bear 
I am tending to keep the assets I control for you heavily in cash for now 
Directly related funds are S P 500 funds such as  NYSE SPY    NYSE IVV    NYSE VOO  and VFINX   but if we have a bear market  virtually all US equity funds and individual stocks are likely to be sucked in the whirlpool of declining prices  Correlations approach 1 00 in the early stage of rapid decline in a Bear market ",2015-09-29,Richard Shaw,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-bear-is-now-more-likely-than-not-266454,266454
193633,415149,CVX,Iranian Oil Minister Talking Up A Big Return To The Oil Markets,opinion,"Once international sanctions on Iran are lifted  the country will be able to increase its production of crude oil to pre sanctions levels   by 500 000 barrels per day within a week  and by more than 1 million barrels per day within a month  Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh says 
 Some of the most effective sanctions  against Iran  with regards to the oil industry were those that targeted aspects such as sales  volumes  shipment  insurance and the transfer of money   the minister said the night of July 1 on Iranian state television   If those issues are resolved  Iran will regain the market share that it has lost which amounts to above 1 million barrels per day  
Zanganeh said Iran s government already has informed OPEC about its decision to regain its status as a major global oil exporter  which it enjoyed before the sanctions  and declared that Tehran needs  nobody s authorization to retrieve its rights  

Such an optimistic outlook is nothing new to Zanganeh  As recently as June he predicted that Iran could ramp up oil output by 1 million barrels per day within seven months of a lifting of sanctions  At the time  he said  that Iran could   where it stood in 2011  a year before the toughest sanctions were imposed 
The only difference today is that Zanganeh now believes that level can be reached in just one month  For all the minister s talk of a rosy energy future for his country  he apparently has believers among the world s most influential oil executives at companies that have been badly hurt by the low price of oil  whose value has plummeted by half from more than  110 per barrel in June 2014 

This has cut deeply into the earnings of energy companies around the world  As a result  many have ordered dramatic spending cuts  and now appear to be on layoff spree  with Royal Dutch Shell  LONDON RDSa  announcing the elimination of 6 500 jobs  the British utility Centrica  LONDON CNA  cutting 6 000 positions and Chevron Corp   NYSE CVX  cutting 1 500 jobs 
Such deep job cuts can only mean these companies see no quick respite from low oil prices  and several executives are on the record as saying so  They include Shell CEO Ben van Beurden as well as Bob Dudley  his opposite number at BP  LONDON BP   Dudley says he expects oil prices to stay  lower for longer  

There are at least two reasons the problem is expected to be so protracted  First  OPEC s decision to maintain production levels came at its semiannual meeting in Vienna in November  and was kept at that level at its next meeting in June  Second  Iran s determination to ramp up production once the sanctions are lifted  probably in early 2016  means that price relief may be at least a year away  maybe further 
Zanganeh said it was  unfair  to blame Iran for keeping oil prices low  He pointed to OPEC s decision not to cut output and the group s move to overproduce by at least 1 million barrels per day   The issue of oil prices is very complicated   he said   There is a strong political will  beyond Iran s borders  that does not want the prices to rise  
Instead of waging its price war with rival producers  Zanganeh said  OPEC should cut its own production in order to accommodate Iran s full return to the oil market ",2015-08-04,OilPrice.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/iranian-oil-minister-talking-up-a-big-return-to-the-oil-markets-260452,260452
193634,415150,CVX,A Look At The Energy Sector Impact On Dividend ETFs,opinion,"One of the most popular strategies at our firm is the Strategic Income Portfolio  which focuses on a multi asset approach to generate consistent income and overall low volatility  In order to accomplish those goals  we are continually scanning the ETF landscape to evaluate suitable equity income funds that meet our investment criteria  These ETFs typically consist of high quality stocks with above average dividend streams and low internal expenses 
While every index is slightly different  one theme that you often see repeated throughout the high dividend arena is an emphasis on big energy names  Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and or Chevron Corp  NYSE CVX  are commonly in the top 10 holdings of these diversified dividend portfolios  According to dividend com  XOM has a current dividend yield of 3 74   while CVX yields 5 00  
As a result of the energy sector woes over the last 12 months  I thought it prudent to look at the overall impact of these stocks on total return  In addition  it should be noted that ETFs with a fundamental or dividend weighting methodology may be increasing their energy exposure in the future to adjust for the higher yields these companies are now paying 
One example of a fund with an outsized allocation to energy stocks is the iShares Core High Dividend ETF  NYSE HDV   This ETF is based on the Morningstar Dividend Yield Focus Index  which selects 75 stocks based on their high dividend yields and financial history  HDV currently has  4 3 billion in total assets  a 30 day SEC yield of 3 90   and an expense ratio of 0 12  
The top holding in HDV is XOM  which makes up 8 3  of the total portfolio  Energy stocks as a whole are the second largest sector in HDV with a total weight of 18 45   Obviously this is going to result in these energy companies making a big impact on total return and overall yield 
On a year to date basis  HDV is down 1 50   while the broad based SPDR S P 500 ETF  ARCA SPY  has gained 2 63   This path of divergence really kicked into high gear over the last two months as the energy sector rolled over once again 

While this overweight exposure has certainly been a drag on HDV  it hasn t been a catastrophic event because of the counterbalancing effect of consumer staples and health care stocks 
Other well known dividend ETFs with a relatively healthy dose of energy exposure include 
Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF  NYSE VYM    11 90  energy
Schwab U S  Dividend Equity  NYSE SCHD    11 40  energy
WisdomTree Equity Income Fund  NYSE DHS    13 55  energy
First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund  NYSE FDL    10 62  energy
Investors that believe the carnage in the oil   gas space is due for a bounce may be more inclined to choose a dividend ETF with a higher weighting in this sector  Conversely  those that are less enthusiastic about the prospects for an imminent recovery may choose to underweight or avoid these funds altogether 
I continue to own VYM as a core equity income holding in my Strategic Income portfolio  Despite its flat performance so far this year  the diversified basket of over 430 dividend paying stocks offering attractive value characteristics and a dependable 30 day SEC yield of 3 26   In addition  the ultra low 0 10  expense ratio keeps overall portfolio fees to a minimum 
The Bottom Line
One of the most important exercises that individual investors can do is analyze the index construction of their ETF holdings  Take note of any sectors that your funds are overweight or underweight in order to gauge how they will react under different circumstances  That way you are prepared in the event that a significant divergence occurs and can make adjustments as necessary 
In addition  it s important to re evaluate the portfolio on a quarterly or semi annual basis  These funds undergo regular rebalancing and may shift their exposure based on the mandate of the index provider

193636,415152,CVX,What s The Low Price Of Oil Telling Us  ,opinion,"Market fundamentalists tell us that prices convey information  Yet  while our barbers and hairdressers might be able to give us an extended account of why their prices have changed in the last few years  commodities such as oil  which reached a  last week stand mute  To fill that silence  many people are only too eager to speak for oil  And  they have been speaking volumes  So much information in that one price 
First  as prices fell last year when OPEC refused to cut its oil production in the face of slowing world demand  the industry kept saying that  from American tight oil fields at around  80 a barrel and be profitable  Then  as prices fell further  the industry and its consultants  that while growth in tight oil production would slow  it would still be profitable for the vast majority of wells planned 
Petroleum geologist and consultant  is probably the best representative from the skeptical camp  For many years Berman has been pointing to the high cost of getting fracked oil out of the ground  And  those costs led to negative free cash flow for most tight oil operators for several years in a row that is  they spent considerably more cash than they took in  making up the balance with debt and stock issuance  Not surprisingly  the operators took that money and kept drilling as fast as they could 
It was a recipe for oversupply and a crash  one that is now threatening the solvency of many fracking dependent U S  oil companies 
As if to the rescue  the giant consulting firm Deloitte  when U S  futures prices hit  48 a barrel on February 4 a little prematurely it seems  Friday s price for September futures on the NYMEX closed at  42 50 
Not to worry  Two major international oil companies  Chevron  NYSE CVX  and Exxon  NYSE XOM    that  40 a barrel oil won t be a problem for them  One of the sources cited was Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson whose company has had trouble  for more than a decade at much higher average prices  In fact  oil majors have been  since early 2014 when oil prices were still hovering above  100 
It seemed as if the message that the price of oil was sending from about the middle of last year until just recently was going unheeded by American oil producers  U S  oil production kept rising despite dramatically falling prices  But when production growth finally stopped in June  there was hope that less supply would be weighing on prices  and  that the price would go higher 
The reasoning behind this call was that continuing economic growth worldwide would combine with stagnating growth in oil supplies to squeeze the market enough to move prices up 
While low oil prices were supposed to  according the the International Monetary Fund   magazine took a more measured view  It also looked at the decline in employment and investment in oil which had previously been booming 
High cost oil from the Canadian tar sands is also taking  as investment is slashed in the face of low prices 
With the recent renewed slump in oil prices  the industry is trotting out the same kind of stories it trotted out when oil was around  80 and then  60  Oil at  will be no problem for a special breed of drillers in the Bakken Formation of North Dakota  we are told  If you actually read the story  it is stating the obvious  that break even prices vary from well to well  And  the writer refers to  realized  prices  not the NYMEX futures price  It turns out that because Bakken lacks pipelines for transporting oil  it must use oil trains  That s expensive 
So  those buying oil from North Dakota take the freight costs into account  The average realized price on Friday  for the type of oil extracted from Bakken s deep shales in North Dakota  While wells that are already drilled often produce regardless of price because those who operate them must pay back debt  it is doubtful that very many new wells would be profitable at this price  And  it is worth noting  those investing their capital do not as a rule seek to break even  A break even proposition usually sends them looking elsewhere to invest their money 
Beyond this  there is a broader consideration  And  it is something which very few people seem to be talking about when it comes to all the information that is supposed to be conveyed by the oil price 
As the world s central energy commodity  oil is a good indicator of economic activity  With the nearly universal conviction that the previous bounce in oil prices  to around  60  signaled a stronger economy and thus stronger oil demand  logic would dictate that we now consider the opposite  that the new slide in oil prices is signaling new weakness in the world economy  If so  it s the kind that ought to frighten even the optimists this time 
Having said all this  it might be wise to take any day s price reports in the same way as the low or high temperatures on a particular day  A cool morning in summer does not mean winter is right around the corner  Nor does a hot day in mid winter spell the end of the season  What s more important is to look at the overall picture to see if the season is changing or even more important  if the climate itself has shifted  both literally and metaphorically 
That takes a lot more analysis than the daily market reports can provide and than most people even those whose job it is to follow markets have patience for 
In that regard the long view suggests that the acute investment slump in oil which is unfolding will lead to tight supplies in a few years  because of all the wells that are not going to be drilled to replace the depletion from existing wells   That would set us up for a price spike at some point as it takes a considerable amount of time to ramp up new drilling after a long period of decline 
All this assumes that the current  seeming weakness in the economy doesn t morph into something that would cause a long term economic decline or stagnation which would keep oil prices low for a much longer period ",2015-08-17,Kurt Cobb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-is-the-price-of-oil-telling-us-261796,261796

193650,415166,CVX,11 Red Flag Events That Happened As We Enter The Pivotal Month ,opinion,"Are you ready for what is coming in August  All over America  economic  political and social tensions are building  and the next 30 days could turn out to be pivotal  In July  we saw things start to turn  As you will read about below  a major six year trendline for the S P 500 was finally broken this month  Chinese stocks crashed  commodities crashed  and debt problems started erupting all over the planet  I fully expect that this next month  August  will be a month of transition as we enter an extremely chaotic time in the fall and winter  Things are unfolding in textbook fashion for another major global financial crisis in the months ahead  and yet most people refuse to see what is happening  In their blind optimism  they want to believe that things will somehow be different this time  Well  the coming months will definitely reveal who was right and who was wrong  The following are 11 red flag events that just happened as we enter the pivotal month of August 2015 
 1 Puerto Rico is going to default on a 58 million dollar debt payment that is due on Saturday  Even though this has serious implications for the U S  financial system  Barack Obama has said that there will be no bailout for  America s Greece  
 2 As James Bailey has pointed out  the most important trendline for the S P 500 has finally been broken after holding up for six years  This is a critical technical signal that will likely motivate a significant number of investors to sell off their holdings in the weeks ahead 
 3 The IMF is indicating that it will not take part in the new Greek debt deal  As a result  the whole thing may completely fall apart 

Leaked minutes of the fund s latest board meeting  which took place on Wednesday  showed staff  cannot reach agreement at this stage  on whether to take part in the new  86bn   60bn  bailout for Greece  The document said there were doubts over the capacity of the Athens Government to implement economic reforms  as well as the over the sustainability of the country s sovereign debt pile  which is now projected to hit 200 percent of GDP 
The German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  only sanctioned a new Greek deal earlier this month on the condition that the IMF takes part 

 4 Italy is going down the exact same path as Greece  but Italy is going to be a much larger problem for Europe because it has a far  far larger economy  This week  we learned that youth unemployment in Italy has reached a 38 year high of 44 percent  and Italy s debt to GDP ratio has now hit 135 percent 
 5 The Canadian economy has officially entered a new recession  This is something that was not supposed to happen 
 6 The price of oil plummeted close to 20 percent during the month of July  It was the worst month for the price of oil that we have seen since October 2008  which just happened to be during the height of the last financial crisis 
 7 Commodities just had their worst month in almost four years  As I have written about previously  we witnessed a collapse in commodity prices just before the stock market crash of 2008 too 
 8 Thanks to Barack Obama  the U S  coal industry is imploding  and some of the largest coal producers in the entire country have just announced that they are declaring bankruptcy 

On Thursday  Bloomberg reported that the biggest American producer of coking coal  Alpha Natural Resources  NYSE ANR   could file for bankruptcy as soon as Monday 
Competitor Walter Energy  NYSE WLT  filed for bankruptcy earlier this month  and several others have done the same this year 

 9 For the month of July  the Shanghai Composite Index was down 13 4 percent  Despite unprecedented government intervention to prop up the market  it was the worst month for Chinese stocks since October 2009 
 10 A major red flag that a recession in the United States is fast approaching is the fact that Exxon  NYSE XOM  Mobile just announced their worst earnings for a single quarter since 2009  Compared to the same time period one year ago  Exxon Mobile s earnings were down 51 percent 
 11 Chevron  NYSE CVX  is another oil giant that has seen earnings plunge  In the second quarter of this year  Chevron s earnings were down an eye popping 90 percent from a year ago 
And in this list I didn t even mention the economic chaos that is happening down in South America  For full coverage of that  please see my previous article entitled  South American Financial Crisis Of 2015  
To a certain extent  I can understand why most Americans are not alarmed about the months ahead  The relative stability of the past several years has lulled most of us into a false sense of security  and the mainstream media is assuring everyone that everything is going to be just fine and that brighter days are ahead  At this point  many believe that it is patently absurd to suggest that we could see an economic collapse in 2015  But of course even though the signs were glaringly apparent  very few of us anticipated the financial crisis of 2008 either 
A few weeks ago  I authored a piece entitled  The Last Days Of  Normal Life  In America   and I stand by every single word of that article  I truly believe that the era of debt fueled prosperity that we have been enjoying for so long is coming to an end  and our standard of living will never again get back to this level 
Just yesterday  I had the chance to go over and stock up on some emergency supplies at a dollar store  It always astounds me what you can still buy for a dollar  The combined cost of raw materials  manufacturing  packaging  shipping and retailing most of these items shouldn t be less than a dollar  but thanks to having the reserve currency of the world  we are still able to go to these big box stores and fill up our carts with lots and lots of extremely inexpensive merchandise 
Unfortunately  this massively inflated standard of living is going to come crashing to a halt  This next financial crisis is going to destroy the system that is currently producing such comfortable lifestyles for the vast majority of us  and that will be an extremely painful experience 
So enjoy this summer for as long as it lasts  Even though August threatens to be pivotal  it is going to be nothing compared to what will follow ",2015-08-02,Michael T. Snyder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/11-red-flag-events-that-just-happened-as-we-enter-the-pivotal-month-260196,260196
193651,415167,CVX,Exxon Mobil And Chevron See Massive Declines In Profit,opinion,"Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM    Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX 
If you re an investor  you know that the oil market has fallen on some serious hard times  and with things going the way they ve been  things will only get worse  Unfortunately  the downward trend in the value of oil has started to wreak serious havoc for the oil giants  ExxonMobil and Chevron  Both of these companies released their earnings reports Friday  showing shocking declines  even in the midst of the oil crisis  Today  we ll take a look at the earnings reports from XOM and CVX  how the market reacted to earnings  and what we can expect to see moving forward  So  let s get right to it 
XOM Beats Revenue  But Misses Earnings
Exxon Mobil produced a bit of a mixed report  While the company did beat top line revenue expectations  they fell flat when it came to earnings  Here s what we saw 

Top Line Revenue   Wall Street expected XOM to produce  72 5 billion in top line revenue for the second quarter  However  the company beat these expectations in a big way  producing  74 1 billion instead 
Earnings   Nonetheless  when it comes to earnings  the company missed expectations  producing only  1 00 per share  Analysts expected to see the company generate  1 11 per share 

Following the earnings release  XOM CEO  Rex W  Tillerson had the following to say 
 We are delivering on our investment and operating commitments across Exxon Mobil s integrated portfolio  Our quarterly results reflect the disparate impacts of the current commodity price environment  but also demonstrate the strength of our sound operations  superior project execution capabilities  as well as continued discipline in capital and expense management  
CVX Follows The Same Path
Unfortunately for Chevron  their report really wasn t much different  aside from the fact that their earnings miss was far wider  Here s what we saw 


Top Line Revenue   In terms of top line revenue  CVX did incredibly well  producing  40 357 billion in the quarter  Analysts only expected that the company would produce  29 533 billion 


Earnings   Unfortunately however  the strong revenue didn t bleed into earnings  In the quarter  the company earned  0 75 per share  far short of the  1 13 per share analysts were expecting to see 


Here s what a Chevron representative had to say after the release of earnings 
 In light of the current market environment  Chevron is taking action to reduce internal costs in multiple operating units and the corporate center  These initiatives  which are currently underway  are focused on increasing efficiency  reducing costs and focusing on work that directly supports business priorities  
How Investors Reacted To The News
As we ve come to expect any time a company misses earnings expectations  both Exxon Mobil and Chevron saw declines as a result of their reports  Here s how trading ended for both companies on Friday 


Exxon Mobil   Exxon Mobil lost 4 48  in the trading session  closing the day out at  79 29 


Chevron   Chevron lost 4 92  in the session  closing the day at  88 45 per share 


What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
To tell the truth  I don t like to be the bearish speculator as I like to think of the positivity that could send stocks up  Unfortunately however  I don t think I have much of a choice in this particular case  The reality is that both of these companies are feeling the pain of an incredibly poor commodities market  and if world news is any indication  this isn t likely to change  The bottom line is that with the persistent strong dollar  poor economic conditions around the world  and massive oil supply glut  I simply don t see any opportunities for strong growth at the moment  Nonetheless  there is a bit of a glimmer around the dark cloud  Poor oil prices are likely to drive XOM and CVX down even further  but aren t likely to last forever  So  long term investors may want to look at these declines as a way to get in on the future oil market at a discounted price

193652,415168,CVX,Linn Energy Hits Memorial Production Partners,opinion,"It was an awful week for oil related plays as oil s price price continued to drop and one energy company after another  including the titans Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX   failed to provide investors much in the way of reassurance  This calamity was quite a contrast to the much higher optimism from earnings just three months ago 
The all time low on the United States Oil ETF  NYSE USO  is already receiving a major challenge as oil prices plunge anew
The all time low on the United States Oil ETF  USO  is receiving a major challenge thanks to the renewed plunge in the price of oil  Surprisingly  the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index  OVX   an index built off USO  is nowhere near the highs it achieved when USO was last cratering to these levels  I am interpreting this as a sign that the market currently believes USO has little additional downside  Of course  the market could be very wrong with so many uncertainties ahead on the demand  think China  and supply side of oil  think inventories  geopolitics  and monetary policy   Although OVX was not as high as I would have liked  I still started into the USO rangebound trade in place of my earlier simple trading scenarios for USO  Given the market s reaction to the onslaught of bad news from oil related companies  I am bracing myself for at least one more wave of panicked exits from oil ahead 
Linn Energy  NASDAQ LINE  delivered a harsh dose of reality for investors in high yielding oil and natural gas Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs   During its earnings announcement on Thursday  July 30  LINE announced it would suspend its dividend entirely in order to pay down debt  In the long run  this decision is an extremely smart swap  but right now  panic rules 
The post earnings selling in Linn Energy  LINE  has yet to let up
Incredibly  LINE has lost 71  just in the last three months  For high yield investors  this is a nightmare scenario that completely blows up years of patient dividend collection and reinvestment  I have duly noted that perhaps  just perhaps  the market is starting to tell us that there is truly nowhere to hide from low yields  and low returns    
The panic was complete enough to spread to Memorial Production Partners  NASDAQ MEMP   As I have pointed out in earlier pieces touting MEMP  production hedges out about 4 years makes this company very attractive  Seeking Alpha author and E P investor Daniel Jones calls MEMP   one of the best hedged  if not THE best hedged  E P operator in this space   The subsequent selling in MEMP is happening even AFTER  
Memorial Production Partners LP  MEMP  crashes in sympathy
I used MEMP s announcement to double down on my recently purchased shares 
I now await this week s earnings  August 5  with full radar up  Jones has done the math and concludes that MEMP will need to cut its dividend DESPITE the hedges if oil prices stay this low for a sustained period  However  he is overall optimistic about MEMP  so I am assuming he is poised to buy if the market further discounts MEMP  Here is what he had to say in  The Simple Math Behind Memorial Production Partners  Dividend Cut Guaranteed  

 Right now  the picture for Memorial looks pretty positive since management is virtually guaranteed to see positive cash flow through 2018  If the energy market doesn t recover by then  however  there could be some meaningful problems for the business  but i don t think it s likely that prices will stay anywhere near this low for such a long timeframe 
Regardless of how you look at it  though  anything shy of an almost immediate recovery in energy prices will result in the company having to cut its dividend relatively soon  which could be a net negative for investors who rely on the business for its hefty yield  If  on the other hand  prices do increase soon  then Memorial will be a great prospect for both income sensitive and value oriented investors  meaning that the best way to play this is to ask yourself the likelihood of rising energy prices near term  If you believe that higher prices are probable near term moving forward  Memorial is great both from a yield perspective and an appreciation potential perspective  but if you expect the downturn to be prolonged  then you could experience a very bumpy ride along the way  

Jones mixes up forming an opinion with predicting the future   that is  YOUR particular opinion on the future of oil prices has absolutely NO impact on what actually happens going forward  However  I do agree with the underlying premise  MEMP is a fantastic value play at these levels  If you choose to jump in  do not over extend yourself and keep some powder dry to take advantage of the market s  panicked  discounting mechanism going into over drive 
Be careful out there

193653,415169,CVX,Layoffs Surge As Oil Price Outlook Remains Sober,opinion,"Lately the leaders of some of the world s biggest energy companies have been saying oil prices will remain depressed for some time   perhaps for the next five years   and now they ve decided to cut their costs in the most painful way possible  massive job cuts 
Royal Dutch Shell  LONDON RDSa  announced July 30 that it expects to eliminate 6 500 positions  The announcement came the same day it reported that earnings in the second quarter were  3 4 billion  33 percent lower than the  5 1 billion it made during the same period of 2014 
The same day  the British utility Centrica  LONDON CNA  said it plans to cut fully 6 000 jobs and reduce the size of its division for producing oil and gas  The day before  Chevron Corp   NYSE CVX  of the United States expected to eliminate 1 500 positions 

And as oil producers struggle to rein in spending elsewhere in their operations  the pain is being shared by the oil service companies they rely on  The Italian energy contractor Saipem  for example  says it plans to cut 8 800 jobs in two years 
 We have to be resilient in a world where oil prices remain low for some time   Shell CEO    These are challenging times for the industry  and we are responding with urgency and determination  
It may be too early to determine whether the price of oil  which began falling a year ago  was now forcing the energy industry to go beyond cutting fat and is now gouging into the very sinew of its operations  but it s clear that they re convinced that other economies simply weren t enough to keep themselves afloat 

And all because of the steep decline in the price of oil  In June 2014  its average global price was more than  110 per barrel  Now it s around  50 per barrel  despite a brief  small spike recently that brought it up to around  60 per barrel 
The price fall began because drillers in the United States had increased oil production  mostly from shale deposits  which are more expensive to exploit  Instead of reducing its own production to help boost prices  OPEC  under Saudi leadership  decided at its semiannual meeting in November to keep production at 30 million barrels a day in an effort to make shale drilling unprofitable

193654,415170,CVX,Dollar Rallies On End Month Buying  Oil Falls Sharply,opinion,"Dollar rallies on end month buying The FOMC has said that the decision on whether to raise rates depends on the US economic data  so traders are ultra sensitive to the US data nowadays  Friday s Q2 employment cost index  ECI  shocked the market on the downside  with the smallest qoq growth in earnings since the series began in 1982  The Fed wants to see rising compensation and people quitting their jobs at an increasing pace as indirect indications of a firmer employment market  The disappointment led to some dollar weakness  as this was the last ECI report before the September FOMC meeting  but gradually investors dug into the data more and found that there were many special factors that reduced its credibility  End month buying took over after that and the dollar ended Friday generally higher  even though fed funds rate expectations fell notably   end 2016 is back below 1   for example 

  The dollar was helped by comments from St  Louis Fed President James Bullard  who said that the outlook for the US economy  remains fairly good  and that the latest data boosts the case for a rate hike in September  Although Bullard isn t a voting member of the FOMC right now  his comments do show how some members of the FOMC must be viewing the data 
  Oil falls sharply on OPEC output  China fears  oil currencies fall too Oil fell sharply on Friday after the OPEC Secretary General said the group is  not ready  to cut production  while sluggish demand in China may reduce demand  The fact that Exxon Mobil Corp  NYSE XOM  and Chevron Corp  NYSE CVX   the biggest US energy producers  also announced disappointing earnings didn t help matters either  Then the Iranian oil minister was quoted as saying Iran s production can increase by 1mn barrels a day one month after sanctions are lifted  which Iran expects to happen by late November  That s all the market needs to hears  Then this morning  the Caixin Markit China manufacturing PMI for July was revised down sharply to 47 8 from 48 2  showing that the contraction in manufacturing is accelerating  which has caused oil to fall further today 
  The plunging oil price explains why CAD and NOK are the two worst performing G10 currencies and RUB the second worst performing EM currency   TRY remains the worst performing  falling another 4  or so   However  MXN continued to recover  as did the Eastern European currencies  I remain bearish on oil and therefore bearish on these oil currencies in particular  commodity currencies in general 
  On the other hand  sterling looks like it could gain further as positioning is neutral  see below   There is a lot of news coming out about sterling on Thursday that could be the catalyst for a further leg up in the currency  or down too  don t forget   see below for details  
  Commitment of Traders report  positioning at extremes Positioning among speculators is hitting extreme levels for several currencies plus the precious metals  Investors seem very bearish indeed on the commodity related currencies  especially those related to oil  even though positioning in oil itself is neutral  The large shorts in MXN may explain the snapback we ve been seeing since the Mexican central bank announced that it would intervene in the FX market  Note though that positioning in the main G10 currencies   including EUR but more specifically JPY  GBP and CHF    is quite neutral  This signals to me that there is plenty of room for speculators to expand positions in these currencies  particularly short JPY and long GBP 

  Today s highlights  During the European day  we get the final manufacturing PMI figures for several European countries  and the Eurozone as a whole  As usual  the final forecasts are the same as the initial estimates  Market reaction on these news is usually limited unless there is a huge revision from the preliminary figures 
  The Greek stock market will reopen today  While it s been closed  an ETF on Greek stocks listed in New York  NYSE GREK  has fallen by 17   That may be a reasonable estimate for what will happen when the Greek market reopens 

  In the US  we get the personal income and personal spending for June  Both are forecast to decelerate on a mom basis  The market will most likely focus on personal spending  which is forecast to slow sharply from May   a negative for the dollar  Even though the preliminary US GDP expanded in Q2  solid spending is needed to suggest that the economy has the steady momentum necessary to bring the Fed closer to a rate hike this year  Therefore  a significant positive surprise is needed for the USD to remain supported  The yoy rate of the PCE deflator and core PCE for June are also coming out  The PCE deflator is expected to decelerate  while the core PCE is forecast to remain unchanged in pace from May  The ISM manufacturing PMI index comes out a bit later and is expected to be unchanged at 53 5  which may offset the negative spending figures somewhat  Also  the final Markit service sector PMI for July is due out 
  As for the speakers  Fed Governor Jerome Powell speaks 
  Rest of the week  We have a very busy week  featuring three G10 central bank meetings and the US nonfarm payrolls 
  Tuesday  The main event will be the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  policy meeting  At their last meeting  the RBA kept its cash rate unchanged and maintained a neutral bias as far as their future stance  The forecast is for the RBA to remain on hold again  hence the focus will most likely be on the statement accompanying the rate decision for any hints regarding the future path of the interest rate  If they maintain their neutral stance  AUD could strengthen a bit  at least temporarily 
  Wednesday  In the US  the ADP employment report for July is coming out two days ahead of the nonfarm payroll release  as usual  The ADP report is expected to show that the private sector gained fewer jobs in July than it did in the previous month  but still above the crucial 200k level  With a little more than a month before Fed s September meeting  further improvement in the labor market is likely to increase speculation about the Fed raising rates 
  Thursday  We have a very big day in the UK  it s going to be a super Thursday  as we have the Bank of England policy meeting  the release of the minutes of the meeting with the officials  votes  and new forecasts about the economy  all at the same time  On top of that  the August Inflation Report will be published simultaneously  This will be a massive amount of information and data that the market will have to digest very quickly  Besides the huge amount of data  the recent commentary by a number of MPC members suggest that a few of them are moving towards voting for the first rate increase  Therefore  we could have some dissenting votes this time  In such case  and along with new upbeat GDP and CPI forecasts  we believe that the pound would probably strengthen across the board  particularly against the weaker commodity currencies 
  Friday  The main event of the day will be the US nonfarm payrolls  The current market forecast for July is for an increase in payrolls of 223k  the same as in June  Another reading above 200k would suggest that the US labor market is gathering momentum and is likely to keep USD supported against its peers  Canada s unemployment rate for July is also due to be released Friday 
  In addition to the employment reports  Bank of Japan hold its policy meeting Friday  Market expectations   and ours    are for no change in BoJ policy  The focus will most likely be on Gov  Kuroda s press conference afterwards  There will be particular interest in anything he might say about the controversy over revising the CPI statistics as part of the usual revisions every five year

EUR USD surges on the Employment Cost Index

  EUR USD surged on Friday after the US Employment Cost Index for Q2 rose by the lowest in the 33 year history of the report  Nevertheless  the rally was stopped at 1 1115  R1  and the pair gave back a large portion of its gains  During the early European morning  EUR USD is trading slightly above the 1 0965  S1  line  A dip below that is likely to open the way for another test of the 1 0900  S2  territory  Taking a look at our short term oscillators though  I would be wary of an upside corrective bounce before the next negative leg  perhaps for a test at the 1 1020  R1  line  The RSI shows signs of bottoming near its 50 line  while the MACD stands fractionally above its trigger line and could turn positive soon 
  As for the broader trend  as long as the pair is trading between 1 0800 and 1 1500  I would see a neutral longer term picture  I believe that a move above the psychological zone of 1 1500 is the move that could carry larger bullish implications  while a break below 1 0800 is needed to confirm a forthcoming lower low on the daily chart and perhaps turn the overall bias back to the downside 
  Support  1 0965  S1   1 0900  S2   1 0870  S3 
  Resistance  1 1020  R1   1 1115  R2   1 1200  R3 
GBP USD once again hits the 1 5670 barrier

  GBP USD found support near the 1 5560  S1  line on Friday and rebounded to hit once again the strong resistance hurdle of 1 5670  R1   I still believe that the short term picture is cautiously positive  and therefore  a break above that resistance would confirm a forthcoming higher high on the 4 hour chart and perhaps open the way for the 1 5735  R2  line  The RSI  already above its 50 line  looks ready to turn up again  while the MACD stands positive and just poked its nose above its trigger line  These indicators detect positive momentum and support that the pair could trade higher  at least in the short run  On the daily chart  cable is still trading above the 80 day exponential moving average  This makes me believe that the overall picture remains somewhat positive as well and that there is still the likelihood for the rate to trade higher in the not to distant future 
  Support  1 5560  S1   1 5465  S2   1 5410  S3 
  Resistance  1 5670  R1   1 5735  R2   1 5780  R3 
EUR JPY climbs and hits resistance at 137 35

  EUR JPY traded higher on Friday after it hit support at 135 50  S2   Subsequently  the rate found resistance at 137 35  R2  and retreated to find support at 135 90  S1   I believe that the short term picture stays somewhat positive and therefore  I would expect the forthcoming wave to be positive  perhaps to challenge once again the 137 00  R1  barrier  Our short term oscillators stand near their equilibrium lines  but the RSI has turned up and looks ready to move above 50 soon  This corroborates my view that the forthcoming move is likely to be to the upside  On the daily chart  the pair is still trading above the medium term uptrend line taken from the low of the 14th of April  and above the 133 30 support area  which stands marginally below the 50  retracement level of the 14th of April   4th of June advance  As a result  I would see a cautiously positive longer term picture as well  I would like to see a daily close below that area before I assume that the medium term picture has turned negative 
  Support  135 90  S1   135 50  S2   135 00  S3 
  Resistance  137 00  R1   137 35  R2   138 00  R3 
Gold rebounds from 1080

  Gold traded higher on Friday after it hit support at 1080  S1   The metal has been oscillating between the aforementioned support and the resistance of 1105  R1  since the 21st of July  and therefore  I would consider the short term picture to be neutral  Looking at our short term momentum indicators though  it is possible that gold could extend a bit higher  The RSI rebounded from its 50 line  while the MACD stands above its trigger line and could obtain a positive sign soon  What is more  there is positive divergence between both these indicators and the price action  A clear move above 1105  R1  is likely to confirm the case and perhaps extend the bullish wave towards our next resistance of 1120  R2   In the bigger picture  the plunge on the 20th of July triggered the continuation of the longer term downtrend and kept the overall bias of the yellow metal to the downside  in my view 
  Support  1080  S1   1072  S2   1060  S3 
  Resistance  1105  R1   1120  R2   1130  R3 
WTI continues its tumble and hits 46 35

  WTI continued falling on Friday and during the Asian morning Monday  it hit support at 46 35  S2   The short term outlook remains negative  but I would now expect the forthcoming wave to be positive  perhaps for a test at the 47 40  R1  resistance barrier  The 14 hour RSI has just exited its below 30 territory  while the hourly MACD has bottomed and could cross above its trigger line soon  On the downside  a move below 46 35  S2  is needed to confirm a forthcoming lower low  and could probably open the way for the psychological barrier of 45 00  S3   On the daily chart  I see that the medium term trend is negative as well 
  Support  46 70  S1   46 35  S2   45 00  S3 
  Resistance  47 40  R1  48 65  R2   49 50  R3

193656,415172,CVX,Oil Prices Plunge ,opinion,"U S  stock markets ended lower on Monday while oil prices plunged after global oversupply created concerns over weak demand  Monday s declines deepened the recent slump in oil prices  bringing a barrel of oil down to a four month low amid soft demand  a marked increase in the number of active oil rigs and disappointing construction spending and manufacturing  The number of active U S  oil rigs has increased in four of the past five weeks  Additionally  recently released economic data reports have created concerns that demand is also falling  The purchasing managers manufacturing index fell from 53 5 in June to 52 7 in July  demonstrating that U S  factories had less activity  At the same time  another report revealed that construction spending missed expectations and rose just 0 1   Benchmark U S  crude fell  1 95  or 4 1   to trade at  45 17  Crude oil suffered considerable declines last year but so far  2015 has seen prices decline by 15   Brent oil  used by many refineries  has also declined  falling  2 69  or 5 2   to trade at  49 52 per barrel and is down 13 5  this year 
Oil s retreat is pegged as the cause for the fall in U S  shares on Monday  The selloff increased over the day as more data signaled falling demand alongside the increased oil production  Prices have fallen more than 50  over the last 12 months and stock indexes usually follow oil s decline  The Dow Jones fell 91 66 points  or 0 5   to trade at 17598 2 after paring earlier losses  The S P 500 index fell 5 8 points  or 0 3   to trade at 2098 4 and the Nasdaq composite fell 12 9 points  or 0 3   to trade at 5115 38  As can be expected  the energy sector was the biggest decliner  falling more than 2   Chevron Corp   NYSE CVX  has fallen 3 3  and Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  has fallen 1 5

193657,415173,CVX,Equity Opening Calls,opinion,"It s generally been an upbeat session here in Asia despite continuation deterioration in oil and inflation expectations 
It seems the bulls have had a better say in Australia and China and certainly I think price action in Australia looks quite interesting  I would say even the bulls would have put a low probability of a clean break through the key 5 700 area for the ASX 200 pre market  but not only did we see a break through the June July double top but we have seen good volume on the break as well  The RBA to blame for the loss of momentum  although the index is still modestly above 5 700 
The S P ASX 200 is clearly having a strong outperformance of late with the MSCI World ASX 200 ratio falling quite aggressively of late  The 5  fall in the AUD during July has clearly assisted that trade and is certainly a reason why CSL  ASX CSL  has broken the A 100 barrier today  As far as momentum plays go in the Aussie stock market  this is about as bullish as it gets  pullbacks will remain supported  The question remains how much further CSL can go and with price now at A 101  it is trading at premium to the consensus analyst s price target of  100 72   the first time since April  The last time price crossed the brokers target  we subsequently saw a 6  increase in analysts  price targets  However  I am skeptical we will see the same this time around  This is a name to stay in or buy on pullbacks in my opinion  but it is clear that the market is telling you this is a quality business and investors seem happy to pay up for the cash flows and earning streams 

Staying equities specific  Suncorp  ASX SUN  have really lifted expectations for Aussie reporting season  although the market seemingly misinterpreted the financials on first blush  The diversified financial has had a good run since early May and the market clearly wanted to see pleasing numbers  After seemingly disappointing at first  we saw a strong reversal  with traders compelled by the performance of its general insurance business and the lower and doubtful debts  Personally  I was keen to watch out for the dividend payout ratio  given increasing payout ratios will be a key reason for the ASX 200 to attract offshore capital and at 81   it seems this resonated through the market and reinforced the idea that other firms will follow suit with returning capital to shareholders 
Two sectors that should be avoided by investors are the material and energy space  Both are sectors that are great for traders but make terrible investments  Companies such as Rio Tinto  LONDON RIO  or BHP  NYSE BBL  are producing at low levels  but in the end commodities have such limited visibility right now and provide such little confidence to shareholders  We have seen the Impact first hand of late with massive job cuts in Chevron  NYSE CVX   Shell  LONDON RDSa  and Anglo American  LONDON AAL  of late  Still  we should see dividend increases for Rio  A 1 07 VS A 0 96 in 2014   although analysts do expect BHP to keep theirs steady  while FMG  ASX FMG  should drop their dividend to 6  
Of course the big talking point today has been the huge data drop in Australia  and if the UK will be celebrating  super Thursday   today is Australia s  super Tuesday   We saw a modest 20 30 pip move in AUD USD after the 0 7  rise in nominal retail sales  but this did little to alter the future perception on rates and it will take something more than stronger retail turnover to change Glenn Stevens view 
This came across firmly in today s Reserve Bank statement  although the fact that the central bank have altered its view that on the currency from further falls a  likely and necessary  and now simply suggesting the AUD is  adjusting to significant declines in commodity prices  is actually quite bizarre  The strategy was working well  There was a slow gradual decline in the AUD  despite stabilisation in its key export commodity  which is what all central banks desire  This could and should alter somewhat now  although the market is still pricing a 68  chance of a rate cut by December  from 73  pre RBA statement   However  for currency traders the RBA has just given us a reason to leave the AUD out of the central bank divergence trade  as the RBA are on hold for a long time  Trader s preference has firmly shifted to selling NZD  CAD  NOK and SEK  but AUD is firmly in the neutral camp for now 
Japan is once again sidelined  although traders have been keen to focus on a slight drop  to 32 8  from 34 2   in the pace of expansion in the monetary base  We have also seen an unexpected 2 9  drop in real cash earnings  This won t please the Bank of Japan at all  but it won t push them into increasing the current QE program from a monthly run rate of  80 trillion  The barrier to that feat is way too high right now 
USD JPY seems to be missing a catalyst and while it s hard to find a strategist who doesn t feel the pair is going higher over a medium or long term time frame  everyone seems to want to buy on a break of the  124 50 triple top  Letting the market dictate can often be a great strategy and while the US yield curve is flattening as a result of better buying in the 10 and 30 year maturities  the USD seems to be missing a catalyst 
Yesterday s US ISM manufacturing had its positives and negatives  but the fact new export orders showed good contraction won t bode well for future GDP reads  USD bulls will point to the fairly low contribution from exports as a percentage of GDP  currently around 12    but it s worth keeping in mind that the consensus estimate for Q3 GDP is currently 3   although there would be downside risks to that call ",2015-08-04,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/equity-opening-calls-260447,260447

193669,415185,CVX,Chevron  A Deeply Undervalued High Yield Dividend Aristocrat,opinion,"Chevron  NYSE CVX  is the 2nd largest oil and gas corporation based in the United States 
The company has a  178 billion market cap  versus  344 billion for ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM   Chevron made a cool  17 3 billion in profits over the last 12 months 
Dividend investors will quickly notice the stock s high dividend yield  Chevron currently has a dividend yield of 4 5  
Unlike most high yield stocks  Chevron has a long history of dividend increases  Chevron  thanks to its streak of 27 consecutive years of dividend increases 
Chevron is not a new company  It has proven itself over the last 145 years 
Chevron can trace its history back to 1879 when the Pacific Coast Oil Company was incorporated  In 1900  Rockefeller s Standard Oil acquired the Pacific Coast Oil Company  Eleven years later  the Supreme Court forced Standard Oil to break up 
This break up created Standard Oil of California   which changed its name to Socal  Socal grew from 1911 through 1977  In 1977 the company merged with 5 other domestic oil and gas businesses and renamed itself Chevron  The company has been known as Chevron ever since 
Recent events have not been kind to Chevron  The company s stock is down nearly 25  this year  Chevron s stock price decline is a direct result of falling oil prices 
Chevron is an integrated oil and gas business  The company operates both upstream and downstream businesses  The company s downstream businesses tend to be more profitable with lower oil prices  while the upstream division is more profitable with higher oil prices 
Unfortunately for Chevron  the company is not evenly balanced between upstream and downstream  The bullet points below shows profits from each division  in millions  in the company s  versus 2014 
2015 Q1 upstream profits of  1 560 versus  4 307 in Q1 2014
2015 Q1 downstream profits of  1 423 versus  710 in Q1 2014
As you can see  the upstream division is far more profitable than the downstream division when oil prices are high  When oil prices fall  the downstream division sees profits grow  doubling in this case   but downstream profit growth does not offset the steep profit declines in the upstream division 
Focus on Efficiency   Asset Sales
With falling profits in Chevron s upstream division  the company is focusing on increasing efficiency  The company is targeting cost reductions between 10  and 30  in its upstream operations  The company is re engineering its work processes and has found  900 million in reductions 
Chevron has also expanded its asset sale program  The company expects to generate another  5 billion from asset sales between now and 2017 
Chevron s Growth Prospects
With low oil prices  investors can lose track of long term growth prospects in the oil and gas industry  The macro growth drivers in the industry are population growth and rising global incomes   which stimulates energy demand 
The industry is projecting long term growth  Chevron projects a 40  increase in energy demand  based at 2013 levels  by 2035  Gas demand is expected to increase by 45  and liquid demand is expected to increase by 20  
So what s the bottom line  Oil and gas is still a long term growth industry 
Chevron has positioned itself to grow production over the next several years  The company is still targeting 20  production growth from 2014 through 2017 
Chevron plans to achieve this growth through large scale projects  including  Jack St  Malo  Big Foot  Angola LNG  Gorgon  and Wheatstone 
The Jack St  Malo project is also a deep water project located in the gulf of Mexico  The project has already started producing  At peak operating capacity  the Jack St  Malo project will add over 100 MBOED to Chevron s operations 
TheBig Foot project is also a deep water operation located in the gulf of Mexico  The project was expected to begin production in 2015  but is experiencing delays  Once complete  The Big Foot project should add around 80 MBOED to production for Chevron 
Chevron is also experiencing fixable issues in its Angola LNG project  The project has had several setbacks and delays including fires and various technical issues  The Angola LNG project will contribute about 60 MBOED to Chevron when it starts operating at peak efficiency  Chevron expects the Angola LNG project to restart production in the 4th quarter of 2015 
The Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects are both located off the northwest coast of Australia  The projects are the centerpiece of Chevron s production growth plan  The Gorgon project is 90  complete  and the Wheatstone project is 60  complete  Production will ramp from these projects through 2020  At their peak  the projects are expected to add over 450 MBOED to Chevron s production 
Expected Total Returns
Over the last decade  Chevron has grown earnings per share at an average of 7 5  a year  The company is expected to grow production at around 7  a year to 2017  Chevron will likely continue to grow earnings per share around 7 5  a year  in line with its long term historical average 
The company s earnings are highly volatile due to dependence on the price of oil  If oil prices rise  Chevron s earnings per share will surge higher  The company s 7 5  expected long term earnings per share growth combined with its current 4 5  dividend yield give investors expected total returns of around 12  a year 
Final Thoughts
Chevron is currently trading at just 7x its peak earnings  from 2011   The company appears deeply undervalued at this time  Chevron is cheap due to oil price declines  If oil prices rise  Chevron shareholders could see large gains from both increased earnings and a higher price to earnings ratio 
Chevron ranks highly using   The company s extremely high dividend yield  low valuation  and solid growth prospects should provide market beating returns for dividend growth investors who can withstand the stock s high volatility ",2015-07-13,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chevron:-a-deeply-undervalued-high-yield-dividend-aristocrat-258128,258128

193671,415187,CVX,GDP Miss Non Event for Energy Prices,opinion,"The morning trade featured some significant fundamental data  with the US 2nd quarter GDP missing expectations  natural gas inventories shrinking  and jobless claims continuing to dwindle 
The soft GDP reading  2 3 vs  expected 2 6  came on the heels of the FOMC decision to leave rates unchanged yesterday  though seemingly intent on at least one 2015 rate move  Less than expected GDP would appear to have the effect of lessening the likelihood of a sooner rather than later rate hike  However  one would assume the committee was already privy to this information going into the meeting  and if it were to have a pronounced effect on their leanings  it may have been evident in the press release yesterday  The market in general has taken the GDP miss in stride  with WTI still up on the day  Equities are down only nominally and bond yields have gone lower  but seem to be stabilizing 
WTI remains just above 49 dollars currently  as the big draws this week in inventories continue to filter into the price discovery  We are seeing some industry reaction to the recent decline in WTI from 60 dollars to 47 dollars  as some of the majors like Shell  LONDON RDSa  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  are instituting secondary rounds of austerity measures  this time shedding significant numbers of employees in an effort to make up the slack from the depressed price  Gasoline and distillates remain higher on the day as well  with demand for gasoline state side at several year highs driving the price discovery higher  If the energy markets can remain close to unchanged on the day or higher in the face of the worse than expected GDP report  then that would seem to be some confirmation of an exhausted bear market preparing to trade higher in coming sessions 
Natural gas got more bullish news this morning  with the inventories showing only 52 BCF vs  the expected 54 BCF  Granted  that is not a significant miss in expectations  but it declined nonetheless for the third week in a row  with the hottest part of the year upon us  Inexplicably  the market has sold off about 8 cents on the day  trading at 2 78 after trading as high as 2 895 shortly after the report  These mildly bullish reports seem to be feeding new short positions rather than building momentum higher  as the past three rallies due to lower than expected builds have been met with semi dramatic reversals  That being said  the market remains firmly within its recent range after spending most of the week grinding higher  Disclaimer  Trading commodity futures and options involves substantial risk of loss and may not be suitable for all investors ",2015-07-30,Tory Enerson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gdp-miss-non-event-for-energy-prices-260054,260054

193686,415202,CVX,The  Always Fuel  Of The Future  Kerogen,opinion,"Kerogen shale is known as the fuel of the future 
The problem is  it s held that title for decades  never coming to fruition 
This oil shale  not to be confused with   is a fine grained sedimentary rock suffused with kerogen  a precursor to oil 
Kerogen contains oil and gas  But it has to be mined  crushed  and heated to a very high temperature for the oil and gas to be released 
The process is extremely energy  and water intensive   not very economically viable  Plus  burning kerogen produces a lot of carbon dioxide 
That s why big oil companies like Chevron  NYSE CVX  and Royal Dutch Shell  LONDON RDSa  have abandoned oil shale projects in Colorado in recent years 
But new technological advancements mean this future fuel may finally be a part of the present 
Estonia  The Kerogen King
This tiny Baltic nation prides itself on its technological prowess  Its home to the creators of Skype and is the first country to hold elections with online voting 
Estonia has been using its advanced technology in the energy sector  as well  In fact  it s been working with oil shale for nearly a hundred years 
You see  the country sits on the seventh biggest kerogen deposit in the world  For many decades  it s relied on kerogen shale for more than 90  of its electricity needs  In fact  Estonia is a major electricity exporter 
It uses about 85  of the kerogen it mines for electricity  burning the rock directly  The remaining 15  is turned into oil and related products  By 2016  Estonia hopes to produce diesel for vehicles from kerogen 
The interesting fact here is that the country s CO2 emissions have remained stable over the past 20 years  even though Estonia continues to mine more and more of the oil shale  And  surprisingly  its per capita CO2 emissions are lower than those in the United States 
The country is able to pull this off thanks to special technology developed by the state owned energy company Eesti Energia  also known as Enefit 
The latest version of its technology  developed in conjunction with Finland s minerals processing technology company Outotec Oyj  LONDON 0MGI   is called Enefit280 
Enefit280 equipped plants use 100  of the mined shale  producing shale oil  retort gas  and electricity  This essentially water free  carbon capture ready technology also generates electricity from excess heat and retort gas  further offsetting CO2 emissions 
The only residue left is a non hazardous ash  Estonia even repurposes this ash by using it in cement and other construction materials 
Open Source Energy
But the country isn t stopping there  Innovation continues and kerogen technology is getting more and more efficient 
Enefit says it s improved on the process of extracting energy from kerogen 
 Through co generation of oil  gas and power all at once  we can halve our CO2 emissions   said the CEO of the company  Hando Sutter  to the Financial Times 
The first of this new generation of shale oil power plants will be commissioned later this year  And the company is planning to bring in new partners 
France s Alstom  PARIS ALSO  will also build a plant for Enefit in Narva  in the eastern part of the country  It s a combined oil shale and biomass power plant that will meet tough  future EU environmental requirements  The  640 million plant will be the biggest energy investment by Estonia since its independence 
This technology could be highly beneficial to the United States  quest for energy independence 
Underneath Colorado  Wyoming  and Utah lies the Green River Formation  This formation of over 1 000 feet of sedimentary rock contains the world s largest deposit of kerogen shale 
Estimates for it have been as high as three trillion barrels of oil  with half of it being recoverable  That is double the world s known oil reserves 
There s also additional kerogen around the world  There s an estimated five trillion barrels of kerogen oil sitting in deposits in 29 other countries 
And now the technology exists to extract these riches economically and burn it cleanly 
Exporting Its Technology
As you can imagine  Enefit is most anxious to export its kerogen technologies to other countries with big oil shale deposits  At the top of the list are the United States  China  Russia  Jordan  Brazil  and Morocco 
Enefit is working in conjunction with Outotec to adjust its technology in order to process the local variations in oil shale properly 
The first successful export of its technology will be to energy poor Jordan  The company expects to receive the okay this year to build a 540 megawatt power station near a kerogen deposit  The project should cost about  2 2 billion and will be financed with help from China  If all goes as planned  the plant will start generating electricity in 2018 
Enefit is making moves in the United States already  too  In 2011  the company bought a significant oil shale deposit in Utah  which is believed to hold 2 6 billion barrels of recoverable oil 
The project is still in the permitting phase and is conducting engineering and environmental studies  so construction isn t likely to occur soon  considering there are probably plenty of environmental fights ahead 
It will be interesting to see if the Estonians will be successful in exporting their technology to the other nations with big kerogen deposits as they have been at home 
Or if oil shale will remain the unattainable fuel of the future

193708,415224,CVX,One Important Energy Sector Metric Being Closely Watched,opinion,"Expected 2015 Energy sector growth rates are a mess if you ve been reading this blog regularly  although the stocks aren t acting nearly as bad as the numbers 
The December  14 low prints remain intact for a lot of names  but not all  and I suspect  after I started doing the bottoms up homework  is that a lot of sell side analysts are simply throwing EPS estimates out there  since they don t have a good gauge on how this year is going to progress  and for a lot of Energy analysts weren t around in 1986 when we had another  similar  supply driven crash in the sector 
My key metric  for what it is worth  is that I m watching the Q4  15 Energy sector earnings growth rate as published by Gregg Harrison and Thomson Reuters  since it is the first quarter that laps the collapse in the crude oil price in 2014 
Here is both the expected growth rate for Energy sector earnings in Q4  15 as well as the change over the first quarter  2015 
3 27 15   36 7 
2 27 15  32 9 
1 30 15   28 2 
1 1 15   1 8 
The reader can quickly see how Energy earnings deteriorated rapidly in January  15 for the 4th quarter of  15 and have since slowed their rate of descent  but still declined about 400 bp s per month for February and March  15 

In my opinion  it will be critical to watch the oil service names like Schlumberger and Halliburton  who typically report for the integrated oils like Exxon  Chevron  NYSE CVX  and Conoco  who typically report the last week to ten days of the January  April  July and October 

The expectations in Energy are practically apocalyptic right now with expectations of dividends being reduced  free cash flow deficits  ongoing supply increases in the US  and storage capacity evaporating rapidly 

I m serious   hard to imagine how the news or headline flow gets any worse  and yet a lot of Energy names are not making new lows 

Something will have to give  either the Energy sector growth rates start to firm up and even improve  particularly q4  15  or a lot of Energy names have to take out these late  14 price lows 

Again  this is just my opinion 


One minor correction or clarification on the Industrial s post this weekend  the Industrial sector earnings growth estimate was for full year 2015  and it was the only sector which saw an improvement in its full year 2015 growth rate over the period from Jan 1  15 to March 27th  2015   is the link  The q1  15 Industrial sector revisions were negative as is typically the case in the current quarter  I m trying to get some clarification on what is pulling the 2015 full year earnings estimates higher for Industrials ",2015-03-31,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-is-one-important-energy-metric-being-closely-watched-246767,246767

For the broader market to continue its advance  one of two things needs to happen  Either earnings growth needs to massively accelerate  or investors have to get comfortable with bubble valuations on par with those seen in the 1990s  With earnings already near all time highs and with most of the world economy looking shakey it s hard to see a major acceleration of profit growth happening this year  And while we can never rule out a 1990s caliber stock bubble  that s not exactly something I want to bet on  particularly with the Fed now effectively out of ammunition 
But while the broader market is looking stretched these days  there are definitely some pockets of value to be found  And one area that really stands out at today s prices is the energy sector 
Of the 10 industrial sectors that make up the S P 500  energy is the cheapest by a wide margin  trading at a CAPE of just 13 8  That s roughly half the CAPE valuation of the S P 500 as a whole  As a point of reference  the consumer discretionary  health care  and technology sectors trade at CAPEs of 39 1  31 5 and 28 8  respectively 
To be fair  some sectors notably consumer discretionaries and technology deserve to trade at a premium to the broader market  as they tend to have fatter profit margins and faster growth rates  But Big Oil is not exactly a profit slouch  The two biggest heavyweights in the sector  Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX   consistently generate returns on equity in the high teens and above  with very few exceptions 
As of this writing  I do not have a position in ExxonMobil or Chevron  But in my  portfolio  I do have a large allocation to the energy sector  Between energy majors and pipeline MLPs  more than 25  of my portfolio is now allocated to energy  I like to invest my money where it is treated best  and right now many of the best names in this space are trading at 20  50  discounts to their 2014 highs and offer some of the highest dividend yields in the world 
Am I concerned about falling energy prices 
No  I m not  Big Oil has proven over the years that it is more than capable of making money in both bull and bear markets in energy  Frankly  the sector had gotten sloppy in recent years in some of its capital allocation decisions  There is nothing like a good crude oil crash to make management focus on building shareholder value 
Meanwhile  the sector offers dividend yields of 3  6  after the slide in share prices  I fully expect dividend growth to slow over the next two years  but I m not expecting a wave of dividend cuts  or at least not among the blue chips in the sector 
We can t control market prices  But we most certainly can be selective with what we buy  and today the best values in the world are in the energy sector ",2015-04-13,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-for-value-in-the-second-quarter:-energy-stocks-248096,248096

AUDUSD  Unfortunately our buy entry on yesterday s trade was not reached as the limit buy level of 0 7740 came 7 pips short of the low for the day  The Aussie dollar recovered early losses as a rally in oil prices supported commodity currencies such as the NZDUSD and USDCAD and overcame the sell off seen earlier in the day  
From observations in recent price actions  it appears that the sellers are waiting for an entry whenever there is a retracement towards the 0 7852 resistance level  which is limiting further upside strength  
As oil and copper prices rebound from oversold areas  we expect AUDUSD to show resilience as the tug of war between shorts and longs continues along with choppy ranging price actions  We remain near term bullish and medium long term bearish

193727,415243,CVX,Thoughts On The Incongruous Energy Sector,opinion,"The topic of energy stocks and crude oil prices has reached epic proportions on social media and financial news outlets  I have seen a myriad of  experts  pointing to oil prices plunging as low as  23 per barrel to as high as  80  by the middle of this year 
No matter where you fall on that spectrum  the one thing I know for certain is that no one knows what is going to happen to crude oil prices  The best forecasters in the world have no better idea than you or I where this trend will ultimately turn  Commodities can find themselves oversold and stay oversold for extended periods of time despite cyclical or economic factors that favor a reversal 
I am not interested in picking a bottom in the United States Oil Fund  NYSE USO  or United States Natural Gas Fund  ARCA UNG   but rather am focusing my efforts on the technical price patterns of energy stocks 
In my opinion  the investment opportunities in oil related stocks follow far more predictable patterns than the direct commodity futures themselves 
The benchmark Energy Select Sector SPDR  ARCA XLE  appears to be setting up what could be a potential floor in the energy arena  This ETF has nearly  12 billion invested in 45 large cap energy producers and has continued to attract positive fund flows despite its hearty drop over the last seven months 
A look at the chart below shows how XLE hit a low in December and subsequently re tested that level in the early stages of January  The eerily similar lows it hit on both occasions have the makings of a double bottom in energy stocks if this most recent strength can hold  Even some modest consolidation without a violation of those levels would ultimately be a good thing moving forward 

Those that have been waiting for some positive news from the energy sector should be buoyed by these observations  While it may be early to make a definitive call that the bottom is in  we are starting to see diverging qualities that favor strengthening in oil related companies 
The biggest hurdle that fresh capital in XLE  or a related fund such as the Vanguard Energy ETF  NYSE VDE   will face is the uptick in volatility compared to other areas of the market  Energy stocks have seen their daily price fluctuations magnified by two or three times what the broader market has been experiencing  Conservative investors should be wary of this risk before making a commitment with new money 
Many of my income clients have also been inquiring as to the best area of the dividend paying energy sector to supplement with high yield master limited partnerships  MLPs   My response has been to check out the iShares MSCI Global Energy Producers ETF  NYSE FILL   which targets exposure to large integrated oil companies 
The top stocks in FILL include Exxon Mobil  Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell A  BA RDS   Note that this ETF has 47  of its 213 underlying stocks in countries outside the United States 
This ETF has a relatively small asset base of just  14 million  but has a liquid basket of holdings and has begun to accumulate more meaningful daily trading volume  From an income standpoint  FILL has an attractive 30 day SEC yield of 3 17  compared to 2 54  in XLE 
The energy sector has certainly captured the attention of market participants and should remain on your radar through the next several months  If we can build on the recent strength or hold current levels  this may turn into a more favorable long term opportunity from a relative value standpoint ",2015-01-23,David Fabian,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thoughts-on-the-incongruous-energy-sector-239499,239499
193728,415244,CVX,Is There A Future For Arctic Oil And Gas Projects ,opinion,"Until recently  the promise of Arctic oil and gas continuously lured in energy companies  both domestic and foreign  in an attempt to get a piece of the action  In 2013  Ernst   Young  that the Arctic region could hold 13  of the world s untapped oil reserves  along with 30  of undiscovered gas reserves worldwide  In spite of this  there remains little doubt as to the costs associated with such oil exploration projects  with a difficult geographical environment making exploration costs on par with that of space exploration 
This concern is understandably magnified greatly  with the recent slump in oil prices  Taking this into account  what lies in store for Arctic oil and gas projects going forward In spite of oil prices dropping by over  to under  60 per barrel  company responses have remained somewhat mixed  For instance  Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa   its intentions to begin drilling in the Arctic region this summer  contingent on the awarding of permits  For Royal Dutch Shell  as is the case for many oil firms with a presence in the region  high costs will be incurred irrespective of whether drilling takes place or not  as maintenance costs will continue to be high As an example  Royal Dutch Shell estimates that the project would cost  1bn regardless of whether drilling actually takes place 
However  other companies have not been as enthusiastic  For instance  Statoil  NYSE STO   that it will put its Norwegian Arctic drilling plans on hold for 2015  with Chevron  NYSE CVX  suspending drilling plans in the Beaufort Sea indefinitely  Additionally  with the introduction of Western sanctions  Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  has been forced to cease its joint venture exploration contract with Russian O G firm Rosneft  MCX ROSN   As a result  Rosneft has been forced to also suspend drilling plans for this year and is reportedly hoping to resume in the summer of 2016 
As a matter of fact  Western sanctions on Russia appear to be taking their toll on Russian O G firms with Arctic exploration interests  Given the logistical difficulties involved in Arctic drilling projects  Russian companies have been dependent on Western know how to ensure the proper development of offshore fields  In this context  Western sanctions will make this more difficult for Russian firms In terms of tax considerations  the same varies widely  with countries such as Russia and Canada typically providing better terms than that of Norway  for instance  Norway does not provide tax incentives for Arctic O G exploration  Additionally  the country reduced the capital expenditure uplift that is allowed over a given four year period to 22  from a prior   However  Russia has continued to promote the development of Arctic projects  notably through the  of export taxes from new offshore fields for a 5 to 15 year period  whereas previously export duties stood at approximately  460 per ton  This is contingent on 70  of offshore projects remaining under Russian ownership  However  even with low taxes it is hard to make a case for the immediate viability of the projects given the slump in oil prices  Oil prices will recover but Arctic projects remain on hold in the case of many O G companies  Should the industry thrive in the future  I see large  integrated O G firms such as Royal Dutch Shell as being in the best position to thrive  We have already seen that Shell has among the greatest capacity to continue drilling in the Arctic region  and the fact that Russian companies are dependent on Western expertise to conduct such projects means that it will likely prove difficult for Russia to be overly stringent in terms of Russian ownership policies  Therefore  I see larger firms like Shell having the most to gain from continued development in the region should prices rebound to vibrant levels medium to long term ",2015-02-09,Michael Grogan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-will-arctic-oil-and-gas-projects-fare-going-forward-241346,241346
193737,415253,CVX,Remarkable Energy Chart,opinion,"At first sight  the following chart is pretty jaw dropping 

Thus far in the month of December WTI crude oil is down more than 22  while the SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE   is up 1  This tremendous out performance by the large integrated energy companies that comprise the XLE  Chevron  NYSE CVX   Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   etc   is actually explainable  First of all  most large oil producers have sizable hedge books with price floors  many of these floors are currently around  70 barrel  which hedge much of their production 12 18 months out  Therefore  crude oil s decline during December  from around  70 barrel at the beginning of the month to below  54 barrel yesterday  does not have a huge near term impact upon large integrated oil producers  earnings Second  many analysts are forecasting a decent rebound in oil prices during 2015

193745,415261,CVX,Time To Walk Away From Energy ETFs ,opinion,"Talk about doom and gloom  Oil bears are predicting  40 per barrel  perhaps even  30 per barrel  Meanwhile  a whole lot of folks are treating the chatter like it is a foregone conclusion 
What would need to happen for oil to go from  110 per barrel at the height of Russia Ukraine tensions down to  30 per barrel and stay there  Oil producing exporters would need to vow never to cut production  ever  Countries exceptionally dependent on oil revenue  a la Russia  would need to accept their financial strife  rather than decide upon any form of military engagement  Central banks around the globe would need to decide that they are no longer interested in fighting against a deflationary spiral  And hell would need to freeze over  since demand from every corner of the earth would need to disappear entirely 
Obviously  economic hardship across the globe has been a damper on demand  Clearly  the decision by producers around the world to keep producing  coupled with increasing oil production capacity in the United States  increases supply  It follows that the laws of supply and demand are not favorable for the near term direction of oil prices  Yet even if a future shock emulates 2008 s systemic breakdown of the financial system or resembles 2011 s sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone  an oil price collapse would recover to levels that reflect cyclical changes  In other words  oil could momentarily see  120 or  40  but you should be thinking  80 per barrel 
What can you do in the meantime  Some folks are suggesting that you abandon energy ETFs  In theory  those that have been long funds like SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE  probably should lighten up  though they would have been better served by selling XLE in September when the price moved below and stay below its 200 day trendline 

Yet before repudiating everything associated with energy   from hybrid and electric car makers to drillers to energy infrastructure   one might want to revisit the notion of longer term  value    In particular  I am thinking about the integrated corporations like Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX   Not only are they high yielding stocks with 3  plus yields   not only are they dividend aristocrats with 25 plus years of increasing their dividend payments   but ExxonMobil s CEO recently explained that they are positioned to succeed at oil prices between  40 and  120 
Form a fundamental standpoint  P Es below 12 and P S ratios near 1 0 for both corporations are remarkably favorable  The broader stock market is pushing valuations that defy common sense  yet enjoy the tailwinds of easy monetary policy  low rates  technical uptrends as well as relative strength 
I am not saying that XOM is destined to pop in a Santa Claus rally  It s a valuation play in the Warren Buffett mold as well as a contrarian selection in an unpopular space  It may be below its 200 day moving average  but it even has a series of higher lows in 2014   something that you cannot say about the broader energy play in XLE 

In truth  Chevron may be a little bit riskier and a little bit trickier  Yet it is still a high yielding dividend aristocrat with an attractive valuation  What s more  you could not ask for more cash on its balance sheet  If oil gets much uglier  it might be able to make strategic acquisitions in the oil and gas space   They d do that  of course  because they realize oil will eventually recover to more favorable levels  i e    75  80 per barrel  
Naturally  if I am dead wrong about every last aspect of the near term or long term future for the energy sector  I am able to reduce the risk of loss with stop limit loss orders  Moreover  as the creator of the FTSE Multi Asset Stock Hedge Index  I have yet another tool in the protection shed ",2014-12-04,Gary Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/time-to-walk-away-from-energy-etfs-234725,234725
193746,415262,CVX,The Other Side Of Low Oil Prices  Fewer Exploration And Pipeline Project,opinion,"With oil hovering around  70 a barrel  oil and gas companies must make decisions on 800 proposed projects worth a total of  500 billion  An oil analyst told Reuters that up to  150 billion worth of the those projects  because of the low oil prices   Some projects require higher energy prices to be cost effective 
Oil companies are trying to access more complex and hard to reach fields located in some cases deep under the sea  but the cost of production has risen sharply  and given the rising cost of raw materials and the need for expensive new technology to reach the oil  many projects are simply no longer feasible  The price of oil has plunged by 40  in the last 5 months to around  70 a barrel

 NEW YORK  July 29  Reuters    Stocks ended the worst week
in a year as time runs out on Washington to reach agreement
before the U S  government loses its ability to borrow money 
 The S P 500 fell every day this week and was down 3 9
percent for the week as legislators failed to work out an
agreement to raise the federal borrowing limit  which expires
on Tuesday  Investors also worry about the likelihood of a U S 
credit downgrade 
 The CBOE Market Volatility Index   a gauge of
investor fear  jumped as much as 9 percent to its highest level
since mid March before paring its rise 
 Natalie Trunow  chief investment officer of equities at
Calvert Investment Management in Bethesda  Maryland  said
investors are taking a more defensive stance  possibly moving
more into cash 
  It s frustrating for investors and for U S  citizens to
see this unfold in the way it has been   she said 
  From an overall asset allocation standpoint  in an
environment like this  you get bigger moves into cash and safe
havens  
 The Dow Jones industrial average  was down 96 87
points  or 0 79 percent  at 12 143 24  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  was down 8 39 points  or 0 65 percent  at
1 292 28  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 9 87
points  or 0 36 percent  at 2 756 38 
  U S  President Barack Obama told Republicans and Democrats
to find a way  out of this mess   The United States will be
unable to borrow money to pay its bills if Congress does not
raise the debt limit by Aug  2  For details  see
 ID nN1E76S004 
 A second attempt for a vote in the House of Representatives
is expected after the close of trading on Friday after a bill
was modified to try to win over more conservative lawmakers 
The measure has little chance of passing in the Senate 
however 
 At least one credit rating agency has said it is likely to
lower the United States  prized tripe A rating if the cuts in
Washington don t go far enough 
  Will the deal be enough to satisfy the credit rating
agencies is really what s at stake here   Trunow said  whose
firm manages about  14 8 billion 
 The S P utility index  is down 2 1 percent for the
week  while the Dow is down 4 2 percent and the Nasdaq is down
3 6 percent for the week 
 The S P 500 briefly fell below its 200 day moving average 
seen as key support  and bounced back from its worst levels of
the day 
 Weak economic data also weighed on equities  The U S 
economy stumbled badly in the first half of this year and came
dangerously close to contracting in the January March period

193756,415272,CVX,European shares rally from two year low,news,"  FTSEurofirst 300 rises 2 3 percent  bouncing from 2 yr low
   German court rejects lawsuits aiming to block bailouts
   Banks gain

 LONDON  Sept 7  Reuters    European shares rose sharply on
Wednesday  bouncing from a two year closing low  after a late
Wall Street rally on better than expected services sector data 	
 Stocks were up across the board  with the STOXX Europe 600
Banking Index up 3 3 percent  Greek banks 
rose 6 5 percent  	
 Shares extended gains slightly after a German court ruled
against blocking bailout packages 	
 Germany s Constitutional Court rejected a series of lawsuits
aimed at blocking Germany s participation in bailout packages
for Greece and other euro zone countries  but said parliament
must have a bigger say in future rescues  	
The country s highest court in Karlsruhe said the German
government must seek the approval of parliament s budget
committee before granting such aid  a requirement which could
further slow down Europe s response to the debt crisis  	
 It was in line with expectations  We got a brief pop higher
in equity markets  It doesn t really change much  except the
perception that the euro might collapse  if the Germans ruled
 bailouts  unconstitutional  so that fear has gone in the short
term  But it doesn t change the underlying fundamentals   said
Michael Hewson  market analyst at CMC Markets 	
 At 0901 GMT  the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
European shares was up 2 3 percent at 924 54 points  after
falling 0 7 percent in the previous session to its lowest close
since July 2009  	
 The index has lost more than 17 percent in 2011 	
 Across Europe  Britain s FTSE 100 rose 2 3 percent 
Germany s DAX was up 2 9 percent and France s CAC40
 rose 2 8 percent  	
 The Euro STOXX 50 rose 2 8 percent to 2139 25 
but technical analysts were bearish  	
  The decisive breakdown below 2 147 has set the stage for a
retest of the 2009 low around 1 826   said Richard Ross  global
technical strategist at Auerbach Grayson  	
 Recent weakness had made equities look cheap 	
  There is this nagging fear that valuations don t really
count for anything  Investors need more confirmation suggesting
it s best to stick to companies with robust balance sheets that
are paying cash in the form of higher dividends   said Jeremy
Batstone Carr  strategist at Charles Stanley 	
 He said cyclical stocks might gain most if the rally were to
be extended 	
 European banks have fallen more than 33 percent in
2011  the Basic Resources Index is down more than 28
percent  	
  It is possible that the falls we have seen are
over reacting to the global crisis  The implication is that
profits will fall  whereas global growth is still perceived to
be positive   Batstone Carr said  	
 Swiss company Richemont   home to luxury brands such
as Cartier  rose 4 6 percent after beating expectations for
five month sales  helped by Asia  	
 Richemont extended gains from the previous session  when
Swiss stocks surged 4 4 percent after the Swiss National
Bank said it would set a minimum exchange rate target of 1 20
francs to the euro   	
 BP gained 3 4 percent after the British oil major
made a deep water discovery in the Gulf of Mexico with its
partner U S  firm Chevron Corp   the operator of the
well  	
 Wall Street pared losses on Tuesday  after the pace of
expansion in the U S  services sector was shown to have
unexpectedly accelerated in August

193758,415274,CVX,Prepare For A Historic Turnaround In Mexico,opinion,"If we needed any more proof that government run industries are destined for disaster  just look at Mexico 
To date  the country s oil and gas sector has been under the control of the government and its proxy  Pemex 
Like most countries with government controlled assets  any profits generated by the industry end up being diverted elsewhere  As a result  the country is experiencing the lowest level of oil production in 24 years 
In many parts of Mexico  electricity is more costly per kilowatt hour than in the United States  And given its paltry exploration efforts  it currently relies on imports for natural gas 
That said  there s still a huge opportunity brewing south of the border 
In fact  while it might seem unthinkable  the potential for a Mexican energy boom could be just as massive as the one in the United States 
Time to Live up to Its Full Potential
There s no question that there s a ton of opportunity in Mexico 
The country s northern border is simply a line on the map  not in the ground   meaning that the resource rich Eagle Ford Shale extends into Mexico 
The offshore oil in the Gulf of Mexico still offers huge potential to companies rich enough to develop deepwater real estate  BP  NYSE BP   for instance  is still pouring hundreds of million of dollars into Gulf operations  despite the tens of billions it had to pay out because of the deepwater Macondo oil spill 
Indeed  with over 10 billion barrels in proven reserves  oil is a major component of Mexico s future 
Yet in terms of production  the country currently rates 10th in the world 
But that could change very soon 
As I  a few months ago  Mexico is taking steps to finally open up its oil and gas sector to private and foreign companies  And the added cash will serve to further develop the country s energy assets 
Investing in Mexico requires guts and deep pockets  however  The country has issues with narcotics trafficking  violence  and corruption  It s kind of like the Nigeria of the Southern Americas  That is  it s rich in both resources and those who would line their pockets with the proceeds 
As a result  while a lot of smaller players would probably like to participate  the first round of assets will go to the bigger players 
When Mexico does open its doors  we should see a huge impact on future earnings for three major players in particular  Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM   BP and Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  
These companies have experience drilling and exploring in emerging markets  They have the financial resources to fund major campaigns  And they re hungry for more assets  especially in the Americas   where  despite issues that I mentioned above  the environment is still more stable than in other regions where they operate 
Mexico s oil production is declining after hitting a peak in 2004  The gas production is less than 10  of what the United States produces  And the country barely even makes the top 40 in proven reserves 
That all spells potential   and maybe the next biggest energy investment boom in the Americas 
And  the chase  continues

Federal Reserve  Fed  policy continues to raise the uncertainty premium  Ask market agents when the Fed will make its first interest rate hike  the answers range from early 2015 to 2017  Ask Fed speakers and you get a similar range  Connect the Fed s dots and see an array of Fed forecasts way above the current market option pricing of the future path of interest rates  Who is right  the Fed with what they are saying  or the markets with what they believe  Markets establish prices with real money bets by skilled market agents  Feddies opine and then revise opinions in their next quarterly revelation  At Cumberland Advisors we think the skilled market agents have the better forecast  We would reconsider this conclusion if the Fed actually gave us the forecast and matched it with the name of the forecasting member of the FOMC  But now the Fed only gives us the dots and keeps the names of the forecasters private  Transparency  Or is it purposeful opacity  Hmmm 
Stocks get pummeled as uncertainty rises and volatility seeks its way back to a new normal  The world watches the VIX every day in the lower right hand corner of the Bloomberg TV screen  It is repriced every minute  Everyone runs into the VIX when the market falls and sells the VIX when the market rises  Is the VIX a forward looking indicator  Maybe  But maybe not  Is it now reactive because everyone watches it  In that case  it has lost its value as a forward looking indicator  The question is debatable  That is what Goodhart s Law is all about   Google     
Separate accounts allow investors to see everything they hold every single minute in real time  Separate accounts allow the investor to ask the manager why something was bought or sold and the reasoning behind the transaction  The investor can request an explanation of rationale or policy  the principle behind the decision  and the macro view driving it 
Investors have huge questions about the world right now  Investors and their agents seek clarity and understanding  They can achieve this goal most effectively in separately managed accounts with full transparency and personal explanations  Or they can choose opacity or fuzziness  To be perfectly clear  at Cumberland we do not use  unconstrained  funds 
Ebola vaccines will start to roll out in 2015  Oil prices will reach a bottom somewhere below the marginal cost of production  That will start to change behavior in the Energy patch  Cycles go in both directions  Volatility is now returning to what it was before the 2007 onset of the financial crisis and the 2009 onset of central bank policies  zero interest rates  that suppressed volatility for the last five years 
And finally  a most disturbing news item this morning  
We now have to ask the hardest question in American politics  It is a throwback to the Richard Nixon era   What did the president know and when did he know it   The New York Times is reporting that chemical weapons were found by American forces in Iraq between 2004 and 2011  and the information was not released by the Pentagon  That really gives us huge pause  The report suggests that neither Congress nor American citizens were fully informed  The Pentagon was following orders issued by the administrations of Presidents Bush and Obama 
For both presidents the question remains   What did the president know and when did he know it

 NEW YORK  June 9  Reuters    Wall Street edged higher on
Thursday after six days of losses as a narrowed U S  trade
deficit was seen as one positive point for growth in a recent
avalanche of weak economic data 
 But the mood remained fragile with many analysts expecting
the S P 500 to retest its March 2010 lows after falling more
than 6 percent since a peak in May  and the latest data from
the labor market provided little room for optimism 
  We re basically trading off technicals   said William
Larkin  a portfolio manager with Cabot Money Management in
Salem  Massachusetts 
  We re going to be in a very active trading range  and we
just need a couple of key warnings    on consumer confidence

support at 1 250  its March low  according to analysts at Brown
Brothers Harriman in New York 
 U S  stocks have held in a pattern recently of selling off
in the second half of the day as investors look for a bottom 
 The U S  trade deficit narrowed unexpectedly in April  as
U S  exports rose to a record and imports from Japan tumbled
more than 25 percent in the aftermath of the March earthquake 
tsunami and nuclear disaster  a U S  government report showed
on Thursday 
 The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment
benefits rose by 1 000 last week  however  according to a
report on Thursday that could add to fears the labor market
recovery has stalled

 NEW YORK  June 28  Reuters    U S  stocks rose for a second
day on Tuesday as optimism grew that a solution to the Greek
debt problem was near  boosting investor appetite for risky
assets as equities recouped some of their recent losses 
 Buyers snapped up shares after the S P 500 s 7 percent
swoon since April  mostly in commodities and technology shares 
as investors sought to raise their exposure going into the end
of the quarter and before earnings season next month 
  The greater risk to the market is that the news is not
negative and we rally on good earnings   said Marc Pado  U S 
market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald   Co in San Francisco 
  The more the market pushes higher  the more it makes the
people who are under exposed nervous   he said 
 There was a strong move into riskier cyclical areas of the
market such as energy  retail and materials  Those sectors 
which are more sensitive to shifts in the economy  have
underperformed the market so far this year 
 The S P energy index  surged nearly 2 5 percent  the
biggest gainer among S P sectors  Halliburton Co  gained
5 9 percent to  48 94  while Chevron Corp  was up 1 4
percent at  100 30

 NEW YORK  July 29  Reuters    U S  stocks dropped for a
fifth straight day on Friday after weak data on the economy and
a setback on a debt deal discouraged investors  pushing the S P
500 briefly below a key technical level 
 The Dow  the Nasdaq as well as the S P fell more than 1
percent early in the session  but soon pared losses after the
S P hit its 200 day moving average  an important level of

spending barely rose amid higher gasoline prices  For details

sentiment fell in July to its lowest point in more than two

happens  we won t get much economic growth in the second half

 NEW YORK  May 6  Reuters    U S  stocks were set for a
higher open on Friday  putting the S P on track to snap a
four day losing streak  after an unexpectedly strong payrolls
report eased fears about the path of the economic recovery 
 U S  nonfarm payrolls rose 244 000 last month  the most in
11 months  the Labor Department said on Friday  well above
economist  expectations for a 186 000 increase 
 U S  crude oil futures  which had slumped on Thursday after
a patch of soft economic data during the week  pared earlier
losses and were flat at  99 82 a barrel  ICE Brent futures rose
0 3 percent to  111 10 
 Exxon Mobil Corp rose 0 9 percent to  83 33 and Chevron
Corp gained 0 9 percent to  103 50 
  Surprisingly good  strong number here    this reminds
everyone that we are still on the path of recovery   said Jeff
Kleintop  chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston 
  This might even put a bid back in commodities which have
suffered so tremendously this week on the fear that there is no
more need for an inflation hedge  
 S P 500 futures gained 12 20 points and were well above
fair value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures jumped 100
points and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 23 points 
 Wall Street stock indexes fell for a fourth straight day on
Thursday as a massive sell off in commodities spilled over into
other markets  forcing investors out of higher risk assets and
rattling equities markets before Friday s U S  payrolls data 
 Friday marks the one year anniversary of the  flash crash

 The benchmark S P 500 has fallen 2 1 percent this week on a

commodity prices on Thursday as concerns rose over
deteriorating demand

 NEW YORK  May 6  Reuters    An unexpectedly strong U S 
payrolls report propelled stocks higher on Friday one day after
a selloff  but investors were wary that the market s
months long rally may be near a peak 
 All three major indexes rose more than 1 percent after U S 
non farm payrolls increased by 244 000 in April  the most in 11
months and well above economists  expectations for an increase
of 186 000 
  The risk has definitely increased for a correction  The
decline in commodities this week was sort of the start of it  
said James Dailey  a portfolio manager at TEAM Asset Strategy
Fund in Harrisburg  Pennsylvania 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 152 20 points  or
1 21 percent  at 12 736 37  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index was
up 15 94 points  or 1 19 percent  at 1 351 04  The Nasdaq
Composite Index was up 31 87 points  or 1 13 percent  at
2 846 59 
 Dailey said the S P 500 s next technical level to the
upside was 1 400   but we won t go there until some sort of a
correction  
 The benchmark S P 500 had fallen 2 1 percent this week
before Friday s advance  On Thursday commodities led selloffs
in several markets on concerns over deteriorating demand 
 The iShares Silver Trust suffered outflows of more than  1
billion in the week ended Wednesday  its worst one week outflow
ever  plus heavy losses due to the slump in the price of
silver 
 U S  crude oil futures  which had slumped on Thursday after
a batch of soft economic data during the week  pared early
losses and rose 1 8 percent to  101 57 
 Dailey said that while the broader market could see a 5 10
percent correction  emerging markets and sectors leveraged to
commodities could see up to a 20 percent decline 
 Exxon Mobil Corp rose 1 4 percent to  83 81 and Chevron
Corp gained 1 5 percent to  104 15  The PHLX Oil service sector
index rose 2 5 percent 
 Friday marks the one year anniversary of the  flash crash 
on Wall Street when the Dow lost nearly 700 points in minutes 
 The CBOE volatility index    dropped 8 8 percent to 16 60
after closing at its highest level on Thursday since March 28 
 Gains were also seen in materials related stocks  with the
S P materials index up 1 9 percent  led by a 3 3 percent rise
in mining company Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold to  51 49

 NEW YORK  May 23  Reuters    A wave of fear that Europe s

The Standard   Poor s 500 Index   declined 17 52 points 
or 1 31 percent  to 1 315 75 and the Nasdaq Composite Index
  fell 46 90 points  or 1 67 percent  to 2 756 42 
  There are some signs that suggest the market is oversold
in the near term  but I see a significance built into this
decline  I wouldn t be surprised to see S P down to 1 300 
1 280 levels   said James Dailey  portfolio manager at TEAM
Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg  Pennsylvania 
  Unlike before  I don t see the market brushing off the
European issues this time because there are heightened concerns
about the global industrial slowdown   said Dailey 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300 index hit a five week
closing low and turned negative for the year  losing 1 7
percent to end at 1 116 52 points  Emerging market equities
 slumped 2 4 percent and leading world stocks
 were down 1 9 percent 
 The euro fell to a record low against the safe haven Swiss
franc   The single currency was down 1 percent against
the dollar  at  1 4015  Against the Japanese yen  the
dollar  rose 0 16 percent to 81 82 yen 
 The dollar index  rose 1 1 percent  which dented
commodity prices and shares of commodity sensitive shares 
Alcoa Inc  lost 2 6 percent to  15 85  Freeport McMoRan
Copper   Gold  fell 3 percent to  46 92 
 U S  light sweet crude oil  fell  3 03  or 3 03
percent  to   97 07 per barrel  and gold  was unchanged
at  1 511 50 an ounce 
 A stronger dollar often pressures dollar denominated oil
prices by raising the price for consumers using other
currencies and pulling investment from commodities 
 Chevron Corp  dipped 1 6 percent to  100 92  while
the PHLX oil service sector index  shed 2 3 percent 
 Europe s crisis appeared to deepen as the ruling Spanish
Socialists were hit by stinging losses in local elections and
now face walking a tightrope between voter anger over sky high
unemployment and investor demands for strict austerity
measures 
 Investors are increasingly concerned that voter rebellions
against austerity plans could cause bailouts and budgetary pact
agreements to unravel  leaving large swathes of debt in
jeopardy of default 
 Speculation also mounted over a possible restructuring of
Greek debt  pressuring the euro 
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou discussed new
emergency measures to cut Greece s deficit in a bid to convince
leaders the country can avoid a restructuring 
  The premiums charged by investors to hold Italian and
Spanish 10 year bonds rather than safe haven German bunds rose
to their highest levels since January  at 186 and 261 basis
points respectively   ID nLDE74M094 
 Government bonds outside the euro zone periphery rallied as
investors sought higher quality and easily traded assets 
 Benchmark 10 year Treasury  yields fell 0 04
percentage point to 3 11 percent  after earlier touching a
five month low of 3 09 percent 
  The key point is that the crisis seems to be taking hold
even of peripheral countries regarded as solid   said WestLB
rate strategist Michael Leister   Sentiment is that there
appears to be no end to it now Italy is being scrutinized by
the ratings agencies

193790,415306,CVX,Chevron Corp  EPS Report May Be Problematic,opinion,"Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings before the market opens on Friday  May 2nd  Chevron is one of the biggest names in oil and energy  Energy and utility stocks have been the leaders so far in 2014  Chevron stock opened the year with a nasty selloff but has since rebounded to start of 2014 prices  The Estimize community has high expectations for the energy companies on the bottom line this period  but revenue forecasts are generally coming in well below the Street s this quarter  Thursday morning the Estimize community accurately predicted that fellow energy giant Exxon Mobil would beat EPS estimates by a wide margin but come up way short on revenue  Contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are expecting a similar story from Chevron on Friday 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Chevron to report  2 53 EPS and  66 445B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 19 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  2 68 EPS and  61 695B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Chevron to both beat Wall Street s EPS projections and miss the Street s revenue estimates by a wide margin 
Over the past 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Chevron s EPS and revenue 3 and 5 times respectively  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a wider than usual difference of estimates between Estimize and Wall Street 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  2 52 to  3 11 EPS and from  55 000B to  67 230B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a wide range of estimates on Chevron 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of EPS estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Throughout the quarter Wall Street lowered its EPS consensus for Chevron from  2 94 to  2 53 while the Estimize consensus fell from  3 07 to  2 68  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus rose before the report from a low of  59 522B to  66 445B while the Estimize consensus also popped up at the end of the period from  59 332B to  61 695B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and often a leading indicator  for Chevron this quarter we see falling EPS estimates and rising revenue expectations from both groups going in to the report 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects  2 57 EPS and  66 846B in revenue  turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is ranked 3rd overall among over 4 350 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 59  and 54  of the time respectively throughout over 2000 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case turbinecity is one of very few analysts on the Estimize platform expecting Chevron to beat revenue estimates this quarter 
The Estimize community expects Chevron to follow suit with Exxon Mobil on Friday by reporting higher earnings than expected while coming up short on revenue  Unfortunately for Exxon Mobil shares were trading down midday on Thursday as the oil stocks tend to trade on oil production and increasing revenue rather than the number on the bottom line

193791,415307,CVX,How To Avoid the Worst Style ETFs,opinion,"Picking from the multitude of style ETFs is a daunting task  In any given style there may be as many as 49 different ETFs  and there are at least 237 ETFs across all styles 
Why are there so many ETFs  The answer is  because ETF providers are making lots of money selling them  The number of ETFs has little to do with serving investors  best interests  Below are three red flags investors can use to avoid the worst ETFs 
Inadequate liquidity
High fees
Poor quality holdings
I address these red flags in order of difficulty  Advice on  is here  Details on the  
How To Avoid ETFs with Inadequate Liquidity
This is the easiest issue to avoid  and my advice is simple  Avoid all ETFs with less than  100 million in assets  Low asset levels tend to mean lower volume in the ETF and large bid ask spreads 
How To Avoid High Fees
ETFs should be cheap  but not all of them are  The first step here is to know what is cheap and expensive 
To ensure you are paying at or below average fees  invest only in ETFs with an expense ratio below 0 45   which is the average expense ratio of the 237 US equity style ETFs I cover  Weighting the expense ratios by assets under management  the average expense ratio is lower at 0 20   A lower weighted average is a good sign that investors are putting money in the cheaper ETFs 
Figure 1 shows the most and least expensive style ETFs in the US equity universe based on total annual costs  ProShares provides 3 of the most expensive ETFs while Schwab ETFs are among the cheapest 
Figure 1  5 Least and Most Expensive Style ETFs

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
AdvisorShares Madrona Forward Domestic ETF  FWDD K  and ProShares Ultra QQQ  ARCA QLD  are two of the most expensive U S  equity ETFs I cover  while Schwab U S  Broad Market ETF  SCHB K  and Schwab U S  Large Cap ETF  SCHX K  are the least expensive  The more expensive FWDD and QLD receive my 3 star or Neutral rating  while the cheapest ETFs also receive my 3 Star rating  One of the most expensive ETFs  FWDD earns a better rating than one of the cheapest ETFs  Quality holdings can make up for high costs 
However  investors need not pay high fees for good holdings  Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF  SCHD K  is my fifth highest rated style ETF and earns my Neutral rating  It also has low total annual costs of only 0 04  
On the other hand  Schwab U S  Mid Cap ETF  SCHM K  holds poor stocks  And no matter how cheap an ETF  if it holds bad stocks  its performance will be bad 
This result highlights why investors should not choose ETFs based only on price  The quality of holdings matters more than price 
How To Avoid ETFs with the Worst Holdings
This step is by far the hardest  but it is also the most important because an ETF s performance is determined more by its holdings than its costs  Figure 2 shows the ETFs within each style with the worst holdings or portfolio management ratings  The styles are listed in descending order by overall rating as detailed in my 
Figure 2  Style ETFs with the Worst Holdings

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
My overall ratings on ETFs are based primarily on my stock ratings of their holdings  My firm covers over 3000 stocks and is known for the due diligence done on each stock we cover 
First Trust and ProShares appear more often than any other providers in Figure 2  which means that they offer the most ETFs with the worst holdings  ProShares Ultra Russell2000 Value has the worst holdings of all Small Cap Value ETFs  IWC  FNY  VXF  FAD  and RYJ all have the worst holdings in their respective styles 
Note that no ETFs with a Dangerous portfolio management rating earn an overall rating better than two stars  These scores are consistent with my belief that the quality of an ETF is more about its holdings than its costs  If the ETF s holdings are dangerous  then the overall rating cannot be better than dangerous because one cannot expect the performance of the ETF to be any better than the performance of its holdings 
Figure 2 reveals that one of the cheapest ETFs  Vanguard Extended Market ETF  VXF   gets my Dangerous rating because its holdings get my Dangerous rating  Similarly  PowerShares RAFI Fundamental Pure Mid Value Portfolio  PXMV   also one of the cheapest ETFs  gets a Dangerous portfolio management rating and  therefore  cannot earn anything better than a 2 star or Dangerous overall rating  Again  the ETF s overall rating cannot be any better than the rating of its holdings 
The Danger Within
Buying an ETF without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances  As Barron s says  investors should know the Danger Within  Put another way  research on ETF holdings is necessary due diligence because an ETF s performance is only as good as its holdings  performance 
PERFORMANCE OF ETF s HOLDINGs   PERFORMANCE OF ETF
Best   Worst Stocks In these ETFs
Baker Hughes  Inc   BHI  is one of my least favorite stocks held by FWDD and earns my Dangerous rating  Over the past seven years  BHI s after tax profit  NOPAT  had declined by 1  compounded annually  The company s return on invested capital  ROIC  is now a bottom quintile 4   down from 13  in 2006  BHI has generated negative economic earnings for five straight years as well  Despite the declining fundamentals  BHI s stock price is up over 50  in the last year  which has made it overvalued  To justify its current price of   70 share  BHI would need to grow NOPAT by 12  compounded annually for the next 53 years  Double digit profit growth  over that time frame  is highly unlikely  Investors should avoid BHI 
Chevron Corp  NYSE CVX  is one of my favorite stocks held by SCHV and earns my Attractive rating  Over the past decade  CVX has grown NOPAT by 10  compounded annually  Even though 2013 was a down year for profits  CVX s ROIC of 9  still matches Exxon Mobil  XOM  and surpasses ConocoPhillips  COP  at 6   Despite this impressive profit growth and strong profitability  CVX remains undervalued  At the current price of   125 share  CVX has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 1 1  This ratio implies that the market expects CVX to grow NOPAT by only 10  for the remaining life of the company  This expectation seems rather low given CVX s long term track record

193792,415308,CVX,Bill Newman  Go For Black Gold In Argentina,opinion,"It s been a long time since the Repsol fiasco in Argentina  and the oil rich nation has been making steady efforts to encourage foreign investment in its energy sector  Bill Newman  vice president of international oil and gas with Mackie Research Capital  insists investors should focus less on political risk and more on the world class Vaca Muerta shale play  In this interview with The Energy Report  Newman names oil and gas majors and junior explorers making progress  and recommends a few names that are taking advantage of Argentina s production incentives 
The Energy Report  Let s talk about the macro economic picture for Argentina in terms of energy  What is the story there with the country s growing deficit  the devaluation of the peso and the reliance on energy imports 
Bill Newman  Production of both oil and natural gas in Argentina has been declining for years  At the same time  demand has been increasing  This is accelerating Argentina s energy deficit  The Argentina government understands that in order to slow production declines and eventually return to energy self sufficiency  a substantial increase in investment will be required  and a large portion of that capital will have to come from foreign investment  The bottom line is that the government knows it needs to attract capital  and that could translate into modest improvements to the energy sector in order to promote that investment 
In January 2014  we saw a rapid devaluation of the peso  The peso has subsequently stabilized but there is still some risk of further devaluation  Oil and gas is priced in U S  dollars  which somewhat mitigates the impact of the falling peso  Producers could have lower operational costs in the short term  as most expenses are paid in pesos  Inflation remains a problem in Argentina  and the government is actively taking measures to prevent social unrest by negotiating with unions for higher wages to compensate for the weaker peso  But the government understands that increased foreign investment is one tool that could help to resolve the issue 
TER   Is Argentina increasingly attractive to foreign investors 
BN  It s no surprise that the expropriation of Repsol s 51  holding in Yacimientos Petrol feros Fiscales  YPF  in April 2012 jolted investor confidence  But ever since then  the government has been trying to repair the damage by introducing new incentives to promote investment by energy companies  Argentina has also been working toward improving its reputation on the international stage through negotiations with the debt holdouts  and successfully negotiated a compensation settlement with Repsol  REP  for the expropriated shares  This really is a complete turnaround from the direction the government was taking in early 2012  We think these efforts have reduced the perceived investment risk of Argentina  and that is starting to be reflected by increased investment  If Argentina holds the course  investors should start to focus less on political risk and focus more on the world class Vaca Muerta shale play 
TER   What is the significance of the YPF  5 billion   5B  settlement with Repsol 
BN  A large portion of the land that is prospective in the Neuqu n Basin of the Vaca Muerta is held by YPF  so major oil companies looking for a meaningful position in the play might have to complete a deal with YPF  Before the settlement  most companies that were hoping to joint venture with YPF put their plans on hold  The  5B settlement is a signal to the market that the government is serious about repairing its reputation on the world stage  and the move should open the door for new joint ventures in 2014  With the improving outlook  many companies have announced expanded plans for Argentina  Royal Dutch Shell A  RDSa  plans to invest  500 million   500M  into the unconventional shale plays in Argentina in 2014  which is approximately three times the amount the company invested in 2013  Also  Petrobras no longer has its Argentina subsidiary up for sale and instead now expects to make a large investment in Argentina this year 
TER   What is the story behind the  1 6B joint venture Chevron Corp   CVX  recently announced with YPF 
BN  The  1 6B investment is the second stage of the joint venture between Chevron and YPF to develop the Vaca Muerta shale play on the Loma Campana block  The first phase  which was a  1 24B investment  was completed early this year  and production from the Vaca Muerta shale is now about 20 000 barrels per day  20 000 bbl d   The second investment includes 170 wells  and longer term plans could include up to 1 500 wells and an increase in production up to 50 000 bbl d and 100 million cubic feet per day  100 MMcf d  of natural gas  We see the second Chevron YPF investment as another vote of confidence for the Vaca Muerta shale play in Argentina 
TER   Who is drilling in the Vaca Muerta play  and with what kind of success 
BN  According to the U S  Energy Information Administration  Argentina has the fourth largest technically recoverable shale oil resource and the fourth largest technically recoverable shale gas resource in the world  most of which is located in the Neuqu n Basin  The EIA estimates that the Neuqu n Basin alone holds a recoverable resource of 16 billion barrels and 308 trillion cubic feet of natural gas  so that s a massive prize  The supermajors currently appraising the shale include Chevron  Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM   Shell  Total S A   TOT  and BP Plc  BP  through its ownership in Pan American Energy  PAEYE   Petrobras  PBR  also has holds a significant interest  The three Canadian based junior oil and gas exploration companies that we cover with operations in Argentina are Americas Petrogas Inc   BOE   Madalena Energy Inc   MVN  and Crown Point Energy Inc   CWV 

Americas Petrogas holds a very large land base in the Neuqu n Basin  which the company acquired many years before the shale play took off  There has been a lot of activity by the supermajors on blocks directly offsetting its Los Toldos blocks  In April 2014  Shell farmed into two blocks held by Total  which are located near Americas Petrogas  Los Toldos I block  Rumors are Shell paid approximately  6 000 acre  Also in April  YPF and Chevron announced another  140 million joint venture to drill nine exploration shale wells on the Narambuena block  Chevron also plans to drill four wells targeting the Vaca Muerta shale on the El Trapial block  A lot of money is being spent on lands very near to America Petrogas  lands  which could help derisk the play  In September of last year  Americas Petrogas announced a formal strategic review process to attract new joint venture partners or buyers  and we think the  5B settlement to Repsol and the increase exploration activity can only help with the process 
Madalena has been a very active driller in the Neuqu n Basin  The company recently drilled two Vaca Muerta exploration wells on the Coiron Amargo block  which will be fracture stimulated and tested in Q2 14  The Coiron Amargo block is located within the prime Vaca Muerta shale oil window and just to the east of the Loma Campana block  where Chevron and YPF are drilling  Madalena is also having a lot of success by drilling horizontal wells to achieve high flow rates from the conventional Sierras Blancas formation  So far the company has discovered six Sierras Blancas light oil pools on the Coiron Amargo block  But Madalena has shown the best way to develop the play is with unstimulated horizontal wells  In January 2014  Madalena announced that the CAN xr 2 h  horizontal well tested up to 2 235 barrels of oil equivalent  2 235 boe d   and in April the CAN 15 h  well  a second horizontal well targeting the largest Sierras Blancas structure  tested at 1 945 boe d from only a portion of the horizontal leg  The company plans to drill three more horizontal Sierras Blancas wells this year  which should boost its production in Argentina  Madalena now has two high impact plays to appraise on the Coiron Amargo block 
Near the Coiron Amargo block  Madalena holds a 90  working interest in the Curamhueleblock  The region could be the next hot area for shale exploration  As we mentioned  Chevron plans to drill four wells targeting the Vaca Muerta shale on its El Trapial block  which is directly adjacent to Madalena s Curamhueleblock  Madalena also sees a lot of potential in the Lower Agrio formation  which is another shale play on the Curamhuele block  With the success of the Sierras Blancas wells and all the shale wells that are scheduled to be tested  we think Madalena could add a lot of value in 2014 
TER  How are Crown Point s financial fundamentals looking this year  in light of its operational story 
BN  Crown Point s current focus is on growing its conventional natural gas production through a low risk drilling program in Tierra del Fuego  which is located on the southern tip of Argentina  The company also has conventional and shale oil potential on its 100  owned Cerro de Los Leones block in the Neuqu n Basin  Crown Point didn t drill any wells last year because it was waiting for governmental approval for an extension of Tierra del Fuego concessions  which it has received  Crown Point just started a 10 well drilling program consisting of eight development wells and two exploration wells  so we expect production to grow from approximately 1 600 boe d to over 2 000 boe d by year end  Natural gas prices have been steadily rising in Argentina  which has really improved the economics of the play  Also  last year the government introduced a new natural gas price incentive program that  in effect  sets the natural gas price to  7 50 million British thermal units for production above a baseline  Crown Point has applied for the program  so if the company is approved  it could have a big impact on cash flow  Investment in Tierra del Fuego is really picking up  and a few weeks ago YPF announced plans to invest  700 million   700M  in Tierra del Fuego over a 10 year period 
One other near term catalyst is that Crown Point is currently testing the La Hoyada x 1 exploration well on the Cerro de Los Leones block  which it drilled earlier this year  We are hoping for a test of over 200 bbl d 
TER  Are there any other energy firms that you have your eye on in Argentina 
BN  I ve been watching a company call Apco Oil   Gas International Inc   APAGF   which is 69  owned by WPX Energy Inc   WPX   APCO is partnered with Madalena on the Coiron Amargo block and with Crown Point in Tierra del Fuego  Apco really has a large land position in the oil window of the Vaca Muerta shale play

193793,415309,CVX,Oil And Gas Stock Roundup  CVX  XOM,opinion,"Crude Oil prices registered a big weekly loss on weaker than expected U S  economic data  while natural gas was propelled by the forecasts of warmer temperatures 
Among the newsmakers  U S  supermajor Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX  said that it is on track to grow production by 20  to 3 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2017  while larger rival Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM  shipped first cargo from its  19 billion Papua New Guinea plant         
Crude Oil 
Crude prices edged down last week  as the dismal GDP data renewed concerns about the U S  economy s growth outlook  Sentiments were further dampened by a fall in the country s April consumer spending   the first drop this year  Geopolitical forces also played their part in bringing down crude prices  with Ukraine s presidential election results being viewed as a step towards easing confrontation in the region  
However  to some extent the bears were offset by strong fuel demand   particularly motor gasoline   and continued decline in storage at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
As a result of these factors  by close of trade on Friday  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  oil settled at around  102 71 per barrel  shedding 2 2  for the week       
Natural Gas 
Natural Gas rallied last week on expectations of an uptick in electric power demand with the imminent arrival of summer months  This was partially offset by a bearish supply data 
The commodity found support from the impending onset of warmer than normal summertime mercury readings that is likely to boost gas fired electricity demand for air conditioning 
However  some of the gain was lost by the EIA s weekly inventory release  which showed natural gas stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 114 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended May 23  above the guided range  of 107 111 Bcf build  
Influenced by these factors  natural gas prices ended Friday at  4 54 per million Btu  MMBtu   up 3 1  over the week 
Energy Week That Was 
The week s energy coverage was dominated by the following news  
Chevron Production Growth Target on Track 
In its 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders  U S  energy giant Chevron Corp  declared that its production growth target is on track  The company intends to reach a production level of 3 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2017  marking 20  increase from the 2013 output 
Further growth can be expected toward the end of the decade  Chevron has over 70 projects in the pipeline  due to start by 2020  Amongst the major upcoming projects  the Gorgon and Wheatstone natural gas initiatives in Australia are progressing well  with expected start ups in 2015 and 2016  respectively  
Exxon s  19B Project Ships First Cargo
Last week  U S  energy giant Exxon Mobil Corp s  19 billion Papua New Guinea  PNG  liquefied natural gas  LNG  project dispatched its first cargo ahead of schedule  Operated by affiliate Exxon Mobil PNG Ltd   PNG LNG is anticipated to generate over 9 trillion cubic feet of gas over its estimated 30 years of operation 
Japan s Tokyo Electric Power Co  Inc  will be the recipient of the first cargo  The facility   whose construction started in 2010   is an integrated development that comprises gas production and processing facilities in the Southern Highlands  Hela  Western  Gulf and Central provinces of PNG 
BP Spillover Case Review Rejected by Court
Oil giant BP  NYSE BP  ongoing court case tied to its 2010 Gulf of Mexico  GoM  oil spill suffered a setback on Wednesday  In a 2 1 judgment  the 5th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals rejected BP s bid to stop payments to businesses that have not proved their damage from the spill  The company has already appealed to the U S  Supreme Court to review the court order on the settlement  The bone of contention per the company is that the lower court ruling will force it to pay for economic damages to business without the claimants having to prove their losses resulted from the spill 
Encana s PrairieSky IPO a Success 
Canada s Encana Corporation  NYSE ECA  announced the closure of its PrairieSky Royalty Ltd  initial public offering  IPO   The 52 million shares offered in the IPO were priced at  28 00 per share  Encana received gross proceeds of roughly C 1 46 billion  Canada s largest IPO in over a decade officially opened business on May 29 and made a superb start  Shares of PrairieSky gained around 32  to close at  37 per share in the Toronto stock exchange  substantially higher than its  28 sale price  Encana shares also gained about 1 5  on the day to close at  23 28 
PetroChina Parent May Invest  2B in Peru 
China National Petroleum Corporation   CNPC     the parent company of Chinese energy giant Petrochina  NYSE PTR    intends to invest roughly  2 billion in Peru over a period of 10 years  Latin America has caught China s attention for its natural gas resources that could fuel the Asian country s future economic growth  This led the Chinese state owned firm CNPC to expand its presence over there  CNPC has already started operations at Colombia  Ecuador  Cuba  Brazil  Costa Rica and Venezuela

193799,415315,CVX,Danger Zone  Energy Sector Funds,opinion,"Energy sector ETFs and mutual funds are in the Danger Zone this week  Despite the quality of stocks in the sector  ETF providers and fund managers are not offering quality funds  Even worse  they are charging disproportionately high fees for these low quality funds 
Poor Stock Picking
76 out of 273 stocks held by Energy ETFs and mutual funds  58  of the market cap  earn a Neutral or better rating  Despite this fact  none of the 19 ETFs and only 2 of the 85 mutual funds in the Energy sector even manage to earn a Neutral rating  Figure 1 has details 

Source  New Constructs  LLC 

Energy came in eighth out of ten sectors in my first quarter  Sector Rankings for ETFs and Mutual Funds  report  It ranks behind the seventh place Materials sector even though only 54   versus 58  for Energy  of the stocks by market cap in the Materials sector earn a Neutral or better rating 
Ivy Global Natural Resources Fund  IGNAX  exhibits some of the worst stock picking in the Energy sector  It does not allocate any money to Attractive or better stocks while 42  of its assets are allocated to Dangerous or worse holdings 
Anadarko Petroleum Cop  APC  is one of my least favorite stocks held by IGNAX and earns my Very Dangerous rating  APC s after tax profit  NOPAT  in 2012 was roughly the same as in 2005  but its return on invested capital  ROIC  has shrunk from 13  to 5  over that timeframe  Liabilities that subtract from APC s equity value  which include adjusted total debt  underfunded pensions  and deferred tax liabilities  add up to  31 billion  76  of market cap   Rather than reflecting these liabilities  APC s stock is priced for significant growth  APC s valuation of   80 share implies that the company will grow NOPAT by 10  compounded annually for 32 years  It s hard to see why an investor would want to bet the company will surpass those high expectations 
Heavy allocation to APC and other overvalued stocks like it earn IGNAX my Very Dangerous rating and put Energy sector funds in the Danger Zone 
High Fees
IGNAX is also guilty of the other major sin that many Energy ETFs and mutual funds commit  It charges exceedingly high total annual costs of 4 10   11 of the 85 mutual funds in the Energy sector charge total annual costs of over 4   Similarly  8 out of 19 Energy ETFs charge total annual costs of over 0 60   For comparison  only 2 out of 8 Utilities ETFs charge total annual costs above 0 60  and only 2 of 33 mutual funds in the Utilities sector charge over 4  a year  Figure 2 confirms that Energy funds are the most expensive 

Source  New Constructs  LLC 

Figure 2 takes into account both ETFs and mutual funds  Only Information Technology funds have a higher average cost  but Energy funds are the costliest when weighted by assets under management  Energy funds are almost four times costlier than Consumer Staples funds  Not coincidentally  Consumer Staples is my top rated sector 
Energy funds should not get away with charging such high fees for such poor stock picking  The fact that weighted average costs are below the average costs for the sector shows that investors are favoring the cheaper funds  which is a good sign  but too many high cost funds remain 
The Best of the Worst
Only two mutual funds  WorldCommodity Fund  WCOMX  and ICON Energy Fund  ICENX  earn a Neutral rating in the Energy sector  ECOMX has only  2 million in assets  but ICENX has a respectable  752 million in assets  ICENX also charges below average  for this sector  total annual costs of 1 56  
ICENX s portfolio is much stronger than most others in the Energy sector  Over 13  of its assets are allocated to Attractive stocks  while only 22  of its assets are in Dangerous or worse stocks  This portfolio is not great by any means  but  at least  it s enough to earn ICENX my Neutral rating 
Chevron  CVX  is one of my favorite stocks held by ICENX and earns my Attractive rating  From 2002 to 2012 CVX grew NOPAT by 20  compounded annually while increasing ROIC from 4  to 11   2013 was not a great year for CVX  but its strong track record suggests that the decrease in profits was a blip rather than the start of a trend  For long term investors  CVX s recent earnings disappointment is a boon  as it gives them an opportunity to get in at lower prices  Down 11  already in 2014  CVX looks enticingly cheap right now  At its current valuation of   111 share  CVX has a price to economic book value ratio of only 0 75  which implies a permanent 25  decrease in NOPAT from its 2012 level  I can t see a company as well run as CVX experience such a large profit decline for an extended period of time 
ICENX still holds plenty of poor stocks  but its allocation to CVX and other undervalued companies helps balance out the bad  Normally  ICENX would be a middle of the road fund  but in the poor Energy sector it manages to rise to the top  If ICENX is the best this sector can do  investors would be better off buying individual stocks instead and not paying any management fees

193800,415316,CVX,How To Avoid The Worst Sector ETFs,opinion,"Picking from the multitude of sector ETFs is a daunting task  In any given sector there may be as many as 45 different ETFs  and there are at least 183 ETFs across all sectors 
Why are there so many ETFs  The answer is  because ETF providers are making lots of money selling them  The number of ETFs has little to do with serving investors  best interests  Below are three red flags investors can use to avoid the worst ETFs 
Inadequate liquidity
High fees
Poor quality holdings
I address these red flags in order of difficulty  Advice on  is here  Details on the  
How To Avoid ETFs with Inadequate Liquidity
This is the easiest issue to avoid  and my advice is simple  Avoid all ETFs with less than  100 million in assets  Low asset levels tend to mean lower volume in the ETF and large bid ask spreads 
How To Avoid High Fees
ETFs should be cheap  but not all of them are  The first step here is to know what is cheap and expensive 
To ensure you are paying at or below average fees  invest only in ETFs with an expense ratio below 0 52   which is the average expense ratio of the 183 US equity ETFs I cover  Weighting the expense ratios by assets under management  the average expense ratio is lower at 0 33   A lower weighted average is a good sign that investors are putting money in the cheaper ETFs 
Figure 1 shows the most and least expensive sector ETFs in the US equity universe based on   Direxion provides three of the most expensive ETFs while Fidelity ETFs are among the cheapest 
Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Direxion Daily Natural Gas Related Bull 3x Share  GASL  and ProShares Ultra Consumer Services  UCC  are two of the most expensive U S  equity ETFs I cover  while Schwab U S  REIT  SCHH  and Vanguard REIT  VNQ  are the least expensive  The more expensive RETL and UCC receive my 2 star or Dangerous rating  while the cheapest ETFs also receive my 2 Star rating  One of the most expensive ETFs  Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3x Shares  FAS   earns a better rating than three of the cheapest ETFs  Quality holdings can make up for high costs 
However  investors need not pay high fees for good holdings  Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF  FSTA  is my highest rated sector ETF and earns my Attractive rating  It also has low total annual costs of only 0 13  
On the other hand  SCHH and VNQ hold poor stocks  And no matter how cheap an ETF  if it holds bad stocks  its performance will be bad 
This result highlights why investors should not choose ETFs based only on price  The quality of holdings matters more than price 
How To Avoid ETFs with the Worst Holdings
This step is by far the hardest  but it is also the most important because an ETF s performance is determined more by its holdings than its costs  Figure 2 shows the ETFs within each sector with the worst holdings or   The sectors are listed in descending order by overall rating as detailed in my  

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings

My  are based primarily on my  of their holdings  My firm covers over 3000 stocks and is known for the due diligence done on each stock we cover 
iShares  PowerShares and SPDR ETFs appear more often than any other providers in Figure 2  which means that they offer the most ETFs with the worst holdings  iShares FTSE NAREIT Industrial Office Capped Index Fund  FNIO  has the worst holdings of all Financials ETFs  PowerShares Dynamic Food   Beverage  PowerShares Lux Nanotech Portfolio  PXN   iShares Dow Jones U S  Home Construction Index Fund  ITB   State Street SPDR S P Telecom ETF  XTL  and PowerShares S P Small Cap Utilities Portfolio  PSCU  all have the worst holdings in their respective sectors 
Note that no ETFs with a Dangerous  earn an overall rating better than two stars  These scores are consistent with my belief that the quality of an ETF is more about its holdings than its costs  If the ETF s holdings are dangerous  then the overall rating cannot be better than dangerous because one cannot expect the performance of the ETF to be any better than the performance of its holdings 
Figure 2 reveals that one of the cheapest ETFs  PSCU  gets my Dangerous rating because its holdings get my Dangerous rating  Similarly  SPDR S P Biotech ETF  XBI   also one of the cheapest ETFs  gets a Dangerous portfolio management rating and  therefore  cannot earn anything better than a 2 star or Dangerous overall rating  Again  the ETF s overall rating cannot be any better than the rating of its holdings 
Find the ETFs with the worst overall ratings on my   More analysis of the  
The Danger Within
Buying an ETF without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances  As Barron s says  investors should know the   Put another way  research on ETF holdings is necessary due diligence because an ETF s performance is only as good as its holdings  performance

Best   Worst Stocks In these ETFs
Amazon com Inc   AMZN  is one of my least favorite stocks held by RETL and UCC and receives my Very Dangerous rating  Over the past five years  AMZN s after tax profits  NOPAT  have declined by 1  compounded annually  Over the same time frame AMZN s return on invested capital  ROIC  has decreased from 27  to a bottom quintile 4   As I wrote in   and   AMZN s valuation implies an unrealistic level of profitability and growth  AMZN s recent track record does not suggest it can achieve significant NOPAT growth  In 2013  AMZN s NOPAT margin continued its decline to 0 7   down from 1  the year before  At the current price of  361 share  the market expects AMZN to increase NOPAT by 26  compounded annually for 24 years  In the highly competitive arena of online retail this expectation seems highly unrealistic  especially when coupled with AMZN s shrinking margins 
Chevron Corporation  CVX  is one of my favorite stocks held by FENY and receives my Attractive rating  Over the past decade  CVX has increased after tax profits    by 20  compounded annually and currently earns a return on invested capital  ROIC  of 11   Despite this consistent growth  CVX remains undervalued  At   112 share  CVX has a price to economic book value    ratio of 0 75  This ratio implies that the market expects CVX s NOPAT to permanently decline by 25   With such pessimistic expectations and a strong history of growth  CVX presents a great opportunity for investors

193801,415317,CVX,Russian Aggression Paves Way For Ukrainian Energy Independence,opinion,"As Ukraine s Crimean Peninsula is lost to Russia  with a referendum on the peninsula s independence planned for Sunday and the specter of a Russian military advance on eastern Ukraine looming large  we are witnessing a crisis of international proportions  The key to this crisis is energy 
Russia s aggressive move on the Crimea may in fact be the international catalyst Ukraine needs to pave its own energy independence with a little help from its friends  As the standoff between pro Russian and Ukrainian forces in the Crimea continues following the ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych  and as Western officials scramble to loosen Russia s grip on Ukraine  energy independence is the critical axis on which it all spins 
There is a way out  former Ukrainian deputy prime minister Yuri Boyko tells Oilprice com that US gas could play a vital role in the end game for Kiev  There are two revolutions here that need to come together  the political revolution in Ukraine and the shale gas revolution in America  Where these two meet is where Russian dominance ends 
Yuri Boyko is the Former Vice Prime Minister for Energy  Space and Industry  as well as the former Minister of Energy and Chairman of the Ukrainian State Gas Industry 
In an exclusive interview with James Stafford of   Boyko discusses 
     How the American shale gas revolution could help Ukraine      The single most important weapon in Russia s arsenal      Why Europe will be hesitant to sanction Russia over Crimea      Why we need to change the balance of power in Central Europe      Why America should export LNG to Ukraine      Why  reverse flow  to Europe is important      How Europe can fight back      What Ukraine needs from Washington      Why the next big Gulf of Mexico style auction should in the Black Sea
Oilprice com  The knee jerk reaction would be that Russian aggression in the Crimea is a red flag for investors  but is it possible that we re looking at a potential new opportunity here  perhaps a catalyst for a new era of Ukrainian energy independence 
Yuri Boyko  Absolutely  What Moscow wants out of all of this is to halt Ukraine s European integration process and to delay its signing of the AA DCFTA  Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement   It would also like more control over key strategic assets  particularly the gas transit system  But  Moscow s actions in Crimea after the ouster of Yanukovych in February could very easily spur Ukraine s move towards Europe and away from Russia  Now more than ever  the West and Ukrainians themselves see the need for energy independence and the connection this has to the Western world 
Oilprice com  The  has changed the geopolitical landscape of energy for America and perhaps for the world  What could this mean for Ukraine  its current crisis and threats emanating from Russia 
Yuri Boyko  I believe that with support from Washington and the European capitals  energy can be an important tool in preserving Ukrainian sovereignty in the face of the recent Russian aggression in Crimea and its threats against Eastern Ukraine 
Ukraine s new government in Kiev needs Washington s support on energy as part of an overall effort that includes sanctions  both in the short  and long term  in order to change the balance of power in Central Europe  Today  Ukraine produces approximately 35  of its natural gas supply  the rest coming largely from Russia  Last week  Gazprom again threatened to cut off the gas to further pressure Kiev and its European allies 
More specifically  we need support for efforts to ship LNG  liquefied natural gas  to Ukraine  Efforts were already underway to establish an American made floating offshore terminal that could receive shipments  LNG arriving offshore Ukraine under an American flagged vessel would be a powerful and important way to support Ukraine  The same should be promoted for Europe  America could become an exporter of gas to Europe to offset Russian influence 
Oilprice com  What about Europe  What role can Europe play when it is also hostage to Russian gas 
Yuri Boyko  Natural gas is the single  in Russia s arsenal  It is President Vladimir Putin s weapon of choice  Europe understands this all too well as most of its natural gas supply transits Ukraine  so supply disruption is used to influence events not only in Ukraine  but also Berlin  Paris and Brussels  This is why Europe will be hesitant to apply strong sanctions against Russia 
Oilprice com  Where can Europe fight back 
Yuri Boyko  The US needs to work with European allies to halt the construction of the South Stream pipeline which is planned to run from Russia under the Black Sea through Turkish waters  then up through Southeastern Europe and into the EU   It is majority owned by Gazprom  and like the North Stream pipeline under the Baltic  it was designed to circumvent and isolate Ukraine politically and economically from Europe 
We also need support for continued  reverse flow  sales of European gas to Ukraine   Ukraine recently purchased gas back from Germany that had transited Ukraine at a discount to the price charged Ukraine by Russia   This could include completion of the much discussed Odessa Brody pipeline for oil transit 
Oilprice com  Amid these defensive options against Russia  what is a longer term plan for Ukraine  for Ukrainian energy  and for oil and gas wealth buried in Ukrainian shale 
Yuri Boyko  This is where the new Ukrainian government will play a critical role  providing policy  technical and financial guarantees for American and European companies to develop our substantial natural gas reserves 
Chevron and Shell are currently in the process of exploring the massive shale fields in both the east and west of Ukraine  But Ukraine also needs oil field service providers  technical expertise and education programs to expand our own domestic supply as in the US 
Again  this is where Washington can help  by sending advisors to Kiev  perhaps from DOE  Department of Energy  and FERC  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission   to provide policy guidance to our Ministry of Energy to improve the systems and functioning of government as it relates to licensing  regulation and development of Ukraine s own oil and gas 
Beyond this  there is another interesting opportunity to offset Russian gas in Ukraine  What many people may not know is that Ukraine is one of the most efficient users of natural gas especially in heavy industry in the country s east  With a comprehensive energy efficiency assistance program  including experts from EBRD and other groups  further reduction of waste on an industrial level could offset a significant percentage of the gas purchased from Russia by some estimates up to 10

Oilprice com  What s the next step  What should Ukraine s new leaders be doing to get the shale ball rolling 
Yuri Boyko  Ukraine should launch a Black Sea and onshore auction process similar to the US auction of offshore blocks in the Gulf of Mexico   Ukraine and seismic companies could conduct surveys of shale and the Black Sea and then sell that seismic data in advance of an auction  The auction and the sale of seismic data alone to prospective bidders would pay for the seismic imaging  The attraction of this would be significant 
And while the major oil and gas companies have an important role to play here  it s important to understand that smaller  independent operators have an equally significant role to play  they are always drilling economic returns at rapid rates in Ukraine  And there is much more of that to be had 
Oilprice com  What is the message that needs to be sent to Moscow  to Washington  and to Brussels 
Yuri Boyko  Our allies must meet this challenge with us on energy   We need to ensure that Russia understands that energy warfare can only be a short term gamble 
Just prior to this crisis  as Vice Prime Minister  I traveled to Houston to promote Ukraine s energy and space industry  and had the opportunity to meet senior American executives in the oil and gas industry   The exchange was instructive  it was evident that the US has the knowledge and skills readily available that could help Ukraine take a step away from its energy dependence on Russia the way  America is moving away from its dependence on the Middle East for oil   Now Ukraine needs that knowledge  skill and investment for our survival as a nation ",2014-03-18,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/russian-aggression-paves-way-for-ukrainian-energy-independence-206335,206335
193802,415318,CVX,Small Oil Companies Eye Huge Prize In Ghana ,opinion,"Since the first discovery of the massive Jubilee oilfield in Ghana by a start up company  the West African playing field has begun to change  and so too have investor sentiments  disappointed most recently by the low fourth quarter 2013 results of major integrated oil companies like Exxon  NYSE XOM   Shell  RDSa   Chevron  NYSE CVX  and BP  BP  
But while the super majors are struggling with soaring project costs and poor balance sheets  innovative juniors and start ups are increasingly swooping in to take advantage of new highly prospective plays and as long as they don t come up dry they are turning into superstars overnight 
West Africa s emerging  is one of the best indicators of how the oil and gas playing field is undergoing a major transformation 
In 2007  a Dallas based start up company  Kosmos Energy  KOS   jumped on this scene to great fanfare  making the Jubilee field discovery  It was the company s first major discovery  and one of the largest discoveries in all of West Africa in two decades  First production came online in 2010 and average production today is about 104 000 110 000 bpd 
A record breaking inflow of offshore oil investment followed this discovery  bringing in British operator Tullow Oil  TLW LSE   which remains the key player in Jubilee  and a whole list of major oil and gas companies eying not only Ghana s Jubilee field  but everything in the West African vicinity 
But at the end of the day  it was a small  Dallas based start up that prompted the unparalleled development of oil and gas plays in West Africa 
Another start up  the African based subsidiary of CSE listed Gondwana Oil  is continuing the trend in Ghana  Earlier this week  the company won exclusive rights to negotiate for the offshore Cape Three Points South Block in the highly prospective Tano Basin  about 30 kilometers from Jubilee 
This particular block hopes to take off where Kosmos left off with Jubilee  The block is surrounded by 20 producing discoveries in an area that has a commercial success rate for drilling of over 60  
Gondwana is in a similar position to Kosmos when it made the Jubilee discovery 
So while there is some safety in the diversification of the major oil companies  it s also harder for investors to get big returns on a hot new play like Ghana  As such  investors are increasingly willing to risk on juniors and start ups who are focused on a single hotspot that promises a big reward   If these low market cap companies can actually get their hands on significant acreage in venues like Ghana  investors seem ready to take notice 
In the meantime  the bigger companies continue to make significant headway in with Ghana s oil  despite  including delays to the country s gas infrastructure  which means that associated gas is being lost to flaring or has to be re injected into wells 
 ENI  NYSE E  has been successful in the   not far from Jubilee  estimating that field holds around 150 million barrels of recoverable oil    NYSE HES  is also prioritizing Ghana  with seven successful wells so far in the Tano Basin and new exploration planned for this year ",2014-03-28,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/small-oil-companies-eye-huge-prize-in-ghana-207710,207710
193806,415322,CVX,Matt Badiali s Insider Tips From Energy Fronts In Kurdistan  Tuscaloosa,opinion,How can investors get exposure to the hottest new oil and gas plays without getting burned by conflict premiums abroad or regulatory hurdles in North America  Fresh off three months of travelling the globe  S A Resource Report Editor Matt Badiali shares his insights with The Energy Report readers on how to go where no one else wants to be and make a lot of money doing it    The Energy Report  You spent the last three months traveling and logging your discoveries with your   What are the major fundamental shifts that have caused the current downturn in natural resources    Matt Badiali  Oil prices are up and have been staying relatively high  higher than I thought they would  honestly  But there has just been destruction in precious metals  base metals  coal and uranium  There are two factors impacting the prices  The global economy is still in shambles  That hurts demand for natural resources    And there has been a cooling of China s growth  It is still growing like crazy  it s just not growing at the rate we have seen in the past  That s a function  in part  of the size of that economy  It is just enormous  It can t sustain a double figure growth rate  So we still see demand there  just not as great as it was    That reality has pushed down the prices of commodities  which in turn have made the commodity companies less profitable  and in some cases in the gold space  borderline money losers  Investors have pulled out of that market    We also have a bull market in the Standard   Poor s 500  Investors are fickle  They want to go where they re going to make money  Right now  a lot of the money has moved into the big blue chips    TER  Let s focus on the bright spot  oil and gas  You visited the Kurdistan region of Iraq  Can you describe to me what it was like to travel there  How were you treated  Did you feel safe  MB  This was one of the most highly anticipated trips I have ever taken  I woke up in the middle of the night a few times in preparation for this trip  The Western media makes Iraq sound like a live fire zone and that wasn t the case at all  Kurdistan is the northern region of Iraq  It touches Iran  Syria and Turkey  It s an independent  autonomous region within the country run by the Kurds  I flew in to the capital city  Erbil  or  Arbil   through Germany and I flew out through Dubai    I was shocked  It s the Middle East  I expected desert  camels and burkas  but it s not like that  It s high desert  it reminded me a lot of Colorado and Nevada  I saw lots of wheat fields  The people were wonderful  The women wore traditional or Western style clothes    Prior to my arrival  Kurdistan had not had a bombing six years  About three weeks before I went  the city was the victim of a bomb attack against its security apparatus  That put the whole country on alert  There were a lot of checkpoints in and outside the city    Just to get into my hotel  guards checked the car inside and out and underneath with a mirror  Inside the gate they passed my bags through an airport scanner  To go into the actual hotel  I had to go through a metal detector and a pat down  Then I was in this wonderful  Western style hotel  I had wireless Internet  all the modern conveniences  excellent food  I was surprised    The money that has poured into Kurdistan because of oil and gas is astonishing  They call it Little Dubai  Everywhere we looked  we saw massive infrastructure projects  Major companies are building there  Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM  is building a multi story headquarters there  Marriott had a gigantic new hotel project there  Hilton has two properties going in  All the oil service companies are there  I visited the Family Mall and short of the metal detector to get inside  you might as well be in Cincinnati  I felt like I could have been in the US    TER  Is there a premium price for doing business there    MB  You do have to pay a price for security  Inside the city  it s very safe  Outside the city  it s a little different  I didn t know what to expect  so I hired a security team  Each car came with two guards armed with AK 47s  That may have been overkill for some areas  And some places I wanted to go  like Kirkuk  they said it wasn t safe even with security    That added security has to impact the bottom line for companies to work there  For example  a typical well pad in Texas includes a trailer and a guard to keep wanderers out  But in Iraq  you build a compound and employ armed guards  Plus  the stakes are also higher in the Middle East because there is a lot more oil on each site  A well drilled on one of these Iraqi fields flowed 42 thousand barrels a day  42 Mbbl d   Compared to 300 barrels per day  bbl d   which is the typical output of a Texas Eagle Ford well  at  100 barrel  bbl  that s  4 2 million  4 2M  worth of oil every day    TER  Is production back to the level it was before the 2003 invasion    MB  No  and progress is slow  When Chevron Corp   CVX  and Exxon Mobil came in to southern Iraq to help bring the giant oil fields back online for Baghdad  they found navigating the red tape was impossible  There is also a lot of friction between the Iraqi Arabs and the Kurds so getting the oil out of Kurdistan is a challenge  It looks like there is an agreement now to ship it out through Turkey  but it is a political balancing act  I believe we re going to see a lot of oil coming out through Turkey within the next six years  The plan is to have 2 million barrels oil per day  MMbbl d  going from Kurdistan out through Turkey by 2019    TER  Is it mainly the juniors that are working on these projects or is this a job for the majors  Who s actually taking advantage of the opportunities there    MB  The juniors were the first movers  This area opened up not long after the war ended  A couple of Canadians led the way  ShaMaran Petroleum  SNM TSX   WesternZagros Resources Ltd   WZR TSX V  and Heritage Oil Corp   HOC TSX  HOIL LSE     Those companies made the initial discoveries  The problem is that a discovery is a science project until you can actually get the stuff to market  That s been the hard part  In fact  one of the fields in operation now uses 700 trucks day because there s currently no pipeline    The majors have started to quietly move in  There has been a lot of resistance and some false promises from Baghdad  Chevron and Total S A   TOT  are in Kurdistan now with all the other big companies  The attraction for the majors is that this is a part of the world where you can make a discovery that can materially replace reserves for even the biggest companies    The attraction for the Kurds is that the major oil companies will develop these fields the best  They have experience in the region  they know how to get the job done and they have clout  The little guys may be technically solid  but it s going to take more than solid technique here to get all this stuff done    So the answer is both  The juniors are in there now  The majors are moving in  and the majors are probably going to consolidate this area within the next two years    TER  I know you visited some juniors  What s an example of a junior that s operating in the area    MB  WesternZagros has a couple of big exploration blocks in the Kurdamir region of Kurdistan  I had a chance to meet with their geologists and members of the team  These people are well informed and technically savvy    They put together a great information session  which they allowed me to attend  The lead lecture was provided by an energy analyst who worked in the Bush White House and was a diplomat prior to jumping over to the private sector and working for the Kurds  He presented an excellent summary of the many influences affecting the oil and gas industry in Kurdistan    I was very impressed by WesternZagros  The company is educated on the region  which is critical to success  Companies have to be sensitive to the religious and political differences between the Kurds and the Arabs  The two groups are distinctly different  The Kurdish population is split and isolated due to the arbitrary boundaries drawn after World War II  These boundaries left isolated pockets of Kurds separated in three different countries    TER  Understanding that balancing act is probably key for WesternZagros to be able to operate successfully in the area    MB  Absolutely  And it s important for WesternZagros  investors to understand  too  Investors boarded a bus not an armored bus because this area really is very civilized and went to look at the property for themselves  WesternZagros  leases are in the southeast part of Kurdistan  on trend with the giant Kirkuk oil field  which up until the discovery of Ghawar in Saudi Arabia  was the largest in the world  The oil is lighter and sweeter  which makes it more valuable    The company has two production sharing contracts that are about 500 000 acres  It was the fourth international company to come into Kurdistan  so this company was an early mover  The company is fairly small  It has almost 5 billion barrels oil equivalent  Bboe  of prospective oil  It s an interesting little play  When the rollup happens  WesternZagros will be included in that group  absolutely    TER  If Iraq and Iran increase production in 2014  what impact could that have on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  and oil prices    MB  OPEC has decided it is going to hold total production steady  so it won t have a big impact on oil prices  but everyone else in OPEC has to produce less oil to do that and accommodate a new stream of 1 MMbbl d  The one good thing for OPEC members is that Libya is still offline and probably not coming back for a long time  That means there will be room to accommodate more crude oil    What will probably happen is that OPEC members will cheat  so they ll have their quota and some extra tankers will fill up  accidentally   We may see more oil on the market than the official totals  We ll have to wait and see if the demand can sop up that leakage    The U S  is importing a lot less oil from OPEC  but the majority of OPEC s oil was going to Asia anyway  So the big question will be  What s going to happen to China s demand  All indications are that the Chinese are in love with automobiles  which means the demand for oil will be there  We shouldn t see too much of a decline in oil prices    TER  Let s switch to North America  where the controversy is about fracking  Some communities have proposed bans  including Colorado  where you visited recently  As a trained geologist  please give us your perspective on the safety profile for fracking    MB  Fracking is only controversial because people don t understand it  It s been completely misrepresented  Fracking is not new  We ve been fracturing rocks in oil wells since the 1940s  Back then  they used  torpedoes  little metal gizmos filled with nitroglycerin they dropped down vertical oil wells and then ran like crazy  It would hit the bottom and blow up  We have been trying to crack rocks to release oil for 70 years    The true revolution isn t due to fracking  but rather to technology    The computer revolution that allowed us to have cellphones that are more powerful than desktops we had 10 years ago also had a dramatic affect on oil exploration  It allows us to drill a mile and a half down and a mile and a half sideways and end up at a spot the size of a coffee can  You can pick your point now  That s tremendous  We could never do that before    Shale beds are the source of the all the oil we have found so far  It is like a carpet soaked full of oil and gas  Drilling conventional oil fields is simply tapping the lucky spots in the rock  Places that happen to trap the oil as it moved out of the shale  Thanks to the computer revolution  we can move from trapped oil to the source of the oil itself    There is still a massive amount of oil and gas in the source rocks the shale  However  the layers are thin  relatively speaking  so you have to be precise  Our ability to crack these rocks in very precise increments and produce them unlocked the potential we are benefitting from today    Fracking is the one component of the shale revolution that people are afraid of  And they shouldn t be afraid  The techniques are safe  when done correctly    We don t use nitroglycerine anymore  Now we typically use a combination of water and guar gum  a food additive  It is very safe  The wells that are tapping shale are not near drinking water aquifers  in fact they are about a mile below the aquifers  for the most part  Some are deeper    Simple economics  water seeping into a well would make pumping too expensive  and strict laws ensure fracking will not mix petroleum with water sources  In addition to distance  safety precautions include casing the wells with solid steel tubes to prevent anything inside the well from getting out  If there is an accident  it is due to human error  not fracking  If you don t cement the casing in right  or you damage the casing and don t fix it  or you spill frack water into a creek those things cause problems    There are also laws and safety precautions around how the fracking water is treated once it is pumped out  If that spills  it s no different from a gas station  it can leak dangerous chemicals into the ground  That is why there is an entire industry built around cleaning up spills    At the heart of the  fracking controversy  is a large part of the population that would like renewable energy to be the only source of energy in the U S  They want to make biofuels  They want to use wind and solar energy  and that s it    In a period when we believed that oil supplies were running out and natural gas supplies were running out  there was a lot of political clout thrown at alternative energy as a national security issue  We had to import our oil from OPEC  and natural gas from Qatar  and it was scary  It was going to be expensive  and we were going to be beholden to foreign governments  and it was just a terrible  awful  scary thing    Now  instead of buying natural gas from Qatar for  14 thousand cubic feet  Mcf   it is available domestically for  1 80 Mcf because there s so much of it  In fact  we stopped drilling in lots of places because economically it didn t make sense  Cheap natural gas kills the ability of renewable energy to compete    It can work  but we re going to pay double or triple our current electric bills  The alternative energy faction doesn t want cheap hydrocarbons to continue to produce electricity because it hurts their cause  but it helps electricity users  private citizens and businesses    TER  We ve heard about problems with faster than expected decline rates in some shale wells  Can you explain how shale well development and life cycle is different from those of conventional wells    MB  There is a big decline rate  There absolutely is  Initial production will be the most oil or gas produced from a shale well in its lifetime  It s a pretty exponential decline  and then it flattens out  The thing that we don t have good data on right now is how long these wells will last because we just haven t been doing it long enough    The oil supply in the shale wells is different from the oil in a conventional well  Conventional wells tap a reservoir  You can think of it like a glass of iced tea  where the tea moves around the ice cubes  A conventional well is like putting a straw in and sucking the iced tea out  If you put two straws in it will lower the iced tea in the glass a lot faster    With a shale well  you aren t dealing with a reservoir  The reason we have to crack the rocks is that the shale is a dense rock saturated with oil  Each shale well is its own glass of iced tea  That means you can put shale wells close together and they don t sip from the same glass  That means the volume of oil you can get out of a shale layer is much larger than you would get out of a conventional oil field    We re seeing that with the Bakken  The Bakken is the big giant oil shale up in North Dakota that no one believed would ever produce oil  The original by the U S  Geological Survey  USGS  estimation was for 151 MMbbl oil total  They were so wrong  The production rates just keep going up  Since 2008  the Bakken has produced 450 MMbbl oil  That s three times the initial estimate    It defies all the arguments that rapid declines in shale wells are going to bust this trend  I look at this and I see the innovation equivalent of the Internet for energy  Cheap energy is the best possible thing that ever happened to North America and to the U S  People need to understand just how transformative cheap energy really is to their lives    TER  Also  not all shale is alike  How much of the success of a well is based on geology and the type of oil and gas in the resource versus location  the ability to move that resource to consumers  How much is just good management    MB  You hit the nail on the head  You need several things  You need the right rocks  There have been some colossal failures in shale plays  There have been some false starts  SandRidge Energy Inc   SD  raised a lot of money to develop the Mississippian  which is actually in Oklahoma   And it made promises about production rates  but the rocks it drilled initially turned out to be better than the rest of the trend play  So the company couldn t fulfill the promises because there just wasn t enough oil  The geologists didn t have the technical understanding of the rocks they should have had before they borrowed all that money  SandRidge imploded and the stock was demolished  Having the right rocks is critical    Takeaway capacity is also critical  There was a time when companies were sitting on hundreds of wells that had been drilled but not completed because they didn t have pipeline capacity to get the stuff out  I m sure you ve heard what s happening up in the Bakken Formation where they re hauling oil by rail    These days  it s as hard politically to get a pipeline permit as it is to actually build one  There is the whole Not In My Backyard  NIMBY  factor  People like the idea of domestic oil production  but they don t want an oil pipeline anywhere near their houses  So they re putting it on railcar  It s twice as expensive to move oil by rail as it is to put it in a pipeline and nowhere near as safe  But it is expedient and sometimes the only option  I think we re going to see a lot more rail because you just can t get pipelines permitted    TER  Is that more of a problem in Canada than in the Midwest    MB  I think it s equal  I think there s going to be more political pressure for Canada to build some big pipelines  Historically  all of Canada s pipelines pointed south because the world s largest consumer of oil and gas is in the US    Now the U S  is importing less because it produces its own higher quality crude  That makes the new market for Canada s oil either Europe or Asia  However  it has to build a pipeline across the country or get the Keystone Pipeline through the middle of the U S  to the ports in Houston    It is a no brainer in my opinion  We should let Canadian crude oil come to our ports  Cheap energy could be an enormous boost for both our economies  We re already seeing it  BMW relocated a plant to the U S  An Egyptian fertilizer company is building a plant in Iowa  A gas to liquids plant is going to Louisiana in a parish where the unemployment rate was ridiculous  This is the sort of thing that can happen when you have cheap  abundant energy  I m a huge fan    But because it is so difficult to get oil to market  places in the Bakken are selling crude at a discount to West Texas Intermediate  WTI   Canada s crude oil is trading at massive discounts  It s hard for oil companies to make money when they can t get it to the markets that have the demand    TER  Let s talk about some of these places  According to the   nine of the 10 best places to invest in oil and gas exploration worldwide are in North America  the top three being Oklahoma  Mississippi and Saskatchewan  I understand that the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale in Mississippi and Alabama is one of your favorites  How does it compare with the other shale resources    MB  It s new  so it s really an unknown commodity right now  What we ve seen in each of the shale plays is that the first moving companies figure out the peculiar combination of the best rocks and the best development techniques  For example  Continental Resources Inc   CLR  is the Bakken company  It has been one of the most amazing success stories in the shale plays  period  Coming out of 2009  Continental was a  14 stock  It touched  121 share in October of this year because of production growth out of the Bakken shale  The company has done the work and found the best way to drill the Bakken  and the numbers prove it  Continental has a tremendous story  Several other companies have done the same thing in their own particular shales    Sanchez Energy Corp   SN  is another great example  Sanchez ownership has been active in the Eagle Ford and now it is bringing that expertise to the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale in Mississippi and Louisiana  The Tuscaloosa Marine Shale is an analog to the Eagle Ford  When the sea level was higher  it was part of the basin  That means it has great basics the right rocks  with the right combination of organic carbon and thickness  It should be an ideal place to use understanding of shale to develop a new region    A few small companies operate there  Lots of infrastructure is already in place  I think it will do very well    TER  Compared to Continental  does a company like Sanchez have more upward room to grow    MB  Yes  it s a scale thing  Continental is a  19 billion  B  company  It takes a lot of new oil production to generate material growth for Continental  Sanchez  on the other hand  is fairly small  It just had its initial public offering  It s a  1B company  so it has lots of room to run  It doesn t take anywhere near as much oil production for a company like Sanchez to grow  Companies like Sanchez that are hungry  smart and run by great operators will really benefit as production increases    TER  You mentioned the Eagle Ford Shale  I ve heard that production targets estimate tripling production there in 20 years  Who is going to be the beneficiary of all of that growth    MB  A lot of companies are down there nowadays  When Eagle Ford initially opened up  nobody thought it extended more than a couple of counties in southeastern Texas  Now  it extends under the border of Mexico and it s moving north toward Houston  This play just continues to get bigger  The problem is none of the companies there are cheap anymore  I do like the companies that are going to be transporting that oil out of the Eagle Ford  the pipeline plays  There are some interesting plays in logistics    TER  Any other insights for investors preparing for 2014    MB  I m going to give you an insider tip  The secret to investing in commodities is to look at what people hate  Go to the places where people think you are nuts    For instance  I like coal because it s cheap  Coal mines are going out of business left and right  but there are companies in the space making a lot of money  I told my readers to buy Peabody Energy Corp   BTU   Peabody is basically the Exxon Mobil of the coal space  It has operations in the least expensive district in the U S   the Powder River basin  It owns the world s largest coal mine and it produces coal in Australia that gets sent to Asia    In the U S   coal was just destroyed by low natural gas prices  But in the rest of the world  coal is in high demand  Japan is shifting to coal from nuclear  Germany is doing the same  China burns an enormous amount of coal  The Chinese government is shutting down several coal mines a week because they aren t safe    That means investors who are willing to hold their nose and invest where other people aren t investing can buy the biggest player in the space for really cheap  Then you can send me a thank you note next year    TER  Thank you     is the editor of the   a monthly

193807,415323,CVX,Friday s Oil And Gas Outlook,opinion,"OUTLOOK
Crude Oil Expectations of an improving economy and bullish supply data have strengthened oil prices to around  100 per barrel  Crude s recent run has been spurred by the Federal Reserve s measured Taper announcement  The central bank    asserting that the U S  economy was strong enough    stated that it will reduce bond repurchases by  10 billion  bringing its monetary stimulus to  75 billion a month from Jan 2014    This has fueled hopes for robust fuel and energy demand in the world s biggest oil consumer  The bullish momentum was further propelled by positive revision to third quarter GDP numbers and continued decline in U S  supplies  Partly offsetting this favorable view has been a spike in domestic production    now at their highest levels since 1988    and suggestions of increase in Libyan oil exports following months of political turmoil   The immediate outlook for oil  however  remains positive given the commodity s constrained supply picture  In particular  while the Western economies exhibit sluggish growth prospects  global oil consumption is expected to get a boost from sustained strength in China  the Middle East  Central and South America that continue to expand at a healthy rate  According to the Energy Information Administration  EIA   which provides official energy statistics from the U S  Government  world crude consumption grew by an estimated 1 1 million barrels per day in 2013 to a record high level of 90 3 million barrels per day  The agency  in its most recent Short Term Energy Outlook  said that it expects global oil demand growth by another 1 2 million barrels per day in 2014  Importantly  EIA s latest report assumes that world supply is also likely to go up by 1 2 million barrels per day in 2014  In our view  crude prices in the first half of 2014 are likely to exhibit a sideways to bearish trend  trading in the  90  100 per barrel range  As North American supply remains strong and the groundbreaking agreement with Iran makes it easier for the country to sell the commodity  we are likely to experience a pressure in the price of a barrel of oil Natural Gas Over the last few years  a quiet revolution has been reshaping the energy business in the U S  The success of  shale gas     natural gas trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations    has transformed domestic energy supply  with a potentially inexpensive and abundant new source of fuel for the world s largest energy consumer  With the advent of hydraulic fracturing  or fracking     a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water  sand and chemicals    shale gas production is now booming in the U S  Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract gas from shale formations  the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U S  energy supplies  playing a key role in boosting domestic natural gas reserves  As a result  once faced with a looming deficit  natural gas is now available in abundance  In fact  natural gas inventories in underground storage hit an all time high of 3 929 trillion cubic feet  Tcf  in 2012  The oversupply of natural gas pushed down prices to a 10 year low of  1 82 per million Btu  MMBtu  during late April 2012  referring to spot prices at the Henry Hub  the benchmark supply point in Louisiana     Investors continue to focus on temperature patterns to understand the fuel s economic dynamics  As it is  natural gas fundamentals look uninspiring with supplies remaining ample in the face of underwhelming demand  In fact  it is expected to take many years for the commodity s demand to match supply in the face of newer projects  Despite these issues  natural gas rallied to a two year high recently on the back of persistent decreases in natural gas supplies and forecasts of freezing cold weather conditions  which boost natural gas demand for space heating by residential commercial consumers ZACKS INDUSTRY RANK Oil Energy is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification  We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry  The way to look at the complete list of 260  industries is that the outlook for the top one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower  is positive  the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one third  Zacks Industry Rank  177 and higher  is negative  The oil energy industry is further sub divided into the following industries at the expanded level  Oil   U S  Integrated  Oil and Gas Drilling  Oil   U S  Exploration and Production  Oil Gas Production Pipeline MLP   Oilfield Services  Oil   International Integrated  Oil   Production Pipeline  Oilfield Machineries and Equipment  Oil C  Integrated  and Oil Refining and Marketing  The  Oil and Gas Drilling  is the best placed among them with its Zacks Industry Rank  29  comfortably placing it into the top 1 3rd of the 260  industry groups  where it is joined by the Oil Refining and Marketing   with a Zacks Industry Rank  74  The  Oil Gas Production Pipeline MLP     with a Zacks Industry Rank  96    moves out of the top 1 3rd and into the middle 1 3rd  The  Oil   U S  Exploration and Production  also lie in the middle 1 3rd  with Zacks Industry Rank  149  However  all the other sub sectors    Oil   Production Pipeline  Oil C  Integrated  Oilfield Services  Oil   International Integrated  Oil   U S  Integrated  and Oilfield Machineries and Equipment    are featuring in the bottom one third of all Zacks industries with respective Zacks Industry Ranks of  181   191   206   208   214 and  237  respectively  Looking at the exact location of these industries  one could say that the general outlook for the oil energy space as a whole is neutral to negative EARNINGS TRENDS As far as overall results of the Oil Energy sector is concerned  it displays an encouraging trend  While earnings fell 8 4  in the third quarter of 2013  it improved from the 11 2  drop witnessed in the previous quarter  What s more  there was a marked enhancement in revenue performance  which was up 2 8  in the September quarter as against a decline of 5 4  in the second quarter  The sector had a mixed performance in terms of beat ratios  percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises   The earnings  beat ratio  was an impressive 62 2   but the revenue  beat ratio  was underwhelming  at 37 8  OPPORTUNITIES Considering the turbulent market dynamics of the energy industry  we always advocate the relatively low risk conglomerate business structures of the large cap integrateds  with their fortress like balance sheets  ample free cash flows even in a low oil price environment and growing dividends  Our preferred name in this group remains Chevron Corp   CVX   Its current oil and gas development project pipeline is among the best in the industry  boasting large  multiyear projects  Additionally  Chevron possesses one of the healthiest balance sheets among peers  which helps it to capitalize on investment opportunities with the option to make strategic acquisitions  While all crude focused stocks stand to benefit from rising commodity prices  companies in the exploration and production  E P  sector are the best placed  as they will be able to extract more value for their products  In particular  we suggest exposure to small cap  undervalued E P players like Harvest Natural Resources Inc   HNR  and Abraxas Petroleum Corp   AXAS   which enjoy the benefits of crude oil price leverage  One may also capitalize on this opportunity with the related business sector of energy equipment service providers  Our top pick in this space is Dril Quip Inc   DRQ   This offshore drilling equipment maker boasts of highly engineered drilling and production equipment for deepwater severe service applications and harsh environmental conditions  Further  we remain optimistic on the near term prospects of Halliburton Co   HAL   The oilfield services behemoth    among the top three players in each of its product service categories    is enjoying strong demand for its services in international markets and expects the trend to continue in the coming quarters  The company s inexpensive valuation and a favorable DOJ verdict over its role in the Macondo oil spill lend additional support  Within the contract drilling group  we like Helmerich   Payne Inc   HP   Supported by a superior and diversified drilling fleet  together with a healthy financial profile  we expect the company to sustain its profitability over the foreseeable future  We believe Helmerich s technologically advanced FlexRigs will continue to benefit from an upswing in U S  land drilling activity and the shift to complex onshore plays that require highly intensive solutions  Offshore drilling giant Transocean Ltd   RIG  is also a top pick  With its technologically advanced and versatile offshore drilling fleet  strong backlog and considerable pricing power  the company offers an unmatched level of earnings and cash flow visibility  The recent dividend approval and the settlement of a host of civil criminal claims associated with the Deepwater Horizon incident have also eased the overhang on the stock  Finally  buoyed by the favorable trends in the refining sector  we are more optimistic on the industry than we were a few months ago  After going through a bumpy ride for much of 2013  the sector has started to look up    and it s mainly to do with the  oil spread   the difference between the WTI price and its global counterpart  Brent    With refiners being buyers of WTI  while selling their products based on Brent  the wider the so called  Brent WTI spread   the better it is for the sector components  With current oil spread at more than  10 per barrel  refinery stocks are set to benefit  Against this backdrop  we are particularly bullish on Valero Energy Corp   VLO  and Western Refining Inc   WNR  WEAKNESSES We are bearish on Europe s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell plc  RDS A   The integrated player is particularly susceptible to its high exposure to the downstream business  as well as its major natural gas focus and lofty capital spending  We are also skeptical on Italian energy company Eni SpA  E   The integrated player    with a large presence in Libya    has seen its total production fluctuate in recent times  primarily due to operational disturbances at several fields in the North African nation  Additionally  Eni s upstream portfolio carries greater political risk than its peers  since it has the highest exposure to the OPEC countries  The Rome based company has also been mitigated by a weak macroeconomic scenario in Italy and Europe that is likely to affect its performances going forward  We see little reason for investors to own domestic upstream operator Noble Energy Inc   NBL   particularly due to the flood in Northern Colorado  which is expected to negatively impact production in fourth quarter  In addition  Noble s international business operations are exposed to political and economic risks rife in West Africa and the Middle East  Based upon the number of near term challenges  we remain pessimistic on the near term prospects of National Oilwell Varco Inc   NOV   With markets remaining competitive and pricing likely to be soft  the energy equipment maker s margins are expected to suffer in the next few quarters  Recent weakness in the North American onshore drilling environment has also been a negative  Furthermore  we expect shares to remain depressed until it increases its sub par dividend yield  Land drilling contractor Nabors Industries Ltd   NBR  is another company we would like to avoid for the time being  mainly due to headwinds in the pressure pumping market on the back of collapsing prices and lower utilization  The recent weakness in the North American onshore rig count has also been a negative  As usual  we remain concerned about weak natural gas fundamentals  which are likely to limit the company s ability to generate positive earnings surprises  Nabors  fairly debt heavy balance sheet also remains an issue  Lastly  we recommend avoiding contract drilling services provider Rowan Companies plc  RDC   The volatility in the macro backdrop along with operational hindrances raises concerns  Furthermore  the company expects its contract drilling expenses to increase by 5  to 7  in 2013  Rowan also expects 2014 operating costs to rise by 10  to 11  from 2013 levels ",2014-01-03,Zacks Investment

193808,415324,CVX,5 Stocks For Mexico s Historic Energy Reform,opinion,"2013 was a landmark year south of the border  On Dec 23  President Enrique Pena Nieto signed into law legislation  which required changing the Mexican constitution  to open Mexico s energy market to foreign investment  Mexico is the world s 10th largest oil producer  Reforming Mexico s energy industry has been at the top of the agenda by Mexican presidents over the last several decades  Many didn t think it could ever be done  For 75 years  Mexico s energy market has been dominated by one government run player  Petroleos Mexicanos  otherwise known as Pemex  The changes to the law are groundbreaking and are expected to bring up to  20 billion in direct foreign investment over the next 2 years 
What Happens Now 
Energy reform will happen in two parts  The first was actually changing the constitution and getting the new law passed  That has been completed  But now the hard part of implementation will take place  Under the law  new implementing laws must be in place within 120 days of the passage of the legislation on Dec 23  These laws will lay out the particulars such as which parts of the country will be available for development and how the contract and licensing procedures will work 
Game Changing Legislation
Pemex is a government run company which many oil analysts have said has been left to stagnate  It hasn t developed the latest technologies and is not very competitive in the global energy market  Under the new legislation  Pemex would become more like a private entity  Within 2 years  it will be operating as a regular business  which means it will have to be profitable and pay its bills  It will be pitted against the private sector companies for business  although Pemex will be given the right of first refusal on the first round of projects which will take place in the first 90 days of implementation  Pemex then will have 3 to 5 years to develop those projects  In many countries that have opened up their energy sectors to foreign investment  foreign companies often work in partnership with the government run oil industry  That will apparently NOT be the case in Mexico 
Foreign companies will be bidding on licenses and contracts directly  with proceeds to be deposited into a newly created sovereign fund which will then manage the oil revenue  For oil and gas exploration  Mexico will retain the rights to the commodities under the ground  However  on the downstream side  the Secretary of the Energy can directly award licenses to private companies for refining  pipelines  petrochemicals  bulk stations and gas stations  For the first time ever  you may see gas stations other than Pemex around Mexico 
Foreign Investment Bump
While there is the obvious direct beneficiaries of the law  i e  the foreign oil companies  others could see benefits during the infrastructure build out  such as railroads and airports  As the Mexican economy improves  it could trickle down to retailers  convenience and grocery stores  and homebuilders  The Mexican government expects energy reform to impact GDP by 1  as soon as 2018  You can see why many Mexico watchers are extremely excited about what could develop and Mexico s future 
How Quickly Will it Happen 
While the clock is ticking on the 120 day window for implementation laws to be put into place  no one expects the energy companies to be arriving en mass any time soon  The most hopeful believe there could be some investment by the second half of 2014 but others believe the bulk of the contracts will be awarded and begin in 2015 
Opportunities await in the offshore fields and in places where you d least expect it such as the Eagle Ford Shale in Southern Texas  which has no knowledge of international boundaries and extends south of the Rio Grande into Mexican territory 
5 Ways to Play Mexico s Energy Renaissance
There s no way of knowing which companies would be most interested in investing in Mexico but we can make some educated guesses  Basically  we can assume that most of the world s largest oil companies will be interested  There are few  new  areas to drill that have proven reserves  For instance  on Jan 14  Italy s largest oil company Eni S A   wasted no time in getting into the game  It announced it had inaugurated a representative office in Mexico City and was entering into discussions with Pemex 
But there are also a lot of smaller  independent North American explorers who might be interested in going south of the border  But which ones 
The following are some of the global energy companies I thought could find themselves bidding on Mexican contracts based on their company profiles and past investment behavior  But  remember  nothing is a done deal until the ink is dry 
1  ExxonMobil2  Eni S A 3  Gran Tierra Energy4  EOG Resources5  Anadarko
1  ExxonMobil  XOM 
Big Oil  including Exxon and Chevron Corporation   CVX   is especially suited for entering the Mexican market given their large international operations  Exxon may have a leg up on some of its competitors simply because it has a history of doing business in Mexico through its chemical division 
Surprisingly  it already has 250 employees in the country  It operates a lubricant blending plant in Vallejo and a chemical terminal in the port of Tuxpan  It also has offices in Mexico City 
Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Forward P E   12 6 2014 Expected Earnings Growth   6 

2  Eni S A   E 
Eni is an Italian integrated oil company with a market cap of  84 billion  It already has operations in places such as Libya  Nigeria  Mozambique  Congo and Vietnam  It is used to operating in all kinds of political and geographic environments 
By setting up an office in Mexico City so quickly  it is clearly already signaling that it wishes to be a player in the energy renaissance 
Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Forward P E   9 5 2014 Expected Earnings Growth   36 7 

3  Gran Tierra Energy  GTE 
Gran Tierra is a Canadian based mid cap independent explorer and producer with interests in Colombia  Argentina  Peru and Brazil  Geographically  it might make sense for it to make a play for projects in Mexico 
Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Forward P E   10 7 2014 Expected Earnings Growth   3 7 

4  EOG Resources  EOG 
EOG is a Texas based large cap independent explorer and producer of oil and natural gas  While it has a smattering of international interests  including in Argentina and Trinidad   Tobago  its main focus is on the United States 
So why would it have an interest in Mexico 
One of its large projects is in the Eagle Ford Shale region of southern Texas  This area straddles the Texas Mexico border  The Eagle Ford Shale doesn t actually know the boundary so there will be opportunities on the Mexico side  Many oil analysts consider EOG to be the best situated to take advantage 
Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Forward P E   18 4 2014 Expected Earnings Growth   12 7 

5  Anadarko Petroleum  APC 
Some companies will be attracted to Mexico s offshore possibilities in the Gulf of Mexico  Will one of those be Anadarko 
This big cap independent explorer and producer is already one of the largest deepwater producers in the Gulf  in United States territory  of course  It wouldn t take much to transfer that expertise to Mexican blocks 
Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Forward P E   15 3 2014 Expected Earnings Growth   23 4 

The Big Story of 2014
Mexico s energy reforms will unfold throughout 2014  It won t be a fast process  But if done right  it has the possibility to take the Mexican economy to the next level  Investors should be looking at companies that are positioned to cash in

193809,415325,CVX,EU Readies For Shale Gas Breakthrough ,opinion,"Ukraine in May hosts a summit to explore the potential for shale oil and natural gas in Europe  Ukraine and its Eastern European neighbors may host some of the more promising shale basins in the region  Now Spain and Germany are looking to explore their potential  With the European Union outlining recommendations for shale exploration  the region looks ripe for a breakthrough 
Ukrainian company Nadra Ukrayny  along with co sponsor International Gas Union  hosts a summit May 20 22 to discuss maximizing the benefits of shale exploration in the European community  Organizers say the event will have a pan European focus  with strategy sessions focused on the shale potential from Eastern Europe to Great Britain 
Weeks before Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych sparked major unrest with his November decision to back away from the EU  his government  a  10 billion shale natural gas deal with U S  supermajor Chevron  Under the terms of the deal  Chevron agreed to pay an initial  350 million for exploration work in the Olesska shale  which Kiev says could produce more than 200 billion cubic feet of natural gas  Despite an uncertain political future  this means Ukraine is still one of more promising shale areas in the region 
Polish shale ambitions  meanwhile  were stymied in part by a decision from Italian energy company Eni to pull out of the country  the third company to do so since 2012  Eni  the geology was too complex to exploit now  leaving behind an estimated 187 trillion cubic feet of shale gas reserves  That too should pique future interest once technology evolves  Chevron remains one of the few players still in the Polish shale 
Last week  Rainer Seele  chairman of German energy company Wintershall  told delegates at a Berlin energy conference it was time for an honest debate about shale exploration  Late last year  German leaders  to keep a moratorium in place on hydraulic fracturing  Several European states have expressed reservations about the controversial drilling practice dubbed fracking  For Seele  it s time for  an informed debate and legal clarity  because now  he said  the conversation is at a standstill  In 2012  a  found there may be as much as 100 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable gas locked on German shale 
Spain too entered the fray last week when the central government filed a  against a decision to ban fracking in Cantabria  a region near the coast of the Bay of Biscay   Regional leaders  unanimously to ban fracking out of environmental concerns last year  but with Spain importing more than 70 percent of its natural gas needs  the 70 years  worth of gas in Cantabria is too rich to ignore 
France and Bulgaria are among other European states with fracking bans in place  Last week  the European Commission embraced a series of recommendations meant to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for members that choose to go ahead with shale exploration  The EU said the recommendations were part of a policy framework meant to guide regional energy policy through 2030  EU Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik shale gas is  raising hopes  in Europe  With energy companies clamoring to get in line  Europe may be on the cusp of a shale breakthrough ",2014-01-29,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eu-readies-for-shale-gas-breakthrough-200430,200430
193810,415326,CVX,Here s How The Buy Side Expects Chevron To Report On Friday,opinion,"Chevron Corporation   CVX  is set to report FQ4 2013 earnings before the market opens on Friday  January 30th  Chevron is an American multinational energy company that is engaged in almost every level or the oil  natural gas  and geothermal energy industry  Earlier this month Chevron announced that it was working with Jefferies Group LLC to sell off several assets and reduce costs  CVX stock price has been down sharply over the past 3 4 weeks and revenue expectations from investors are far lower than Wall Street s  Here s how investors expect Chevron to report on Friday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the  platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

 
The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Chevron to report  2 58 EPS and  76 427B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 13 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  2 79 EPS and  69 618B revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Chevron to beat the Street s expectations on profit but come up short on revenue 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a large differential between the 2 groups forecasts  especially on revenue 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate in forecasting profit and revenue 4 times each  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69 5  more accurate than Wall Street  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by an independent  from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus  
The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  2 56 to  3 00 EPS and  64 350B to  76 627B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a large distribution of estimates for Chevron 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A larger distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market  which could mean more volatility post earnings  
Throughout the quarter analysts have downgraded their EPS expectations and increased their revenue forecasts  Wall Street lowered its EPS expectation from  3 11 to  2 58 while the Estimize consensus fell from  3 03 to  2 79  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and we are seeing the two groups revise their expectations in similar directions going into the report 
The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is Gordon who projects  2 92 EPS and  70 000B in revenue  In the Winter 2014 season Gordon rated as the 113th best analyst and is ranked 55th overall among over 3 700 contributing analysts  This quarter Gordon agrees with the Estimize community that Chevron will beat Wall Street s expectations on profit but come up short on revenue 
This quarter analysts on the Estimize com platform are expecting CVX to miss Wall Street expectations on revenue  but exceed on EPS  Chevron is making the right decision to sell of under performing assets and focus on long term growth  however  analysts expect quarterly revenue to fall short of the Wall Street consensus on Friday

193811,415327,CVX,Why Did The Market Rally Back Up ,opinion,"The S P   GSPC SNP  was up over 22 points yesterday  the Nasdaq Composite  NQH14 CME  was up over 84 points and the Dow   DJI  was up over 145 points  With the Fed out of the way until the next meeting and taper  the S P came flying back up 
Maybe some will say the rally back up was because some stocks reported better than expected earnings  while others may point to some type of economic number  GDP  that came in better  but that s not what I think 
Those factors are not the total reason why the S P rallied so much and sold off so much on the close 

 Bus too full 
MrTopStep is a firm believer in trading tools and patterns  and one of our long term trading rules is called  Bus Too Full   While it may sound simplistic  we think it fully applies to the 30 handle rally the futures saw from the 1764 Fed taper low to yesterday s 1794 high  As we have said many times  the S P doesn t always do what you want it to when you want it 

BUS TOO FULL  This is a street guy s term for when the markets are overbought or oversold  When everyone is bearish and the markets are going crazy  we are looking for buying opportunities  We sometimes use  the bus is too full  instead of the terms  oversold  or  overbought  as the bus tends to accelerate to extremes in either direction  An overloaded bus is harder to stop and turn around 

Stops and programs
Algorithmic trading and program arbitrage cannot exist without buy and sell stops  and when you get a sharp move down and the VIX jumps 30  you are almost assured that there will be extra stops in the index markets 
When  gloom and doom  prevails it takes both the bulls and the bears for a ride  See the net changes 
The most recent ride occurred when the ESH14 double bottomed late in the day after the Fed taper  The other part of the ride was yesterday s rip higher when the ESH14 took out all the buy stops back up to 1793 75   MrTopStep said buy stops from 1784 to 1794  
The short sellers got stuck when the ESH14 rallied  and what did they do  They put in buy stops above and the computers searched them out and elected them 
The walkaway trade
Right now it s hard to say what the next move for the S P will be  Late in the day the S P rallied and then sold off as GOOG and AMGN reported  We think it s safe to say we are in a very unpredictable trading environment 
The Walkaway Trade is another MrTopStep trading rule  but it runs contrary to the Late Friday Rip 

THE WALKAWAY TRADE  This is an end of the quarter  or month  trade  On the last day of the quarter  the portfolio managers have a tendency to run out of money after marking up stocks earlier  So  by 12 00 1 00ish CST the S P is susceptible to a decline through the afternoon  Traders look to set up a short position in the early to midafternoon  as the professional money managers walk away  leaving the equities ready for an afternoon fade 

No one knows for sure what the S P is going to do next  but you can rest assured that today s trade will provide both the buyers and the sellers another day of extreme trade

193816,415332,CVX,What Analysts Expect Chevron to Report,opinion,Chevron Corporation  CVX  earlier in this month released an interim report revealing that it s expecting lower numbers compared to the previous quarter  CVX earlier this year had also set up goals to hit a target of 3 3M barrels of oil per day by 2017  However recently  the company s production has been 2 89M barrels  completely missing the target they had set for themselves  Therefore  if CVX seeks to remain competitive against companies like ExxonMobil  XOM   it has to boost its production levels  CVX s interim report showed that the company had been steadily growing throughout the quarter despite low numbers  In fact  CVX saw a 4 2  gain in natural gas production and a 2 9  increase in production growth  which are solid  But steady growth doesn t mean that CVX will hit its targets by 2017  What all analysts are looking to in future quarters is how well CVX can not only increase production but also growth   Chevron Corporation is expected to report FQ3 2013 earnings on November 1st before the market open  The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors   The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for CVX to report  2 96 EPS and  59 345B revenue while the current Estimize consensus from 9 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  2 89 EPS and  59 202B revenue  The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case  we re seeing a smaller differential between the Estimize and Wall Street numbers compared to previous quarters Over the past four months the Wall Street consensus trend for EPS has decreased from  2 96 to  2 7 while Wall Street revenue expectations have increased from  56 499B to  59 345B  The Estimize EPS and revenue consensus have increased this quarter with EPS going from  2 88 to  2 89 and revenue increasing from  54 449B to  59 202B Over the previous 6 quarters  CVX has beaten the Wall Street consensus for EPS 2 times and revenue 1 time  Over the same time period CVX has beaten the Estimize EPS consensus 2 times and the Estimize Revenue consensus 1 time The distribution of estimates published by analysts on Estimize range from  2 68 to  3 12 EPS and  56 855B to  60 046B revenues  We re seeing a smaller distribution of estimates this quarter for CVX than normal  The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A narrower distribution signaling the potential for greater volatility post earnings  a wider vice versa The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is Adam Sussman who projects  2 94 EPS and  59 546B in revenue  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by our deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy Chevron Corporation is a company in a direction of growth  However  for numerous quarters  it has failed to meet or beat Wall Street expectations and it has failed in meeting its own production expectations  Looking at the optimistic side of things however  CVX has shown that it does have the ability for long term growth  especially with the numbers it put out for its interim report  Therefore  there s always the possibility that in the long run  CVX is setting itself up to do great things  but in this quarter  don t expect too much ,2013-11-01,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-analysts-expect-chevron-to-report-190199,190199

193819,415335,CVX,Q4  13 Earnings Growth Will Be Strongest In 2 Years ,opinion,"Per ThomsonReuters  the  forward 4 quarter  estimate on the S P 500 slipped  0 30 last week to  118 24 from  118 54 the week prior The P E ratio on the forward estimate is now 14 8 x   slightly above the 10 year average P E ratio of 14 x  per Factset The  earnings yield  on the S P 500  the  118 24 forward estimate divided by the closing value for the S P 500 on 11 1 13  is 6 72  Importantly  the growth rate on the forward estimate rose to 6 93   up from last week s 6 66  and the prior week s 6 19  Just on a PEG  P E to growth ratio  basis  the S P 500 is trading at 2 15 x  PEG as of 11 1 13  which is inline with 2013 s weekly historical PEG ratio  The high PEG this calendar year was 3 71 x  in early May  2013  and the low PEG was 1 97 x  in mid August  2013 We received an email this week from Dale L  of Chestmoor Capital  Dale noted that the usually steady erosion in the quarterly growth estimate for Q4  13  has not occurred to the extent that it did in Q1 and Q2  13  This was a keen observation  and was part and parcel to our comment about the Q3  13 earnings growth estimate ending September at  4 6    when the y y percentage growth number for quarters 1   2  were closer to 1    2  as the numbers started to get reported  Factset does a great job of quantifying this phenomenon  from Factset s Earnings Insight report dated November 1  13   During the month of October  13  the Q4 bottoms up EPS estimate dropped 1 5  during the month of October   Factset goes on to explain that when compared to the trailing 1 year  5 year and 10 year averages  this 1 5  drop was less than those various averages  with the point being that we are seeing less pressure on the 4th quarter estimate than is normally seen after one month T R is looking for  9 2  y y earnings growth in Q4  13  while Factset is expecting 7 2   When all is said and done by mid February of  14  I expect the T R growth rate to be above 10  for Q4  13 Again  this was an astute observation by Dale  What it means is there is less pressure on forward estimates in terms of percentage growth  as confirmed from Factset   even though analysts as a group remain conservative in terms of modeling forward quarters To summarize all this  in English   while we may not be seeing upward revisions to near term Q4  13 estimates and beyond  what we are seeing is less downward pressure on the estimates  Analysts are getting less negative or cautious Meaningful  Personally  I think it is another small positive around the S P 500 earnings story  The fact that the forward growth rate is moving higher is another plus too Still  the S P 500 needs a 2    3  flush to work off its overbought state Q3  13 Earnings results   any surprises  Per ThomsonReuters  y y earnings growth for the S P 500 is  4 2  as of November 1   13  inline with the  4 6  projected on October 1  Excluding JP Morgan s  JPM  legal charge  which has had the largest impact on both the S P 500 and the Financial sector as a whole  earnings growth is  6 9  per Thomson for the S P 500  and the Financial sector earnings growth is closer to 15  Here is the change in earnings growth expectations since October 1  first column is November 1  2nd column is as of October 1

193820,415336,CVX,Chevon s Bylaws Dispute In Delaware  Investors Drop Appeal,opinion,Dissident investors have dropped their appeal in the matter of Boilermakers Local 154 v  Chevron Corporation   CVX   This resolves for now  and in favor of management  a somewhat arcane dispute over forum selection bylaws that will make life at least marginally more difficult for certain corporate activist strategies One of Chevron s bylaws  adopted in September 2010  specifies that litigation regarding that giant company s internal affairs  issues regarding the voting rights of shares  for example  or dividend distribution  should be decided according to the courts of the state of Delaware  the state of incorporation  The bylaw was adopted by vote of the board  not of the shareholders Two institutional investors  union run pension funds brought an action challenging the legality of the provision Delaware Loves Delaware as ForumIn June of this year the Court of Chancery  by Chancellor Strine  held that  the challenged bylaws are statutorily valid   and are contractually valid and enforceable   By way of rationale  Strine accepted the directors  account of their bylaw as a way of protecting the corporation from  the potential for duplicative law suits in multiple jurisdictions over single events  Further  the Court characterized the arguments of the plaintiffs as  an array of purely hypothetical situations in which they say that the bylaws of Chevron and  in a consolidated case  FedEx might operate unreasonably  As a first reaction  the plaintiff pension fund managers had planned to appeal to Delaware s Supreme Court  But in October they dropped this appeal  So the bylaws stand  Other Delaware corporate managements that have contemplated such forum selection clauses are presumably emboldened  But perhaps they shouldn t be too emboldened  for Strine s decision on its face leaves plenty of room for other dissident investors to fight another day on this battleground Yes  Delaware is notoriously pro management and this decision is one of many that indicates that Delaware is happy directing disputes between management and investors to   Delaware  But there are two points that will ease the pain for those who think that pressuring managements from outside is a good way of creating alpha  as it sometimes  at least  surely is  Federal Common Law DiffersFirst  the federal courts aren t likely to go along  so they remain a possible alternative forum whatever the bylaws say  Indeed  a recent decision by the U S  District Court in San Francisco  California addresses exactly this point  Oracle  also a Delaware chartered company  sought a dismissal of an action brought by shareholders because the California venue was improper under Oracle s bylaws and Delaware statutes The court there  in Galaviz v  Berg  2011  refused to dismiss  saying that  the enforceability of a purported venue requirement is a matter of federal common law   and that the law neither requires nor permits the federal courts  to defer to any provision of state corporate law that might purport to give a corporation s directors the power to control venue   Further  Judge Richard Seeborg  deciding Galaviz  was especially unimpressed by defendant s efforts to enforce a venue clause that was  unilaterally adopted by directors   and largely on that point he denied the motion The other consideration that modifies the significance of Chevron is that even within Delaware the matter may not be settled  Chancellor Strine said that he could not consider  as applied  challenges  He left open the door to the possibility that he might find such clauses inapplicable as applied to various specific situations  He simply said that those arguments would have to be made on behalf of investors in those circumstances  a  real plaintiff whose real case is affected by the operation of the forum selection clause  One awaits that case  when arguments against Delaware centricity may be arrayed in battle once again  even inside Delaware ,2013-11-06,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chevon's-bylaws-dispute-in-delaware:-investors-drop-appeal-190741,190741
193821,415337,CVX,Oil And Gas Stock Roundup  Crude Flat  Transocean Soars On Solid Q3 ,opinion,Broader Market  Crude prices remained flat last week  A better than anticipated October jobs report seemed to ease concerns that last month s 16 day U S  government shutdown has eroded demand in the worlds biggest oil consumer  This was aided by positive data about China s all important trade sector  allaying some of the fears raised by the unusually weak export numbers in September  In more positive news  the first read on Q3 GDP came in better than expected  with the economy growing at  2 8  pace instead of the  2  consensus estimate and the final  2 5  growth pace in Q2  However  at the same time  the recent run of positive economic data  ranging from the ISM surveys to Q3 GDP and October non farm payrolls  has put the December Taper back on the market s agenda  Lower Euro zone growth forecasts for 2014 also weighed on crude prices  Sentiments were further dampened by the Energy Information Administration  EIA  report that showed another jump in inventories  which remains above the upper limit of the average for this time of the year  As per the EIA s weekly  Petroleum Status Report   crude inventories climbed by 1 6 million barrels for the week ending Nov 25  2013 to 385 45 million barrels  A drop in refinery utilization rates and steady production led to the stockpile build up with the U S  even as imports fell  What s more  storage at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma  the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange  was also up 991 000 barrels  the fourth straight weekly gain  As a result of these factors  by close of trade on Friday  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  oil was little changed and settled at  94 60 per barrel  essentially flat for the week  On the other hand  the broad based S P 500 index edged up 0 5  and finished the week at 1 770 61  a day after registering its worst performance in ten weeks  Traders were buoyed by the unanticipated boost in U S  jobs growth in Oct  taking it as a sign of strength in the world s largest economy  Even the weak consumer sentiment numbers could not deter the bulls  The Sub Sectors  Integrated  Major integrated players were mixed  with the top gainer being Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM   The world s largest publicly traded oil firm added 4 0  to its share price last week  Exxon Mobil continues to build on its strong momentum from the previous week  when it came out with a quarterly beat  backed by higher liquid and natural gas prices  Investors also cheered Exxon Mobil s move to restart work in Madagascar  four years after the company announced force majeure following a military coup in the island nation  San Ramon  CA headquartered energy behemoth Chevron Corp   CVX  was another solid performer  Shares climbed 2 7  during the week after the company signed a deal worth up to  10 billion with Ukraine to explore the country s shale gas deposits  which is trying to reduce its dependence on Russian supplies  Moreover  the supermajor s court case in Manhattan   to dispute a  19 billion environmental verdict it faces in Ecuador over pollution   took an interesting turn  as the judge who issued the ruling seemed to have little knowledge about his own order  Overall  however  most of the  Big Oil  is suffering from marginal or falling returns irrespective of the crude price movement  reflecting their struggle to replace reserve base and maintain production growth  as access to new energy resources becomes more difficult  E P  While all crude focused stocks stand to gain lose from rising falling commodity prices  companies in the exploration and production  E P  sector are the most affected  as they are able to extract more less value for their products  Last week  the SIG Oil Exploration   Production Index traded down 1 7   Top decliners include WPX Energy Inc   which plunged 14 7  after coming out with disappointing third quarter results  Plagued by lower natural gas prices  the Tulsa  OK based energy explorer s net loss almost doubled  while being much wider than anticipated  Operating performance was also impacted by a decline in total production volumes  compounded by an increase in operating costs  Moreover  the company s volume guidance was on the weaker side  as it continues to struggle with infrastructure issues in its Marcellus Shale operations  Shares of Anadarko Petroleum Corp   APC  shed 3 6  during the week  Much of this seems to be tied to the American oil and gas producer s failure to match third quarter earnings estimates  Though the company actually announced a rise in profits and also beat revenue projections  it was not enough to appease investors  who expected better growth  considering its premium valuation  A natural gas weighted production profile   whose economics is floundering   also played its part in bringing down the stock  Oilfield Services  The oil services group   represented by the Philadelphia Oil Services Sector Index   was up 1 5  through the week  Leading the pack was offshore driller Transocean Ltd   RIG   which jumped 12 4  through the week after it delivered a standout quarter  On Wednesday  the Switzerland based firm reported larger than expected earnings and revenues for the three month ended Sep 30 on the back of improved rig utilization and average dayrates  Two of the best performers last week were oilfield service biggies Weatherford International Ltd   WFT  and Halliburton Co   HAL   shooting ahead of their peers with additions of 4 3  and 3 9  to their respective stock prices  Weatherford moved higher after it beat profit view and inked deals with the U S  government to settle longstanding corruption charges  Moreover  the Geneva based drilling equipment manufacturer named a new CFO  which boosted investor sentiment and removed uncertainty regarding the company s future leadership  On the other hand  Halliburton on Wednesday said its board approved a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share  up 2 5 cents  or 20   from the prior quarter  Refining   Marketing  This has been one sector that has underperformed the rest of the energy industry for the bulk of this year  With refiners being buyers of oil   whose price saw a steep climb recently   their third quarter profitability had been squeezed due to a rise in the input cost and lower crack spreads  These headwinds were reflected in disappointing results for sector component HollyFrontier Corp  The downstream operator s earnings   dragged down by collapsing refining margins   were way below estimates  However  shares of Tesoro Corp   TSO    one the largest domestic independent refiners   rallied  up almost 3 8  for the week  after it reported third quarter revenues well above expectations on the strength of higher throughput volumes and improved performance by the retail segment that overshadowed weaker refining margins and steep costs  On a brighter note  over the past fortnight or so  crude prices have pulled back and spreads have showed signs of strengthening yet again  pointing to the likelihood that the difficult operating environment could be over sooner than what many investors think  Natural Gas  Investors continue to focus on temperature patterns to understand the fuel s economic dynamics  As it is  natural gas fundamentals look uninspiring with supplies remaining ample in the face of underwhelming demand  In fact  it is expected to take many years for the commodity s demand to match supply in the face of newer projects  The EIA s weekly inventory release showed that natural gas stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 35 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended Nov 1  within the guided range  of 34 38 Bcf gain   The increase   the thirtieth injection of 2013   exceeded last year s build of 27 Bcf but was marginally lower than the 5 year  2008 2012  average addition of 36 Bcf for the reported week  The bullish speculators are betting on the upcoming winter heating season  Nov through Mar  to spur the commodity s demand for heating  Chilly weather forecasts   in East U S  over the next ten days or so   have proved to be the catalyst  As a result  natural gas spot prices ended Friday at  3 56 per million Btu  MMBtu   up 3 2  over the week Performance Chart  This Week s Outlook  Apart from the usual suspects   the U S  government data on oil and natural gas   market participants will be closely watching the coming Janet Yellen confirmation hearings to get

193822,415338,CVX,We re Not Bullish On The Oil Patch,opinion,"A look at the energy markets shows that the prices of the US benchmark oil  WTI  and the international or European benchmark oil  Brent  have been falling since the middle of August 2013  These are two geographically distinct markets with separate forces at work in each  The usual arbitrage that once kept the two prices close to each other seems to be gone  and the spreads  currently about  15  between them have been unusually wide for several years 
Downward Pressure
The US price is influenced by the build out of America s energy infrastructure and exploration sector  As a nation  we are producing more of our own oil and natural gas  We are consuming more of our own domestic production and we are importing less than we used to  We are now more efficient in the way we consume energy  All of this is beneficial to the US  And all of this exerts a downward pressure on US energy prices 
Let s add to that mix the discovery of huge new fields and the development of new technologies in the production of oil and natural gas  The resulting energy outlook for the US is favorable for the next several decades 
Geopolitics
Things are different when it comes to Brent Crude and non US oil pricing  Geopolitical events are acting adversely in Iraq  Libya  Nigeria and other places where crude oil is sourced  Saudi production is up and has closed some of the gap  The ongoing turmoil in the geopolitical sphere injects higher costs and the need for larger inventories  Hence additional risk premia factor into the pricing  Were peace to break out in a durable fashion in the world  the price of Brent oil would drop significantly 
Back in the US the marginal cost of oil production is arguably somewhere in the  70s  The trading price is in the  90s  We may expect the price of US oil to fall over time as additional production is developed  That may cause continuing downward price pressure on gasoline prices  It will also mean that transportation cost pressures will be alleviated because energy is a great portion of that cost 
Inflation
This trend translates to downward pressure when it comes to inflation  Take the pervasive cost structure of energy  lower the price  and have it trend downwards  You will ease inflationary pressure  both directly in terms of lower energy costs and indirectly in terms of the prices of all of the things that depend  in one way or another  on our domestic energy 
The energy sector amounts to about 11  of the S P 500 Index  That is a heavier weight within the stock market and substantially influences market performance  Big cap American companies like Exxon and Chevron are large weights in some of the ETFs that are broad based like those that cover the Dow  DIA  or the S P 500 Index  SPY   Of course  we also track an array of exchange traded funds that expose investors to various components of the energy sector  There are selected Master Limited Partnerships that also enable investors to participate strategically in various components of the energy sector 
Sector Securities
This sector of the stock market has been trading somewhat heavily  It is doing so because of the correlation that exists between the energy price and the prices of the energy sector securities  which are influenced by energy prices 
Jim Roemer  a Sarasota based meteorologist and consultant on commodity prices  notes there is one wild card now in the forecast  In a recent writing  he mentioned the change in polarity of our sun  He observed how it is happening earlier than expected and how the transition comes in a year in which weather patterns are setting up for what might be a very cold winter in North America  There is a link that describes the polarity issue  We are suggesting it as a very quick  for readers 
We find this notion of changes in solar polarity fascinating  This idea introduces a whole new dimension into the debate over global warming  cold versus hot weather  and the dynamics that generate our weather 
There are a lot of things in our solar system that we do not understand and are just learning about  The influences of the sun are only partially observed and understood  We may encounter such an influence this winter  Roemer thinks there is a chance that cold weather will cause a spike in natural gas prices as consumption rises rapidly in response 
Falling Trend
At Cumberland  we are underweight in the energy sector because we see the trend of falling prices  Our allocations are below market weight  We expect that the dominant price trend in oil is downward  though we do have to be prepared for short term shocks  whether from the sun or from geopolitics  We recall the shock forty years ago when war in the Middle East spiked the oil price from  3 to  12  Certain things never change  we must always be prepared for the unpredictable 
Wildcards aside  however  our bullish view on stock markets does not extend to the oil patch

193823,415339,CVX,Has Shale Broken OPEC s Grip  Powerhouses Of The Future,opinion,The Shale Age is the age of the nimble junior  and exploration has revealed oil and gas resources that could forever alter the global production profile  Peter Dupont  oil and gas analyst for Edison Investment Research  tells The Energy Report how companies in North and South America  Australia  Africa and the U K  are upending the oil and gas order and creating a whole new energy investment landscape The Energy Report  The price of Brent is holding steady above  100 barrel   100 bbl  while West Texas Intermediate s  WTI  price is slipping back into the  90s  How are these prices and the spread between them affecting exploration and production of oil and gas    Peter Dupont  Over  100 bbl for Brent is still a pretty good price in terms of potential profitability for most companies  If the price of WTI should drop significantly below  90 bbl  then a question mark begins to arise over drilling activity    Bear in mind  though  that the price structure in North America for other onshore grades at the moment is discounted to WTI  The Bakken price has recently been  15 bbl less than WTI  It s beginning to move into an area where many people think low prices could  at some stage  trigger a decline in drilling activity  I don t think we re there yet  I think the decline has to be sustained for a period of time  Prices north of  80 bbl for Bakken and  90 plus for WTI are still really attractive for developers    TER  Are these spreads caused by transportation challenges  Do you foresee the spread increasing or do you think it will level off as producers find ways to move more oil to consumers    PD  A few months back  most people thought the U S  supply demand issue had been brought into equilibrium because the differential between WTI and Brent dropped to  4 bbl or less  On some days in Q3 13  there was almost no differential  Lately  the spread has widened  One factor has been a decline in refiner demand for crude  That s partly seasonal  of course  and related to maintenance activities  I would expect the refinery utilization rate to rise  it already has from the low point    Oil production is still very buoyant in the U S  and I expect that trend to continue  Near term  we re looking at a spread that might be a bit larger than we expected a few months ago  On average for next year  I d expect a Brent WTI differential somewhere in the high single digits  assuming there are no big weather factors or major unplanned refinery outages  Those would be the wild cards    Also interesting is the big spread that has opened up on the Gulf Coast between Brent and Louisiana Light Sweet crude  LLS   LLS has moved from an historical premium of a dollar or so per barrel to a discount of about  10 bbl  It reflects the fact that surplus oil is being shifted to the coast now that the Cushing bottleneck has been alleviated  The U S  oil price on the coast is now substantially below international levels    TER  What are some companies that are taking advantage of the shifts we re seeing today    PD  The big advantage is for refiners because they re getting oil that is very competitively priced from a global perspective    TER  What are some of the refineries that you ve been watching    PD  They re all well known companies  HollyFrontier Corp   HFC  is one of the big inland refineries  The Tesoro Corp   TSO  refinery in North Dakota also has a pretty big advantage  I m beginning to see an advantage for coastal refineries as well  because with the big discount now opening up for domestic crude  they are receiving internationally competitive crude net of transportation costs  Competitively priced oil is beginning to come into West Coast refineries and Atlantic Coast refineries  The refineries that are really benefiting  however  are those in the Midwest and Mid Continent  That would include the refining complexes in the Chicago  St Louis and Detroit areas and increasingly along the Gulf Coast    TER  So  is this a good time to be looking outside the U S  at companies that are leveraged overseas    PD  There has been a drop in international oil prices as well  Until late November  we were looking at light crude prices significantly below  110 barrel  However  with light crude prices over  100 bbl  producing oil is still a pretty profitable business in most cases    If you re an oil producer  you re a price taker  The big argument becomes whether the price starts to drop toward what s called the long run marginal cost  which includes all the capital costs in addition to operating costs  royalties and taxes    If the price in the U S  drops south of  80 bbl  and particularly south of  70 bbl  then drilling may be affected because the icing will have been taken off the cake  so to speak  Also  remember that quite a few companies in the U S   particularly the smaller ones  use debt to finance development activity  Banks always require hedging  and depending on the shape of the forward curve  this can hurt margins    A sustained drop in price below  75 bbl for several months would in all likelihood have an adverse impact on drilling activity in the U S  In Canada  there is a particular issue surrounding heavy oil  The price of West Canada Select  WCS   a heavy grade  stands at a discount of  40 bbl or so to WTI  It s the cheapest oil in the world for practical purposes  If the price of WCS is depressed significantly south of  50 bbl  it would have the potential to adversely impact production by choking off sources of finance  Marginal oil sands heavy oil producers with above average operating and transport costs would be the most vulnerable    TER  Let s talk about the producers  Are the large  international oil companies or the small producers better positioned right now    PD  For onshore production and development activity  the big international oil companies have not been leading the pack  the great innovators have been a series of medium size producers    Probably the most renowned of the Bakken producers and the largest in terms of acreage is Continental Resources Group Inc   CRGC   You ve got others like EOG Resources Inc   EOG  and Marathon Petroleum Corp   MPC   They are quite big companies in terms of market capitalization  but they re not household names  They re not the Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A   Exxon Mobils  XOM  and BPs  BP  of this world  which have all been late to the game    TER  Are the small and mid size producers good investments right now    PD  I believe the shale revolution is probably at a very early stage  It s got quite a few years to run  These companies have the engineering expertise to unlock the Holy Grail  I think they will probably continue to lead the field  but investors have to be patient  Obviously these companies have their ups and down  but they remain interesting investment opportunities    You also have to remember  particularly in the case of Continental  that production is trending strongly upward  This reflects the scale of its acreage in the Bakken and Oklahoma  innovative technology  a sizeable resource base and the aggressive drill program  Continental continues to look interesting from an investment perspective    TER  How about outside North America  Any companies that could do well based on Far Eastern growth    PD  CBM Asia Development Corp   TCF  is an Indonesia focused coal bed methane  CBM  outfit  The company s key issue at the moment is to get development activity up and running  Unfortunately  the company has had a major constraint in raising capital and hasn t been able to undertake the development activity that was expected for this year  It remains to be seen how quickly it can resurrect the situation  That s really dependent on the company s ability to renegotiate a joint venture agreement with Exxon Mobil  CBM has indicated that it is attempting to renegotiate certain aspects of the joint venture  There s been no news on progress but according to the company  an announcement is expected in the near future  If CBM does manage to renegotiate the joint venture so Exxon Mobil carries more of the financing  this would transform the outlook for the company and potentially provide a major boost to the stock    TER  What about the national oil companies  What are the prospects for those names getting more involved    PD  The Brazilian government has tried to establish closer control over Petrobras  PBR  over the last few years  It has insisted that all the pre salt development activity be undertaken by Petrobras itself  As a result  it s become a much more difficult situation for non Petrobras players to be involved in Brazil  They can participate as investors  but it s impossible for anyone other than Petrobras to be involved as an operator  You ve got a tightening of the state s grip there    Whether that will continue is possibly a bit more of an open question now because of very heavy development costs  Hitting 5 million barrels a day  5 MMbbl d  by 2020 will be a costly task and will require a lot of technical and operational resources  Bringing the production onstream along with expanding the refining infrastructure is placing a huge burden on Petrobras  There is no doubt about the existence of the oil  The problems relate to extraction and logistics given the deepwater location  distance from the coast and the technical challenges of drilling through a very thick layer of salt  I have no doubt Petrobras will succeed in due course  but there are a lot of technical and financial hurdles to be overcome    The other place in South America where you ve had a tightening state grip of late is Argentina  Here the largest domestic oil and gas producer and former Repsol unit   Yacimientos Petrol feros Fiscales  YPF   was partly nationalized in April 2012  The government there is also increasingly involved in LNG imports  Argentina  however  is a very interesting place given its geology and particularly the quality of its tight shale formations  Argentina is not a newcomer to oil and gas production  Oil  in fact  has been produced there for 100 years and there is well developed midstream downstream infrastructure  The country is well served by oilfield service companies  there s plenty of engineering know how and Argentina is host to Tenaris  TS   the world s largest producer of seamless tube  There have also been three big shale oil and gas joint venture announcements in the Neuqu n Basin in recent months between YPF and Chevron Corp   CVX  YPF and Dow Chemical Co   DOW  and Gas y Petroleo  Neuqu n provincial government  and Wintershall Holding GmbH  a subsidiary of BASF Corp   EUR53 17 XETRA      Arguably  the prospects for further shale oil and gas projects have been greatly enhanced in recent weeks following the tentative agreement between the Argentine government and Repsol on compensation terms for YPF  It should also be noted that the business environment has been improving of late in Argentina  This reflects such factors as commodity pricing reforms  the accelerated depreciation of the peso  more business friendly statements emanating from government and a less confrontational government stance vis   vis international bodies  Significantly  the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange Merval Index is up about 3X over the past year  driven in large part by expectations of a change of government in October 2015    There are a couple of particularly interesting Canadian juniors operating in Argentina  Americas Petrogas Inc   BOE  and Madalena Energy Inc   MVN   Both have large acreages in the Vaca Muerta shale oil and gas zone in the Neuqu n Basin  Several medium to large U S  and European players also have interests in Argentina  including Exxon  Chevron  Apache Corp   APA   EOG  BP  Shell  Total S A   TOT  and Wintershall  BP is active through its 60  stake in the closely held Buenos Aires company and second largest domestic oil and gas producer  Pan American Energy  CNOOC and the Bulgheroni family are the other shareholders   Presently the excitement surrounding Argentina mainly relates to Vaca Muerta in Neuqu n  There is  however  another potentially large shale play called D 129 in the San Jorge Basin in Chubut province  Reflecting its dominant position in the Basin  Pan American and by implication BP could potentially be beneficiaries of D 129    Vaca Muerta could be as big as the Bakken  It may hold as much as 25 billion barrels of oil equivalent  25 Bboe  in recoverable reserves  which is a very substantial number  Neuqu n and nearby provinces also boast well developed oil and gas infrastructure including refining and petrochemical facilities    One of the key points of differentiation in Argentina compared with the U S  is the ownership of the mineral rights  In the U S   mineral rights are generally owned privately unless land is federally or state owned  By comparison  in Argentina and in fact in most other parts of the world  mineral rights are not owned by private individuals concerns  They re owned by the state  in one form or another  In Argentina mineral rights are the property of the provinces    Shale oil and gas development has considerable support both at the federal level and the provincial level in Argentina  The federal authorities are interested in increasing the domestic supply of hydrocarbons due to a sizeable import bill for oil and gas of over  10 billion per year  The provinces  by contrast  are interested in oil and gas royalties  which are  in fact  the major source of income  excluding transfers from the federal government  in some provinces  including Chubut  Neuqu n and Santa Cruz    TER  You mentioned the role of the Canada based juniors operating in Argentina  Are those long term investment plays    PD  Some of these companies have first mover advantage  Madalena and Americas Petrogas are the most obvious examples  As is often the case  the junior outfits saw the opportunity in the Vaca Muerta early on or were willing to take the risk before the majors  but big bucks are required for development activity  At some stage the juniors will probably look at selling a stake in the projects or selling the whole company  There are some companies  of course  that may wish to go through the whole process from conceptualization to development the proverbial company maker concept    TER  Which model do you think Madalena and Americas Petrogas are following  Are they looking to be bought out or do they want to go all the way to production    PD  Both companies already have producing assets in Argentina  Production is running at about 2 250 barrels of oil equivalent per day  2 250 boe d  for Americas and 200 boe d for Madalena  Americas has modest 2P reserve of 10 4 MMboe d but the interesting angle is the potential upside reflected by the substantial unrisked recoverable resource position of 8 3 billion barrels of oil  8 3 Bboe   Americas  pilot projects at the moment are relatively small scale  The company is in joint ventures with Exxon and Apache  I suspect  given the lead times involved  the company is planning to find a buyer or to sell down the stake  Indeed  Americas has commissioned Jefferies to undertake a strategic review of the business  If Vaca Muerta and the other tight formations in the Neuqu n Basin do indeed look like they are hosting the best part of 25 Bboe in recoverable resources  then the Americas shareholders could be off to the races  Although selling down stakes in some of the Vaca Muerta plays may make sense from a project finance perspective  disposal of the whole company could be premature at this stage if the recoverable resource position is as large as appears to be the case    Madalena has working interests ranging between 35 90  in three blocks in the Neuqu n Basin comprising a sizeable 135 000 net acres  Contingent and prospective recoverable resources are estimated by Madalena at 2 9 Bboe  of which 45  are oil and natural gas liquids  NGLs   There is a mixture of conventional and unconventional plays  Small quantities of oil are presently obtained from the conventional Sierras Blancas formation in the Coiron Amargo Block  where horizontal drilling technology is being applied  Madalena s key focus presently is to secure a joint venture partner for the appraisal and development of the Vaca Muerta and Agrio shale formations  Securing a partner or partners would be a critical catalyst for the stock    TER  It sounds like you see a lot of opportunity in South America                PD  I think the most interesting developments and opportunities in oil and gas are in the Americas  both North and South  In addition to the relatively well known opportunities in Argentina and Brazil  I believe that Paraguay and maybe onshore and offshore Uruguay could emerge as new frontier oil and gas provinces over the next few years  Governments are supportive of oil and gas exploration and development in both jurisdictions  Currently  Paraguay and Uruguay import virtually all their oil and gas needs    TER  Is there a company in Paraguay or Uruguay that you like    PD  The key company in Paraguay is an AIM listed junior called  President Energy Plc  PPC   It also has interests in Argentina  President has shot seismic in Paraguay s sector of the Chaco Basin  apparently with very positive results  The company has referred to  giant  field potential  Drilling is scheduled to commence in Q2 14  A contract has been signed with Schlumberger Ltd   SLB  for project management and drilling services  The Argentine zone of the Chaco Basin has been a significant producer  Another AIM listed junior  Amerisur Resources Plc  AMER   also has some early stage exploration interests in Paraguay  Amerisur has had a very successful exploration development program in Colombia    Recent drilling activity in northern Uruguay by state owned ANCAP and the ASX listed junior Petrel Energy Plc  PRL  has yielded positive results with evidence of a working petroleum system  The most significant offshore event of late has been Shell s acquisition of Petrobras  interests  Several other majors and mid tier concerns are also present offshore Uruguay  The theory is that Brazil s pre salt reservoirs could extend a long way to the south  Interestingly  a major gas discovery has recently been made by a Total Pan American Energy  PAEYE  Wintershall consortium offshore Tierra del Fuego    TER  Does all the production in North and South America leave OPEC in a less powerful position    PD  Clearly  yes  because you ve got a lot of supply coming online outside of OPEC  There will be about 1 7 MMbbl d in 2013 and probably a similar amount in 2014  Within OPEC  Iraq  not subject to quota restrictions  is planning to boost output by approaching 1 MMbbl d in 2014 as new terminal and refurbished oilfield capacity comes onstream  Libya and Iran would also like to substantially increase production during 2014  On the demand side of the equation  global growth is considerably slower than in the mid 2000s  Growth is now running at 0 8 1 0 MMbbl d less than 1  a year  With demand growth likely to lag potential gains in supply  OPEC members other than Iraq and Iran may need to cut production significantly over the next year or two to avoid downward pressure on prices  Saudi Arabia would have to carry the burden of the adjustment    In 2013  OPEC crude production will be down about 1 MMbbl d to 30 5 MMbbl d while NGL output could be up 0 1 MMbbl d to 6 4 MMbbl d  From a recent historical perspective  OPEC production has remained at a high level  The key negatives for OPEC output in 2013 have been the impact of sanctions on Iran and ongoing civil unrest and strikes in Libya  Iranian output has dropped by about 1 MMbbl d  while Libyan production has fallen from about 1 4 MMbbl d in early 2013 to 0 3 MMbbl d of late  The void has to a large degree been filled by Saudi Arabia and to a lesser extent the UAE and Kuwait    Late in Q3 13 and into Q4 13  Iraq s production also dropped  This is principally because the country is updating major terminal facilities in the Persian Gulf  That will enable Iraq to increase exporting capacity  but it has temporarily adversely impacted production  Additionally  northern Iraq has been plagued by terrorist activity that has interrupted flow on the Kirkuk Ceyhan export pipeline  If not for the disruptions to output in Iraq and civil unrest in Libya  we would probably have been looking at a much lower Brent price in Q4 13    TER  Are there any other superstar companies or geographical regions that we didn t touch on    PD  The Bowland Basin in northwest U K  is looking interesting as a shale gas play  Some drilling activity is expected to start next year  Russia arguably offers major shale oil potential and there are major conventional exploration and development opportunities in Eastern Siberia  Tax incentives may be offered in Russia to encourage shale oil and gas development  China is another interesting area  both for shale oil and gas  You could see drilling activity accelerate here considerably in the next few years  driven by official policy to develop domestic energy supplies and reduce dependence on imports  North Africa is also attracting conceptual interest as a potential shale province  A lot of highly successful exploration activity has been undertaken onshore and offshore East Africa in recent years  Following discoveries made by Tullow Oil Plc  TLW LSE  and Africa Oil Corp   AOI TSX V   Kenya looks like it s emerging as an important new oil province  Somalia and Ethiopia continue to offer frontier rift play potential  Last  central Australia is a very large unexplored area for oil and gas and offers both conventional and unconventional potential in the Mesozoic and Paleozoic basins that characterize the zone    TER  Are there companies you like in Australia    PD  This is a little outside my orbit  However  Santos Ltd   STO  is a major player in central Australia with midstream and downstream interests and pioneered the development of the Cooper Basin 40 50 years ago  Other smaller players active in central Australia are Beach Energy Ltd   BPT   Central Petroleum Ltd   CTP   Drillsearch Energy Ltd   DLS   Norwest Energy  NWE  and Senex Energy Ltd   SXY   Arguably Central Petroleum looks particularly interesting on the basis of its recent Sunshine discovery  its massive acreage and its two large scale exploration joint ventures with Santos and Total  Interestingly  Central Petroleum is to a large extent carried in the early stages of these joint ventures    TER  It sounds like there are a lot of opportunities  particularly for people who have a long term view on investing in oil and gas    PD  Oil and gas is a long term business requiring big bucks

193824,415340,CVX,If Mexico Is The Next Brazil In Oil Production  Brace For Disappointment,opinion,Recent reforms that would open oil exploration and development in Mexico to major oil companies for the first time in decades has  about the prospects of a reversal in declining Mexican oil output and a possible doubling of production  The reforms have brought out  which has a similar arrangement in which the country s state owned oil company works with major international oil giants to develop Brazil s petroleum resources  Adding to the frothy atmosphere  former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva proposed a partnership  to develop oil resources in both countries    In a world with daily average oil prices hovering near record levels  such news might be welcome if only we could actually count on the accompanying optimistic production forecasts  But  it s instructive to look at what actually happened in Brazil since the time its potential as a major new oil producer was touted several years ago    Brazil had discovered large oil deposits in ultradeep  30 000 feet down  reservoirs far offshore  In 2009  Petroleo Brasileiro SA  Petrobras   Brazil s state owned oil company  announced that it would  in oil exploration over several years to boost Brazilian liquid fuel production from 2 4 million barrels per day  mbpd  in 2008 of oil  biofuels and other liquids to 4 6 mbpd in 2015  a move that would make the country a major oil exporter    Let s see what kind of progress Brazil has made so far  In 2012 the country produced 2 65 mbpd of liquid fuels  making hardly any progress toward the goal announced for 2015   The figures for oil proper  that is crude oil plus lease condensate which is the definition of oil  were 1 81 mbpd in 2008 and 2 06 mbpd in 2012   In fact  instead of contributing to the worldwide supply of exports  Brazil remains a net importer of oil according to the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   and those imports grew from 36 470 barrels per day in 2011 to     The large Brazilian oil company OGX Petr leo e Gas Participa  es SA filed for bankruptcy recently  after disappointing output from offshore OGX wells set off a crisis of investor confidence     It s no surprise that state owned Petrobras is also finding it  to exploit its deep sea oil resources than originally anticipated  Admittedly  there are other problems at Petrobras  It has become a tool of economic policy for keeping unemployment low  saddling it with investments that it might not otherwise have made as a private company  But that doesn t change the fact that exploiting oil far offshore at extreme depths is difficult    Mexico s state run oil monopoly  Petroleos Mexicanos  Pemex   has seen its production drop from 3 45 mbpd of crude oil proper in 2004 to just 2 59 mbpd in 2012 according the EIA  Reforms that will give international oil companies new access to Mexican oil fields are supposed to change that trend  It s one thing to let private companies drill previously monopolized fields  It s another to raise overall nationwide production significantly as a result  Just ask the Brazilians  The easy to get oil has already been harvested in Mexico and Brazil  The hard to get oil comes next  and well   it s proving hard to get    Will Mexico fare better than Brazil  Art Berman  a petroleum geologist and consultant who accurately forecast the bust for shale gas investors  offered this analysis in a recent email    I have worked in Mexico since the early 1990s inside Pemex  There is a reason that no significant discoveries have been made since the 1970s  no reservoirs    The Campeche Sound  in the Bay of Campeche  has reservoirs thanks to the biggest frack job ever  the Chicxulub meteor impact  The Golden Lane reef trend  discovered much earlier  has been fully explored with no new discoveries  Beyond that  almost nada    The Eagle Ford Shale play  in Texas  extends into Mexico and  so far  all tests have yielded  natural  gas  There is a potential oil play in the  area from the El Abra Shale that sourced the Golden Lane  The  contains huge oil  resources  that no one has figured out how to exploit commercially as recently as in the last few years  The deep water Gulf of Mexico has serious reservoir problems in Mexico    Add it all up and we are left with the same sense that there should be huge remaining undiscovered reserves in Mexico that an awful lot of smart foreign companies  Amoco  BP  Chevron  Exxon  Shell  etc   have been unable to discover working closely  through service contracts  with Pemex since the 1980s    As far as the Citi  Citigroup Inc   estimates go  projecting a doubling of Mexican production which is mentioned and linked above   mucho ruido  pocos nueces  much ado about nothing  literally  lots of noise  no nuts     Jeffrey Brown  an independent petroleum geologist best known for his Export Land Model weighed in as well on Mexico s oil future  Brown s model  first released publicly in 2006  correctly forecast shrinking global net exports of oil in recent years  He believes that any effect of the Mexican reforms will be relatively small and delayed several years  He related his views in a recent email    Regarding their  Mexico s  offshore potential  it s going to take a long time to work out the agreements  drill some wells and put the wells on line  I wouldn t expect to see any meaningful contributions from joint venture offshore projects until some time after 2020  Regarding onshore   that  production could come on line sooner  but the agreements have to be made  and the per well production rates are vastly lower than offshore  Also  I suspect that the production sharing agreements are going to be something more or less equivalent to a 50  royalty  or worse   versus much more favorable terms in Texas  which would make investment in Texas more attractive to major oil companies versus investment in Mexico     Brown  who manages a joint venture exploration program based in Ft  Worth  also noted that  Mexico is on track to approach zero net oil exports in about six years  around 2019    He continually reminds those making rosy predictions about oil exports for any exporting country that those countries tend to grow as oil revenues increase which means their thirst for oil also grows  That can leave less and less oil available over time for export  If the country s production is in decline  as has been the case with Mexico  exports decrease much faster than production on a percentage basis if domestic consumption grows in the face of declining production  a sort of  on oil exports    It s possible that Mexico s production may grow somewhat as a result of the country s reforms  But  it is foolish to expect too much given what we ve seen in Brazil to date  And  it is important to remember that production from currently producing Mexican wells is declining continuously making it necessary to drill a lot of wells just to maintain current production let alone increase it    Anyone looking for oil exports or production from Mexico to reach their previous high marks would be wise to plan for a less than salutary result ,2013-12-23,Kurt Cobb,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/if-mexico-is-the-next-brazil-in-oil-production,-brace-for-disappointment-196674",196674

193829,415345,CVX,LNG Exports  The  35 Billion Bull Invading Canada ,opinion,In a remarkable interview with The Energy Report  Jason Sawatzky reveals the hottest new thing happening in the North America oil exploration and production space  the rush by major oil and gas firms to build LNG export facilities on Canada s West Coast  The AltaCorp Capital analyst points out that major oil and gas firms are not the only way to play west coast LNG development  and investors should look very closely at Canadian oilfield services  The capital flowing into west coast LNG is pumping up growth in the oilfield services industry too  with plenty of black gold to spread around   The Energy Report  Jason  how will the rush to export West Coast liquefied natural gas  LNG  affect the Canadian oilfield services space   Jason Sawatzky  There is no other oilfield services market in the world right now that has growth in front of it like Canada does  thanks to the development of west coast LNG  Planning for Canadian LNG projects is now in motion  There are three projects that have received export approvals  Three more have applied for gas export licenses  and two more have not yet applied  These projects are going to require enormous amounts of spending on export terminals  pipelines  drilling  fracking  field development and also accommodations  Activity should begin in early 2014 and ramp up over the next five years   TER  Who is backing the three approved projects   JW  The three LNG projects that are advancing the fastest  in our opinion  are the Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A  PetroChina Co  Ltd   PTR  project  the Apache Corp   APA  Chevron Corp   CVX  project and the Petronas  PETRONAS  Progress project  The combined capital cost to buildout all three of these projects is in the range of  30 35 billion   30 35B   That is why we expect to see significant amounts of capital spent in Western Canada  which will positively impact Canadian service companies   TER  Are these companies leveraging this mammoth investment with debt or is the government participating in any way   JS  The companies are putting their own cash into developing reserves and building out the LNG related facilities in Western Canada   TER  The companies must be expecting a really big return   JS  Yes  absolutely  The way LNG development plays out in Canada should be very similar to what happened in Australia with LNG  There are significant natural gas reserves in Canada  and the foreign markets  particularly in Asia  are looking to tap into it   TER  Please define what you mean by  oilfield services    JS  Oilfield services include everything from drilling to fracking to servicing the well after the well has been fracked  There are also ancillary services like providing various rental products and production testing services  etc  A number of different technical skills are required to drill the well  bring it into production and maintain it over time   TER  What firms are best positioned to provide these services   JS  With respect to LNG development  we would highlight Essential Energy Services  ESN  and Canyon Services Group Inc   FRC   First  Essential provides coiled tubing services used for completions  workovers and well cleanout operations  In general  the advantage of using coiled tubing over  say  regular jointed tubing in a service rig or a snubbing unit is the increased speed at which the coiled tubing string can be run in and out of the well  Also  coiled tubing operations can be performed on a live well  meaning that operators do not have to kill the well  as they have to do with service rigs  which can lead to formation damage   With respect to LNG development in Western Canada  we think that deep coil is going to play an integral part in servicing the deep  long reach wells in the Duvernay  the Montney and the Horn River plays  Looking forward  Essential is currently rolling out ultra deep  generation 3 and 4 coiled tubing rigs  Theses rigs will be ideal for servicing the long reach  LNG type wells   JS  Canyon is a Canadian pure play fracker and has a brand new 225 000 horsepower fracking fleet  We believe the Canadian fracking market today is slightly oversupplied  but by 2014  our expectation is for the Canadian market to be undersupplied due to increased LNG activity  Of note  Canyon has been increasing its LNG focused  large cap  exploration and production client base  working for companies like Petronas and Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM   It is also on the bid list for other senior producers   Interestingly  prior to Q1 13  Canyon was not working for any seniors  so this is all incremental work for the company going forward  It is well positioned to take advantage of the ramp up in activity in the Duvernay and the Montney to support West Coast LNG development  The company s balance sheet shows  23 million   23M  in net cash and a  100M undrawn facility as of the end of Q2 13  We believe Canyon has lots of dry powder to respond to potential LNG opportunities   On the valuation side  Canyon is reasonably valued for a high growth  emerging fracker  It trades at about 9 2x 2014 price earnings on our numbers versus our midcap group average of about 10 1x  There is definite upside with Canyon   TER  What other promising companies are involved in oilfield services   Canadian Energy Services and Technology Corp   CEU  sells specialized drilling fluids for use in drilling longer length horizontal wells in Canada and in the U S  Its chemical fluid mix substantially improves the penetration rate of drill bits  and raises the overall productivity of oil and gas wells  The operators ultimately benefit from a reduction in drilling and completion costs  Canadian Energy Services has experienced strong customer adoption of its drilling fluid products  including its main product Seal AX  reduces wellbore seepage   The company also offers synthetic oil based muds  ABS 40 and EnerDRILL  which enhance the rate of drill penetration   Canadian Energy Services is not as leveraged to LNG development as some of the other service companies  but it has very strong fundamentals and growth prospects for providing drilling fluids and production chemicals in Western Canada and the U S  In terms of drilling fluids  the company is already the largest provider in Canada  with about a 30  market share  in the U S   it has 8  market share  Of note  the company recently acquired Venture Mud LP in the Permian Basin  a small private drilling fluids company  giving it exposure to the most active basin in the U S   note   drilling in the Permian continues to shift from vertical to horizontal drilling   Going forward  we believe Canadian Energy Services will continue to make small acquisitions in the U S   and will likely grow organically as well  We think the company can grow its U S  market share to about 10 12  over the next three to five years   On the production chemicals side  Canadian Energy Services recently acquired a U S  company called JACAM Chemical for  240M  JACAM provides production chemicals throughout the U S  and into Canada  Interestingly  its main production chemicals facility in Kansas is operating at a throughput of 20 25   We believe there is tremendous upside in that business as it ramps up throughput and expands into plays in the U S  Northeast  the Eagle Ford and elsewhere in Canada  Of note  when the JACAM facility operates at 100  throughput it can generate about  500M in revenue and about  125M in earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   so lots of potential future upside  We really like this company   TER  What kind of dividends are we talking about with these three service firms   JS  Canyon pays a 3 4  yield right now  Canadian Energy Services pays a 4  yield  Essential Energy pays a 4 2  yield   TER  Do you have target prices   JS  On Canyon Services  we have a  15 50 target price and Outperform rating  For Canadian Energy Services  we have a  22 target price and an Outperform rating  On Essential Energy  we have an Outperform and a  3 50 target price  and we just recently increased that from  3 25 due to the company s expanding coiled tubing business   TER  Do you view these companies as acquisition candidates or are they standalones   JS  Of the three  we believe Canyon and Essential are potential acquisition candidates for a larger  U S  service company that needs exposure to the Canadian fracking and coiled tubing markets  Canyon  in particular  is an ideal acquisition target because it is 100  focused on the Canadian fracking market and it is not too large  As Essential Energy is the largest deep coiled tubing provider in Canada and has a growing service rig fleet  it should also attract a larger Canadian or U S  service company looking to expand into those businesses  It is worth noting that Western Energy Services Corp   WRG  recently paid a solid premium to acquire a service rig company called IROC Energy Services Corp  in Western Canada   TER  What are the mechanics of coiled tubing that make it special   JS  It is steel tubing than can enter a well while it is flowing and under pressure and is mainly used for completions work  The benefit of coil is the operator does not have to kill the well and risk damaging the formation  The fourth generation coil rigs can plunge to about 6 400 meters with 2 5 8 inch coil  Coiled tubing technology has been around for a while  but the new development is that the ultra deep coils are being built to service the really deep LNG related wells  for example those in the Montney and Duvernay   TER  What is the proposed lay of the land and infrastructure for the three big LNG projects   JS  All three are designed to facilitate export of gas from the Western Canadian shales in the Montney  Duvernay and Horn River plays that straddle Alberta and British Columbia  The majors plan to build the LNG terminals in Kitimat and various other places on the West Coast  They will need to build a network of pipelines to feed gas from the fields to the terminals   TER  Are the companies going to share the new infrastructure   JS  A lot of the infrastructure will be project specific  but each project is shared by two or more large companies  including Apache Chevron  Shell PetroChina and Exxon Imperial  In the Canadian oilfield space  we believe LNG development is the 800 pound gorilla in the room  It s all going to start happening in early 2014  and that will be a real growth driver for the whole sector   Some other companies on the frontlines of the LNG buildout are deep drillers  including Precision Drilling Corp   PD   Trinidad Drilling Ltd   TDG  and Akita Drilling  AKT   Those firms have the ultra deep  high spec rigs that are ideal for drilling LNG wells in the Montney  the Duvernay and in the Horn River  Trinidad and Akita have already been awarded contracts for ultra deep   40M rigs    We also see the Canadian frackers as being on the front lines of LNG development  Calfrac Well Services Ltd   CFW  is working for Petronas Progress as is Canyon and Calfrac currently has three to four spreads working for Petronas Progress   A little further down the line  we are watching Horizon North Logistics  HNL  and Black Diamond Group Ltd   BDI   They provide the pipeline camps that will be required for building the West Coast pipelines  There are also assorted compression  pipe coating companies and the deep coil specialist that we mentioned

193832,415348,CVX,Energy ETFs Surge On Q3 Oil Service Earnings Beats,opinion,The energy sector has been performing remarkably well this year on higher oil prices and overseas operations  This trend is expected to continue as we move towards the end of the year  In fact  as per the Zacks Estimates  the energy sector is poised to rank third in Q3 for earnings  after only finance and technology  This solid earnings output should be easy to hit too  in particular after robust Q3 numbers from two energy giants   Schlumberger  SLB  and Baker Hughes  BHI    on October 18th  Increased oilfield activity offshore U S  and overseas boosted the profits of these companies Oil Service Earnings in Focus Schlumberger  the world s largest oilfield services provider  reported earnings of  1 24 per share that topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel and improved from the year ago quarter as well  Higher offshore drilling activity in North America  strong demand from the Middle East and Asia  and a seasonal rebound in Canadian drilling led to the strong performance   Revenues climbed 11  to record  10 5 billion and were in line with our consensus estimate  Meanwhile  Baker Hughes  the world s third largest oilfield services provider  surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and revenues thanks to strong performances in the Middle East Asia Pacific and Europe Africa Russia Caspian business units  The company s earnings of 81 cents per share increased 2 5  year over year and beat our estimate by 3 cents  Revenues rose 8 1  to  5 79 billion and outpaced our estimate of  5 74 billion  Following the earnings beat  BHI led the gains in the energy sector  climbing 7 28  at the close on elevated volume after rising as much as 8  in early trading hours  The shares of SLB rose 3 8  in early trading hours but closed a little lower  with a 2 8  rise  on moderate volume ETF Impact This solid run was also felt in the ETF world  with energy ETFs surging  Many of the key funds in this segment have a double digit allocation to these two oilfield service providers and gained in the day s session  Below  we have highlighted three ETFs with the biggest allocations to these two energy bellwethers that have seen higher trading and look to be big movers this week and in the next  Investors should closely monitor the movement in these funds and could catch the opportunity from any further surge in stock prices Market Vectors Oil Services ETF  OIH  This is by far the largest and the most popular ETF in the energy space with AUM of over  1 7 billion and average daily volume of about 3 5 million shares  The fund provides exposure to the 26 most liquid firms by tracking the Market Vectors US Listed Oil Services 25 Index  The ETF charges a fee of 35 bps annually  Schlumberger occupies the top position in the basket with 20 65  of assets while Baker Hughes takes the fourth spot at nearly 5  after Halliburton  HAL  and National Oilwell  NOV   Apart from the U S  companies  the fund also provides exposure to Switzerland  Bermuda  Luxemberg  United Kingdom and the Netherlands  The fund gained 2 03  on the day and is up nearly 30  in the year to date time frame  The product has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or  Hold  with a  High  risk outlook iShares U S  Oil Equipment   Services ETF  IEZ  This fund follows the Dow Jones U S  Select Oil Equipment   Services Index  holding 50 securities in its basket  The product has amassed  474 9 million in its asset base and trades in good volume of more than 89 000 shares per day  The ETF charges 45 bps in annual fees from investors  Here too  SLB takes the top spot making up roughly 21 57  of the assets while holding less than 9 7  of assets  This suggests that the fund is highly dependent on SLB s performance  BHI occupies the fourth position at 5 61   The fund returned about 32  so far this year and added 2 15  on the day PowerShares Dynamic Oil   Gas Services Fund  PXJ  This product offers exposure only to seven energy stocks with BHI at the top position  allocating 17 04  of total assets  PXJ is an active choice in the energy space and provides an option to pure play with upbeat Baker Hughes earnings and its impressive surge in share price  The fund tracks the Dynamic Oil Services Intellidex index  which evaluates companies on a host of investment criteria including growth  valuation  timeliness and risk factors  The ETF is less popular having amassed  120 2 million in its asset base and less liquid with average daily volume of 45 000 shares a day  The product has an expense ratio of 0 62  and added 2 01  on the day  The ETF is up nearly 30  so far this year  The fund currently has a Zacks ETF Rank of 4 or  Sell  with a  High  risk outlook Bottom Line The stellar performance by Schlumberger and Baker Hughes last week signals that the energy sector will continue to give strong performances in the months ahead  Rising U S  oil demand  greater energy conservation and increasing offshore drilling would fuel further growth  Further  with the earnings releases from other energy companies  Halliburton  HAL   Chevron  CVX  and Exxon Mobil  XOM  pending  it is difficult to conclusively speak on the sector s Q3 performance  though it is clearly off to a good start ,2013-10-22,Zacks Investment

  Updates with closing prices 
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK  Oct 27  Reuters    The U S  dollar and bonds
rose on Tuesday as investors moved into safer havens after
data showed U S  consumer confidence deteriorated in October 
reviving worries over the pace of an economic rebound 
 The U S  dollar rose to two week highs against the euro
while bonds surged  driving yields  which move inversely to
price  down from two month highs 
 Consumer confidence in the United States soured as the
worst labor market in a quarter century increased concerns
over the likely extent of an improvement in the future 
  This report reminds us that the economic recovery will be
soggy at best unless the consumer starts to feel better and
spend more   said Cary Leahey  an economist at Decision
Economics in New York 
 Consumers are the backbone of the U S  economy  so a weak
confidence report bodes ill for the economic recovery because
it indicates restrained consumer spending 
 The Conference Board s index of consumer confidence fell
to 47 7 in October  weaker than the consensus expectation of a
reading of 53 1  Confidence was pressured on growing concerns
that job market conditions would worsen in the near term 
 ID nN27241974 
 Other data showed home prices rose for the fourth straight
month in August  but did little to boost markets throughout
the day  The Standard   Poor s Case Shiller composite index of
home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose more than expected
in August  For more see  ID nN27236301  
 In late trading  the euro was down 0 54 percent at  1 4789
after touching  1 4787   its lowest since Oct  13 and
way below the  1 5064 hit on Monday  which was its highest
since August 2008 
 The dollar index   a measure of its performance
against six other major currencies  rose to 76 323  a two week
high  well above a 14 month low of 74 94 hit last week 
 U S  Treasuries extended gains on Tuesday following the
auction of  44 billion of two year notes  part of this week s
record  123 billion supply of government bonds 
 The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note  shot
up 27 32  with the yield at 3 45 percent  down from 3 55
percent late on Monday 
 Euro zone government bonds also rallied  with Bund futures
posting their biggest one day gain in a month  on the back of
the weak U S  consumer data that boosted demand for these

year highs of around  110 per barrel  Partly offsetting this favorable view has been a spike in U S  production    now at their highest levels since 1989    and suggestions that the U S  may taper its monetary stimulus later this year  The immediate outlook for oil  however  remains positive given the commodity s constrained supply picture  In particular  while the Western economies exhibit sluggish growth prospects  global oil consumption is expected to get a boost from sustained strength in China  the Middle East  Central and South America that continue to expand at a healthy rate  According to the Energy Information Administration  EIA   which provides official energy statistics from the U S  Government  world crude consumption grew by an estimated 0 7 million barrels per day in 2012 to a record high level of 89 0 million barrels per day  The agency  in its most recent Short Term Energy Outlook  said that it expects global oil demand growth by another 1 1 million barrels per day in 2013 and by a further 1 2 million barrels per day in 2014  Importantly  EIA s latest report assumes that world supply is likely to go up by 0 8 million barrels per day this year and by 1 2 million barrels per day in 2014  In our view  crude prices in the final few months of 2013 are likely to exhibit a sideways to bearish trend  trading in the  100  105 per barrel range  As tension over the U S  military intervention over Syria show signs of settling down  we are likely to experience a pressure in the price of a barrel of oil Natural Gas Over the last few years  a quiet revolution has been reshaping the energy business in the U S  The success of  shale gas     natural gas trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations    has transformed domestic energy supply  with a potentially inexpensive and abundant new source of fuel for the world s largest energy consumer  With the advent of hydraulic fracturing  or fracking     a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water  sand and chemicals    shale gas production is now booming in the U S  Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract gas from shale formations  the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U S  energy supplies  playing a key role in boosting domestic natural gas reserves  As a result  once faced with a looming deficit  natural gas is now available in abundance  In fact  natural gas inventories in underground storage hit an all time high of 3 929 trillion cubic feet  Tcf  in 2012  The oversupply of natural gas pushed down prices to a 10 year low of  1 82 per million Btu  MMBtu  during late April 2012  referring to spot prices at the Henry Hub  the benchmark supply point in Louisiana   However  things started to look up in 2013  This year  cold winter weather across most parts of the country boosted natural gas demand for space heating by residential commercial consumers  This  coupled with flat production volumes  meant that the inventory overhang was gone  thereby driving commodity prices to around  4 40 per MMBtu in Apr    the highest in 21 months  During the last few weeks  though  natural gas demand has gone through a relatively lean period  as mild weather    from July through mid August    prevailed over the country  leading to tepid electricity draws to run air conditioners  This led to a slide in the commodity s price  In fact  healthy injections over last few weeks  plus strong production  have meant that supplies have overturned the deficit over the five year average  With more moderate weather expected during the next few weeks  leading to reduced power demand  natural gas prices may experience another downward curve  This  in turn  is expected to pull down natural gas producers  particularly small ones ZACKS INDUSTRY RANK Oil Energy is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification  We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry  The way to look at the complete list of 260  industries is that the outlook for the top one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower  is positive  the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one third  Zacks Industry Rank  177 and higher  is negative  The oil energy industry is further sub divided into the following industries at the expanded level  Oil   U S  Integrated  Oil and Gas Drilling  Oil   U S  Exploration and Production  Oil Gas Production Pipeline MLP   Oilfield Services  Oil   International Integrated  Oil   Production Pipeline  Oilfield Machineries and Equipment  Oil   Integrated  and Oil Refining and Marketing  The  Oil   U S  Integrated  is the best placed among them with its Zacks Industry Rank  36  comfortably placing it into the top 1 3rd of the 260  industry groups  where it is joined by the  Oil   U S  Exploration and Production  with a Zacks Industry Rank  84  The  Oil and Gas Drilling    with a Zacks Industry Rank  99   just moves out of the top 1 3rd and into the middle 1 3rd  The  Oil   International Integrated  also lies in the middle 1 3rd with Zacks Industry Rank  119  The  Oil Gas Production Pipeline MLP  and  Oilfield Services  barely makes into the middle 1 3rd with a Zacks Industry Rank  161 and  166  respectively  However  all the other sub sectors    Oilfield Machineries and Equipment  Oil   Production Pipeline  Oil   Integrated  and Oil Refining and Marketing    are featuring in the bottom one third of all Zacks industries with respective Zacks Industry Ranks of  202   202   233 and  251  respectively  Looking at the exact location of these industries  one could say that the general outlook for the oil energy space as a whole is neutral to negative EARNINGS TRENDS As far as overall results of the Oil Energy sector is concerned  it displays a bearish trend with earnings falling 12 7  in the second quarter of 2013  weakening sharply from the 1 0  drop witnessed in the previous quarter  However  there was a marginal improvement in revenue performance  which was down 5 6  in the June quarter as against a decline of 6 3  in the first quarter  Second quarter earnings across all 16 sectors covered by Zacks increased 2 5   most of it coming from the Finance sector  Should we exclude Finance  earnings would be down 2 9  year over year  with one of the underperformers being the Oil Energy sector  In particular  the Oil Energy sector has suffered from weak results from Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM   which has a significant weight within the sector  Nevertheless  the sector had a decent performance in terms of beat ratios  percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises   The earnings  beat ratio  was 54 8   while the revenue  beat ratio  was 69 0  OPPORTUNITIES Considering the turbulent market dynamics of the energy industry  we always advocate the relatively low risk conglomerate business structures of the large cap integrateds  with their fortress like balance sheets  ample free cash flows even in a low oil price environment and growing dividends  Our preferred name in this group remains Chevron Corp   CVX   Its current oil and gas development project pipeline is among the best in the industry  boasting large  multiyear projects  Additionally  Chevron possesses one of the healthiest balance sheets among peers  which helps it to capitalize on investment opportunities with the option to make strategic acquisitions  While all crude focused stocks stand to benefit from rising commodity prices  companies in the exploration and production  E P  sector are the best placed  as they will be able to extract more value for their products  In particular  we suggest exposure to small cap  undervalued E P players like Matador Resources Co   MTDR  and Memorial Production Partners L P   MEMP   which enjoy the benefits of crude oil price leverage  The current oil price environment should also benefit producers  particularly those international players having attractive growth opportunities in their home markets  One such standout name is PetroChina Company Ltd   PTR   which remains well placed to benefit from the country s growing appetite for energy and the turnaround in commodity prices  We are also encouraged by the natural gas price reform that is expected to boost PetroChina s margins  One may also capitalize on this opportunity with the related business sector of energy equipment service providers  Our top pick in this space is Dril Quip Inc   DRQ   This offshore drilling equipment maker boasts of highly engineered drilling and production equipment for deepwater severe service applications and harsh environmental conditions  China s CNOOC Ltd   CEO  is also a top pick  CNOOC remains well placed to benefit from the country s growing appetite for energy and the turnaround in commodity prices  In particular  the company enjoys a monopoly on exploration activities in China s very prospective offshore region in addition to having a growing presence in the country s natural gas and liquefied natural gas  LNG  infrastructure  The recent acquisition of Canadian energy producer Nexen Inc  will further improve CNOOC s growth profile by augmenting proven reserves by 30   while helping it to vastly expand its holdings in Canada  Finally  despite the uncertain natural gas fundamentals and the understandable reluctance on the investors  part to dip their feet into these stocks  we would advocate buying Range Resources Corp   RRC  and Cabot Oil   Gas Corp   COG   Both of them have been among the better performing S P stocks since the start of 2013  gaining 25  and 55  during the period  respectively  Most of the gains have been driven by their exposure to the high return Marcellus Shale play  as well as their above average production growth WEAKNESSES We are bearish on Europe s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell plc  RDS A   The integrated player is particularly susceptible to its high exposure to the downstream business  as well as its major natural gas focus and lofty capital spending  We are bearish on Brazil s state run energy giant Petroleo Brasileiro S A   PBR   or Petrobras S A  Following the company s lower than expected second quarter showing  we see little reason for investors to own the stock  The Rio de Janeiro headquartered group remains plagued by several issues that include decreased liquids realizations  weak production  huge investment requirements and the possibility of heightened state interference  Energy focused engineering and construction firm McDermott International Inc   MDR  is another company we would like to avoid for the time being  mainly due to its erratic earnings trend over the last few quarters and a disappointing outlook for 2013  Apart from having to deal with steeper operating costs  McDermott has already hinted that its top line will suffer next year due to uncertainty regarding the timing of big awards  One sector that has underperformed the rest of the energy industry is  refining and marketing  With refiners being buyers of crude    whose price has seen a steep climb recently    their profitability has been negatively impacted due to a rise in the input cost and lower crack spreads  Against this backdrop  we are particularly bearish on Marathon Petroleum Corp   MPC

193841,415357,CVX,Stocks With A Margin Of Safety  Invest To Reduce Risk  Enhance Returns,opinion,IntroductionOf all of the many sound investing principles that legendary teacher and investor Ben Graham put forward  he believed that his concept of  margin of safety  was the most important of all  This investment lesson was so deeply ingrained into the mind of Ben Graham s most famous student  Warren Buffett  that he created his two most important rules of sound investing  Rule number one  Never lose money  Rule number two  Never forget rule number one  Clearly  both of these renowned sages understood the importance of minimizing risk  especially when investing in equities  The following quote from Ben s famous book The Intelligent Investor corroborates and summarizes my point  In the old legend the wise men finally boiled down the history of mortal affairs into the single phrase  This too will pass    Confronted with a like challenge to distill the secret of sound investment into three words  we venture the motto  MARGIN OF SAFETY  This is the thread that runs through all the preceding discussion of investment policy often explicitly  sometimes in a less direct fashion   Chapter 20  The Intelligent Investor Investors at all levels of skill and experience will intuitively accept and embrace the margin of safety concept  However  not all investors will dutifully follow it  but few could argue against its validity  Moreover  those that would reject the concept will often rationalize their not following of this simple  yet profoundly important rule based on another widely held notion that in order to get higher returns  you must simultaneously be willing to take on more risk  One of my primary objectives with writing this article is to turn this last notion on its head  I intend to demonstrate that one of the most salient features of Ben Graham s motto  MARGIN OF SAFETY  is that it not only reduces downside risk when investing in equities  but how it also simultaneously enhances future returns  Lowering risk  while concurrently increasing return  is a fundamental tenet  and automatic benefit  of investing in a common stock when it provides the investor a large margin of safety  Yes  investing in a stock when it offers a margin of safety undeniably lowers risk and presents the opportunity for enhanced long term return In order to understand how this works  it s implicit that we also understand exactly what a margin of safety is and means  Simply stated  a common stock offers a margin of safety when it can be purchased at a valuation that is lower than its intrinsic value  Moreover  the wider the gap between current value and intrinsic value  the greater will be the margin of safety  Regarding investing in a stock when it offers a large margin of safety  some may find this next reality ironic  This also means that the safer the stock is  the greater the potential for higher future rewards it offers  Achieving a higher return  while taking less risk  is nirvana for common stock investors At this point  some clarity is in order  The margin of safety principle relates to investing in the same individual stock at different levels of valuation  In other words  I am addressing the risk reward ratio of investing in a single or particular company  at different levels of valuation  Consequently  it must be understood that the company possesses the same attributes of fundamental quality  and growth potential regardless of valuation  Consequently  the higher the valuation  the greater will be the risk  and the lower the return that investment in the company provides  Conversely  at low valuations  the risk of owning the company is lower  but the potential future return higher  Although this defies the principle that you must take higher risk in order to get a higher return  when investing in common stocks it represents an indisputable truth Margin of Safety  What It Is and How It WorksAt this point  it is important to state that margin of safety is a value investor s concept  Moreover  it defies the conventional definition or concept of risk as defined by Modern Portfolio Theory  MPT   Practitioners of MPT rely heavily on the concept of beta to define risk  The following Warren Buffett quote on beta summarizes both of our views on beta  Value investors scorn the idea of beta because it implies that a stock that has fallen sharply in value is more risky than it was before it fell  A value investor would argue that a company represents a lower risk investment after it falls in value  Since a picture is worth a thousand words  I will provide a few examples utilizing the F A S T  Graphs   Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool to illustrate the value investor s concept of margin of safety  and how it simultaneously reduces risk and enhances return  The reader should further note  that what follows are simply offered as examples of how the margin of safety concept works  Additionally  I will provide two examples of classic dividend growth stocks  and two examples of aggressive pure growth stocks to illustrate how this concept universally applies As an interesting sidebar  all of the following examples will illustrate what I believe to be a great irony of investing  In reality  based on the entire historical precedent throughout all market history  the very best time to buy common stocks is when people dislike them the most  And of course  I am referring to recessions which represent periods when people not only dislike stocks  they also flee them  Once again I turn to Ben Graham s The Intelligent Investor to provide insight into the fallacy behind this thinking  The following is found in the footnotes of Chapter 20 on Pages 521 and 522  Graham is saying that there is no such thing as a good or bad stock  there are only cheap stocks and expensive stocks  Even the best company becomes a  sell  when its stock price goes too high  while the worst company is worth buying if its stock goes low enough   Similarly  Wall Street s analysts have always tended to call a stock a  strong buy  when its price is high  and to label it a  sell  after its price has fallen the exact opposite of what Graham  and simple common sense  would dictate  As he does throughout the book  Graham is distinguishing speculation or buying on the hope that a stock s price will keep going up from investing  or buying on the basis of what the underlying business is worth  Sample Dividend Growth StocksAflac Inc    AFL My first example looks at what happened to Aflac s stock price  the black line  as we entered the Great Recession of 2008 2009  Notice how earnings  the orange line on the graph  held up much better than the stock price  More plainly stated  the price fell far more than fundamentals justified that it should  Therefore  once Aflac s stock price fell below the orange earnings justified value line  intrinsic value  a clear margin of safety was created  Moreover  the farther it fell  the safer it became while simultaneously the reward for investing in Aflac also was enhanced Additionally  notice that for all the years prior to that  including the recession of 2001  Aflac s price had never fallen below its intrinsic value  the orange line   And perhaps even more importantly  notice that Aflac raised their dividend every year  the pink line on the graph plots dividends   Also  the reader should further realize that at Aflac s low price of  10 83 in the spring of 2009  it provided the astute investor approximately a 10  current dividend yield  Therefore  at exactly the same time that Aflac s stock provided the highest margin of safety  it also provided the highest current yield of 10 34   and the highest future capital gain potential than at any other time  In other words  Aflac offered investors both its highest capital gain potential  and an extremely high current yield  at precisely the safest time you could have invested in it in modern history A deeper look into Aflac s fundamentals provides additional evidence as to just how safe investing in Aflac was when its margin of safety was the highest  The following FUN Graph  fundamental underlying numbers  plots Aflac s cash per share  cashps  and more importantly as it relates to dividends  free cash flow per share  fcsflps   FUN Graphs calculates free cash flow after dividends have been paid  Therefore  even during the throes of the Great Recession  Aflac s finances were healthy and strong 3M Co    MMM Although some could argue that since Aflac is in the Financial Sector  risk  or at least the perception of risk  would be higher than my rhetoric implies  3M on the other hand is widely considered one of the bluest of all blue chips  Therefore  as the following Earnings and Price Correlated graph depicts  the margin of safety principle is clearly evident Just like we saw with Aflac  3M offered its highest yield and simultaneously its greatest capital gain potential at precisely the time when its margin of safety was strongest  Stated more plainly  3M offered investors its best returns when the risk with investing in it was at its lowest level  With my 3M example  I provide the following FUN Graph which plots assets per share  atps  and common equity per share  ceqps  also known as book value  Once again we see an example of a company that was and remained fundamentally healthy prior to and right through our last two recessions  Consequently  3M s price collapse in 2008 created a great margin of safety and an incredible opportunity to invest in their shares  Before I leave my dividend growth examples and move on to pure growth  I feel it s appropriate to add that the growing dividends provided by both of these Dividend Champions provide a type of margin of safety in their own right  Even though the prices of these Dividend Champions may have temporarily fallen  the dividend income that their shareholders received continued to grow The reader should also recognize that every time a dividend is paid  their capital at risk is technically reduced  This provides one more level of risk mitigation that a margin of safety provides  This coincides with the famous Will Rogers quote   I am more concerned with the return of my money than the return on my money   Consequently  astute investors focused on yield over price volatility  are additionally provided the emotional support needed to fight emotional risk High Growth StocksBy their very nature  high growth stocks are rightfully considered riskier than blue chip dividend paying stocks  Not only do they not provide the safety net that dividends offer  they are also exposed to the difficult challenge of needing to continue growing at high rates in order to reward their shareholders  Consequently  anything that reduces the risk of investing in high growth stocks is a real plus Moreover  in order to participate in the potential high returns provided by a high growth stock  implies that you must also typically be willing to buy them at higher than average valuations  Where most stocks  average companies  are at fair value when their P E hovers around a plus or minus 15  very fast growing companies often command normal P E s that approximate their earnings growth rates  Both of my following growth stock examples will illustrate this point LKQ Corp   LKQ For those not familiar with this incredibly consistent high growth stock  I offer the following excerpt business description courtesy of Capital IQ  LKQ Corporation  together with its subsidiaries  provides replacement parts  components  and systems needed to repair vehicles  primarily cars and trucks in the United States  the United Kingdom  Canada  Mexico  and Central America  The company operates through Wholesale North America  Wholesale Europe  and Self Service  It distributes various products  including aftermarket collision and mechanical products  recycled collision and mechanical products  and refurbished collision replacement products  such as heels  bumper covers and lights  and remanufactured engines to collision and mechanical automobile repair industry  The company principally serves collision and mechanical repair shops  new and used car dealerships  and metal recyclers  as well as to retail customers  LKQ Corporation was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Chicago  Illinois  My primary purpose behind providing this example is to point out that during the throes of the Great Recession LKQ s P E ratio had fallen to 15  Note  I have added a 15 P E overlay the magenta line   Therefore  this considerably above average growth stock could then have been purchased at the valuation of an average growing business  Moreover  notice that only price was weak during this time while earnings continued to strongly advance  Astute growth investors are always on the lookout for this kind of opportunity   Note that LKQ does not offer a margin of safety at today s high valuation  Cognizant Technology Solutions   CTSH For those not familiar with this incredibly consistent high growth stock  I offer the following excerpt business description courtesy of Capital IQ  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation provides information technology  IT   consulting  and business process outsourcing services worldwide  The company operates through four segments  Financial Services  Healthcare  Manufacturing  Retail  and Logistics  and Other  It offers consulting and technology services  such as IT strategy  program management  operations improvement  strategy  and business consulting services  and application design and development  systems integration  and enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management implementation services  It also provides enterprise information management services  such strategic  advisory  and management consulting  enterprise data management  descriptive analytics business intelligence  strategic corporate performance management  and packaged analytics services  as well as big data services that assist clients in managing and deriving actionable insights from the explosion in the volume  variety  velocity  and complexity of data  Cognizant Technology Solutions was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Teaneck  New Jersey  With Cognizant  we once again see an example of earnings continuing to strongly advance  while only fear drove stock price down  Consequently  as we ve seen with all of the examples cited in this article  recessions can be as much about opportunity as they are about risk  At the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009  this powerful growth stock could be purchased at a P E of only 12  Note  I have added a 12 P E overlay the magenta line   The following Earnings and Price Correlated Graph since the beginning of 2009 provides an additional perspective on the margin of safety concept  Notice that Cognizant s earnings growth rate did slow down from 35 7  to 23 7   Nevertheless  the margin of safety provided by its lower than average valuation  mitigated the risk of slower growth The following performance results associated with the above Earnings and Price Correlated graph illustrate the profit opportunity afforded by investing in a high growth stock  even when earnings growth slowed a bit  Simply stated  buying Cognizant at a low valuation reduced risk while generating a compounded annual rate of return of 36 8  per annum that exceeded its earnings growth rate by a wide margin Finding A Margin Of Safety In Today s Strong MarketAt this point  I would like to address what I believe to be a very important misconception held by many investors  Instead of predicating their stock investing decisions based on their view of the relative merits of individual companies  investors will often allow their biased view of the overall market deter them  The refrain goes something like   after such a strong run  the stock market is now too high for me to invest in stocks My experience has taught me that the fallacy behind this line of thinking is that it is not a stock market  instead it is a market of stocks  Moreover  whether we are in a bull market or a bear market  there will always be examples of overvalued  fairly valued or undervalued individual selections to be found  Accordingly  I believe portfolios should be built one company at a time  based on the specific merits of each individual company under consideration Consequently  I present Deere   Co   DE   as a current example of a quality common stock that provides a high margin of safety even in today s supposedly overheated market  Deere   Company is a dividend contender on David Fish s CCC lists found here with a streak of ten consecutive years of dividend increases  Its current single digit P E ratio and above market dividend yield provides a long term opportunity with a strong margin of safety  in my opinion I also offer two additional examples  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  TEVA   and Chevron  CVX   two companies whose current low valuations also provide a strong long term margin of safety  Note that both of these companies can be bought at single digit P E ratios  which I believe mitigates any potential future weaker earnings growth Teva Pharmaceutical IndustriesChevron CorpSpeculation Versus InvestmentThe margin of safety idea conceived by Ben Graham is a concept dealing with sound investing  Value investing  and other prudent investing strategies  must be understood in contrast to speculating  At its heart  identifying a margin of safety in a common stock is first about identifying the company s intrinsic business value  Although margin of safety relates to  and with a low stock price  it is not the price per se but the valuation that it represents that is most important  Once again  I will turn to Ben Graham s teachings from The Intelligent Investor with two important excerpts that summarize my points  Margin of Safety  as the Central Concept of InvestmentIt is our argument that a sufficiently low price can turn a security of mediocre quality into a sound investment opportunity  provided that the buyer is informed and experienced and that he practices adequate diversification  For  if the price is low enough to create a substantial margin of safety  the security thereby meets our criterion of investment   Page 521 The Intelligent Investor To Sum UpInvestment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike  It is amazing to see how many capable businessmen try to operate in Wall Street with complete disregard of all the sound principles through which they have gained success in their own undertakings  Yet every corporate security may best be viewed  in the first instance  as an ownership interest in  or a claim against  a specific business enterprise  And if a person sets out to make profits from security purchases and sales  he is embarking on a business venture of his own  which must be run in accordance with accepted business principles if it is to have a chance of success The first and most obvious of these principles is   Know what you are doing know your business   Page 523 The Intelligent InvestorSummary and ConclusionsInvesting in common stocks is fraught with danger  complexity and confusion  Therefore  anything that can reduce the risks associated with successfully building and executing a stock portfolio is of great benefit  Personally  I do believe that Ben Graham s margin of safety motto is one of the most important investing principles to keep in the forefront of our minds  Finding stocks with great margins of safety does require some work and digging  However  I believe the rewards are more than worth the effort Finally  it s important to recognize and understand that finding stocks when they offer a margin of safety is a long term strategy  For whatever reason  when a stock offers a margin of safety  it is unpopular  Therefore  logic would dictate that it may not provide immediate gratification  However  over the long term  which I define as at a minimum business cycle of three to five years  a stock providing a margin of safety will lower risk and increase long term returns  This is especially important for retired investors or those near retirement Disclosure  Long AFL  LKQ  CTSH

193844,415360,CVX,Geology Beats Technology  Shell Shuts Down Oil Shale Pilot Project,opinion,The belief that technology can always overcome natural limits just took a big hit this week when   The ostensible reason is that the company has opportunities elsewhere  Shell says it wants to shift resources away from the intransigent rock and move it to profitable opportunities  That sounds logical  But  it might have sounded logical in any of the last 10 years as oil prices rose to historic heights while oil shale projects languished  Even today   The prize for anyone who profitably unlocks these deposits is huge    So why isn t  yielding to the mighty combination of deep pockets  sophisticated technology and high prices  A clue comes from one sentence in  in The Denver Post   Full scale production would probably have required building a dedicated power plant   In simple terms  it takes energy to get energy  Shell s process requires copious amounts of electricity to heat the rock in place through boreholes in order to release the waxy hydrocarbons embedded in it  In this pilot project  the subterranean rock was heated for three years before liquids were captured and brought to the surface for further processing   Oil shale is a promotional term  Oil shale is neither shale  nor does it contain oil  It is better characterized as organic marlstone  It contains   a waxy  long chain hydrocarbon that must be extensively processed to make it into a synthetic form of crude oil  Oil shale is often confused with oil taken from deep shale formations such as the Bakken in North Dakota  oil properly called  tight oil    The ratio of energy outputs to inputs for oil shale is estimated to be about 2 to 1  according to  by Cleveland Cutler who has long examined energy return on energy invested  Shell claimed a ratio of around 3 to 1  though that claim no longer appears on the    That seems good until you realize that we are currently running the world on crude which has a ratio around 20 to 1  Furthermore    And  water is increasingly difficult to secure in an area that has seen growing demand combined with more than a decade of drought  Proponents of oil shale claimed in 1981 that it would be economical to process  and stay there  The threshold price kept escalating along with the price of oil  in a 2008 study by the U S  Bureau of Land Management  And  yet here we are  Brent Crude  the de facto world benchmark  hovers around  108 dollars  The average daily price for the past three years has remained above  100  In the face of these consistent record high prices  Shell is abandoning oil shale development  And  Shell isn t the only one  Another international major  Chevron Corp     There are others who soldier on in the oil shale deposits  and they may eventually find ways to produce a synthetic crude from this rock at a profit  But 30 years of failure suggests that such a development remains far off  And  in a world that is trying to wean itself from fossil fuels because of climate change and the risks of depletion  time may run out  The path of oil shale is reminiscent of atomic fusion research  Twenty five years ago  fusion was supposed to be just 25 years in the future  Earlier in the same decade  oil shale was touted as the future of oil  Today  fusion remains the energy source of the future  just as oil shale does   and researchers at the world s main fusion research facility  the   say that fusion will perhaps be ready for commercial use by mid century  To be fair  the challenges for fusion researchers are daunting  For example  they must build and run a device that operates at interior temperatures of 150 million degrees centigrade  which is 10 times hotter than the core of the sun  And  they must do it safely and in a way that produces more energy than the device consumes  But  because the challenges are so daunting  it may turn out that fusion will always remain the energy of the future  We already know how to fuse two atoms  And  we know how to process oil shale to produce synthetic oil  But  we don t know how to do either of these things at an energy or financial profit sufficient enough to make them practical for widespread deployment  There is a strong possibility that we may not learn how to succeed with either in a time frame that matters to anyone living today  That means we must get on with other technologies  energy projects and energy policies that have a more realistic possibility of addressing our energy needs and the climate change caused by our current energy regime ,2013-09-30,Kurt Cobb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/geology-beats-technology:-shell-shuts-down-oil-shale-pilot-project-185751,185751

percent at 25 60 euros at 0752GMT  outperforming the Amsterdam
blue chip index which was up 0 8 percent  They rose as high as

  This project fits well within our strategic focus on the
oil and gas market segment and our expansion into marine
contracting activities   Boskalis Chief Executive Peter
Berdowski said in a statement 
 Boskalis will be responsible for dredging and marine
contracting activities on the Gorgon project and has also been
assigned the logistical and programme management role for part
of the basic infrastructure  the company said 
 Boskalis has said it is engaged in a rationalisation
programme in order to improve its margins and allow it to be
selective in bidding for projects

direction as of late as the weak dollar helps multinationals

193855,415371,CVX,3 Ultra Cheap ETFs For Value Investors,opinion,Value Stocks Shine over Long PeriodsResearchers have come up with different explanations for the  value premium   ever since Fama and French published their famous research paper in 1992  showing outperformance of value stocks over growth stocks over long term  Further  numerous academic studies conducted since then have shown that value stocks have delivered higher returns with lower volatility compared with growth stocks over the long term in almost all the markets studied  Does that mean that investors should ignore growth stocks  Not at all  growth stocks shine in certain market cycles and value stocks in some others  But given their proven performance over long term  value stocks and funds should be a predominant part of any  core  portfolio  Also  while some of the small cap companies have high return potential  they are mostly riskier and require frequent monitoring  and on the other hand established large cap companies with solid balance sheets and stable cash flows are less risky and thus more suitable for long term investors  Are Cheaper Funds Better  Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term  cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins  other things remaining the same  The following table shows how high expanses can affect fund returns  In the example  we put  10 000 in three funds  with annual expense ratios of 0 10   0 50  and 1 00  respectively and assumed that all three of them returned 8  per annum  The difference in total returns  after expenses  becomes very significant as we increase the holding period  For the purpose of simplicity of calculations  we have ignored transaction costs and taxes  We may add that expense ratio is not the only cost involved in investing in an ETF but it usually is the major cost  however investors need to look at other implicit costs too in addition to expense ratio Below  we have analyzed three large cap value ETFs with ultra low expense ratios that should be considered by investors for their long term  core portfolios  Schwab U S  Large Cap Value ETF  SCHV  SCHV provides broad exposure to large cap U S  stocks with value style characteristics  representing about half of the market capitalization of stocks in the Dow Jones U S  Large Cap Total Stock Market Index  Launched in December 2009  the fund has so far been able to attract assets worth  713 4M  which are invested in 356 holdings  With an annual fee of just 7 basis points  this product is the cheapest option in the space  Additionally  the dividend yield at 2 5  is quite attractive  Financials  24 3    Consumer Staples  12 2    Energy  11 6   and Consumer Discretionary  11 1   are the top four sectors  the fund has invested in  With almost a quarter of the asset base invested in financials stocks  the product is likely to benefit from continued outperformance by the sector  Exxon  GE  P G  Chevron and Wells Fargo are among the top holdings  With top ten holdings accounting for just about 27  of the asset base  the fund is pretty well diversified  SCHV is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ETF  Vanguard Value ETF  VTV  VTV follows a full replication approach to track the performance of the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index  With AUM of  11 2 billion and an expense ratio of just 10 basis points  this is one of the largest and cheapest funds within the space  Exxon  J J  GE  Chevron and Microsoft are among the top holdings  The fund is quite well diversified with top ten holdings accounting for just about 28  of the asset base  Financials  22 6    Healthcare  14 4   and Energy  12 6   are the top sectors  The product has returned 18 8  year to date  VTV is an Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ETF  Vanguard Russell 1000 Value ETF  VONV  VONV tracks the Russell 1000 Value Index  which predominantly comprises value stocks of large U S  companies  The fund charges a low expense ratio of 15 basis points while the SEC yield is attractive at 2 2  currently  Financial Services  29 6    Energy  14 9   and Healthcare  13 0   are the top sectors in terms of asset allocation  Looking at the holdings   Exxon  GE  Chevron  J J and P G occupy the top spots  The fund holds 649 stocks with top ten holdings accounting for about 27  of the asset base  VONV is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  ETF ,2013-08-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-ultra-cheap-etfs-for-value-investors-180205,180205

193857,415373,CVX,Crude Prices Fall Despite Supply Drop,opinion,The U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed that crude stockpiles logged a larger than expected decline  The report further revealed that within the  refined products  category  gasoline stocks plunged  while distillate supplies were up from the week ago level  Meanwhile  refiners unexpectedly scaled up their utilization rates by 1 6  Despite the supportive crude data from the U S  government and the ongoing unrest in Egypt that could destabilize the resource rich Middle East and further tighten the global supply picture  the commodity s price retreated back below  104 a barrel  This was mainly on account of the minutes from the Federal Reserve s July meeting that suggested that the U S  may taper its monetary stimulus later this year  Traders have voiced concerns that Fed s shift away from the bond buying policy may lead to dollar denominated oil prices to increase in local currency terms in emerging markets  thus slowing growth  About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report The Energy Information Administration  EIA  Petroleum Status Report  containing data of the previous week ending Friday  outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U S   both locally and abroad  The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of petroleum products  It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry  Analysis of the Data Crude Oil  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1 43 million barrels for the week ending Aug 16  2013  following a decrease of 2 81 million barrels in the previous week  The analysts surveyed by Platts   the energy information arm of McGraw Hill Financial Inc   MHFI    had expected crude stocks to go down some 1 million barrels  An uptick in refinery processing rates and lower domestic production led to the stockpile drawdown with the world s biggest oil consumer even as imports rose  In particular  crude inventories at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   were down 1 09 million barrels from the previous week s level to 37 43 million barrels  Stocks are currently at their lowest since Mar last year and 27 8  under the all time high of 51 86 million barrels reached in Jan  As a result of the seventh weekly inventory decline in 8 weeks  at 359 06 million barrels  current crude supplies are at their lowest level since Aug  31  last year  It is now down slightly  by 0 4   from the year ago period  though it is still close to the upper limit of the average for this time of the year  The crude supply cover remained at 22 7 days   same as in the previous week  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 23 2 days  Gasoline  Supplies of gasoline were down for the second time in as many weeks  as domestic consumption strengthened and imports dropped  This was partially offset by rise in production  The 4 03 million barrels withdrawal   comfortably outpacing analysts  projections for a 1 5 million barrels decrease in supply level   took gasoline stockpiles down to 218 40 million barrels  Notwithstanding this drawdown  the existing inventory level of the most widely used petroleum product is 7 7  higher than the year earlier level and is in the top half of the average range  Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  were up 871 000 barrels last week  just short of analysts  expectations for a 1 million barrels rise in inventory level  The increase in distillate fuel stocks   the third in as many weeks   could be attributed to higher imports and production  At 129 35 million barrels  distillate supplies are 3 4  above the year ago level but is close to the lower limit of the average range for this time of the year  Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization edged up 1 6  from the prior week to 91 0   The analysts were expecting the refinery run rate to decrease 0 5  to 88 9   Stocks to Consider Despite concerns  with spot crude price staying strong   at around  104 a barrel   brokerage analysts are likely to upgrade their forecasts on oil weighted companies and related support plays  leading to positive estimate revisions  While all crude focused stocks   including behemoths like Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM  and Chevron Corp   CVX    stand to benefit from rising commodity prices  companies in the exploration and production  E P  sector are the best placed  as they will be able to extract more value for their products  In particular  one can look at Matador Resources Co   MTDR    a small cap  undervalued E P player   as a good buying opportunity  Dallas TX based Matador Resources  sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   with current focus on the high return Eagle Ford shale formation in South Texas  is expected to witness earnings growth of 287  in 2013 ,2013-08-23,Zacks Investment

 By Ellis Mnyandu
 NEW YORK  Sept 23  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Wednesday
as investors worried the Federal Reserve is closer to pulling
back on extraordinary measures to inject funding to shore up
the economy 
  The Fed s policy setters met and kept interest rates
unchanged  as expected  but they also said the U S  central
bank would slow purchases of mortgage debt to extend that
program s life until the end of March  That was seen as a step
toward a measured withdrawal of its extraordinary support for
the economy during the downturn  For details  see
 ID nN23390829 
  They re talking about removing some of the various
packages they have in place for purchasing mortgages and other
instruments in debt markets that was kind of keeping everything
flowing   said Kurt Brunner  portfolio manager at the
Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia 
  There s a broad concern about what happens when the Fed
gets out of the way  
 Among the casualties were banks  housing stocks and energy
shares  The Dow Jones home construction index  slid
3 4 percent  while the S P energy index  declined 2
percent  a decline that coincided with a sharp slide in crude
oil prices 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  shed 81 32 points 
or 0 83 percent  to 9 748 55  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
 declined 10 79 points  or 1 01 percent  to 1 060 87  The
Nasdaq Composite Index  lost 14 88 points  or 0 69
percent  to 2 131 42 
 Initially stocks had risen sharply following the Fed s
comment that economic activity was picking up  but in the last
hour of trading the market reversed course as investors fretted
about the timing of the removal of some of the Fed s stimulus 
 The other worry was the Fed s vow that interest rates will
stay low for an extended time 
  Keeping interest rates low    it s positive for the
consumer  but it s tougher for banks to make money with
interest rates so low   said Dan Faretta  senior market
strategist at Lind Waldock  a brokerage firm in Chicago 
 The market s runup of nearly 60 percent over six months
might have also caused some investors to use the Fed s
statement as reason to book profits  he added 
 Slowing mortgage purchases is something the Fed could
consider in another six months  Faretta said   There s still a
lot of problems with mortgages  the housing market in general 
as well as the banking sector  
 Among banks  JPMorgan  fell 3 03 percent to  45 06 
making the stock the Dow s top drag  The S P financial index
 and the KBW bank index  each lost 2 1 percent 
 Home builder Toll Brothers  fell 3 4 percent to
 20 68  In energy  Chevron Corp  fell 1 7 percent to
 71 73  while U S  front month crude futures  declined
 2 79 or 3 89 percent to settle at  68 97 a barrel 
 Networking equipment maker Cisco Systems  weighed
heavily on Nasdaq  falling 2 6 percent to  22 80 
 Volume was moderate  with about 1 32 billion shares
changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange  compared with
last year s estimated daily average of 1 49 billion  On the
Nasdaq  about 2 72 billion shares traded  above last year s
daily average of 2 28 billion 
 Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by
a ratio of about 9 to 5  while on the Nasdaq  about eight
stocks fell for every five that rose

 NEW YORK  Oct 12  Reuters    U S  stocks trimmed gains to
trade flat on Monday as investors locked in some profits in
cautious trading before earnings season picks up steam 
 With many market players away for the Columbus Day holiday 
volume was light  making the market choppy  The Nasdaq turned
negative  but the Dow and the S P 500 managed to stay above
water as energy shares gained alongside the price of oil 
 If the broad S P 500 closes higher  it will be its sixth
day of gains 
 This would be the S P s longest winning streak since
another six day runup in late May and early June 2007 
 Optimism about the earnings season that is getting under
way has fueled stocks  recent advance  pushing the S P 500 up
almost 60 percent from March s 12 year closing low  As a
result  some investors took the opportunity to cash in profits 
analysts said 
  You re seeing prudence taking the lead here  with people
starting to lock in profits in hopes we don t see a pretty big
move down after some of the larger companies report over the
next few days   said Michael James  senior trader at regional
investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles 
 Black   Decker Corp  jumped 6 4 percent to  50 25 as
the power tools maker raised its third quarter earnings outlook
ahead of a series of blue chip earnings reports this week  For

193864,415380,CVX,20 Inexpensive Dividend Aristocrats With Low Forward P Es,opinion,Dividend Aristocrats are some of the best dividend growth stocks you can buy  These stocks have raised their cash distributions to shareholders over a period of more than 25 years without a break  Obviously  that s no guarantee the dividend will go higher next year but the possibility is very strong   I recently

193865,415381,CVX,US Market Roundup  Trading Lower But Not As Bearish As You Think,opinion,US stocks clocked in yet another losing day  not entirely surprising considering that we have had a long series of bullish gains prior to this  S P 500 close 0 37  lower while Dow 30 fell by 0 24  on Monday  The common explanation for the decline was the slightly depressing US economic data that was released on Monday  However  if we look closely at the actual data  this explanation does not really stand well  We had a 2 major news from North America yesterday   Pending Home Sales and Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activities  The former was actually better than expected  growing 9 1  Y Y in the month of Jun  while Dallas Fed came in at 4 4 vs 7 5 expected  which is also not a dismal print as it is still nicely positive considering the volatility of the index So what is the actual reason for the fall We saw big names losing yesterday   Microsoft  Hewlett Packard  Chevron and ExxonMobil  It is possible that the decline in these big names dragged the broader risk sentiment lower on a day which saw Asian Market trading extremely bearishly  However  there is some silver lining as most of the losses suffered yesterday was the result of a opening gap lower  with prices actually pushing higher during the latter part of the trading session  This suggest that price is generally stable for now  and the decline suffered yesterday may simply be a one time revaluation due to broad anti risk sentiment  rather than US stocks being bearish themselves  This is important as we enter into the final stretch of earnings seasons   stock prices still have the opportunity to rally higher if earnings are better than expected  and or any high level economic news event surprise to the upside  e g  ISM Manufacturing  FOMC Rate Decision  Dow 30 Hourly ChartThis is important for technicals as well  Price is currently heading into the 15 550 resistance once more after breaking the descending trendline  With Stoch readings pointing higher and deep within the Oversold region  bulls will be glad to know that inherent sentiment of US stocks isn t outright bearish  This puts price in a good position to retest 15 550 proper once more  and even in the event that a bearish rejection does occur at the resistance  the likelihood of prices holding above the descending trendline increases as well S P 500 Hourly Chart With regards to S P 500  the likelihood of a trendline break increases especially given that Stoch readings is still yet within the Overbought region  A break of the descending trendline opens up 1 690 as the next level of bullish target  Similar to Dow 30  the ability to breach 1 690 based on this move alone is suspect  but the possibility of descending trendline turning into a support is higher given the non bearish nature of US stocks  Currently  with Nikkei 225 trading higher  potentially a corrective pullback  and other Asian Stocks marginally higher  there will be less bearish resistances against any further climb of US stocks  This further increases the likelihood of prices hitting their respective bullish targets in the next few trading session if not the upcoming one  However  it should be noted that Nikkei 225 s current bullish effort is far from negating the overall bearish pressure  especially when seen from the Monthly Chart  Therefore  we could still see a reversion of bearish sentiment across Asian Markets  which will jeopardize bulls ability to break through the aforementioned resistance  adding one more reason why a rebound back towards their respective descending trendline may be more likely in the near term ,2013-07-30,Mingze Wu,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-market-roundup:-trading-lower-but-not-as-bearish-as-you-think-177504,177504

193867,415383,CVX,Big Oil  Disappointing 2Q Earnings,opinion,Last week the major integrated oil companies reported earnings for the second quarter of 2013  and all in all  the investment world was not pleased with their performances  First  people should understand that the largest oil companies in the world  Exxon  Shell  BP  and Chevron are dominant companies which generate large amounts of revenues  cash flow  and in absolute dollars  net profits  However  the costs for large integrated majors have been going up and are enormous  In order to explore for oil  both in the sea and on land  they have to pay millions for the licenses and the acreage to develop  Once they have the land or rights to sea areas  they have to lay out hundreds of millions of dollars to drill for the oil with rigs or sea platforms  Projects take years to develop  so the payback time can be extended  The chances of discovering oil are typically about one in every four wells that are drilled  One final potential problem is the volatility of oil prices  In this quarter  as oil prices retreated a bit  their profits were hurt some  Obviously  the way technology has developed the capabilities of seismic imaging and the use of sensors and nanotechnology  more precision in locating oil is constantly improving  Still  the largest problem for investors in the oil sector is the amount of capital expenditure which constantly needs to be made  Another problem for big oil is much of the new possible discovery is located in areas which are very dangerous  either weather wise or in politically unstable regions  Making things even more difficult for the majors is the high volume of oil that they deal with  and the expectations of Wall Street  The investment world is constantly concerned with growth  The big oil majors produce an average of anywhere from 2 5 millions of barrels of oil per day  In order to move the needle on those production numbers  the oil majors have to invest not hundreds of millions of dollars in new projects  but billions of dollars  Big oil is a high stakes game with major financial and political consequences as many countries depend on their oil revenue for nearly all of their budget revenues for a fiscal year  I would expect you will see a much sharper focus placed on developing existing acreage versus looking for new territories  especially if those areas are dangerous  in tough to access regions  or under the control of governments which might be considered questionable to deal with  In looking at the major s results  Exxon  BP  Shell  and Chevron all had results which were below what the market expected  Speaking specifically to BP and Shell  the former was hurt by a high tax rate and some tax lag on their investment in Rosneft and how Russian duties are calculated  Certainly  the fact they had to set aside a bit more money for the ongoing legal situation from the Macondo oil spill did not help either  Operationally  things went pretty much as expected as their upstream division performed well and their downstream  refining  was solid  Shell was disappointing because their investments in non conventional avenues for oil development  meaning shale and tight oil  proved very disappointing  Shell also withdrew their guidance for cash flow growth in the future  Shell is the second largest oil company in the world  and their announcement shows that regardless of how promising an area is  if you pay too much for land or access to development  there certainly is no guarantee you can recover the resources to make the return on investment worthwhile  This is the fundamental issue with the big oil companies right now  which is how much return will be realized based on the amount of capital spent  Shock of shock to anyone investing capital  but this is the same question one has to consider for any opportunity you might evaluate  I would expect Shell will return to the fundamentals of upstream exploration and refining to get those operational areas straightened out  Once they do so  they will then revisit the unconventional resource question  but probably with a heightened focus on return on investment  One final note on the big oil companies is they remain dominant in an industry which will be with us for quite a long time  In that light  Wall Street ignoring them  or even worse punishing them  might not be the wisest action  In fact  a few of the major are buying back their own shares  Hmm  what does that tell you  Regarding my own thoughts on lawyers  certainly what BP is having to deal with regarding the settlement with the Macondo Oil Spill has an affect on how I see things  It appears BP is now taking the step of either having a favorable ruling from the district court on how claims are processed  or they will opt out of the settlement  The trail lawyer profession is one where for many years  they have targeted any industry they can think of to extract massive damages  I am not saying enterprises are not responsible for industries when they make errors  and many families deserve compensation for injuries  illnesses  or even worse  loss of life of family members  What is at issue is the conduct of the trial lawyer profession in their various efforts in many different situations  One of the largest trial firms was Millberg Weiss  which was investigated for all kinds of illegal activities and eventually had to be broken up  They are not the only class action law firm which has engaged in  what I will call  questionable ethical behavior  In the situation with BP  the company agreed to a class action settlement  has payed out  20 billion of claims  and when the claims administrator was switched  all of sudden law firms and other businesses have been getting paid out on claims which BP say have no merit because a different interpretation of revenues and expenses is being applied  Can you say  bait and switch  In fact  BP says over 50  of all the claims amounts have been going to law firms  The judge in the case is an ex head of a class action lawyers law firm  Can you believe he has always sided with the class action lawyers  what a shock  Now  BP will take a different tact and we will see what happens   Full disclosure  I own BP  the firm Y H   C Investments owns BP and Shell for clients  The media space is really starting to heat up as far as possible merger and acquisition talk  If you read the  of Barron s this week  the possibilities are literally endless  The companies who could be involved are the biggest providers of content and access in the world  Google  Amazon  Comcast  Apple  Netflix  Time Warner  Time Warner Cable  Yahoo  Facebook  etc  It has been a long summer  and it is time to vacation  You know I will be watching what goes on in the investment world  but now is a time for me to recharge the battery  If you have any comments  or thoughts on the blog  or any questions  please post them  I hope you enjoy your

193869,415385,CVX,Bill Newman  Has Danger Of Nationalization Grown For Energy Companies ,opinion,Argentina s nationalist seizure of YPF s assets last year stunned markets  but loss of foreign investment compromised the nation s energy self sufficiency  Now  says Bill Newman of Mackie Research  the government is taking steps in the right direction  In this interview with The Energy Report  Newman outlines the political landscape and identifies promising plays in the region The Energy Report  How is the news that Argentina holds the fourth largest shale oil reserve in the world affecting business plans for companies that operate there  Bill Newman  The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  report that was released in June 2013 showed that Argentina has a technically recoverable shale oil resource of 27 billion barrels  so it reaffirms the large potential of Argentina  Although the shales plays are in an early stage of appraisal  we don t believe the potential of the shale is the key issue for oil and gas companies investing in Argentina  The political risk is still the chief concern  However  this year the government started to move away from its nationalist policies  so we think the political climate is slowly improving  TER  When we talked last year  Argentina had recently expropriated the assets of Yacimientos Petrol feros Fiscales  YPF NYSE   YPF  from Spain s Repsol  REP MC  without compensation  And the government temporarily froze the Argentinean assets of Chevron Corp   CVX NYSE  in response to a  19 billion   19B  judgment in Ecuador  Has the danger of nationalization of foreign owned oil and gas assets receded or increased  BN  We believe that since the nationalist events that occurred late in 2011 and in early 2012  the Argentina Government has realized that it needs foreign investment in order to achieve its energy self sufficiency goal  We believe the likelihood of additional nationalization of oil and gas assets is small  In fact  with oil and natural gas declines accelerating  we believe that commodity prices in Argentina will continue to rise and that the government could introduce new incentives to promote investment similar to Decree 929  announced on July 15  2013  TER  YPF has access to prime drilling properties in the Vaca Muerta shale formation  Is that good or bad news for foreign drilling concerns  BN  I believe YPF holds about 50  of prospective land in the Vaca Muerta shale  so if a major or supermajor company wants to establish a large position in the Vaca Muerta  it will likely have to deal with YPF  as was the case with the recently announced  1 24B Chevron join venture  Repsol has already filed a lawsuit against Chevron and this is going to be an ongoing issue until YPF and the Argentina Government compensate Repsol for its YPF shares that were expropriated  Repsol has asked for  10 5B in compensation  which is far more than what has been offered so far  However  Madalena Energy Inc   MVN TSX V  and Americas Petrogas Inc   BOE TSX V  are both in early stage discussions to farm out an interest in high working interest blocks in return of a significant carried work program  Neither of these companies have the baggage that comes with the YPF and Repsol dispute  As for the Los Moles and Agrio shales  a lot less is known about these plays  and the near term focus will be on the Vaca Muerta  but in time we expect these plays to get more attention  just like what happened in North America with the development of the Barnett shale and then the Bakken and so on  TER  What is the drilling infrastructure situation in the Neuqu n Basin  Is there infrastructure to transport product into domestic and or export markets  BN  Argentina does have a big advantage over other shale basins in that the country has good production infrastructure  So the timeline from exploration to appraisal and full scale development is much shorter  Argentina used to be a net exporter of natural gas to Brazil and Chile but now has to import about 20  of its natural gas from Bolivia at about  11 per million British thermal units   11 MMBtu  and liquified natural gas  LNG  at  17 MMBtu  The high cost of imports is hitting Argentina s foreign currency reserves  so the country is motivated to stop the production declines and eventually become an exporter again  Argentina has strict foreign currency exchange policies and this has definitely been a deterrent to investment  But Argentina realizes this is a problem  The new Decree 929 allows companies that invest over  1B over a five year period to sell 20  of the production at world prices and without paying export taxes  and the proceeds can be kept outside of Argentina  That s a step in the right direction  TER  Do you have any names in that space of firms that already have well placed land positions  BN  Madalena Energy Inc  is an oil and gas exploration and production company with an interest in three blocks in the prolific Neuqu n Basin in Argentina  and 92 800 acres in Paddle River Alberta  Oil and natural gas prices are expected to continue to rise in Argentina and we are hopeful that the government will implement additional investment incentives that could be beneficial to Madalena  The shale plays in the Neuqu n Basin of Argentina offer world class resource potential and Madalena is well positioned to capitalize on the unconventional plays  The company continues to make progress on all three of its blocks located in Argentina  Americas Petrogas Inc  is another junior international exploration company in the Neuqu n Basin in Argentina  In September 2012  Americas Petrogas and partner Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM NYSE  completed a five stage frack of the Vaca Muerta shale in the Lte x  1 well  The following December  the companies drilled and cased the ADA x 1 well on the Los Toldos II block  An independent assessment of the unconventional shale resource on its properties is expected to be released in early Q3 13  In addition  Americas Petrogas has secured two loans equivalent to US 9 4M from the Commercial Bank of China  With cash and cash flow  Americas Petrogas does not expect to issue a new equity in the short term  TER  Are vertical wells the status quo technique for accessing the petroleum reservoirs in this and similar formations  or will horizontal fracking play a increasing role in Argentina  BN  Currently  most wells targeting the shales are vertical because companies are still assessing the best methods to complete and produce the wells  In most cases the shale zone is so thick that it might be more economical to drill  frack and complete vertical wells versus drilling horizontally  but the jury is still out on that  As for the juniors operating in Argentina  the cost to develop the plays  whether using vertical or horizontal wells  will be in the billions of dollars  so most smaller companies will likely sell down to a much smaller working interest or just sell the entire block or even the company  Argentina does require foreign fracking expertise and ExxonMobil  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A NYSE  RDS B NYSE   Chevron  BP Plc  BP NYSE  BP LSE  and Total S A   TOT NYSE  are already operating in Argentina and provide that expertise  TER  As times goes by  how is government s control of the oil and gas sector likely to evolve as the shales are opened up  Will this be a gradual or a long term process  BN  We think the government of Argentina now realizes it needs to attract capital in order to reverse its production declines and return to energy self sufficiency  so we expect commodity prices will continue to increase over time and that the government will slowly introduce new incentives for oil and gas companies  It s not going to be a complete turnaround to a free market  but given the potential of the prize  we think as the political and investment climate stabilizes  investment will come back to Argentina  TER  Are there other countries and jurisdictions that you find attractive in the South American oil and gas space  BN  There is an interesting shale play developing in the Middle Magdalena Basin in Colombia  Canacol Energy Ltd   CNE TSX  has signed agreements with ConocoPhillips  COP NYSE   ExxonMobil and Shell to explore the potential of the La Luna and Tablazo shale oil plays  Colombia offers much better fiscal terms than Argentina  but because these policies have been so successful in increasing investment  the production infrastructure is nearly full and it will take some time to expand capacity  Also  Gran Tierra Energy Inc   GTE TSX  GTE NYSE  is exploring a new oil resource play in the Rec ncavo Basin in Brazil  which is at an early stage  TER  Decree 929  which you touched on earlier  provides new incentives for explorers and producers in the Vaca Muerta shale  What is the content of these incentives and how could they improve the situation for foreign and domestic companies with large stakes in Argentina  BN  Argentina s expropriation of Repsol s share in YPF in 2012 was a bit of a shock and it forced oil and gas companies to step back a bit to wait and see what the government s next move would be  But I think the government quickly realized that it couldn t fund growth internally and that it needs foreign investment to reserve its production declines  So I think the threat of additional expropriation in the oil and gas sector is remote  The new investment incentive brought in with Decree 929 somewhat confirms that the government understands that it needs foreign investment  The Decree makes it more likely that the major and super major oil and gas companies will continue to invest in Argentina and this is good news for Americas Petrogas and Madalena because both companies are in the process of farming out highly prospective block  Madalena hopes to find a partner for its Curamhuele block before year end and Americas Petrogas is looking to partner on the Loma Ranqueles block and probably the Totoral blocks  The new Decree increases the probably that this will happen  TER  Do you see the decree turning around the import export ratio in Argentina  BN  Reserves and production of both oil and natural gas in Argentina is in steep decline and Argentina is even more dependent on imports to satisfy demand  The energy deficit is depleting Argentina s foreign currency reserves  which is a problem  especially because the government has limited access to external sources of capital  It will take a large amount of capital just to reverse the production decline  and I think the government understands it can access some of this capital by providing incentives to international oil and gas companies  Again  Decree 929 was a step in the right direction  TER  Can the government be trusted not to reverse its liberalizing course once it has weathered its current set of energy problems  BN  That s a good question  Unfortunately  history has shown that this is not the case  Hopefully  Argentina will look at the turnaround that happened with Colombia over the last 10 years after the government overhauled its fiscal terms  which stimulated investment and helped production to almost double to approximately one million barrels of oil per day  TER  Are the majors looking harder at possible acquisitions in the Argentina shale plays  or are they going to play coy for a while longer  Any names there  BN  I think it s more likely that the majors will joint venture than acquire companies at this stage  But as the shale plays mature  it s likely that the smaller companies will be acquired  Madalena and Americas Petrogas have a large land base in the heart of the shale play  so they are natural targets   is vice president of international oil and gas with Mackie Research

193870,415386,CVX,Six Key Oil   Gas Discoveries ,opinion,The pace of oil and gas exploration is frightening  and discoveries are weekly  if not daily  with volumes investors would only have dreamt of a decade ago  With each new discovery  it becomes difficult to keep track of the playing field  and even more difficult to rank the potential  There are also a lot of juniors popping up on the scene now  exploring  finding and developing with the intent to lure the bigger players to buy them out  So we ll make it easy for you here  with our list of 6 key oil and gas discoveries so far this year  followed by a short list of the companies we think have the best potential and they re not necessarily the ones who have made the biggest discoveries  Last year  it was all about East and West Africa  with game changing finds in Kenya  Mozambique  Angola  Ghana and Ivory Coast that have sent explorers on a feeding frenzy looking for analog plays in the region and finding plenty  This year  so far  we like the discovery revival in the Gulf of Mexico and handful of new sub salt and pre salt plays  6 Key Discoveries of 2013  Shenandoah 2 Gulf of Mexico In mid June  Anadarko Petroleum  APC  announced a major new discovery in this deep water play  more than 500 million barrels of crude oil in the Shenandoah 2 well  This find is important  the implications are massive and this means we could be looking at a major oil rush in the Lower Tertiary trend   Anadarko shareholders should be thrilled   And it wasn t easy  or cheap   Anadarko drilled through some six miles of rock in water at a depth of 5 800 feet  The Lower Tertiary trend and its sub regions could hold up to 15 billion barrels of oil  What this discovery means is that the US oil boom is far from over  and the Gulf of Mexico Lower Tertiary trend is still surprising us  Anadarko s find solidifies a trend that began with ExxonMobil s 2010 discovery of the Hadrian field  700 million barrels   Royal Dutch Shell s discovery of the Appomattox field  500 million barrels   Chevron s discovery of the Moccasin field  200 million barrels   and BP discovery of the Mad Dog field  est  4 billion BOE   Coronado Prospect Gulf of Mexico In May  Chevron Corp  CVX  announced a new discovery at its Coronado prospect in the Gulf of Mexico  at the Walker Ridge Block 98 1 well  The well is some 190 miles off the coast of Louisiana in the Lower Tertiary sub salt trend  in water of around 6 127 feet  but it s been drilled to a depth of 31 866 feet   One of the deepest wells ever drilled and probably cost at least  250 million  though we don t know for sure   The scale of the reserves is still under appraisal for commercial viability  and Chevron currently holds a 40 percent working interest in the prospect  Other owners of the Coronado prospect are ConocoPhillips   COP   with a 35 percent stake  a subsidiary of Anadarko Petroleum Corp    APC   with a 15 percent stake  and Venari Offshore LLC with a 10 percent stake Harpoon Discovery Newfoundland In mid June  Norway s Statoil announced it was evaluating a new discovery of high quality oil off the coast of Newfoundland  about 500 kilometers northeast of St  John s  The Harpoon discovery is under some 1 100 meters of water  While we don t know the extent of the Harpoon discovery just yet  what we like is that it is only 10 kilometers from the earlier Mizzen discovery  which is estimated to hold between 100 million and 200 million barrels of oil  Statoil owns a 65  stake in Harpoon  the rest is owned by Husky   Offshore Cote d Ivoire In late April  France s Total SA announced a major discovery in the deep waters off the western coast of Cote d Ivoire  encountering 91 feet of net oil pay while drilling in Block CI 100 in about 7 400 feet of water  It was the first block Total drilled  What is significant about this discovery is not the net feet of pay  but the fact that it confirms an extension of reserves in the Tano basin  home to the giant Jubilee field in neighboring Ghana  The Jubilee field is one of the richest oil fields in Africa with potential reserves eclipsing 1 8 billion barrels  This is the second major find in Cote d Ivoire recently  last year Tullow Oil which is also exploring in Ghana  made an offshore discovery here as well  Gullfaks  North Sea In April  Statoil said it could be sitting on 40 150 million recoverable BOE in the North Sea in its Gullfaks license  where it is still working to confirm its findings  Gullfaks is in the North Sea s Shetland Group Lista Formation  The Gullfaks finds are younger  shallower deposits than its primary areas  Gullfaks has three permanent installations that have so far produced over 2 4 billion barrels of oil and over 56 billion cubic meters of gas  Statoil is the operator of the license  with a 70  interest  along with Petoro  30    The Gullfaks discovery follows two other recent massive discoveries in the North Sea  Johan Sverdrup and King Lear  Santos Basin Libra  Brazil In May  Petrobras doubled the estimate for its Libra field to 12 15 billion barrels  This makes it Brazil s largest ever discovery  Brazilian officials say it could easily produce a million barrels of oil per day once it is fully developed that s TWICE the output of OPEC member Ecuador  Production could begin in five years  with plans for up to 12 18 production vessels permanently anchored on the field  each of them pumping up to 30 000 barrels per day  For state run Petrobras  which owns the field  it means more expenditures and more debt  and it s already drowning   The answer  Petrobras is taking the show on the road  preparing to offer foreign investors up to a 30  stake in this amazing prospect   The Libra auction will take place in October  and 70  of the field will be up for grabs   WHAT S WORTH OWNING Genel Energy  LON GENL  We can t get enough of Anglo Turkish Genel  which is advancing like a hurricane in Kurdistan  discovery after discovery and amazing drilling success   and also faring nicely in Africa  Shares in the company have advanced almost 50  over the past year on success in Kurdistan  and now it s about to hit the roof as its crude oil pipeline nears completion and is slated to start pumping crude to Turkey by the end of September  There is a short window of opportunity here to get in while this is still a bit undervalued   And there are a number of undervalued stocks operating out of Kurdistan   Genel is the largest producer in Iraqi Kurdistan  and its holdings are impressive  We re talking about 7 production sharing contracts with some nice geological diversity  Its largest producing fields in Kurdistan are Taq Taq and Tawke  which have an estimated gross proven and probable reserves of 1 4 billion barrels of oil and gross proven  and probable reserves of 1 9 billion barrels  By 2014  Genel is aiming for a production capacity of 140 000 net bopd  Anadarko Petroleum  APC  Anadarko has great onshore assets in the US Gulf of Mexico and diverse offshore  deep water assets off the coasts of Algeria  Ghana  Mozambique  Brazil  China  Indonesia and New Zealand  with proven oil and gas reserves at about 2 560 million BOE as of end 2012  We re looking at liquids natural gas ratio of 46  54   For 2012  Anadarko saw a 10  increase in overall production  This year  Anadarko plans to spend some  5 5 billion developing its onshore US assets alone  and about  1 billion on its overseas plays  So we expect another nice increase in production for 2013  The company will shift its key activities a bit to account for low natural gas prices  so we ll see more focus and money spent on the Gulf of Mexico and less at the Marcellus shale  for instance  Anadarko is trading at  86 10 per share with a total market cap of more than  43 1 billion  In the second week of June  shares of Anadarko rose 3 7  on the news of a major new discovery in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico  Shenandoah 2  mentioned above   Noble Energy Inc  NYSE NBL  When you think about the Levant Basin these days  you think about Houston based Noble Energy  In late May  Noble announced a new discovery in the Mediterranean Sea  just 20 miles northeast of its Tamar field in its  after drilling to a total depth of 15 783 feet  The well encountered 184 feet of net natural gas pay  and Noble thinks it potentially holds up to 2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas  This brings its in the Levant Basin including the Tamar and Leviathan fields up to 38 trillion cubic feet of natural gas  Noble is definitely on a roll in the Levant Basin  and this latest discovery is its 7th so far in the eastern Mediterranean  Back in the US  it s more good news for Noble  In mid June  Noble confirmed that its second Gunflint appraisal well in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico had an estimated gross resource of 65 90 million bbl of oil equivalent  This means Noble s plans for a subsea tieback development at Gunflint are a green light for this year  Production is targeted for the end of 2015 at both Noble s Gunflint and Big Bend deep water discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico  Oryx  OXC  Sorry  but it s got to be Kurdistan again  but this time Oryx  a company we ve written about before but you may not have heard of  If you haven t you re missing out  About a month ago  Oryx the upstream division of  offered up 17  of its shares  16 700 000 common shares  on the Toronto Stock Exchange for C 15 per share  with gross proceeds of  250 million  The proceeds will allow Oryx to complete its exploration and appraisal plans through mid next year  and they expect some serious results over the next 12 months  Oryx is the brainchild of Swiss billionaire Jean Claude Gandur  who made his grand entrance onto the oil and gas scene in 2008 with the sale of Addax Petroleum to China s Sinopec for  7 2 billion  Since then  he s been out of the fossil fuels game so Oryx is his re entry ticket  Gandur owns 77  of Oryx through AOG  Oryx is exploring in west Africa and Iraqi Kurdistan  but it s the Kurdistan assets we really like  Gandur is an excellent diplomat who can navigate power brokers  which will make or break a junior company in this territory  Oryx isn t making any money yet  but it will  and that s why we think now is the time to get in on this  It could very easily go the way of Addax  which was making about  300 million annually in net income when it was sold to Sinopec  Gandur has dumped  700 million into Oryx  which has been busy buying up licenses and drilling wells  It s sitting quite nicely in Kurdistan right now with a 100  focus on oil and 143 billion bbls of proven oil reserves  This report is part of Oilprice com s premium publication Oil   Energy Insider  Oil   Energy Insider gives

193871,415387,CVX,Smart Fracking  Jim Letourneau On Enhanced Oil Recovery ,opinion,What s the difference between an oil well and a very expensive hole in the ground  Advanced hydraulic fracturing techniques  in many cases  That s why Big Picture Speculator Editor Jim Letourneau is following service companies that are helping producers get to the finish line on time and under budget  In this interview with The Energy Report  Letourneau discusses new ways to play the ever evolving shale revolution The Energy Report  On July 26  George Phydias Mitchell died at the age of 94  The late Texas oilman had pioneered the use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  Can you speak about his achievements  Jim Letourneau  Mitchell was the founder of the entire shale oil shale gas revolution  For decades  the Texas wildcatters had known that there was gas in the Barnett Shale  but it was very difficult to get it out  Mitchell did not invent the fracking technologies  He just wanted to get the gas out of the shale  And as the owner of an oil company  he got to challenge the technical people  He basically said   If you guys can t figure it out  I ll find someone who can   He had the power and the money and the persistence to make it work  Mitchell Energy   Development Corp  began working on the problem in 1981  and it took until 1999 to figure it all out  The company sold for  3 5 billion   3 5B  in 2001  It is inspiring  TER  Were other companies trying to develop fracking  JL  The conventional wisdom did not comprehend what George Mitchell was attempting  some folks thought he was crazy  And since some visionaries fail  we need to celebrate the ones who are successful  He grew to be very wealthy as an oilman  but he had also read the book      and he was very concerned about how civilization is managing the earth s resources  TER  The extraordinary success of fracking has brought the prices of petroleum products below the cost of production  in some cases  What kinds of adjustments are the juniors that are already producing product in the North American shale field having to make in order to turn a profit  or even to just survive intact until the next boom  JL  Because horizontal wells cost anywhere from  5 15 million   5 15M  to drill  the juniors typically need to partner with a larger company  The big companies wait for juniors with nice land positions but not much capital to get desperate  then they move in to strike a deal  The giant shale plays are not junior friendly  because small firms do not have the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to develop them  Thirty million dollars sounds like a ton of money  but it might only fund two wells  Statistically  it might be necessary to drill up to 10 wells to prove up a play  Typically  it s the majors that develop the new fields  and the juniors try to tag along by capturing acreage in a hot play  and that is often a good strategy  But they can t afford to spend big money to crack the code  They usually look for partners  Even medium sized big companies like EnCana Corp   ECA TSX  ECA NYSE  are entering into partnerships with foreign companies and looking for big investors  because the amount of money required to develop these plays is so enormous  In Northeast British Columbia  literally billions of dollars of investment will be required to fully develop the resource  If a junior s land position is compelling enough  it can get a big payday from selling it  The challenge is that there are numerous shale opportunities for major oil companies to pursue and a junior needs an asset that is big enough to move the needle  TER  For companies with producing wells  what kinds of new technologies are available to increase productivity without hurting already stressed out operating budgets  JL  There are a lot of technological tricks with minimal costs  A producer can re enter wells or stimulate wells or fracture older wells  It can enhance oil recovery with pulsed injection of water or chemicals  TER  How does that work  JL  A tool installed in the well injects fluids in pulses pumping like a heart pumps  Think of putting a kink in a garden hose  Pressure builds up and when the kink is released there is a strong pulse of water  This technology is efficient and companies can make money doing enhanced oil recovery with pulsed injection  TER  What names are on top of that technology  JL  Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc   WEE TSX V  provides pulsing tools to operations all over the world  It has a couple new business lines with fantastic growth rates  In well stimulation  a chemical  usually acid  is injected into a formation to clean up the area around the well bore so that more oil and gas can flow  By using pulsing  the acid is placed more uniformly and better flow rates are achieved after the stimulation  This part of Wavefront s business is growing very quickly and now accounts for roughly half of the company s revenue  Wavefront s pulsing technology has been modified for use in performance drilling tools  Fluid pulsing behind the drill bit and drill string agitation dramatically increases the rate of penetration  Reducing drilling time by 20 40  is an easy sell  and the enhanced oil recovery business has a huge market in the field  In another five years  these technologies will be commonplace  but it takes time since most oil companies are slow to adopt new technologies  It is going to take a few more quarters for Wavefront s revenue to ramp up  but its revenue growth is encouraging and I am quite optimistic about its prospects  TER  How is its cash position  JL  It has over  11M in cash  It is very close to being profitable  and it has more than enough money to see it through  The bottom line is that it has a market cap of about  25M and a rapidly growing business  TER  How is Wavefront s stock performing  JL  The share price is approaching all time lows  A couple of weeks ago  I bought more Wavefront shares because it is so cheap  I could be wrong  but the company has staying power  and it is not desperate for cash  so it is a good buy right now  TER  Where are the best shale oil plays located  JL  The big picture is there are lots of thermogenically mature source rocks all over the world that are amenable to horizontal drilling and fracking  Typically  these plays do better where there is existing infrastructure and expertise  like Texas  It is harder to do hydraulic fracturing in relatively new areas like Pennsylvania and New York or Europe because even though these regions have a long history of petroleum development  they currently do not have the infrastructure and the regulatory environment to manage fracking  Take the Wolfberry trend in the Wolfcamp shale  for example  It s one of the hottest Texas plays with really good results coming out  And because it is in Texas  there are not a lot of regulation related delays  TER  Do you have any names for us in these shale plays  JL  There is a small Canadian company with a foot in the Wolfberry door called Big Sky Petroleum Corp   BSP TSX V   It has drilled one well that recovered a small amount of oil  but it remains to be seen how that plays out  Right now  Big Sky does not have a lot of staying power on its own  but it does have a big land position  However  with only about  1M in cash on hand  it needs to find a partner or get bought out  That is not an uncommon situation for a small company with a big land position  Capturing the land takes expertise and an upfront investment with no immediate return  The next step is drilling wells that flow at an economic rate  Or a company can wait for other drillers nearby to come in with good wells  which can make it easier to raise money at that point  I also pay attention to Shoal Point Energy Ltd   SHP CNSX   which has big shale play acreage in Western Newfoundland  but since it did not have a lot of cash  Shoal Point partnered with another company that will earn in by drilling wells  Drilling costs a lot of money  and the first well does not always work out  Drilling can quickly turn into a giant money pit  Generally  the challenge is the continual need to raise capital  It is a grind  but every once in a while  a company taps that gusher and sells itself to a major at a big profit  It just doesn t happen all the time  It took George Mitchell 20 years to figure out what he was doing in the Texas shales  and that is too long a wait for most investors  TER  Do you have any other names  JL  There is a hot new play in California called the Monterey Shale  It is world class source rock  A little company called Zodiac Exploration Inc   ZEX TSX V  has a big land package in the San Joaquin Basin  It has farmed some of it out to partners  and it is getting results  It has about  13M in cash  TER  Are there regulatory issues in that area in California  JL  Zodiac is drilling close to Bakersfield  which is an oil and gas friendly neck of the woods  There are some big majors involved there  like Chevron Corp   CVX NYSE   And once a major gets involved in a play  it helps everybody in terms of community relations  Occidental Petroleum Corp   OXY NYSE  is also big in that area of California  TER  What kind of oil price will make shale exploration profitable  JL  At  150 barrel  we would be booming  But  seriously  even the current low prices are sustainable  There are a lot of moving targets and price is just one of them  There are the drilling and completion costs and those costs are coming down because companies are figuring out what technologies work best  The oil and gas business is slowly learning how to frack more efficiently  Oil companies cannot do much about the price of petroleum  but they can watch their costs  and that is where the focus is now  TER  You often talk about the  hype cycle   What is it  JL  When something new comes along  everybody gets excited about it  everybody wants to try it and then the technological limitations kick in  The challenge is to make that technology better and better  Hype oriented investors get in during the onslaught of the hype and then sell at the crest  Things decay as people realize   wow  this is going to take a lot of work   With the advent of hydraulic fracturing  there was a big hype cycle  Everybody wanted in on the new thing  Money was thrown at all sorts of shale plays all over the world  Some of them worked out  and some of them did not do well  But the industry is maturing and optimizing the strategies that work  It is a slow grind to make horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing economic  But the current price of product is certainly sustainable  and oil companies can make a profit if they keep costs under control  In the long run  oil production will operate like a manufacturing business  When the price goes up  there will be no shortage of ways to increase production  There is a huge runway  and that will keep the industry in balance for many decades ahead  TER  It sounds like you re an optimist  JL  I just do not see a problem in the current situation  With the new industry that George Mitchell created  we are less reliant on coal  Natural gas is a better  cleaner fuel than coal in spite of the protests and arguments to the contrary  Most people would rather have natural gas fired electricity than coal fired electricity for a variety of reasons  Low energy prices are good  It s good for the economy  When we humans run out of a resource  we usually fix the problem  One good example is the peak oil website    It recently stopped adding new content  because the peak oil argument is the same thing repeated over and over  The argument is that there is a finite amount of oil and we are going to run out of it and the consequences will be dire  But when there is a new discovery  the oil peakers have to pick it apart and say   oh  it s not that good because these wells decline quickly  or   the environmental impact of this is too great   They are continually negative about new developments that increase supply  And it s fair to be critical  Good business practices include environmental impact and looking at how resource development best serves all of society  But the big picture is that we have bought ourselves a lot of time with horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  we will not run out of hydrocarbon fuels  and we will be able to make a nice transition into cost effective alternative energy during the next 10 or 20 years  TER  Given the high costs of exploration  is there going to be a collapse of the junior sector  JL  There has already been a natural winnowing out of a lot of juniors  It used to be that a junior with a small amount of money could develop a play to the point where a bigger company would buy it out  Now the bigger companies have all kinds of options to pursue  so they re less interested in small acquisitions and they have just as many ideas as the juniors do  The challenge for a viable junior is to have a play in the top quartile  The odds are stacked against junior explorers  But if one of them ties up the right land  then there is an exciting payday for all involved  The key challenge is how to crack the code for the least amount of money  TER  How can investors determine which of the small firms has the best chance of success  JL  That is unknowable  because there are a lot of variables  The ideal situation for an investor is to hold a diverse portfolio of juniors  There definitely are attractive companies out there and they all have the same story   We have captured acreage  and there are lots of hydrocarbons in place  and we have lots of science to support that it is valuable   And sometimes they have big companies playing right beside them  too  But advancing the story to where there is a payday for the investors is a long road  I m not being negative  but realistically  it s not easy right now for the juniors  They need their plays to look shiny and pretty  They need people to get interested  And there are so many shale plays out there that it s hard to stand out  TER  Thank you

193872,415388,CVX,UPDATE 1 S Korea KOGAS to import LNG from Gorgon for 15 yrs,news,"  KOGAS to import 1 5 mln t yr LNG from Gorgon for 15 yrs
 
  Adds details 
 SEOUL  Sept 15  Reuters    South Korea s state owned KOGAS
said on Tuesday it had agreed with Chevron Corp to import 1 5
million tonnes of liquefied natural gas  LNG  per year for the
next 15 years from the Gorgon LNG project in Australia 
 The contract was the first long term import deal from
Australia by South Korea  the world s No 2 LNG buyer after
Japan 
 KOGAS  the world s biggest corporate buyer of LNG and South
Korea s sole wholesaler  said in a news release that the
contract could be extended another five years  and the two firms
were also discussing the gas import and stake sales from
Wheatstone LNG Project in Australia 
  As part of this agreement  KOGAS and Chevron plan to
proceed discussion on additional LNG imports and stake sales
from the Wheatstone Project   the KOGAS statement said 
 Chevron and its partners ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell 
each holding a 25 percent stake in the project  on Monday gave a
formal green light to building the Gorgon LNG project  the
world s biggest new development  at a lower than estimated cost
of  37 billion 
 Monday s investment decision is the starting gun on a
project that will generate huge revenues for contractors and
deliver some 8 percent of the world s LNG when it begins
production in 2014 
 Chevron said in July its Gorgon and Wheatstone projects will
position it to capture Asia s rapidly growing gas demand  which
it expects to double between now and 2030 
 The firm said it planned to ship first gas from Wheatstone 
located offshore Western Australia state  in 2016 and is
targeting a final investment decision on the project in 2011

193873,415389,CVX,UPDATE 4 Greenpeace ends protest at Shell oil sands mine,news,"  Activists leave Alberta mine  face no charges
   Oil sands mine operating at normal production
   Greenpeace disappointed by Harper Obama meeting
  Recasts  with Greenpeace ending demonstration 
 By Jeffrey Jones
 CALGARY  Alberta  Sept 16  Reuters    Greenpeace activists
who occupied mining equipment at Royal Dutch Shell Plc s
 Canadian oil sands project ended their protest on
Wednesday after 1 1 2 days and were escorted away without
facing charges  the environmental group said 
 Shell said production at the Muskeg River mine  one of four
oil sands projects in northern Alberta  operated at normal
rates throughout the day as the demonstrators worked to spread
their message that developing the oil sands hampers the fight
against global warming 
 The protest  which began with 25 activists and ended with
15  coincided with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper s
visit with U S  President Barack Obama in Washington on
Wednesday 
 Greenpeace spokesman Mike Hudema said the group was allowed
to leave the mine after leaders spoke with company officials
and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
 The Harper Obama meeting did not produce the results that
climate change activists hoped for 
  We haven t seen nearly enough concrete commitments from
the Harper Obama meeting that they will move quickly to help
the world avert catastrophic climate change   Hudema said 
 The activists entered the mine  located north of Fort
McMurray  Alberta  on Tuesday and locked down a massive dump
truck and mining shovel  The company temporarily suspended
production at the 155 000 barrel a day site  but resumed
operations late in the day 
 Hudema said there was a  cordial atmosphere  between
demonstrators and Shell staff at the mine  and both sides
stressed they had taken care to ensure the safety of everyone 
 Shell said it is working hard to improve its environmental
performance by developing a carbon capture and storage project
for its oil sands operations  and by advocating a Canadian and
international carbon cap and trade policy 
 The Muskeg River mine s other owners are Chevron Corp
 and Marathon Oil Corp   with 20 percent each  It
is one of four major oil sands mining operations near Fort
McMurray  Alberta

193877,415393,CVX,Investors Versus Traders  A Battle For Oil   Gas Profits,opinion,The worst may be over for companies and investors who have weathered the depressed gas prices of the past few years  but that doesn t mean it s clear sailing from here  In this interview with The Energy Report  Robert Cooper  senior energy analyst with Haywood Securities  talks about the need for selectivity and patience for catalysts that can crystallize underlying stock values  It s a battle of long term investors versus short term traders   The Energy Report  Looking back to your last interview with The Energy Report in November  you seem to have called the bottom in gas prices correctly  What s your view of where things are headed now   Robert Cooper  We expect a reasonably robust pricing scenario ahead  Here s why  In 2013  we will likely see flat natural gas supply growth  this will be the first year in the last several that this will be the case  The natural gas rig count is at 350  the lowest since 1995  The declining rig count has taken its toll on almost every U S  shale basin  the only basin that s growing is the Marcellus  and it is growing partly because infrastructure constraints are being alleviated  Unless productivity undergoes another massive step higher  or drilling time is cut in half again  rig count matters as a predictor of natural gas production levels  Natural gas liquids  NGL  prices are weak  and this impacts the ability of explorers and producers  E Ps  to reinvest at the same level as even a year ago  This further reduces the probability that capital will be redeployed to dry gas plays   TER  Your May 9 report shows gas storage 28  lower year over year and 5  below the five year average  What are the implications of that   RC  It means the gas market is in deficit  If I were an end user who was short gas  I d be worried the conditions are in place for a gas price rally that could catch me unaware   TER  What do you think the chances are of that happening   RC  I wrote in March that we re looking at CA 4 per thousand cubic feet  CA 4 Mcf  gas in Canada  We got to around CA 3 89 on the spot market  and the strip in the winter was very close to CA 4  If it s a normal summer  I think there s a better than 50  chance of hitting that CA 4 level in Q4 13 or Q1 14  I also said in our last interview that if you give me normal weather  I can give you CA 4 Mcf gas  which was the case   TER  How low do you think gas could go again  in the next year or so   RC  I never say  never   but I wouldn t bet on a return to last year s  1 90 price low or anything close to that  Right now  we have a favorable storage situation and we have long term beneficial factors working in the gas market bull s favor   TER  What do you see on the horizon for oil  Do you expect oil to be range bound up to  105 per barrel   105 bbl    RC  The economy isn t strong enough to support  100  bbl oil for very long  nor will supply costs support prices below  80 bbl for very long  Unless there s a big change in the economy toward much stronger or much weaker growth  that range is probably what you can look for in oil prices   TER  Storage and distribution capacities are key factors in determining North American oil prices  How are you reading those indicators   RC  In Canada  the bulk of our oil supply growth is slated to come from the oil sands  We need pipelines to transport that  But in the short term  midcontinent refineries are scheduled to complete turnarounds this summer  and that should firm up heavy oil prices relative to West Texas Intermediate  WTI   Infrastructure  or lack thereof  has certainly been a dominant theme in the Canadian oil market  certainly for the past year or so  Oil by rail has been an important bridge  as it has allowed product to move from where it s produced to where there s demand while bypassing infrastructure constraints  The development of oil by rail has been a textbook case of the invisible hand of the market at work   TER  What s your view on the Keystone Pipeline  Will it be built   RC  That s the million dollar question  President Obama is under considerable pressure from environmentalists who believe oil sands development is the main bogeyman contributing to global warming  But the U S  has had a goal of achieving energy security since Nixon  and Keystone would move the U S  a lot closer to this goal that would be an important legacy for any president  In addition  Keystone is important for the U S  Canada relationship  Rejection of the pipeline could be problematic for bilateral relations and would likely push Canada to increase its energy involvement with the U S   strategic competitors in Asia  If I had to guess  I d say Keystone will ultimately be approved  but likely with some quid pro quo that will be an attempt to pacify the president s environmentalist support base   TER  How has price action for oil and gas impacted the companies you cover   RC  The volatility has  at times  removed the incremental and marginal buyer from the equation  In particular  foreign investors have looked at Canada and said   I m just going to buy Brent exposure or pure WTI exposure and avoid all of this price differential and pipeline risk   And they have  So access to capital for Canadian producers has been limited  especially for the small  and mid cap companies  thereby limiting their strategic options  Ultimately  if this volatility continues  it will result in further culling of the investable universe   TER  So it s going to be survival of the fittest   RC  More or less  yes   TER  What companies have been your best performers over the past six months   RC  Because the market has been so bleak  the best performers have been ones we re trying not to lose money on  unfortunately  In my last interview  we talked about Crocotta Energy Inc   CTA TSX   Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd   TVE TSX V  and Novus Energy Inc   NVS TSX V   Crocotta and Tamarack are in roughly the same spot as when we last talked  Both have executed well on their business plans  and both have advanced the ball in developing new plays and properties  Each has performed quite well in a miserable market  Consequently  we still recommend both  They both have very strong management teams that are heavily invested and are motivated to do the right thing for shareholders   Novus is a little bit of a different story  The consolidation we discussed in west central Saskatchewan s Viking area was fast coming and  indeed  has accelerated as expected  Novus has decided to participate in that  In late November and early December  it announced that it was considering methods for optimizing shareholder value  including a corporate sale  That process has been ongoing  admittedly at a slower pace than anticipated  But investors will see an answer one way or another  The Board of Directors is expected to decide which direction the company will be heading  potentially as soon as the end of the month   TER  Another company you talked about is Yoho Resources Inc   YO TSX V   Can you give us an update   RC  Yes  Yoho s stock price has basically remained flat since the last time we talked  However  all of the underlying fundamentals continue to improve  Its core position is in the Duvernay play  in the Kaybob region of Alberta  The Duvernay  in our view  is fast becoming a world class shale play as it continues to mature  Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM  recently purchased Yoho s partner  Since we last talked  PetroChina Co  Ltd   PTR  bought a 50  interest in Encana s Duvernay acreage  the best part of which is proximal to Yoho  This was a multibillion dollar transaction  Yoho has continued to drill good wells that have been on cost and at expected rates  It s taken a little bit of time to gestate  but ultimately the Duvernay is going to become the domain of much larger companies  Immediately proximal to Yoho is Chevron  Exxon  Encana Corp   ECA   Talisman Energy Inc   TLM TSX  and Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A  RDS B   Yoho is a prime takeout candidate  It has a sustainable business plan with well over  1 billion   1B  of future capex to drill in the Duvernay alone  so this company could be around for a long time  But in our view  it will ultimately be purchased by a larger player  We expect Yoho will be a winner for investors who have a slightly longer time horizon than tomorrow   TER  How about some new names that you re covering that look interesting   RC  We re very big fans of a new company called Condor Petroleum Inc   CPI TSX  run by a very experienced group of managers who came out of the supermajors  Chevron Corp   CVX  in particular  The President and CEO  Don Streu  is a serious individual who managed very large projects for Chevron in Angola  Indonesia and Nigeria  Condor has taken a very different approach to exploration in Kazakhstan by gathering an immense amount of three dimensional  3D  seismic data to derisk drilling  This is something that hadn t been done there before and it has paid off  Condor recently announced a large discovery well and is appraising it as we speak   Condor represents one of the best risk reward tradeoffs we can find  Well costs are very low appropriate for a company its size  and yet the targeted prospect size is very large  So there is a whole lot of torque for shareholders  Condor has a fully funded balance sheet  It sold a noncore gas property for  88 million   88M   has an active exploration program and is pursuing joint ventures with much larger companies for its largest and most expensive prospects  The main caution is that in Kazakhstan  business proceeds at a slower pace than in North America because of the large government bureaucracy and lack of developed infrastructure  especially in the rural parts of the country where Condor operates  So this is a true investment rather than just a trade   TER  Where is the stock trading now  and where do you think it s going   RC  It s a  0 50 stock today  We have a  1 10 target on it   TER  What s the level of political risk in Kazakhstan   RC  Any place outside of North America is not going to have the same sort of risk profile as we do at home  What I can say about Kazakhstan is that there is a very large and onerous bureaucracy in place because it is a deliberate attempt to stymie corruption  Kazakhstan is rapidly growing and has broader ambitions than to just be a regional player  such as joining the World Trade Organization  It s certainly not for the faint of heart  but on the other hand  we think that the risk reward tradeoff for Condor is well in your favor right now  Condor s management team is full of individuals who have operated in the country s oil and gas sector before  which is an essential consideration  Kazakhstan has immense potential for oil and gas development and Condor knows how to operate effectively in that environment  So we recommend the stock   TER  What s your general advice at this time for investors looking for potential profits in the oil and gas sectors   RC  I d recommend that you do your homework and that when you buy  ensure you have a margin of error with respect to valuation  And have patience  because this is a very jittery market  Ultimately  good companies with good assets purchased at good prices tend to pay off over time  But if you have a very short time horizon  you might not get that opportunity to see the value creation  There is some very good value in the oil and gas sector in Canada right now  but it also takes time for catalysts to emerge to crystallize that value  That takes an investor as opposed to a pure trader   TER  Good advice  Rob  We appreciate the opportunity to talk with you again   RC  Thank you for having me   Robert Cooper  CFA  is a senior energy analyst based in Calgary with a focus on Canadian oil and gas exploration and production companies with domestic

short term  said Paul Mendelsohn  chief investment strategist
at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte  Vermont  The index
closed at 1 033 37 in the previous session 
  You may be reaching a point of exhaustion up here  but
it s too early to say whether this resistance point is real or
whether it s just a matter of time until the liquidity
overcomes this resistance  
 Mendelsohn said stocks could also face pressure if
investors become more concerned that the economy is not
improving as fast as initially anticipated

193888,415404,CVX,Total Kenya H1 pretax profit plunges 94 pct,news,"  Results reflect falling oil prices
   Local competition also hit margins

 NAIROBI  Aug 28  Reuters    Total Kenya posted a pretax
profit of 55 million Kenyan shillings   721 500  on Friday for
the first half of 2009  down sharply from 903 million a year
earlier  due mostly to last year s fall in oil prices 
 The oil company  part of French oil giant Total  said
turnover for the period had declined to 15 3 billion shillings
from 26 2 billion in the same period 
  This year s half year results reflect the effects of the
sharp decline in international crude prices towards the end of
2008   the company said in a statement 
 The firm said a drop in local pump prices due to stiff
competition in the market also adversely affected the margins at
a time when expensive stocks were still being held 
  The results of the second half will largely depend on the
stability of the international oil prices and performance of
manufacturing  tourism  and agriculture which form part of our
major markets for petroleum products   it said 
 In May  Kenya gave Total conditional approval to purchase
Chevron s Kenya unit 
 A gazette notice signed by Finance Minister Uhuru Kenyatta
said Total had to sell Chevron s LPG filling centre  a 25
percent stake in a Mombasa based lubricants blending plant  and
several service stations among other requirements   The firm has
14 months to meet the conditions

   China losses shake fragile economic confidence
  Updates to U S  markets close 
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  Aug 19  Reuters    U S  stocks rebounded and oil
closed above  72 a barrel on Wednesday after data suggested a
recovery in U S  oil demand  a surprise for investors who
earlier were fretting over a sharp slide in Chinese equities 
 A U S  government inventory report showed a huge drop in
crude supplies last week  boosting oil futures by more than  3
a barrel and lifting Wall Street sentiment that had turned dour
after a 4 3 percent a drop in the Shanghai Composite Index
 
 The drop took losses on the key Chinese index to 20 percent
over the past two weeks  a plunge hard for investors to ignore
considering China s role in any global recovery 
 Copper fell to its lowest level in just over two weeks  and
government debt prices in Europe and the United States rose as
investors sought havens in less risky assets 
 But oil reversed early losses after the U S  Energy
Information Administration  EIA  said crude stocks fell by 8 4
million barrels last week  confounding analysts  expectations
for a rise of 1 3 million barrels   EIA S 
  I think these  demand  changes are reflective of an
improving economy  but one must be cautious because these
changes are versus year ago weak numbers   said API chief
economist John Felmy 
 The decline in crude stocks was caused by rising production
in refineries but also by a sharp drop in oil imports  with
traders holding more inventories in tankers offshore as they
await higher prices   ID nN19525271 
 Still  the news lifted U S  stocks that had fallen about 1
percent earlier in the session  The S P Energy index 
gained almost 2 percent  making it the top sector performer 
Exxon Mobil  closed 2 3 percent higher while Chevron
 gained 1 8 percent 
  Oil is helping us   said Rick Meckler  president of
LibertyView Capital Management in New York   It s a big part of
the index and energy companies have helped turn this market

193901,415417,CVX,PREVIEW Oil majors seen having  ugly  second quarter,news,"By Tom Bergin
 LONDON  July 17  Reuters    The world s largest oil
companies likely had an  ugly  second quarter  with earnings hit
by a halving of oil and gas prices  sharply lower refining
margins and  worst of all for many  stubbornly high costs 
The oil and gas sector will likely report a 62 percent drop
in second quarter earnings compared to 2008  and a 27 percent
decline compared to the first quarter of 2009  analysts at
Citigroup predicted 
 The quarter on quarter decline comes despite a recovery in
crude prices to almost  60 per barrel from around  44 in the
first quarter  and reflects continued weakness in gas prices and
crude processing margins and  for many  lower production 
  Generally  if there is an area where we are going to be
disappointed  I d say it is the integrated oil companies   said
Fred Dickson  market strategist at D A  Davidson   Co in Lake
Oswego  Oregon 
 Exxon Mobil  the world s largest non government controlled
oil company by market capitalisation  is expected to report
second quarter net income of  4 75 billion  down 59 percent on
April June 2008  according to Reuters estimates 
 U S  No  2  Chevron is forecast to post a 70 percent drop in
net income to  1 82 billion 
 Europe s largest oil company  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  is
predicted to report a 70 percent fall in current cost of supply
net income  excluding one off items  with an average forecast of
 2 55 billion in a Reuters poll 
 BP Plc  Europe s No  2  was forecast to report a replacement
cost net income  excluding one offs  of  2 81 billion  a 67
percent drop on the year 
 Replacement cost and current cost of supply net income
exclude unrealised profits or losses related to changes in the
value of fuel inventories  making them comparable with net
income under U S  accounting rules 
 
 STICKY COSTS
 Soaring oil prices prompted and  for many oil industry
investors  disguised a doubling in the cost of producing oil
between 2004 and 2008 
 Now  after a collapse of crude prices from a record above
 147 last July  companies including BP and Shell are pressing
suppliers hard for discounts 
 Companies have claimed some success in this  In the first
half of the year  upstream oil and gas production costs fell 8
percent  according to a survey by industry consultants IHS CERA 
 However  many oil executives doubt their profit margin will
be boosted by significant cost cuts  Much of the drop in the IHS
CERA index is due to a collapse in steel prices  since a peak in
mid 2008  and in the cost of hiring rigs  
 However  steel prices have started to rise again in recent
months and analysts believe rig rates may be nearing a bottom 
 Meanwhile  prices for highly complex equipment  on which the
industry increasingly relies  due to the need to explore for oil
in ever more remote locations  have remained stubbornly high 
 Analysts at Morgan Stanley  who predicted an  ugly  quarter
for the sector  said that as companies report in the coming
weeks investors could be disappointed about how  sticky  costs
may be 
 However  with so much bad news forecast  any positive may
buoy investors   The sector could see something of a relief
rally if results prove no worse than expectations   Gordon Gray 
oil analyst at Collins Stewart  said

  US Treasuries dip as housing data curbs safe haven appeal
 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK  Aug 4  Reuters    Global stocks were subdued on
Tuesday and oil prices were little changed as investors turned
more cautious a day after risk appetite rose on renewed
optimism about an economic recovery 
 Wall Street  however  managed a modest gain on
better than expected data on home sales  though technology 
materials and energy shares sold off on profit taking 
 The rise in stocks pushed down the safe haven appeal of
Treasuries  sending prices of U S  government bonds lower 
 The data on pending sales of previously owned U S  homes 
based on contracts signed in June  offset news that U S 
consumers suffered their biggest drop in incomes in four and a
half year  Consumer spending  however  rose slightly more than
expected in June  pushed up by higher gasoline prices 
 The National Association of Realtors said its pending home
sales index rose 3 6 percent in June from an upwardly revised
0 8 percent gain in May 
  For those that look at housing as the catalyst from which
we have to emerge  this is going to be considered a positive

lifetime low 
  We ve had a very strong move on better than expected
earnings  especially among banks   said Philip Lawlor 
strategist at Nomura in London   It s not surprising that we ve
had some profit taking  
 Banks took the most points off the index  after a run that

percent from its March 9 low 
 The MSCI world equity index edged up 0 11 percent after
hitting its highest level in nearly 10 months on Monday  while
the MSCI index for emerging market stocks dipped 0 19 percent 
 The good news from the U S  housing sector was enough to
curb the safe haven appeal of U S  Treasuries  sending prices
of 10 year notes down 22 32  with the yield at 3 7181 percent 
 The economic optimism spurred by the housing data also cut
the safe haven bid for the U S  dollar  keeping it near 2009
lows versus the euro 
  Good news for the U S  economy is bad news for the U S 
dollar   said Andrew Wilkinson  senior market analyst at

 By Brian Gorman
 LONDON  July 10  Reuters    European shared closed lower on
Friday  notching up a fourth straight week of losses on worries
about corporate earnings and the pace of economic recovery  with
drugmakers and banks suffering most 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 1 1
percent to 814 29 points  its lowest close since April 28  Over
the week  it fell 3 4 percent  but is still up more than 26
percent from the record low it hit on March 9 
 Drugmakers were among the biggest losers  GlaxoSmithKline 
Novartis  Shire  AstraZeneca  Roche and Sanofi Aventis fell
between 1 1 and 2 4 percent 
 Next week  Novartis will be the first of the sector s major
players to report second quarter earnings 
 Pharmas initially fared better in the downturn than other
sectors but have begun to underperform  and bleak prospects of
more competition  problems getting new drugs to market and
cheaper medicines are looming on investors  radars 
 U S  consumer sentiment soured in early July  slipping to
its weakest since March  when confidence in the financial sector
and economy were at a low ebb  the Reuters University of
Michigan Surveys of Consumers showed on Friday 
 Consumers  escalating concerns about an extended economic
downturn  job security and erosion of wealth were the main
factors depressing sentiment  the survey said 
 Its preliminary index of confidence for July fell to a
reading of 64 6 from the final reading for June of 70 8 
  The Michigan number was a bit of a disappointment   said
Mike Lenhoff  chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities  in
London 
  But second quarter earnings have become more important than
ever  as the market is focused on recovery  Expectations have
been revised down so much  that earnings may end up surprising
some people on the upside

 By Ryan Vlastelica
 NEW YORK  July 10  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Friday 
with the Dow industrials and the S P 500 set for their fourth
weekly drop  after Chevron s warning about its second quarter
results prompted investors to sell some energy shares 
 Investors  mood also was soured by fresh data showing July
consumer sentiment hit its lowest level since March 
 The news underscored concerns that an economic recovery
and corporate profits in the second quarter earnings season
will be weak with little cause for optimism about results for
upcoming quarters 
 David Katz  the chief investment officer of Matrix Asset
Advisors in New York  said he didn t think many companies
would raise their outlooks in the reporting season 
  There s no incentive to step up and talk up the future 
especially because there s low visibility   he said   Our
expectation is that companies are going to do what they ve
been doing  beating expectations  but setting a low bar and
being cautious

U S  corporate profits and fading hopes for a global recovery

 By Edward Krudy
 NEW YORK  July 10  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Friday 
with the Dow industrials and the S P 500 set for their fourth
weekly drop after Chevron warned about its second  quarter
results and consumer confidence fell to it lowest level since
March 
 But the technology heavy Nasdaq outperformed the wider
market after Goldman Sachs upgraded the U S  hardware and
software sectors to  attractive  from  neutral   citing
potential growth in demand from businesses 
 Among a series of other calls  Goldman raised its price
target on the stock of Apple Inc to  160 from  145  Apple s
shares jumped 1 4 percent to  138 33 and gave the top boost to
the Nasdaq 
 The news on Chevron and the U S consumer underscored
investors  concerns that an economic recovery and corporate
profits in the second quarter earnings season may be weak 
U S  oil futures prices fell as much as 1 5 percent earlier in
the session to slide below  60 a barrel  which prompted
investors to sell some shares of energy companies 
  People are starting to question whether the economic
recovery is going to take place in the latter part of this
year or whether it s going to come next year   said Cleveland
Rueckert  market analyst at Birinyi Associates in Stamford 
Connecticut 
  I think that has been the general sentiment over the last
few weeks   he said   Some of the  economic  data points
haven t really lined up with the projected recovery this
year  
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 64 99 points  or
0 79 percent  to 8 118 18  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
fell 5 76 points  or 0 65 percent  to 876 92  The Nasdaq
Composite Index dipped 1 38 points  or 0 08 percent  to
1 751 17 
 The S P 500 s recent rally of nearly 40 percent from a
12 year closing low in early march has stalled as investors
failed to find hard evidence that the economy is recovering at
a healthy pace  The broad based index is off 7 percent since
hitting a peak on June 12 
 Weighing on investors  U S  consumer sentiment soured in
early July  slipping to its weakest since March  when
confidence in the financial sector and economy were at a low
ebb  according to Reuters University of Michigan Surveys of
Consumers 
 Energy shares were the biggest losers in the S P 500 
pressured both by a drop in crude oil prices and after Chevron

 August crude futures lost 36 cents  or 0 6 percent  to

weekly fall since January 
 Goldman Sachs  call on technology shares followed a
similar move by Banc of America Merrill Lynch earlier in the
week  when it upgraded the U S  semiconductor sector 
 Reuckert said the technology sector could be set to
advance if the market starts to reverse recent defensive moves
into areas such as healthcare and consumer staples  especially
if earnings season surprises on the upside 
  It s really the growth stocks that are going to be in
focus throughout the earnings season   he said   I would
really be looking at technology  When you think about growth
stocks  that s what pops into people s minds

 LONDON  July 13  Reuters    European share prices extended
the previous session s losses to hit an 11 week low early on
Monday  led down by oils and miners  with corporate earnings
worries forcing investors to scale back their trading positions 
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down
0 2 percent at 812 94 points by 0834 GMT after hitting an
11 week low of 805 93  The index  which has fallen in seven of
previous eight sessions  slipped 1 1 percent on Friday  notching
up a fourth straight week of losses 
 Miners were among top losers on the index  also tracking

0 3 0 6 percent 
 Xstrata was down 4 6 percent  The company said on Sunday it
remained committed to a nil premium merger with Anglo American

would offer a 5 billion pound   8 1 billion  sweetener to seal
the deal 
 Analysts said that uncertainties about the earnings season
continued  U S  oil major Chevron last week provided a downbeat
earnings outlook and investors awaited results from Goldman
Sachs and Intel on Tuesday  JP Morgan Chase on Thursday and Bank
of America on Friday 
  I don t think we will see an economic recovery this year
and     earnings estimates are still too high  so there is room
for disappointment   Philippe Gijsels  senior equity strategist
at Fortis Bank  in Brussels 
 Banks were mixed  HSBC  Barclays  Lloyds  Societe Generale
and Swedbank were down 0 1 1 8 percent  But Standard Chartered 
Royal Bank of Scotland and BNP Paribas gained 0 3 0 4 percent 
 UBS was up 1 2 percent  The U S  government and the Swiss
lender asked a federal judge on Sunday to delay the start of a
closely watched trial  as they seek to resolve their dispute

Americans suspected of using the Swiss bank to dodge taxes 
 Some energy stocks came under pressure after crude oil
prices fell more than 1 percent before paring losses  Repsol 
StatoilHydro and Royal Dutch Shell shed 0 1 0 8 percent 
  It feels like the excitement we all felt a month ago at the
sustained rally has drained away  leaving a bitter taste in the
mouth   said Owen Ireland  an analyst at ODL Securities 
  Should the markets have simply flattened out it would not
feel so uncomfortable  as we could quite imagine a mid July
resurgence  Instead  markets have been riddled with weakness 
and sentiment will surely have to change dramatically if we are
to see things improve

 NEW YORK  July 10  Reuters    The dollar and yen rose
against other major currencies on Friday with investors
cautious as the U S  corporate earnings season began and
benchmark stock indexes fell 
 A report showing that U S  consumer sentiment soured in
July further bolstered the two currencies  which strengthen
when investors become averse to risk due to pessimism about the
prospects for a global recovery 
 The yen hit a five month high against the U S  dollar this
week and surged to two month highs against the euro and
Australian dollar as investors unwound bets in riskier assets
that they had made using the low yielding Japanese currency 
 The yen lost some of those gains on Thursday but then held
its ground as other currencies lost momentum after U S  stocks
fell  A profit warning from Chevron added to the specter of a
weaker than expected second half economic recovery 
  It underlines the ongoing gloom facing the U S  consumer
and further delays prospects for a near term recovery   said
Brian Dolan  senior currency strategist at Forex com 
Bedminster  New Jersey of the most recent U S  data   That will
weigh heavily on risk sentiment  pushing stocks and yen crosses
down and boosting the dollar  
 Midway through the New York session  the euro was 0 8
percent lower at  1 3920  The euro was down 1 4 percent against
the yen at 128 53 yen 
 The U S  dollar index  which tracks performance against a
basket of six major currencies  was up 0 6 percent at 80 385 
 The dollar was down 0 7 percent at 92 33 yen  going as low
as 91 80 during the New York morning  according to Reuters
data  That was just above the five month low 
 The yen gained in particular this week as the U S  dollar
status as a reserve currency came under scrutiny at the G8
meeting in Italy  although reaction was muted to calls from
China for a review of the reserve currency system at a meeting
of world leaders on Thursday 
 Support from softer equities  and some worries over the
potential for near term economic recovery  both of which have
helped the dollar index push back towards its opening level for
this week   said Sacha Tihanyi  currency strategist at Scotia
Capital in Toronto in a note to clients 
 SWISS FRANC EYED
 The Swiss franc fell after Swiss central bank chief
Jean Pierre Roth said in an interview published on Friday the
Swiss National Bank was sticking  decidedly  to its policy to
prevent a strengthening of the Swiss franc 
 The dollar gained 0 8 percent on the day to 1 0867 Swiss
francs while the euro rose 0 2 percent to 1 5126 francs 
 Sterling fell 1 percent on the day to  1 6180 
relinquishing gains made on Thursday in part after the Bank of
England surprised markets by not using the remaining 25 billion
pounds available under the current asset buying program 
 In other news  the European Central Bank and euro zone
national central banks bought 23 million euros  worth of
covered bonds under the 60 billion euro programme launched this
week  the ECB said on Friday 
 The program is aimed at boosting lending to stimulate the
ailing economy 
The central bank has said it will review the program in
August when it releases new quarterly forecasts

   U S  consumer sentiment softens
 By David Brett
 LONDON  July 10  Reuters    UK blue chip stocks ended a
fourth consecutive week in negative territory on Friday as U S 
data heaped more gloom on the global economic outlook  with
energy stocks weighing most on Britain s top share index 
 The FTSE 100 closed down 31 49 points  or 0 8 percent  at
4 127 17  for a weekly loss of 2 3 percent  its lowest closing
level since April 28 
  The fundamentals haven t been all that encouraging today   
the U S  trade balance has contracted further showing waning
demand domestically   said Giles Lee  senior dealer at CMC
Markets 
 The U S  trade gap narrowed unexpectedly to  26 billion in
May to the lowest reading since November 1999 as exports rose in
spite of weak global demand and imports shrank 
  The Michigan consumer confidence reading has plummeted
whilst falling output prices in the UK are painting a bleak
picture for domestic inflation in the months ahead  
 The Reuters University of Michigan preliminary July consumer
sentiment survey posted at 64 6 from 70 8 in June  
 Energy stocks slid as oil prices kept below  60 per barrel 
on track for its largest weekly fall since January 
 BP  Royal Dutch Shell  BG Group  Tullow Oil and Cairn Energy
 fell between 0 8 and 1 5 percent 
 The latest report from the International Energy Agency
predicted an increase in oil consumption in 2010  but expected
it to stay negative in 2009 and saw limited demand for OPEC
crude 
 Chevron s warning about second quarter results also weighed
on the sector  with U S  stocks dropping on jitters that an
economic recovery and corporate profits will be anaemic 
 Traders said earnings from U S  and European companies over
the next few weeks would be critically important in determining
market direction 
 
 INSURERS  DRUGMAKERS HIT
 Aviva was the index top faller  off 4 9 percent on lingering
speculation that the life insurer is going to cut its dividend 

 The uncertainty spread to other life insurers as Standard
Life  Prudential  Legal and General and Old Mutual dropped
between 2 7 and 3 2 percent 
 Drugmakers also took a beating  with AstraZeneca 
GlaxoSmithkline and Shire down between 1 1 and 1 5 percent 
 Miners were dealt a blow by weak metal prices  with Rio
Tinto  Kazakhmys  Eurasian Natural Resources  Lonmin and BHP
Billiton falling between 1 4 and 3 3 percent 
 Rio Tinto was the second sharpest blue chip faller  dogged
by the detention of four employees by Chinese authorities for
leaking China s  bottom line  in iron ore price negotiations 
according to a source with knowledge of the probe 
 Retailers were broadly higher  with traders citing the low
interest rate environment and positive broker commentary from
the previous session as supportive

193923,415439,CVX,Robert Cooper  Oil And Gas Volatility Creates Winners And Losers ,opinion,Price movements  distribution problems  drilling rig availability and regulatory factors have all come into play this year  providing both challenges and opportunities for junior companies  according to Robert Cooper  senior oil and gas analyst at Haywood Securities  But change has been good for some of the companies he follows  and in this interview with The Energy Report  he shares some names that are still sitting pretty  The Energy Report  It s been about one year since we last spoke  Robert  What do you think have been the most significant developments in the North American oil and gas industry since then  Robert Cooper  It s a dynamic business  and a number of changes have occurred  First  the macroeconomic backdrop remains murky  resulting in persistent volatility in equity and commodity markets  Investors remain wary of putting on riskier trades because the visibility simply isn t there  The fear that some Monday morning we ll wake up with a negative surprise is inhibiting risk taking and impacting small cap growth equities  particularly  Second  the rapid increase in U S  oil production has negatively impacted Canadian producer net backs  The spread between Canadian light oil prices and the U S  equivalent has been much more volatile than historical rates  The lack of pipeline capacity has exacerbated this trend and given rise to alternative methods of transportation  such as oil by rail  But overall  the  differential risk  has been added to the list of risk factors investors assume when investing in the oil and gas sector  Finally  the natural gas market  after a period of massive oversupply  has  in our view  self corrected and appears to have returned to balance  TER  In terms of pipeline capacity and building potentially new pipelines and better distribution  do you have any further thoughts on where you think that might be headed at this point or is it all regulatory  RC  There is a juicy arbitrage between waterborne markets and domestic markets  There are a lot of smart companies and individuals looking at ways to solve that  but in the end  these things sometimes have political masters who need to be appeased  The current president has indicated he s not amenable to it  We ll see what happens  TER  In your last   you were seeing a potential downside in oil prices in the  60 70 range  if the economy took a turn for the worse  Things now seem to be slowly improving in North America  Oil has been up and down  but it s still kind of weak  Some analysts are thinking we could still see lower prices  What s your thinking  RC  Higher or at least stable prices are primarily a function of the global economy continuing to muddle through with positive  but not thrilling  economic growth  We ve seen a lot of competing evidence on this  but on the whole  the global economy is doing just that  Conversely  I am still of the view that global shocks  such as sovereign default or a hard landing in China  would likely deflate the oil market  We saw the impact of economic concerns in Q2 12  when crude tumbled from over  100 per barrel  bbl  to about  76 bbl at the end of June  That downside risk remains  That s not our base case forecast  but we re certainly cognizant of the potential for black swan events that can really deflate the equity and commodity markets  TER  Is the new trading range somewhere between  80 90 bbl  or is this just a temporary setback  RC  The oil market is highly volatile  so you could probably make a case for somewhere between  75 100 bbl  The longer it s at  75 bbl  the more likely it is to move higher  Alternatively  if it hovers in the  100 bbl range  the more likely it is to move lower  The sweet spot is somewhere in between  and that s what we ve seen on the whole in the last several quarters  TER  Natural gas is a different story  We ve bottomed out already  Where is it headed from here  RC  The gas market is very similar today to what it was a year ago  and yet different in a number of respects  Last year  the market knew that production from shale gas reservoirs  particularly in the U S   was rapidly increasing  and had taken the step change down to the  4 per thousand cubic feet  Mcf  range as a result  But the winter was one of the warmest on record  Consequently  gas collapsed along with demand  The difference between this year s storage overhang in April versus normal was basically equal to the lost heating demand over the winter  In other words  we can retrospectively demonstrate that the market was balanced a year ago  Between October of last year and April of this year  it went from balanced to well oversupplied  What changed in the summer was what we refer to as the power burn rally  in that utilities switched from coal to gas en masse  In the span of three or four months  that phenomenon has returned the market to essentially the same place it was this time last year  In fact  prices are approximately equal to last year  as are storage levels  The difference now  however  is that there are other positive factors at work  One  the number of gas directed drilling rigs have fallen from the 800s into the low 400s  Second  producers have pivoted to liquids rich gas and or oil  Natural gas liquids  NGL  prices have declined precipitously year over year  YOY   The average weighted NGL barrel as a percentage of crude oil is down 25  YOY  This change still results in economic  liquids rich gas projects  but it reduces the cash flow associated with them  With lower cash flow comes lower reinvestment and less drilling  and then you should see a further cannibalization of the gas rig count  Finally  gas supply has stopped increasing  After several years of higher production  it looks like exit 2011 to average 2012 production is basically flat  All of those  in aggregate  are good signs  TER  What happens if we have another warmer than normal winter  RC  My view now is that the gas market is balanced  Whether or not it goes higher or lower in the near term is largely a function of winter weather  You give me normal weather  and I can probably give you  4 Mcf gas  If you don t  then it s history repeating  TER  Have the prices over the last six months to a year had any significant impact on the way that oil and gas companies are planning their future operations  based on what s visible to them at this point  RC  Speaking about Canada  the small  and mid cap Canadian producers have embraced hedging to a greater degree than I can recall  Generally speaking  pre 2008  the prevailing view of exploration and production  E P  managers was that companies existed to provide investors beta to commodity prices  In other words  they were unhedged  Since then  we ve noticed a distinct trend toward risk management  which means greater and more consistent hedging among the producers  This has been driven by a number of factors  including more challenging equity markets in which raising capital is much more difficult  It s a function of highly volatile commodity prices and  on average  larger capital budgets that require some certainty in the cash flow  E Ps have attempted to take some risk out of the business plan by providing a degree of cash flow certainty via hedging  Second  E Ps have become much more focused on cost control  One manifestation of this is that  in Canada  a number of producers have made conscious decisions to avoid drilling during peak seasons  The goal is to utilize the best rigs and services at off peak times  A number of them have had success  which has made a positive impact on capital costs and returns  The downside is that drilling in Canada remains seasonal  and spring breakup remains an impediment for many companies  But  overall  I think the theme is toward risk management  simply because the equity markets of late have been rather unforgiving of mistakes  TER  Everybody has to adapt to changes  and it s a fluid market  You joined Haywood Securities since we last spoke  Has that had any impact on the way you approach your investment selections and general analysis  RC  No  Nothing has changed in how I evaluate equities  although I ve added an international dimension to my coverage universe  TER  Maybe you can bring us up to date on developments with some of the companies we talked about last year and how they look now  RC  Let s start off with Open Range Energy Corp   ONR TSX   Open Range was a huge win  We said then that once the E P was split  the tank business had a significant growth runway and that the company was likely to get acquired  We got both of those right  The tank business is now called Poseidon Concepts Corp   PSN TSX   It s taken off  paying a dividend and trading at about  15 share  Growth in the U S  has accelerated  We were predicting at that time   130 million   130M  in 2012 earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   Management guidance for 2012 is now  210M in EBITDA  The E P spinout was acquired by top tier producer Peyto Exploration   Development Corp   PEY TSX   Crocotta Energy Inc   CTA TSX  was another one  It has performed as I expected  We said then that there was  4 share upside  and it got there in January  It has since pulled back some  but the business is further advanced now at a lower stock price than it was then  Crocotta has proven its Edson liquids rich gas asset and has added an emerging Cardium oil play as well  With gas strip prices as they are now  we re likely to see further development in the Montney play in northeast British Columbia  All the while  Crocotta management has maintained a sterling balance sheet  so we like this story a lot  Right now  it s about  3 20  In October of last year  it was around  2 60  Yoho Resources Inc   YO TSX V  is the final one  I said last year that I liked Yoho because it had the most resource exposure of any junior company I knew of combined in the Duvernay and the Montney  That is still the case  and it remains one of my favorite stories  What s changed is that Yoho has drilled some Duvernay shale wells  The development of any shale basin tends toward lower productivity and higher well costs at the outset  and as the plays mature  production increases and costs decrease  Yoho is following that in the Duvernay  What s most interesting is that Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM  recently paid  2 6 billion for Yoho s partner in the Duvernay  Celtic Exploration Ltd   CLT TSX   This shows you that the Duvernay is the real deal  and that large companies want exposure here  The thesis remains the same on Yoho as it was 13 months ago  TER  Do you expect it to be taken out  at some point  RC  If you look at where Yoho is and its Duvernay acreage  it is surrounded by the majors Chevron Corp   CVX   Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A NYSE  RDS B NYSE   Exxon  Talisman Energy Inc   TLM TSX   Encana Corp   ECA TSX  ECA NYSE  and Husky Energy Inc   HSE TSX   And then there s Yoho  So chances are Yoho will not be around in 12 18 months  That would be my guess  It s been our Top Pick this year on the basis that resource exposure is an investable theme among the juniors  And we still feel that way today  TER  Do you have any new names that you d like to talk about at this point that look interesting  RC  I do  One is called Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd   TVE TSX V   Tamarack has emerged as a very well run junior light oil producer  The company is active in Alberta s Cardium light oil trend as well as Alberta s Viking light oil trend  It produces about 2 550 barrels of oil equivalent per day  boe d  currently  The company is led by the former CEO of Apache Canada  APA NYSE   We like the company for a number of reasons  First  Tamarack has a number of oil projects that have payouts in about a year  This is an attractive attribute because it means that the company is able to self fund under reasonable commodity price assumptions  Second  Tamarack has demonstrated that it has been able to reduce costs and increase productivity in both the Viking and Cardium formations  Obviously  decreased costs and increased productivity drop right down to the bottom line in improved economics  Third  we really like management  They work hard  They take a risk managed approach to their business  and they tend to meet or exceed expectations  Finally  we like the risk reward profile of attractive valuation coupled with a number of near term drilling catalysts  TER  That s certainly one to keep an eye on  How about any others that look interesting  RC  The second company is called Novus Energy Inc   NVS TSX V   Novus is also a Viking producer but in west central Saskatchewan  We like the Viking generally  for a number of reasons  especially for a junior producer  The Viking in west central Saskatchewan is well defined geologically  It s low risk  low capital cost and repeatable  The key to success is having scale  because the initial well productivity is lower than some of the deeper  tight oil plays in Alberta  Novus has the dominant land package in the area and is growing production  It is guiding to 4 400 boe d at year end  We have written that we think Novus  asset base could ultimately support a dividend  Based on the comparables  this should result in some value creation  Alternatively  it s our view that the west central Dodsland area is going to be the domain of larger producers  and that consolidation is likely  In either scenario  we see Novus benefiting  TER  Could Tamarack and Novus get taken out  RC  I think Tamarack is earlier in its life cycle than Novus is  Larger companies need scale and scope and a number of them have indicated that west central Saskatchewan is going to be a focus for them  If you want scale and scope in west central Saskatchewan  you pretty much have to go through Novus  TER  So it s pretty well situated there as far as its land position  RC  Yes  it is  TER  Generally speaking  what do you think the focus should be for our readers and people interested in playing the energy markets in North America at this time  RC  I think volatility creates winners and losers  The winners tend to be experienced managers with proven track records  In times of stress  proven managers tend to retain their multiples relative to their peers and are able to raise capital  if required  This enables them to grow  either organically or through mergers and acquisitions  And in the worst of times  they survive  When the rising tide isn t lifting all boats  investors should gravitate toward the best in class  TER  That s a good closing thought  Thank you  Robert  RC  I said this last time  and I ll say it

 By Simon Falush
 LONDON  July 10  Reuters    More gloom on prospects for the
global economy sparked by weak U S  corporate results depressed
commodity prices  knocking energy stocks and dragging Britain s
top share index to a 10 week low by midday on Friday 
 By 1028 GMT the FTSE 100  was down 24 00 points at
4 134 66 after it closed 18 43 points higher on Thursday at
4 158 66  The index is on track for its lowest close since late
April  down 2 4 percent this week  set for its fourth
consecutive week in negative territory 
 Energy stocks took the most points off the index as oil
prices slid below  60 per barrel  on track for its largest
weekly fall since January  as the demand outlook soured
and on fears of new rules to curb futures speculation 
 BP   Royal Dutch Shell   BG Group  
Tullow Oil  and Cairn Energy  fell between 0 5 and
1 1 percent 
  The oil price has come off in the last few weeks and that
has chilled the mood for commodities   said Lars Kreckel  equity
strategist at Exane BNP Paribas 
 A downbeat earnings outlook from U S  oil major Chevron Corp
 also dented sentiment on the sector and the wider
economy 
 Kreckel said earnings from U S  and European companies over
the next few weeks would be critical for giving the market
direction 
  In general I would expect them to meet or beat analyst
expectations but it will be difficult to meet investor
expectations   he said  adding that he expects defensive stocks
and cyclical laggards to outperform

193932,415448,CVX,Best And Worst ETFs  And Mutual Funds   Energy Sector,opinion,The Energy sector ranks fifth out of the ten sectors detailed in my sector rankings for ETFs and mutual funds  It gets my Neutral rating  which is based on aggregation of ratings of 20 ETFs and 79 mutual funds in the Energy sector as of October 10  2012  Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the sector  Not all Energy sector ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 23 to 173   which creates drastically different investment implications and ratings  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst ETFs and mutual funds  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks  To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the Energy sector  investors need a predictive rating based on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings  Investors should not buy any Energy ETFs or mutual funds because none get an Attractive or better rating  If you must have exposure to this sector  you should buy a basket of Attractive or better rated stocks and avoid paying undeserved fund fees  Active management has a long history of not paying off  Figure 1  ETFs with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5   Best ETFs exclude ETFs with TNA s less than 100 million for inadequate liquidity Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsPowerShares Dynamic Energy E P  PXE  is excluded from Figure 1 because its total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million and do not meet our liquidity standards Figure 2  Mutual Funds with the Best   Worst

Funds  Invesco Energy Fund  IENIX  is my top rated Energy mutual fund  Both earn my Neutral rating Direxion Daily Natural Gas Related Bull 3x Shares  GASL  is my worst rated Energy ETF and Saratoga Advantage Trust  Energy and Basic Materials Portfolio  SBMBX  is my worst rated Energy mutual fund  Both earn my Very Dangerous rating Figure 3 shows that 58 out of the 286 stocks  over 42  of the total net assets  held by Energy ETFs and mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating  However  no Energy ETFs or Energy mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating The takeaways are  mutual fund managers allocate too much capital to low quality stocks and Energy ETFs hold poor quality stocks Figure 3  Energy Sector Landscape For ETFs  Mutual Funds   StocksSources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings As detailed in     the fund industry offers many cheap funds but very few funds with high quality stocks  or with what I call good portfolio management  Investors need to tread carefully when considering Energy ETFs and mutual funds  as no ETFs or Energy mutual funds in the Energy sector allocate enough value to Attractive or better rated stocks to earn an Attractive rating  Focus on individual stocks instead  Chevron Corporation  CVX  is one of my favorite stocks held by Energy ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Attractive rating  CVX currently trades at a steep discount to its no growth value  its price to economic book value is  60  which implies that the market believes CVX s profitability will permanently decline by 40   Over the past ten years  CVX s invested capital has grown 131   At the same time  CVX s NOPAT has grown 397   Growth in operating profits  NOPAT  coupled with asset efficiency creates value for equity holders  Rather than investing in an energy fund where only a portion of the investment will go towards Attractive stocks like CVX  investors should focus on allocating to the specific stocks that earn an Attractive or better rating  Range Resources Corp  RRC  is one of my least favorite stocks held by Energy ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Dangerous rating  RRC s ROIC of 3 5  places it in the bottom third of the 3000  companies we cover  This relatively low ROIC means RRC has had a negative economic earnings margin twelve out of the past fourteen years  To justify RRC s current stock price  RRC must grow its NOPAT 20  compounded annually for the next 25 years  These high market expectations along with low real earnings power make RRC a Dangerous stock  170 stocks of the 3000  I cover are classified as Energy stocks  but due to style drift  Energy ETFs and mutual funds hold 286 stocks  Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all Energy ETFs and mutual funds  Figure 4  Separating the Best ETFs From the

193935,415451,CVX,High Gasoline Prices And Politics Are A Volatile Mix,opinion,Nothing infuriates Americans more than volatile  spiking gasoline prices  Often the causes given for gasoline price hikes seem contrived  Iran and Israel trade harsh words in press reports and before the ink is even dry of the page oil prices tick up  Word of a fire at an oil refinery is enough to send prices shooting up as high as the flames on the cracker  and just as fast   Those price spikes never seem to come down nearly as fast as they shoot up  Politicians are quick to blame oil companies for gouging customers  speculators for manipulating markets  traders for withholding supply   The truth about gasoline price volatility is both a little more complicated and yet quite simple  The factors that seem to have the most impact on gasoline prices include  Global Oil Swing Productive Capacity  While the world has plenty of oil overall  prices are set by the amount of excess capacity at the daily margins  That is how much oil is left over when all the contracts for delivery are met  How much oil is available if something goes wrong  If some refinery shuts down  If some pipeline bursts  If some war breaks out  This marginal oil quantity has traditionally been controlled by Saudi Arabia s ability to ratchet up or ratchet down the amount of oil pumped each day  This control over swing productive capacity is what gives OPEC its market power and drives the rest of us crazy The Refinery Business Model  The oil refining business is a hard way to make a living  These plants are enormously complicated  They require skilled precision to keep them operating at optimal performance and many things can and do go wrong  Yet it is almost impossible to build new refineries in the US today because of the environmental regulation  high capital costs and the NIMBY pressures in every potential location  We live close the edge of full refining capacity  yet refining margins are very thin because the costs of operation are so high Boutique Fuels Mandates Create Monopoly Markets  A recent fire at the Chevron refinery near my home in the San Francisco Bay area adversely affected the supply of the blends of gasoline used in many of the Western States  A pipeline rupture in the Midwest reduced the supply of oil to refineries serving Chicago  While do these incidents have such a major impact on gasoline supply and price  Because the environment restrictions on fuels has created a system of boutique fuel blends that are virtual monopolies in many markets  The gasoline produced in the Richmond Chevron refinery is specifically designed for the Western market and no other gasoline products can be shipped in from other states to make up for a supply shortfall when a fire or other supply chain problem happens  So having reasonable gasoline prices requires that virtually EVERYTHING must work perfectly in the gasoline production supply chain or else It does not have to be this way  but Congress passes laws without the slightest regard to how they will be implemented or enforced in practice  Congress takes credit for Clean Air but allows bureaucrats to impose regulations that have costs or impacts far beyond what the law intended  This happens because our environmental laws are written to ignore the cost while taking credit for the benefits  Our laws allow Federal agencies to set their own standards for measuring benefits  They are not subject to any burden of proof  The laws allow comment periods on rulemaking proposals but the bureaucrats do not have to accept the comments  The system is one sided and so are the costs   A more balanced and reasonable approach to environmental regulation would require Congress to approve major rule makings by a Federal agency so it cannot avoid the accountability for imposing the costs  Existing regulations should be subject to sunset provisions and forced to be reconsidered regularly to reflect changes in technology and other factors  New laws requiring regulations should not go into effect until the final rules to implement the law are approved by Congress  Just as environmental advocates can sue in Federal Court to enforce environmental laws  those subjected to them should be able to sue over the reasonableness of the impacts of the law and rules to force the government to own its burden of proving that the benefits outweigh the costs and do not constitute an unreasonable taking of private property for which just compensation is required   These changes in our regulatory regime won t get more refineries built  but they would inject some common sense into the regulatory process and force the Federal agencies that dream up all these rules that the benefits are worth the cost and the practical application of proposed rules is reasonable and in the public interest ,2012-08-22,Gary Hunt,https://www.investing.com/analysis/high-gasoline-prices-and-politics-are-a-volatile-mix-133783,133783

193937,415453,CVX,Between An Argentine Shale Rock And Hard Place,opinion,You must admit there is a certain irony in reports out of Argentina by none other than the newly named CEO of YPF   NYSE YPF  Miguel Galuccio  that his company has found a significant shale deposit waiting to be developed and if he can do so  it will make Argentina a significant exporter of oil and natural gas What s the irony YPF is the company that Argentina recently seized from Spain s Grupo Repsol and nationalized  The action created a huge international dispute and Repsol s demand for payment of  10 5 billion for confiscating its assets three months ago SOURCE  USGS Argentina shale gas reserves exceed its 13 4 trillion cubic feet  tcf  conventional proven gas reserves  The largest shale play is the Neuquen basin with more than 250 TCF  YPF discovered 4 5 TCF of shale gas in the Loma de la Lata Field of Neuquen in December 2010 Gas transportation and field services infrastructure are already in place making it attractive for further development  There are also additional Argentine shale deposit reserves in Chubut and Santa Cruz provinces near the Golfo San Jorge in the Atlantic southeast part of the country  The  says Argentina s technically recoverable shale gas reserves are the third largest in the world after the United States and China at 774 trillion cubic feet  Tcf  with more than half of that in the Neuqu n Basin on the western side of the country  Mr  Galuccio used his  to dangle the prospect of opportunities for 50 50 partnerships with YPF for investors in the projects  He said foreign oil companies partnering with YPF could reasonably expect a 15 percent to 20 percent return on their investments  The YPF CEO said he wanted to invest  37 2 billion through the end of 2017 to begin development of the shale resources and wanted an initial tranche of  4 6 billion of that total amount to come from outside investors  Three fourths of the capital would be used for production and the remaining capital would be used to improving refinery capacity and 4 percent for new exploration  The numbers reveal the Argentine dilemma finding shale resources is a long way from developing them and bringing them to market  And that is the rock and hard place Argentina faces  To exploit its shale potential Argentina needs the active participation and assistance from large international oil field services companies and deep pocket investors  After Argentina s economic crisis it put price controls on energy which scared away investors and developers  It new plan has begun to turn that around and make it more likely that E P can be profitable again  But its habit of regulatory overreach and confiscating investors  property are still significant problems  Argentina s shale resource potential is large enough to attract the biggest companies  But in the rapidly changing world of global shale development there are many places where investors can participate in the growth of shales without the risk Argentina presents Today  the United States is actually one of the most attractive markets in the world for shale because more than 96  of the development is taking place on private lands beyond the reach of Federal regulators  Investors have opportunities not only to buy positions in shale E P developments but also gain access to the technology  skills and expertise needed to develop other shale resources around the world  China is expected to be one of the largest investors in US shale development eager to scale its capabilities and then use them to develop China s own enormous shale resource potential  This should be sobering news to the Argentine Government  There are plenty of big international oil and gas companies working in Argentina including ExxonMobil  Chevron  Apache Total and Halliburton but the trade press suggests that Argentina will first have to settle its dispute with Grupo Repsol and pays up for its confiscatory ways  The fierce global competition for energy is attracting capital to the best opportunities  Argentina will not be able to dictate terms for its shale development in isolation so the right balance of price and terms will be required to make it attractive enough from among the options to warrant the risk  Beyond that the risk premium Argentina can expect to pay to play in the shale game will almost certainly eat into its margins or delay its development ,2012-09-13,Gary Hunt,https://www.investing.com/analysis/between-an-argentine-shale-rock-and-hard-place-136296,136296
193938,415454,CVX,Oil s New Floor Price   75 ,opinion,Oil analysts  pundits and commentators are getting a hold on the rising threat of what is called  severe correction  hitting oil markets  The 2008 2009 sequence where Nymex prices crashed from a peak around  147 a barrel to about  40 is relatively fresh in the mind  The rebound was also dramatic  pushing prices through 2010 back over the 100 dollar mark into low triple digits by Q1 2011   The present outlook certainly includes the potential for gung ho traders working another downside then upside miracle  but fundamentals dictate otherwise  The basics of world oil have changed  even in the 4 years since 2008  neither further price growth beyond  125 a barrel for WTI  nor a crash below about  60 to  75 a barrel for WTI are realistically possible   although traders do not need  or want  to know that  Prices far below  100 a barrel for the two major reference grades  WTI and Brent  are however the new rational  market equilibrium  outlook  meaning several things   NEW REALITIES FOR NEW ENERGY Back in 2008 the global economy was at the end of maybe its last classic growth surge  which operated through 2004 2007 and was weakening fast by 2008  when  financial expectations  and market rigging were able to briefly drive Nymex  ICE and other oil market prices near  150 a barrel  The surge was so special there was almost no spread or prime on Brent against WTI and heavily compressedremiums on less traded  regional reference  crudes such as Urals  Bonny  Dubai  Tapis  ESPO or others   Also during the 2004 2007 global economy growth surge  it was still possible to have annual growth rates of world oil demand near 2 percent  another rearview mirror item in global energy history  Betting on if  rather than when world oil demand can again rise by even one half of that Belle Epoque rate  that is 1 percent or about 890 000 barrels per day in a 12 month period  is integrated in oil market trading as a background bet  still today   Despite that  both the IEA and EIA  since 2008  have on multiple occasions been forced to backtrack on their growth forecasts  always trimming their estimates of global oil demand growth going forward  In the case of the IEA  recent and ongoing oil market analysis and forecasts still include claims that  by about 2017  global oil demand could recover Belle Epoque annual increments  that is growth of well above 1 25 million b d each year  Even with accelerated output of shale oil and natural gas liquids  and gas based synthetic oil  and biofuels  and oil saving the two energy agencies still say  global oil shortage could or would return with prices forecast or guesstimated by the IEA of  well above  150 per barrel   even  200 a barrel   It is not presently possible to say when the IEA and EIA will throw in the towel on  high growth high price  scenario building  but the facts and trends are stacked against them  What we can say is that another oil price surge to near  150 per barrel would  more than ever  trigger oil saving and substitution which is already in high gear   but first we would have to accept it is even possible to attain  150  The current outlook  and increasingly the betting by traders is no   Conversely and poorly analyzed and identified  the  new floor price  for oil is a lot higher than in 2008 2009  Another price crash to  40 per barrel would have fast and drastic impacts on world oil  world energy and the economy   all of them negative  The drastic cut in oil E P  exploration and production spending  through 2008 2009  only reversing in 2010  estimated by analysts at around 40  45   could easily be topped when or if oil prices fall below  60 per barrel  let alone  75  Any sustained period of oil prices at below  50 per barrel will be disastrous for Big Energy  triggering showdown time for their corporate strategies and identities in the energy world   WHY THE NEW PRICE FLOOR  One simple reason is that if oil E P declines from its current high rates  probably above  350 billion per year   even maintaining current global oil output will be difficult  taking Exxon Mobil  XOM   its current E P budget for oil is around  36 billion per year  for 2012   with the corporate goal of raising Exxon Mobil s total oil production capacity by about 1 million b d by 2016  When or if Exxon takes its foot off the spending pedal  or shelves the program aimed at covering annual depletion loss of capacity and also expanding total oil output   by 1 million b d in 4 years   this major oil producer could only produce less oil  The same story applies to almost any other major oil   gas corporation  even including the NOCs of OPEC and non OPEC states  for a variety of reasons which feature the extreme high costs  and therefore risks of expanding total oil output  for a global oil market that is going south   Right behind those reasons and especially for the  historic oil majors   including Exxon  Chevron  CVX   BP  Shell  RDS A   Total  TOT   Enersis  ENI    the rush to develop and produce shale gas and stranded gas   in unexpectedly huge quantities   has added a new dimension to world oil   gas  Basically  gas can and will only become cheaper everywhere outside the US  even if oil gets more expensive  As oil prices grow  energy consumers find ways of not using it  and these ways expand fast when oil prices rise fast  Every  demand domain  of oil is in fact threatened  even the semi sacred private automobile  which can easily  cheaply  and cleanly run on gas  Oil fired electric power production is an almost extinct species in OECD countries   but developing countries still consume around 2 billion barrels a year for power generation  according to IEA data  The alternatives to oil fired power are simply massive  and always getting cheaper  and now include the new renewables  wind and solar  Oil fired marine transport  using about another 2 bn barrels a year  was another  reserved domain  for oil  but ships can run on coal  gas and wind  as well as oil  Also  both bulk cargo and container shipping are in decline as the global economy downsizes  re localizes and constantly raises its energy efficiency   The above and other energy economic fundamentals are likely not so important for explaining why the coming slide in oil prices may have to stop at around  60 to  75 per barrel  the knock on to a basically deflating real economy  well sheltered from or starved by the rain of QE bank bailouts  of a major cut in oil prices will be deflationary   and bad  For Big Energy companies and corporations the impacts may be disastrous  really disastrous  including bail outs being needed for what were imagined to be Win Only cash machines generating shareholder benefits  supplying energy and oil products supporting a huge web of state tax revenues  Cheap energy is a danger for economic growth  the exact opposite of any political party pitch on the subject   and the US experience with cheap shale gas is a real time  real world example of what cheap gas energy has done for the economy  almost nothing for growth  and major damage across the energy patch   We can however be rather sure oil traders will not be interested in this type of analysis   when the right signals come  barrel prices can fall far and fast  in  10 a week increments  to be sure with highly predictable dead cat bounces when  market sentiment says the downside was exaggerated   Finding the right price level for oil is however easy  in the US  natural gas is now priced around  20 per barrel equivalent  the cheapest coal in the US is priced at  1 60 per barrel equivalent  wind power and solar power plants operate on  fuel  that is 100  and perfectly free  beat that with 100 dollar oil   From the danger price level of  75 per barrel on the downside  however  the action by oil producers will go into high gear  Saudi Arabian claims  from its oil minister al Naimi that  he likes  75 oil  will disappear off the newsfeeds coming out of Saudi Arabia  and Russian reaction to  75 oil is easy to predict  Further price erosion to  60 per barrel will produce a rout  with a major downward impact on oil production and supply  enabling oil traders to excel themselves with an hysterical surge in prices  but that is business as usual ,2012-10-02,Andrew

  Updates to mid morning 
 By Edward Krudy
 NEW YORK  July 2  Reuters    U S  stocks fell sharply on
Thursday after payrolls data showed more Americans than
expected lost their jobs in June  dimming hopes of a quick
economic recovery 
 U S  employers cut 467 000 jobs in June  far more than the
363 000 forecast by a Reuters survey  while the unemployment
rate rose to 9 5 percent  the government said on Thursday in a
report that showed a labor market continuing to struggle 
 A separate report showed U S  factory orders came in better
than expected in May  but this provided little comfort in what
had turned into a broad sell off in equities by mid morning 
  The emphasis has been on jobs  and the fact that the
number came in worse than expected is all the reason in the
world why the market would sell off   said Kevin Caron  market
strategist at Stifel Nicolaus   Co in Florham Park  New
Jersey 
  One of the camps that has been behind the S P s 40 percent
improvement from its lows has been the green shoots crowd that
have been looking for more of a V shaped type of recovery in
the economy  and if data like this continues to come in  it s
going to make that case very hard to sustain  
 Commodity prices eased and safe bet U S  Treasuries edged
higher after the jobs data  Crude oil fell almost 4 percent to
under  67 a barrel  denting shares in energy companies 
 U S oil producer Exxon Mobil Corp fell 1 7 percent to
 69 37  and its sector peer Chevron Corp lost 1 6 percent to
 65 43 
 Crude prices were helped lower by a stronger U S  dollar 
which moved 0 8 percent higher against a basket of major
currencies after hitting a three week low on Wednesday  The
dollar has been volatile in recent weeks  in part because of a
continued debate over its position as a global reserve
currency

 By Brian Gorman
 LONDON  July 6  Reuters    European shares fell to a
seven week low on Monday  on worries that economic recovery may
still be some way off  with energy companies and banks leading
the fallers  and ahead of the start of second quarter earnings 
 At 0810 GMT  the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was down 1 8 percent at 827 58 points  after falling as
far as 827 00  its lowest level since May 14 
The European benchmark index is up more than 28 percent from
its lifetime low of March 9  However  it has fallen for three
straight weeks  with some analysts saying it has risen too fast 
relative to the tangible evidence of economic recovery 
 The heavyweight banking sector took most points off the
index  BNP Paribas  Banco Santander  Credit Suisse and HSBC were
down between 0 9 and 1 percent 
   There s a feeling corporate results are still going to be
poor   said Justin Urquhart Stewart  investment director at
Seven Investment Management  in London  
  People are asking where the growth is going to come from 
They re looking at data and noticing it s still getting worse  
though not at the same rate as before  he added 
 Worries on lower demand pushed commodity prices lower  Crude
prices fell more than 4 percent to below  64 a barrel  Total 
ENI  BP and Royal Dutch Shell dropped between 2 5 and 3 percent 
 Copper and other metals also fell  Anglo American 
Antofagasta  BHP Billiton  Lonmin  Rio Tinto  Vedanta Resources
  Xstrata fell between 2 and 4 7 percent  
 
 BASF RISES
 Chemicals giant BASF was one of a only a handful of
heavyweight stocks to rise  up 0 4 percent  after Banc of
America Merrill Lynch upgraded it to  buy  from  neutral   
 In a week shortened by the Independence Day holiday  U S 
shares also fell for a third straight week  Data showed that the
unemployment rate for both the United States and the euro zone
has risen to 9 5 percent 
 Across Europe  Britain s FTSE 100  Germany s DAX and
France s CAC 40 were down between 1 3 and 1 7 percent on Monday 
Japan s Nikkei closed 1 4 percent lower on Monday 
In an otherwise thin corporate and economic calendar on
Monday  investors will focus on services U S  PMI data for June 
expected to show further contraction  but at a slower rate than
before  
 Futures for the Dow Jones  S P 500 and Nasdaq were down
between 0 9 and 1 2 percent 
 Aloca  Pepsi Bottling Group and Chevron are among those
kicking off second quarter earnings season later this week

 NEW YORK  July 6  Reuters    U S  stocks fell on Monday as
investors worried about the potential strength and timing of an
economic recovery  sending oil prices and energy shares lower 
 Markets briefly cut losses after data showed the U S 
service sector contracted at a slower pace in June  blunting
some pessimism over the economy after a last week s much
worse than expected jobs report 
  Overall the data looks like a positive  although it may
not be enough in the near term to overcome last week s
disappointing jobs report   said Michael Sheldon  chief market
strategist at RDM Financial in Westport  Connecticut 
 Oil touched a five week low and fell to around  64 a
barrel  sending Exxon Mobil Corp down 2 1 percent at  67 05 
and Chevron Corp fell 2 1 percent to  63 09  The two companies
were the biggest weights on the Dow Jones industrial average 
  Although the weaker oil prices bode well for
recession weary consumers  strong commodity prices have been
viewed as a signal the global economy is stabilizing

193945,415461,CVX,Buy  Discount Darling  Oil Stocks This Summer  Ray Kwan,opinion,Not every beaten down oil stock is necessarily a bargain  Picking the true gems requires in depth analysis of the type that Ray Kwan  professional engineer and oil and gas analyst  does at Macquarie Capital Markets  In this exclusive interview with The Energy Report  he explains what to look for and talks about several of his  discount darlings  and why he thinks they offer investors a good shot at above average returns  The Energy Report  Oil prices have been bouncing around quite a bit  Where do you see them headed over the next year  Ray Kwan  As a firm  we re actually pretty constructive on the oil complex  There are three main reasons behind that  First  global refineries are exiting a large maintenance season  Second  we believe that there s going to be a slow but steady transport demand recovery in Asia as well as in the U S  Finally  we re going to see stronger demand for power generation in emerging economies and throughout Asia  We expect the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  to balance out excess supply by reducing production  The bottom line is that we think West Texas Intermediate  WTI  prices will increase to the  90 100 barrel   90 100 bbl  range by year end  TER  Will China s economic growth or lack thereof have a significant influence on the market  RK  Macquarie has pretty good insight into the Asian markets  especially China  We expect a soft landing  That is going to bode well for a lot of the commodities  including oil  TER  On the other hand  low natural gas prices have been a problem for producers for a couple of years now  although consumers are benefiting from it  What do you see going on there  RK  We re not as positive on gas  unfortunately  The supply side continues to offer little help in rebalancing the market  and it s still flat to growing  despite the drop in the rig count  The only silver lining is the coal to gas switching on the demand side and the hot summer  which has improved U S  storage levels  Unfortunately  it s just not enough  in our view  I think coal to gas switching is effectively tapped out  and it should set a ceiling for natural gas prices over 2012 and 2013  Interestingly  if natural gas comes close to the  3 thousand cubic feet   3 Mcf  range  utilities could potentially start switching back to coal  Next year  we expect natural gas to stay in the  3 50 3 70 Mcf range  TER  You just mentioned strip pricing  and you talk about this in your research reports  Can you explain that concept in layman s terms  RK  Strip prices are the future prices for both oil and natural gas  Future contracts give buyers the right to purchase a set amount of a given commodity on a set day in the future  In the U S   the most liquid futures contracts are Henry Hub as well as WTI  Both of those are found on the NYMEX  Futures contracts give investors a picture of what producers  as well as speculators  are willing to pay for the commodity to be delivered at that time  TER  What is the best valuation metric for determining which stocks are true bargains  RK  We look at two valuation tools  The first is enterprise value to debt adjusted cash flow  EV DACF   The second is net asset value  NAV   EV DACF is essentially enterprise value  EV  divided by debt adjusted cash flow  Debt adjusted cash flow is funds from operations and adding back the interest costs  So it s somewhat equivalent to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   This figure will indicate a company s valuation based on near term cash flow  With EV DACF  the cheaper it is  the more it represents a true bargain  NAV  on the other hand  is simply the present value of the company s Proven and Probable  2P  reserves at a particular oil and gas price  You subtract the debt and add any option proceeds as well as the value of the company s land  If a company is trading below NAV  that naturally represents a bargain  In addition to that  if a company has a huge resource that s not accounted for in its 2P reserves  we add its risked resource NAV to that equation so we can see the ultimate potential of the company  TER  Do you use different discount factors  RK  Yes  For the NAV  especially in the junior oil and gas space  we use a standard 10  discount rate  Sometimes we use sensitivities for an implied discount rate  TER  Your coverage list is fairly broad  Most of these stocks range between  3 12  and you have a couple of cheapies in there  How do you determine which companies to cover  RK  We look for high growth exploration and production  E P  names that are generating solid cash flow while growing their NAVs through the drill bit and or through acquisitions  Our coverage universe is narrowly focused on names that have the capability of showing high growth potential or that have interesting asset bases  TER  Have your cheaper holdings simply depreciated  or do they have a lot of hidden value that the market isn t recognizing  RK  There are some gas names I picked up when we had a better gas environment  expecting that they were going to show quite a bit of growth in cash flow and NAV  With the recent volatility in both oil and natural gas prices  however  the junior oil and gas space has really fallen off  I think this represents a great time for investors to look at these specific names and see what hidden value and optionality these companies have  A lot of them fall in that category  TER  You call some of your holdings  discount darlings   Who are they  RK  The two oily names I like are Whitecap Resources Inc   WCP TSX V  and Surge Energy Inc   SGY TSX   I like them despite volatile prices because they re still able to maintain a fairly profitable margin  Both are close to 70  light oil  They re the  growthy  mid cap oil producers with operations in Western Canada  They re both recognized as having top tier management teams  Both are growing their production on a per share basis by well over 34  year over year  YOY  in 2012  By comparison  our mid cap median group is only generating about 20  YOY growth in production volume  Whitecap and Surge are top tier in these factors  They re generating operating netbacks well over  35 bbl at current levels and are well hedged  They have strong balance sheets and should do well in an oil price recovery  While we re not specifically bullish on gas  Celtic Exploration Ltd   CLT TSX  is one of my favorite gas weighted stocks and  in my view  represents a prime takeout candidate  It has two sizable and contiguous land blocks  chasing the liquids rich  gas prone Kaybob Duvernay shales and Montney at Resthaven  For its Montney land base  Celtic has one of the largest land positions in Western Canada at nearly 700 net sections  Liquids yields from Celtic s Montney wells at Resthaven help improve the overall well economics and should aid in buffering the company against the low gas price environment  In addition  its 172 net sections of Duvernay land are in the sweet spot of the play and are surrounded by larger players  such as Encana Corp   ECA TSX  ECA NYSE   Chevron Corp   CVX NYSE   Husky Energy Inc   HSE TSX  and Talisman Energy Inc   TLM TSX   that are chasing the exact same formation  Given the recent sale of Progress Energy Resources Corp   PRQ TSX  to Petronas  we believe Celtic could be next to be taken out  TER  Do you have any others that could have some reasonable upside  RK  Another name I d mention is Renegade Petroleum Ltd   RPL TSX V   If you re looking for oil  it s over 95  light oil  and close to 4 000 barrels per day  4 000 bbl d  production wise  The company is expected to grow that to 5 200 5 400 bbl d oil  over 95  light oil  by year end  If you want to talk about who has one of the best operating margins or operating netbacks  Renegade would certainly be in that camp  Even at  85 bbl oil  it should be generating more than  45 bbl in operating netbacks  It s a solid company that has a strong balance sheet and is growing  despite the current volatility in oil prices  TER  Are most of these small cap and mid tier companies potential takeover targets  RK  I certainly think so  We believe the theme over the next couple of years is  bigger is better   Given the shift toward horizontal multistage fracture stimulation  per well costs are moving up  requiring junior oil and gas companies to achieve a certain cash flow or production base in order to fund their program  To get to that level  acquisitions will be part of that equation  Nowadays  we believe acquirers are being more selective about the asset bases they want  Typically  acquirers will want to purchase a producer that has a lot of production and a well delineated and contiguous land base  so there is little risk going forward  Small cap and mid tier producers that have these qualities are the first to be considered as a takeover target  in my view  TER  It seems like the average life expectancy for most of these smaller companies is less than 10 years  RK  I agree  What s great about Western Canada is that oil and gas executives here are an entrepreneurial bunch and are good at creating new companies  looking at new plays  turning people s capital into production and cash flow and eventually selling it to a larger company  It s formulaic   Rinse and repeat   That s why you don t see many companies with over a 10 year life span  These executives are moving on to the next big idea  TER  It s sort of an easy business to get into and an easy business to get out of  if you play things right  RK  Definitely  The one thing I would probably highlight is that the quality of the management team is key in this industry  As you said  it is easy to get in but you need to be well connected and have a strong technical background to extract the most out of the company s assets  TER  To summarize  how should investors pick their oil and gas stocks  RK  In my view  it s really a stock picker s game  Oil and gas stocks are definitely going to ebb and flow with the macro environment  but investors with a longer term view should start accumulating over the summer  We expect oil prices to firm up by year end  and the equities will follow  TER  You ve given us some interesting names  Thanks for joining

193947,415463,CVX,Oil Insight Article AMK,opinion,Second quarter results for Exxon  which was the world s biggest company by market capitalization until Apple moved into No 1 slot  confirm a stack of trends in world energy and the global economy  Exxon Mobil is still the world s biggest oil company by market value  even if its combined oil and gas reserves are now minuscule relative to those of a long list of both OPEC and NOPEC national oil companies  Like the other  historic oil majors  Exxon has shifted to the refining downstream  energy trading  non energy activities   and gas production and the hunt for global natural gas resources   makes Exxon and the others highly vulnerable to the global economy s performance  and very vulnerable to falling oil prices   Its second quarter results show that Exxon earned a lot less than most analysts had expected  Reasons included the simple fact that global oil demand has stalled  led by stubborn shrinkage or at best  flat line demand  in the world s largest economies  Exxon was also heavily penalized by the USA s incredibly low natural gas prices  which at around  3 per mln BTU price US gas at about  17 40 per barrel equivalent  This is a 45 percent decline on prices even 1 year ago  and 66 percent since 2006   Exxon is above all realworld  these days  Like the other  historic oil majors   which included Exxon  Mobil  Shell  BP  Chevron  Texaco  ARCO  Total  Gulf  ENI  and others  Exxon has downsized  Only a few figures are needed to show this  announcing the new and downsized earnings of Exxon  its CEO Rex Tillerson said his corporation plans to spend  37 billion in 2012 towards the goal of adding 1 million barrels equivalent per day of new oil production capacity by 2016  Not only the total cost of this downsized goal  but the time needed to achieve it are striking  even stunning  The keyword  equivalent  underlines that a part  probably most of this extra 1 Mbdoe of capacity by 2016 will come as natural gas liquids  even shale oil and condensed oil from natural gas production streams   Until 2009  world oil demand growth attained about 0 8   1 Mbd every year  and in some years well above this  up to 2   2 25 Mbd extra demand in a single year but that was  another age   before 2009   COMMODITY PRICES DONT HELP Exxon s earnings fell short of analyst estimates for the second straight quarter  as the company s total production on an oil equivalent basis  with a fast rising natural gas component and declining oil component struggled to achieve an average  in second quarter 2012  of 4 15 million barrels a day  This was Exxon s lowest quarterly average since 2010  when oil prices were still slowly recouping the losses made in 2008 2009  Current weak performance of Exxon  and other  historic majors   underlines a major and somber fact for global oil  below about  75 per barrel it is getting hard not only to produce more oil  but to maintain current production output   Inside the US  what are suicidally low natural gas prices for producers un surprisingly do not help  integrated energy companies   like Exxon which produce both gas and oil  It makes them hostage to high oil prices  depending on high oil prices to cross subsidize their gas exploration  development and production  Otherwise  rather simply  they risk to run out of business   Exxon s sales rose 1 5 percent to  127 4 billion  The company s initial claim that earnings based on this did not contain any special or one time gains was quickly contradicted by the corporation itself  some  7 5 billion of earnings were due to asset sales based gains  making up 47 percent of the per share earnings  This came from asset sales  Asset sales and trading are now a normal part of Exxon s operations  shown by the role of asset sales in the company s apparently flourishing refining business   Exxon s refining profit quadrupled in the second quarter to  6 65 billion  but  5 3 billion of this came from the company s one off sale of a chunk of its Japanese refining business  to Tonen General Sekiyu   Just as troubling for Exxon s real profitability and showing its total dependence on high oil prices  the corporation s earnings decline has almost exactly tracked oil prices  Brent crude futures  now the benchmark for over 60 percent of world oil trade  averaged  108 76 a barrel during the quarter  a 7 percent decline from a year earlier  Exxon s earnings fell by a little more than that amount   PRAYING FOR HIGH OIL PRICES The likelihood that Exxon CEO Tillerson will grab the microphone to say he wants and needs triple digit oil prices is of course low  but he needs them  For Exxon and any other integrated energy company producing both gas and oil the global economy and its oil demand trends are getting worse by the day  Oil demand in the U S  and China  whose combined consumption of around 28 1 Mbd ranks at about 31 percent of world total oil demand  has now almost perfectly flat lined for one year  The EU27 countries  in 2012  are in their sixth straight year of oil demand contraction  Especially in the US  but this will progressively extend outside America in a predictable future hyper low gas prices are wreaking havoc on company profitability   even threatening their survival  Natural gas prices are  as shown by the company fortunes of gas majority producers like Chesapeake and Exxon s gas subsidiary XTO  which cost Exxon nearly  40 billion to buy in 2009 2010  semi suicidal  Gas futures in New York through the second quarter fell 46 percent compared to a year earlier  and  averaged  2 35 per mln BTU  Ths was the lowest quarterly average in 13 years  since 1999  These price levels  earlier in 2012  prompted Exxon s Rex Tillerson to warn that Exxon and other US gas producers are  losing our shirts  amid a glut of North American shale gas supply  Outside the US the natural gas exists  for sure and certain and in staggeringly immense quantities   but developing and producing it is costly  The gas glut most surely does not only affect Exxon  Royal Dutch Shell has also  gone for gas  and today produces about 55   45 of its total energy output as gas energy and oil energy  For the second quarter  Shell s earnings were also down  by about 13 percent at  5 7 bn  and like Exxon s earnings well below most analyst forecasts   Consumers are already shifting away from oil to gas where they can  Gas is now the most widely used US furnace fuel and the USA s second largest generating source for electricity  but suicidally low gas prices make it a losing bet for energy explorers  In turn this makes oil the  only solution  for energy producers who intend to stay in integrated oil and gas production and the O G downstream  To be sure  this means expensive oil  because low priced oil will be as lethal to company fortunes as bargain basement priced natural gas   What this means is that if a serious slump happens in world oil prices   this will bring dangerous times for the  historic majors   and others  Their corporate strategies will be an analyst s feast  predicting which one will break ranks first and sell more oil   despite falling prices   Already today  analysts criticize Exxon s acquisition of XTO Energy  ranking Exxon the largest US gas producer  in front of Chesapeake Energy Corp  The Chesapeake story or saga is well known today  prompting analysts who in 2010 thought Exxon s buy out of XTO was a great move  to say that today almost any other major oil company except Exxon  with less exposure to US gas  is a more compelling investment and trading play  under current and likely emerging conditions   KEEPING OIL PRICES HIGH The oil and gas producers have already had to abandon all hopes of keeping natural gas prices high   which 5 years ago could attain over  12 50 per mln BTU in the USA  They have been forced to accept that natural gas prices  in the US  have already fallen about 66 percent in 5 years   making their last  best hope  triple digit  oil prices   On the world scene  not only the  historic majors  but also once powerful  recently powerful players as big as Gazprom of Russia are being forced to contemplate an ever approaching and large cut in their earnings on gas production and exports  Quite soon  Gazprom will be forced to abandon  oil indexed  gas pricing  and the results will be terrible for Gazprom   The upsetting and transforming role of surging gas finds  production and supply has now created a context where companies as big as Exxon  BP  Shell  Total  ENI  and the gas majors are trapped in a hole where the only way out is through  triple digit  oil prices  How these players strive to keep oil prices high will be an interesting scene to observe and analyze  but under real and current oil market conditions  even  75 per barrel is cloud cuckoo and massively overpriced ,2012-07-29,Andrew MacKillop,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-insight-article-amk-131236,131236

193949,415465,CVX,Weak Second Quarter For Linn Energy Not A Cause For Concern,opinion,Linn Energy LLC s  NSDQ LINE  second quarter results fell short of expectations  prompting management to reduce its full year forecast for distributable cash flow  DCF   The limited liability company  LLC  generated  0 70 per unit in DCF  which fell slightly short of the declared quarterly payout of  0 725 per unit  In contrast  Linn Energy covered its payout by 114 percent in the first quarter  Despite these disappointing results  the firm grew its hydrocarbon output by 76 percent from a year ago  to 630 million cubic feet equivalent per day  Much of this upside stemmed from the integration of new acquisitions  though Linn Energy also posted solid production increases in core operating regions such as the Permian Basin and the Granite Wash  Linn Energy s efforts to improve drilling efficiency and the implementation of an innovative system for handling the water used in hydraulic fracturing  a production technique that unlocks hydrocarbons from low permeability reservoir rocks  also reduced expenses from year ago levels  What drove the LLC s disappointing second quarter  The price of   NGL  a group of heavier hydrocarbons whose price historically has tracked movements in the value of West Texas Intermediate crude oil tumbled precipitously The barrel of mixed NGLs tracked in this graph consists of 36 5 percent ethane  31 8 percent propane  11 2 percent normal butane  6 2 percent iso butane and 14 3 percent natural gasoline  all of which are delivered at the hub in Mont Belvieu  Texas  As you can see  NGL and oil prices surged in 2007 and early 2008  collapsed in 2008 and early 2009  and rose in tandem from mid 2009 through to 2011 From the beginning of 2006 to mid 2011  a barrel of NGLs usually fetched roughly 60 percent of the price of a barrel of WTI crude oil  But this long standing price relationship has deteriorated over the past eight months  a mixed barrel of NGLs recently bottomed at about 40 percent of the benchmark oil price for North America  When you compare the price of a mixed barrel of NGLs to the market value of Brent crude oil  the differential is even greater  as this international oil benchmark has commanded a significant premium to WTI crude oil over the past two years  Ultra depressed US natural gas prices  the decline in NGL prices and the discounted price of WTI crude oil relative to international reference points stem  in part  from rising production of all three commodities from the nation s prolific shale oil and gas plays  But there s an old saw in the energy business that says it s harder to grow oil and liquids output than natural gas production  The shale oil and gas revolution hasn t invalidated this maxim  Although US oil output has increased for the first time in more than 30 years  this uptick in pales in comparison to the surge in natural gas production that has overwhelmed domestic demand  The supply demand balance in the NGL market lies between the extremes of the  in the domestic market and the substantial supply shortfall that forces the US to make up the difference by importing significant quantities of oil  Domestic NGL production eclipsed 2 million barrels per day in 2010 a record high and averaged 2 38 million barrels per day in May 2012  a 7 percent increase from year ago levels   At the same time  the newfound abundance of ethane and propane has revivified the domestic petrochemical industry  giving chemical manufacturers a dramatic cost advantage over producers in Asia and the Middle East that rely on naphtha and other oil derivatives for feedstock  Over the past decade  multinational chemical producers such as Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW  have gradually shifted their production base from the US to Asia  to build a presence in growing demand centers  and the Middle East  to take advantage of lower feedstock costs   Last year  this trend reversed course  A number of major petrochemical producers announced plans to restart shuttered crackers or construct world class plants to take advantage of favorable pricing on ethane and propane  For example  Dow Chemical the world s second largest chemical outfit announced plans to restart its ethane cracker at its St  Charles complex  upgrade one plant in Louisiana and another in Texas to enable them to accept ethane feedstock and build a new ethylene production plant on the Gulf Coast in 2017  The firm aims to improve its ethane cracking capabilities by 20 percent to 30 percent to take advantage of the superior economics offered by the NGL  And Royal Dutch Shell  LSE RDSA  NYSE RDSA  in June 2011 announced that it would build a world scale ethylene plant in Appalachia that would source its feedstock from the   Meanwhile  Chevron Phillips Chemical a joint venture between Chevron Corp  NYSE CVX  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE  COP  plans to build a major ethane cracker and ethylene derivatives facility in the Texas Gulf Coast region  Equally important  the US has some capacity to export propane and NGL derived products  Both Enterprise Products Partners LP  NYSE EPD  and Targa Resources Partners LP  NYSE NGLS  own or are in the process of building propane export capacity  However  the nation s existing export capacity is maxed out The recent price decline has hit lighter NGLs  especially ethane  which recently slipped to a low of roughly  12 per barrel from more than  30 per barrel at the end of 2011  Although the prices of propane and butane have also tumbled considerably from their 2012 highs  producers can still generate a solid return on these NGLs   The most conservatively run of the upstream MLPs  Linn Energy hedges all its expected oil and gas production for years in the future  limiting its exposure to the vagaries of the commodities market  However  this extensive hedge book  which insulated the firm from the collapse in commodity prices in late 2008 and early 2009  isn t as effective protecting the firm s cash flow against fluctuations in NGL prices  Producers traditionally have hedged NGL production with oil futures  reflecting the long standing relationship between the prices of these two commodities  Unfortunately  NGL prices have declined to a much greater extent than the price of WTI crude oil  in this environment  a short position in crude oil failed to fully protect producers from plummeting NGL prices  Although producers can hedge NGL prices  the market for these futures lacks sufficient liquidity  Clay Jeansomme  Linn Energy s vice president of investor relations  addressed this challenge during a  to discuss the LLC s second quarter results   I f you look back and say  okay  when we looked at hedging it  Linn Energy s NGLs exposure  it s backwardated by 30  40 percent  how bearish do you want to be  But having said that  you would have endured that king of lowered pricing for six months and so you saw the lower pricing that we are seeing today  So  probably nets up to about the same  It just didn t look that compelling honestly  and even looking back it s still questionable as to whether it s compelling  So  until there is a longer dated  less backwardated NGL hedge market and we look at it  trust me  we will look at it every day  because if we had the ability to hedge NGL for 100 percent and then they would be consistent with everything else we do at LINN we would be all over that  But the economics has just never looked compelling at the times we ve looked at it  So we ll keep looking but I don t regret it really at this point  When a producer hedges its output  the firm sells that commodity forward  That is  if an upstream operator expects to flow 1 000 barrels of oil per day in May 2013  the firm s traders would sell May 2013 futures contracts for 31 000 barrels of oil  31 days in May times 1 000 barrels of oil per day   At present  the contract for WTI crude oil to be delivered in May 2013 sells for about  90 per barrel  while the current quote in the spot market is about  88 per barrel  In this case  the hedge locks in a guaranteed price on this future production that exceeds prevailing prices  The differentials between the current price of natural gas and futures contracts are even more favorable  Whereas the fuel fetches  3 25 per million British thermal units  mmBtu  in the spot market  natural gas to be delivered in July 2013 goes for  3 65 per mmBtu  Producers can lock in natural gas prices of more than  4 per mmBtu on futures contracts for December 2013  In this situation  the market is in a state of contango that is  futures contracts trade at a premium to spot prices and near term futures contracts  The NGL market  in contrast  finds itself in steep backwardation  where future prices are significantly lower than prevailing spot prices  In other words  a producer seeking to hedge its NGL prices would lock in a price on future production that s 30 percent to 40 percent lower than the current quote  The lack of an efficient means of hedging NGL output  coupled with a sharp drop in the prices of these commodities  explains why Linn Energy s DCF failed to cover its quarterly distribution  Excluding the effect of weak NGL prices  the LLC would have generated enough cash flow to cover 115 percent of its quarterly payout  Even if NGL prices remain at depressed levels  management expects the publicly traded partnership s distribution coverage to improve to 120 percent in 2013  This forecast could ultimately prove conservative  butane prices have climbed about 18 percent since their June nadir  propane prices have recovered by more than 30 percent and ethane prices have rebounded by almost 40 percent  Management s bullish outlook reflects three upside drivers  the integration of new acquisitions  a focus on growing oil production organically and a shift in NGL volumes from Conway  Kan   to Mont Belvieu  Texas ,2012-08-22,Elliott

 NEW YORK  June 26  Reuters    U S  stocks faltered on
Friday as weak oil futures pressured energy shares and a jump
in the savings rate raised worries the economic recovery will
not make much headway if consumers continue to be frugal 
 Data showed that while consumer spending and income both
rose in May as the government stimulus spread through the
economy  much of the money was being socked away  Savings
jumped to a record annual rate of  768 8 billion  the highest
level since record keeping began in 1959 
  We need people to spend money in order to keep the economy
humming   said Joe Kinahan  chief derivatives strategist at
online brokerage thinkorswim Group in Chicago   The consumer
has been the stalwart of the economy at this point  and we
still need them to be  
 Even so  a separate report showed consumer sentiment rose
in June to the highest since February 2008 as hopes grew that
the recession is abating 
 Energy shares weighed as oil futures fell below  70 a
barrel after oil producer Nigeria said it would halt a battle
with rebels during a two month amnesty

0 59 percent  to 8 421 99  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
slipped 4 91 points  or 0 53 percent  to 915 35  The Nasdaq
Composite Index was off 3 29 points  or 0 18 percent  to

 The broad S P had rallied as much as 40 percent from
March s 12 year low  but the run up has stalled as initial
optimism about a stabilizing economy was tempered by worries
the recovery could be tepid  The index is up about 35 percent

 As investors try to gauge the market s next move  J P 
Morgan Securities said the S P 500 is likely to fall to between
830 and 875 through September 
 The strategists urged investors to use the correction to
build positions in cyclical stocks 
 In the energy sector  Chevron Corp fell 1 1 percent to

 Other smartphone makers cushioned losses on the Nasdaq 
including Apple Inc  which gained 1 3 percent to  141 68  and

 NEW YORK  June 26  Reuters    The Nasdaq rose on Friday 
helped by gains in smartphone maker Palm Inc while other
indexes ended little changed in choppy trading 
 The Dow was dragged lower by sliding energy shares as oil
settled below  70 per barrel  But strength in some financial
stocks helped cushion the S P 500 s decline

 Weighing on sentiment  a jump in the savings rate
suggested that the debt burdened U S  consumer may not drive
the economy out of recession as fast as hoped 
 Data showed that while consumer spending and income both
rose in May as the government stimulus spread through the

jumped to a record annual rate of  768 8 billion  the highest
level since record keeping began in 1959 
 Robert Stimpson  portfolio manager at Oak Associates in
Akron  Ohio  said that while he did not put too much store on
the savings data alone  the trend in the United States was
toward more saving and less spending 
  The U S  markets are probably going to lag the rest of
the world because we have a need to pay down debt  increase
our savings rate and be better stewards of our own capital 
which might lead to lower consumer spending versus the rest of
the world   Stimpson said

included Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke s contentious
appearance on Capitol Hill and the sale of  104 billion in

193960,415476,CVX,Rio 20 Economic Reality Check,opinion,The latest economic statistics are out and it is not good news  The Federal Reserve s  for the U S  economy show significant deterioration as previous GDP growth and other projections since the last report in April  For example  change in real GDP was 1 9 to 2 4  compared to 2 4 to 2 9  in the April projection  The unemployment rate was 8 0 to 8 2  compared to an April projection of 7 8 to 8 0   PCE inflation was 1 2 to 1 7  compared to the April projection of 1 9 to 2 0     The Philadelphia Fed index surveys business in the Mid Atlantic region on their business outlook  It is a key benchmark of business conditions but the latest report showed business contraction in June  This sets up the same  summer slowdown  pattern seen the past few years where first quarter growth is stronger and then wanes over the second half  But the  16 6 Philly Fed Index reading is the second lowest reading in this recovery  Any reading above zero indicates growth a negative reading indicates contraction  What worried economists most in this Philly Fed report was the  18 8 reading for the new orders since factory orders have now fallen in three of the past four months  The bottom line is the economy is deteriorating materially and the forecast is getting worse not better    Roiling Economic Discontent in Rio  Against this backdrop  more than 130 world leaders arrived for the Rio 20 Summit on Sustainable Development where the mood was just as surly as the global economy  The G77 bloc of developing nations lead by China pressed their case that the developed world was responsible for pulling the emerging economies up with a  sustainable development  read  financial subsidies  of at least  30 billion per year  Even in the boom years of the global economy this demand for wealth transfer was a tough sell  Now in the struggle to restore economic stability in both EU and the US the demand was laughable    The conference has been on the verge of collapse for months ahead of the delegate arrival in Rio  Perhaps  the developing world sees this as their last opportunity to guilt the first world into signing onto a wealth transfer and technology transfer deal the development world will use to compete against them in world markets  It clearly was not working     We cannot be held hostage to the retraction resulting from financial crises in rich countries  We are here to think about the long term and not about crises that may be overcome in one or two years    Luiz Alberto Figueiredo  Undersecretary at Brazil s Foreign Ministry    The  guilt them and they will give  strategy no longer is working  Behind the scenes tempers flared as representatives from groups of nations and nongovernmental organizations hoping to shame the major nations into a new round of funding walked out of a core working group on the  green economy  when the tantrums failed to work  Reality is setting in both in the first world struggling to stabilize wobbly economies as well as the developing world using the ruse of sustainability to extract giant wealth transfers that enable them to avoid reforming their own economies and ending the corruption that makes them unattractive investment locations    Then there is this it is more than ironic that this conference is being held again this year in Brazil one of the more promising BRIC developing nations  Yet even Brazil is struggling with balancing the realities of its dependence upon a global economy and its desire for national development  Brazil wants more foreign direct investment yet it permits local prosecutors in Rio State to threaten Chevron executives with jail time and huge fines over natural oil seaps in the offshore deepwater Frades play because Rio State and the Brazilian Federal Government are at odds over the split of oil money expected from the project  I wonder what the reaction in Rio would be if Chevron told the Brazilians that it was pulling out of the Frades project and moving its people and equipment to Angola or Israel or back onshore in North Dakota where the business climate is more  sustainable  because it was focused on the long term    The tough love lesson from Rio 20 is that true sustainability begins at home by creating economic  tax  policy and business conditions that encourage private investment  respect contracts  property rights and the rule of law  set clear environmental rules and enforce them evenly  and replace corruption with healthy competition ,2012-06-24,Gary Hunt,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rio20-economic-reality-check-127467,127467

193966,415482,CVX,COLUMN Miners throw down antitrust gauntlet  John Kemp,news,"   John Kemp is a Reuters columnist  The views expressed are his
own   
 
 By John Kemp
 LONDON  June 24  Reuters    Consolidation of the global
mining industry is nearing its logical conclusion  For years 
senior executives have predicted that the sector would in future
be dominated by five or six large diversified companies 
 The proposed  production joint venture  between BHP Billiton
 and Rio Tinto  and Xstrata s mooted  merger of equals  with
Anglo American would  if consummated  make that a reality 
 BHP  Rio and Anglo Xstrata  together with a handful of other
strategic players    Brazil s Vale  Chile s Codelco  Russia s
Norilsk Nickel and U S  Freeport McMoran    would dominate
production and trading of bulk commodities  iron ore  as well as
a host of other strategic materials  copper  ferro alloys and
platinum group metals  
 For steelmakers  manufacturers and consumers  consolidation
raises legitimate concerns about lessening competition and its
impact on investment and pricing  Competition authorities in the
European Union and elsewhere will subject the deals to intense
scrutiny  The question is whether they can find legal grounds to
block them 
 
 SALAMI SLICING PROBLEM
 Taken in isolation  none of the deals is objectionable 
though the production joint venture between BHP and Rio comes
close to the line and should be subject to especially close and
ongoing surveillance  Regulators may struggle to find adequate
legal grounds to block them  But the cumulative effect of a
whole wave of consolidations is to make the industry
significantly less competitive 
 The issue is the familiar one of  salami tactics   first
used to describe stealth takeovers by totalitarian parties in
central and eastern Europe and later popularised in the British
political satire  Yes  Prime Minister   Fictional Prime Minister
Jim Hacker s chief scientific adviser shows that his boss will
never reach a point at which he is prepared to press the nuclear
button if the Soviets take over western Europe in a series of
piecemeal moves rather than launching one brazen frontal
assault    
 The salami problem explains why the accounting profession
was able to consolidate into just five major partnerships 
reduced to four by the collapse of Andersen  Most observers
agree this degree of concentration is unhealthy  at least from a
public policy perspective  because it means that many large
companies have little or no scope to change their auditor  It is
also now impossible to contemplate the failure of one of the
remaining four firms 
 But regulators found it impossible to object to any of the
long series of mergers and takeovers that brought us to this
point because each deal was not objectionable on its own  even
if the cumulative result produced a sub optimal outcome  There
is a risk this will now be replicated in the mining sector with
similar results 

 CONSOLIDATION DANGERS
 When asked to justify consolidation  mining leaders cite
synergies in administration and operations  the need for
diversification to ride out the business cycle  and the need to
attain a minimum efficient scale to finance huge multi decadal
investment projects costing billions of dollars  Similar
arguments were used during the wave of oil industry mergers in
the late 1990s and early 2000s that produced BP Amoco Arco 
Total Fina Elf  and Chevron Texaco 
 But it is not obvious that mergers and greater corporate
scale have produced benefits for consumers in the form of
greater willingness to undertake risky investments 
 Both the oil industry and the major mining companies have
been criticised precisely for the lack of investment and failure
to raise output more quickly during the first part of this
decade in response to rising prices  Larger scale has not
increased the oil majors  appetite for higher risk and higher
cost projects  instead the industry is locked in a stand off
with sovereign states over the terms of access to low risk 
cheap oil reserves in the Middle East 
 It is  of course  possible to argue that the oil industry
would have invested even less over the past eight years if the
mergers had not gone ahead  but that is a difficult
counter factual to sustain  and evidence is sparse 
 Set against the purported benefits of industry consolidation
are real risks for consumers  The best discussion of the dangers
was set out by the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission  ACCC  in its preliminary  statement of issues  on
BHP s proposed acquisition of Rio Tinto last year
   
 The ACCC noted that just three suppliers  BHP  Rio and Vale 
accounted for a high share of the global seaborne iron ore
market  and raised a series of concerns 
   The threat of competition from rival producers emerging
might be limited given high barriers to entry  including long
lead times and significant sunk investments in associated rail 
power and port infrastructure   As a result  the ACCC noted  it
is uncertain whether the threat of new entry is an enduring and
effective competitive constraint on large  low cost incumbent
suppliers  
   The merged firm  may have the incentive and ability to
influence global supply and global prices  to the extent it
could  profitably time future production and infrastructure
capacity expansions so as to maintain a shortfall of supply  
   The ACCC asked market participants for further information
on the extent to which alternative suppliers might be
 influenced by the pricing and expansion decisions of the major
iron ore  such as to follow their  price leadership  or be
 deterred by announcements regarding capacity expansions  
 In the end  following further submissions from BHP  the ACCC
pronounced itself satisfied on each of these points 
Nevertheless  the issues remain very real  In its own review 
based on the same evidence  the European Commission appeared
poised to reach the opposite conclusion and insist on disposals
as a condition for permitting the merger to proceed  until BHP
scrapped the deal 

 POLICY FACES KEY SHOWDOWN
 In recent years  competition regulators have often been
prepared to tolerate much higher levels of industry
concentration than in the past  relying on the theory of market
 contestability  and the threat of potential entry rather than
actual competition from existing rivals to exert discipline on
prices 
 But contestability is a piece of clever economic theory that
has worked less well in practice  There are signs a
re examination is underway  The European Commission s decision
to make the proposed BHP Rio deal conditional upon structural
remedies appeared to mark the limits of regulators  tolerance
for these highly concentrative deals and the end of the  New
Gilded Age  of permissive merger regulation 
 The Obama administration s new antitrust chief  Christine
Varney  also signalled a tougher approach in a high profile
speech last month  She promised a  shift in philosophy  and to
be aggressive in pursuing cases where monopolists try to use
their dominance to stifle competition 
 The proposed BHP Rio production joint venture  and Xstrata s
interest in Anglo American  pose a direct challenge to this new
line 
 The BHP Rio tie up has been specifically structured as a
production joint venture to escape scrutiny  Unlike full
mergers  joint production arrangements are not normally called
in for prior review  the two companies have promised that ore
sales will be done separately and on a competitive basis  But
since investment plans would have to be jointly agreed  it is
hard to see how the tie up would not give rise to similar
concerns 
 Competition regulators need to step back and look at the
aggregate effect of these deals on the shape of current and
future competition  and what type of industry structure is an
acceptable outcome at the end of the process 
 The traditional case by case approach embodied in past
precedents may make that difficult  In the medium term  more
effective competition enforcement may need a change in the law
to enable regulators to take a broader view  But in the
meantime  they would be advised to adopt an expansive reading of
their existing powers to subject this spate of mining deals to
intensive scrutiny before it is too late

   Energy shares fall alongside oil prices

 Updates to midmorning 
 By Leah Schnurr
 NEW YORK  June 26  Reuters    U S  stocks faltered on
Friday as investors booked profits and energy shares pulled
back alongside oil prices 
 A jump in the savings rate also weighed as investors
fretted that the economy will not be able to make much headway
if consumers save rather than spend 
 Data showed while consumer spending and income both rose in
May as the government stimulus spread through the economy  much
of the stimulus money was being socked away  Savings jumped to
a record annual rate of  768 8 billion  the highest level since
record keeping began in 1959 
  We need people to spend money in order to keep the economy
humming   said Joe Kinahan  chief derivatives strategist at
online brokerage thinkorswim Group in Chicago   The consumer
has been the stalwart of the economy at this point  and we
still need them to be  
 Even so  a separate report showed consumer sentiment rose
in June to the highest since February 2008 as hopes grew that
the recession is abating 
 Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp were the biggest drags on
the Dow as oil futures pulled back more than 1 percent  Chevron
fell nearly 1 percent to  66 30  and Exxon was off 0 5 percent
to  69 55 
 The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 49 43 points  or
0 58 percent  to 8 422 97  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
eased 5 31 points  or 0 58 percent  to 914 95  The Nasdaq
Composite Index was off 7 01 points  or 0 38 percent  to

 By Aiko Hayashi
 TOKYO  June 12  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average rose about
1 percent to hit its highest level in eight months on Friday as
improving confidence about the health of the global economy
spurred broad based gains 
 Mitsubishi Heavy jumped more than 6 percent  helped by a
report that it was close to securing a deal to construct the
world s first large scale coal gasification power plant in
Australia  It was also helped by a brokerage upgrade 
 Nomura Holdings  Japan s largest brokerage  jumped after
Merrill Lynch hiked its rating on the firm to  buy  from
 neutral   saying in a report that the company was likely to turn
profitable in the financial year ending in March 2011 
  The Nikkei could be trading between 10 000 and 12 000 by the
end of this year  as the economic outlook for emerging countries
such as China and India is pretty bullish   said Yoku Ihara 
manager at Retela Crea Securities 
  But after having reached the 10 000 peak  investors are
trying to decide whether to have a break around here or catch
their breath and keep going  
 The benchmark Nikkei climbed 1 percent to 10 076 28  after
rising as high as 10 089 15  its highest point since Oct  7 and
more than 40 percent higher than its March bear market low 
 The broader Topix added 0 7 percent to 946 87 
 Trade was active  partly due to trade linked to the
settlement of Nikkei futures and options contracts  Those
expiring in June likely settled at 10 147 65  Tokyo market
participants said earlier in the day  citing estimates by local
brokerages 
 On Thursday  the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0 4
percent  as crude oil surged briefly to more than  73 a barrel
and lifted shares of resource companies  such as Chevron 
 A sharp drop in interest rates also aided Wall Street as
stocks have tracked bonds of late  with higher rates causing
concern among investors as they could raise company borrowing
costs and slow the economic recovery 
 Data also showed U S  May retail sales rose 0 5 percent 
though the rise was mostly due to higher gasoline prices 
 NOT SO HEAVY
 Mitsubishi Heavy jumped 6 1 percent to 415 yen after the
Nikkei business daily said it looked like it would close the deal
in Australia with orders from the project estimated at around 200
billion yen   2 05 billion  
 Mitsubishi UFJ Securities also hiked its rating on the heavy
machinery maker  saying a shift to cleaner energies could propel
the firm to growth 
 Shares of Nomura climbed 5 1 percent to 916 yen  after the
brokerage won its first rights issue mandate in Europe this year 
underwriting a 420 million Swiss franc   390 million  deal for
Swiss flavour and fragrance maker Givaudan
 A wide range of shares advanced  with clothing retailer Fast
Retailing  a popular stock among individual investors  gaining
1 6 percent to 12 680 yen 
 GS Yuasa  a lithium ion battery maker and a favourite pick
among investors as an environment linked stock  advanced 5 1
percent to 1 040 yen 
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group  Japan s biggest bank

 But NEC Electronics Corp slid 2 7 percent to 981 yen after
the Nikkei business daily said the company was likely to end the
April June quarter with a group operating loss of about 20
billion yen   204 5 million   as sales of chips for use in
information devices and automobiles remain weak

193975,415491,CVX,Kazakhstan urges foreign investors to help economy,news,"By Sabina Zawadzki
 KOSTANAI  Kazakhstan  June 12  Reuters    Kazakhstan  an
oil producing Caspian nation hit hard by the global recession 
urged foreign companies on Friday to invest more of their
profits locally to help diversify the economy 
 The former Soviet nation has attracted more than  50
billion in foreign direct investment since it gained
independence in 1991  mainly in its oil and metals sectors 
 Addressing a meeting of foreign investors chaired by
President Nursultan Nazarbayev and EBRD President Thomas Mirow 
Economy Minister Bakhyt Sultanov said it was time for foreign
companies to look at opportunities in other sectors 
  There is a separate set of issues which we would like to
raise with investors  the reinvestment of profits made in
Kazakhstan in order to develop the service and manufacturing
sectors  small and medium sized businesses       he said 
  That would work in favour of both investors and the state
in light of increases in local content of procurement  
 Foreign investors have been worried about the state of
Kazakhstan s banking sector  which is plagued by deteriorating
asset quality and painful debt restructuring talks  as well as
a string of high profile arrests in the key uranium sector 
 Memories are also still fresh of a bitter dispute between
the government and a group of Western oil companies in
2007 2008 over the future of the Kashagan oilfield  one of the
world s biggest oil discoveries in past decades 
 Addressing investors on Friday  Sultanov vowed to do more
to improve transparency and corporate standards at Kazakh
companies to make it easier for foreigners to enter local
markets 
 U S  oil companies such as Chevron Corp  are some of
the biggest foreign investors in Kazakhstan  which now seeks to
diversify sources of financing by inviting more companies from
Europe and Russia  its biggest trading partner  analysts say 
 Central Asia s biggest economy  Kazakhstan grew rapidly on
the back of booming oil and metals prices between 2000 and 2007
but the financial crisis has ended years of double digit
growth 
 Concerns about emerging market risks have made foreign
investors more cautious about investing in markets such
Kazakhstan    a headache for the Kazakh government seeking new
ways to reinvigorate the stalling economy 
 With industrial production falling and economists expecting
the economy to slip into recession this year  Kazakhstan is
also worried about a possible rise in anti government sentiment
in a country where the state tolerates little dissent 
 Industrial production contracted by 4 6 percent
year on year in January May compared with growth of 3 8 percent
in the same period  according to figures released on Friday

 NEW YORK  June 15  Reuters    U S  stocks fell broadly on
Monday as regional manufacturing data dented optimism about the
economy s health and resource shares fell alongside commodity
prices 
 Economists had expected to see slight improvement in the
New York Fed s  Empire State  index  but the survey showed the
factory sector shrank at a more severe rate in June than the
previous month  After a series of signs the economy may be
stabilizing  investors are looking for more definitive signals
of its improving health 
  The New York manufacturing index hinted that the
improvement in economic data may be slowing down after the
rapid recovery we ve seen over the past one to three months  
said Michael Sheldon  chief market strategist at RDM Financial
in Westport  Connecticut 
 The stronger U S  dollar helped pull the price of oil below
 70 a barrel from a near eight month high  The decline hit
energy companies  shares  including Chevron  down 3 percent at
 70 50  The S P energy index slid 3 3 percent 
 The S P 500 eased off gains of about 40 percent from
March s 12 year low  but was still up about 36 percent from
that trough 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 210 25 points  or
2 39 percent  to 8 589 01  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index slid
25 74 points  or 2 72 percent  to 920 47  The Nasdaq Composite
Index gave up 53 23 points  or 2 86 percent  at 1 805 57 
 While the recent run up in commodity prices had helped
stocks extend their rally  there has also been concern that a
surge in oil and other commodities could hamper any budding
economic recovery  Higher energy costs are a drag on consumer
spending and corporate profits 
 Also dampening sentiment  Goldman Sachs cut its rating on
Wal Mart Stores Inc to  neutral  from  buy   saying it did not
see a lot of positive catalysts to drive shares higher in the
near term as expense pressures and tougher sales comparisons
persist 
 The Dow component fell 2 9 percent to  48 42  and was among
the top drags on the index  The S P s retail index fell 2 3
percent 
 Technology shares  which have been among the biggest
gainers in the three month market rally  also fell heavily as
investors took profits  The PHLX semiconductor index fell 2 2
percent  Shares of tech bellwethers  such as Qualcomm Inc  down

193977,415493,CVX,UPDATE 4 Iraq oil ministry to push ahead with deal tender,news,"  MPs summon oil minister to answer questions
   Fixed fee service contracts in question
   Oil Ministry says moving  full steam ahead 
 
  Recasts  adds details  background 
 By Waleed Ibrahim and Ahmed Rasheed
 BAGHDAD  June 16  Reuters    Iraq s oil ministry vowed on
Tuesday to auction service contracts in prized oilfields to
foreign companies at the end of June  despite the minister being
summoned by lawmakers to answer questions about the deals 
 Oil Minister Hussain al Shahristani and senior executives
from Iraq s South Oil Co  and the Iraq Drilling Company will
appear before parliament next Tuesday  said Shatha al Musawi  a
legislator with the ruling Shi ite alliance 
 The summons came after South Oil Co  head Fayad al Nema 
whose unit produces the bulk of Iraq s 2 3 2 4 million bpd of
crude  told Reuters he objected to the first round of contracts
and had urged Shahristani to cancel the bidding 
 Musawi said oil experts had described the first round of
fixed fee service contracts  due to be handed out on June 29 30 
as a waste of Iraqi money because they involved oilfields in
which Iraq had invested heavily since the 2003 U S  invasion 
  They said Iraq so far had spent around  8 billion to
rehabilitate these fields     they said it is not reasonable
after all this money and all the development undertaken that
foreign companies should take these fields and share Iraq s
production   she said 
  For this reason  parliament decided to host the oil
minister and those oil experts in a special session and to hear
from all of them  
 Nevertheless  the Petroleum Contracts and Licenses
Directorate of the Oil Ministry said it was moving  full steam
ahead  with its plans for the first round auction 
  Today  we received the green light from the cabinet to go
ahead and announce the first bidding round on schedule  without
any delay or change   Abdul Mahdy al Ameedi  the deputy director
general of the directorate  told Reuters later on Tuesday 
 Government spokesman Ali al Dabbagh said the cabinet was
committed to executing the first bidding round as scheduled 
 
  SUPER GIANTS 
 The fixed fee service contracts represent Iraq s first big
push in three decades for foreign investment in its oilfields 
which hold the world s third largest crude reserves 
 Thirty two of the world s biggest energy companies have
qualified and paid fees to take part 
 They include London listed BP and Royal Dutch Shell  U S 
firms Chevron and Exxon Mobil  Russia s Gazprom and Lukoil 
China s CNOOC  and Malaysia s state owned Petronas 
 Northern Iraq s semi autonomous Kurdish authorities have
signed development deals with around 30 private companies  but
Baghdad considers those agreements illegal 
 The first round of service contracts involve older
oilfields  most classed as  super giants  with 5 billion barrels
or more of reserves  that are already producing  Musawi said
they account for some 80 percent of current national output 
 A second round of tenders  the results of which are expected
at the end of the year  involve undeveloped oilfields 
 Musawi said the experts told parliament they did not object
to the second round of contracts for foreign oil companies  Nema
said the same in his interview with Reuters 
 The summons by parliament was not linked to separate moves
by members of parliament s oil and gas committee to quiz
Shahristani over the oil ministry s inability  to date  to
restore oil output to the level it was at before the invasion 
 Musawi said lawmakers wanted Shahristani to explain the
benefits of the first round of contracts  They also wanted a
clarification about the deals  which she said looked more like
production sharing agreements than fixed fee service contracts

193981,415497,CVX,Trading Week Outlook  Bullish Positions Becoming Harder To Justify,opinion,The bears were out in full force as we wrapped up last week  You could almost smell the fear as investors lightened exposure and bailed out of positions  and short sellers stepped up to the plate    While the selling got started midway through the week  the intensity really picked up following the April jobs report which was a major disappointment  For the month  payrolls rose by 115 000   well below the 165 000 that economists had expected  April marked the third month of decelerating job growth    In the  lies  damned lies  and statistics  category  the official unemployment rate actually dropped from 8 2  to 8 1  as the US workforce shrank for the second month  According to the BLS  342 000 people left the labor force last month  Apparently  the market saw through the government charade as the S P dropped 1 6   the Nasdaq Composite lost 2 2   and every single Dow component traded lower    With the majority of recent global economic reports showing weakness  particularly in manufacturing  employment  housing  and consumer measurements   bullish investors are finding fewer data points to support their posture    First quarter corporate earnings reports have held up as one of the last remaining bullish areas   thanks to the majority of companies beating expectations  But according to  the rate at which individual companies are beating expectations has declined steadily throughout the season  It s becoming harder to justify bullish positions as the market rolls over  and we ve been methodically adding bearish exposure to our trading book  With plenty of economic land mines still threatening investors  we re growing more confident in methodically adding more exposure while still carefully managing our risk    Below are a few of the specific opportunities that we are tracking this week    The Australian Connection   While fielding questions from a group of traders last week  I was asked about my thoughts on the US dollar  I responded by saying that the US dollar has plenty of problems   and ultimately may lose a significant amount of purchasing power   but today  the US dollar remains stable versus the other major currencies whose problems are much WORSE     My suggestion was to consider short positions in currencies that were tied directly to natural resources  as current weakness in emerging markets has the potential to shift the supply   demand balance    which in turn affects the currency of resource rich countries such as Australia and Canada    In fact  we took a short position in the Australian dollar  via AUD USD currency pair  last week as the currency resumed weakness after a brief consolidating drift    Last week  the Australian central bank cut their current economic forecast from 3 5  to 3 0   as an indirect result of weakening demand for resources  The lower expectation gives policymakers more leeway to cut interest rates   which would be a natural headwind for the aussie    Austerity measures in Europe add insult to injury as now both emerging markets AND a major portion of the developed world are running into constraints for manufacturing and building  Now that the bearish Aussie trend has been confirmed  the pair could fall a significant way before running into a legitimate support area  AUD USD  title  AUD USD  width  589  height  258  Speaking of Resources    US equities weren t the only group of securities that were under pressure last week  Oil prices took it on the chin as well  dropping well below the  100 per barrel mark for the first time in months    Spring is typically a bullish month for oil prices as traders anticipate a pickup in demand with the summer driving season  This year  the supply side of the equation is getting more attention    Oil inventories rose for the 6th straight week last week   hitting their highest levels ever for this time of year  Couple that statistic with weakening manufacturing  employment and consumer spending  and you don t need much of a catalyst for prices to start backing down    The big question now is how investors will treat the oil producers   If the commodity prices soften significantly  it will certainly cut into profit margins and lead to earnings disappointments  The political environment is already heavily weighted against these firms  and yet any contraction in production would be viewed as  price fixing    leading to more backlash    The E P  Exploration   Production  majors have been hitting key resistance areas on their charts lately   see weekly charts for Exxon Mobil  XOM   Chevron Corporation  CVX   BP P L C   BP  as examples   and a breakdown for the group would likely set up some very attractive reward to risk short opportunities  Another Technical Failure    Technology stocks have not been immune to the broad market selloff   Last month we took a look at a group of    identifying a handful of vulnerable stocks worth watching    In keeping with that overall theme  take a look at the current chart for the S P Technology Fund  XLK    If the pattern looks familiar  simply pull up a chart of Apple Corp   AAPL  and you ll see why  According to Morningstar  Apple makes up 18 31  of the ETF s holdings   and of course Apple has been showing signs of breaking down since it topped in early April    Technology stocks as a group are widely regarded as speculative positions   and while it s not fair to paint such a diverse group with such a broad brush  the truth is that as institutional investors adjust their exposure to a more bearish environment  they will be active sellers of high beta liquid stocks    The technology group is also vulnerable to reduced corporate spending as companies back off on growth initiatives until the economic picture becomes more clear  We re isolating breakdowns in this area and watching for consolidation periods to set up better reward to risk entry points    This week  traders will continue to focus on a full slate of earnings reports  the results of European elections  along with a few key inflation measures at the end of the week    Greece is the major fly in the ointment Sunday night as pro austerity parties received 32  of the vote     This makes it more challenging for current bailout deals to be pushed through  no austerity  no bailouts  and raises even more uncertainty    Overnight futures show oil near  97  US equities down another 95 basis points  and the aussie dollar hitting new lows    The trading environment still favors nimble participants   as there is still plenty of uncertainty  The bearish action gives the fed more ammunition for additional liquidity measures   so don t be surprised if the bulls try to pull that out of their hat    Overall  the picture is turning decidedly bearish and we continue to be comfortable building short exposure as equities break down  Disclosure  This content is general

193982,415498,CVX,Not All ETFs Are Alike,opinion,There s no getting around the fact that assets under management for exchanged traded products are growing  The nearly 1 460 U S  listed ETFs and ETNs had over  1 2 trillion in combined AUM at the end of April  according to data from the ETF Industry Association  That s up from  1 1 trillion a year earlier and  846 7 billion in April 2010  Selling On The FallImpressive growth to be sure  but not all ETFs are getting in on the action  In fact  some ETFs have seen rapid redemptions in the past year  Not surprisingly  some of the worst offenders in terms of redemptions are those whose performance has been less than stellar  That stands to reason as ETF redemption is akin to selling a stock  When lots of redemptions occur in a single ETF  it s equivalent to sellers outnumbering buyers in individual stocks  The result is the ETF s price comes down    Along those lines  fund flows data can be instructive  though the caveat is not always 100  accurate  For example  the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE    ranks among the top 10 ETFs for share creations over the past year  In that time  GDX has lost 21 3     When it comes to those funds seeing big redemptions since May 2011  almost all are in the red  Take a look at a few of the culprits    Market Vectors Coal Miners ETF  NYSE  KOL  Investors apparently got the memo that low natural gas prices coupled with slowing Chinese and Indian economies would not be good for KOL and its constituents  That much is highlighted by the ETF s 38 5  slide in the past year plus the fact that KOL currently rests less than  2 above its 52 week  KOL will start today with  180 4 million in AUM  In early May 2011  that number was over  581 million    iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund  NYSE  EWZ  EWZ and its Brazil ETF brethren have had their share of problems recently  Still  EWZ was the third largest emerging markets ETF overall and the largest  country specific fund  excluding funds tracking the S P 500  at the end of April    That meant EWZ had almost  8 6 billion under management  which has since fallen to  8 billion  At the end of April 2011  EWZ had more than  13 billion in AUM  That puts EWZ down 20  in the past year iShares MSCI Japan Index Fund  NYSE    There might yet prove to be value in Japanese equities  Then again  some folks have been saying that for years as the bull case has yet to materialize  We know this much  EWJ is trading lower than it was in the days immediately following last year s tsunami  EWJ is down 8 4  since May 2011  but its AUM has slid much worse on a percentage basis  At the end of April 2011  EWJ had  7 5 billion in assets  As of May 10  that number was less than  5 3 billion    iShares Silver Trust  NYSE  SLV  Less than 13 months ago SLV was flirting with  47a share  Maybe it was manipulation in the silver market  or perhaps  increased margin requirements  or a combination of both that led to silver s 2011 demise  Whatever the reason  SLV had  17 2 billion in AUM at the end of April 2011  One year later  it had less than  9 billion  as of May 10   When you see So it s not surprising the fund is down 18  in the past year when you see that type of AUM decline  Perhaps we should ask why it s not down even more   Energy Select Sector SPDR  NYSE    With the recent plunge in West Texas Intermediate  NYMEX oil futures have turned negative on the year  Oddly enough  in the past three months  equity based XLE has performed almost twice as bad as the futures based U S  Oil Fund  NYSE       Exxon Mobil  NYSE    and Chevron  NYSE    account for 34  of XLE s weight  That may or may not be a reason for XLE s AUM tumble  but tumble it has  From April 30  2011 to April 30  2012  XLE saw its AUM haul dwindle to  7 7 billion from  10 4 billion  Another  1 1 billion has been pulled from the fund since the start of May An interesting phenomenon and one that underscores the notion investors aren t satisfied with integrated oil stocks ,2012-05-11,Benzinga ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/not-all-etfs-are-alike-122926,122926

   Gazprom Neft extends offer for mid sized Sibir
   Indebted tycoon Chigirinsky  other large holders excluded
   Move by Gazprom Neft could boost output  refining
 
  Adds analyst comment  background on share issue 
 By Melissa Akin and Olga Popova
 MOSCOW  May 26  Reuters    The oil arm of Russian gas giant
Gazprom agreed a takeover offer for mid sized oil company Sibir
Energy  Sibir said on Tuesday  in the state s first big play for
the assets of indebted tycoons 
 Gazprom Neft  Russia s fifth largest oil producer  extended
its 500 pence per share offer to all outstanding shares in the
London listed company  valuing it at 1 93 billion pounds   3 07
billion  
 The offer excluded its major shareholders    indebted oil
and real estate tycoon Shalva Chigirinsky  his partner Igor
Kesayev and the City of Moscow 
 Gazprom Neft gained a foothold in Sibir  a producer of
80 000 barrels per day of Siberian crude  in a bidding war with
larger rival TNK BP  paying a 70 pence premium to the rival
offer for minority stakes and has since brought its stake to
27 5 percent 
 A successful bid to consolidate Sibir  a partner of Royal
Dutch Shell in a Siberian field  would boost crude oil output by
12 percent 
 It would give Gazprom Neft control of the 200 000 barrels
per day Moscow refinery  now shared with Sibir  and refining
capacity would rise by 25 percent 
 The expansionist oil arm of the world s largest gas producer
has voiced ambitions to match ExxonMobil and BP in oil  and has
made several small steps this year  acquiring Serbian refiner
NIS and Italian assets from Chevron 
  My feeling is that Gazprom Neft is the most aggressive
company in the oil industry right now   a source close to the
deal said 
 State controlled Gazprom has dug deep into its pockets to
make the offer  analysts said 
  The valuation was not that attractive  as according to our
calculations  ABC   C2 Reserves are priced at  1 44 per barrel
and refining capacity at  67 50 per barrel   UBS analyst Maria
Radina said 
 
 FOCUS ON SBERBANK
 Sibir said in a statement that Gazprom Neft had proposed a
cash offer for the entire company  excluding shares owned by
Bennfield Limited  Central Fuel Co  and the Bank of Moscow 
 Bennfield represents the holdings of Kesayev and
Chigirinsky  with a stake of around 47 percent that is split
between them 
 The two men were forced to put up their stakes in Sibir as
collateral with Russia s largest lender  state run Sberbank 
which helped them meet credit payments  Russian media  have
reported that Sberbank has been insisting on a change of
ownership at Sibir 
 The City of Moscow  which owns 18 percent of Sibir through
Central Fuel Co has a political interest in stable fuel supplies
from Sibir s stake in the Moscow refinery  owns 18 percent of
Sibir through Central Fuel Co  It is seen as an unlikely seller 
 Chigirinsky won a court order barring any transaction with
his Sibir shares  Russian media have reported that Kesayev has
agreed to sell his 23 3 percent to Gazprom Neft 
 Sibir is suing Chigirinsky  who abandoned his plan to build
Europe s largest skyscraper in Moscow when credit markets
slammed shut  demanding he return  400 million advanced to him
in a failed effort to sell his Russian property portfolio to
Sibir 
 Sibir  which said this week that Chigirinsky signed over 2 7
percent of the company  his Cote d Azur villa and London mansion
to cover part of the debt  said in its Tuesday statement that
the Gazprom Neft offer would also cover any further share
issues 
 Banking sources said the company had left open the option of
an additional share issue  New shares could be used to cover
obligations on share options 
 Sibir said it could not guarantee that Gazprom Neft would
not seek its delisting if it acquired 75 percent of Sibir 
 However  the source close to the deal said that Gazprom Neft
was mopping up the last of the minority holdings in the company 
  They are effectively taking the company private   the
source said 
   1  6288 Pound

   Dollar bounces off 2009 low after Asian comments
   Bonds rise after mixed data with safe haven support
   Oil falls more than 3 pct on rising crude inventories
  Adds close of U S  markets 
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  June 3  Reuters    Weak U S  economic data and an
unexpected rise in crude oil inventories on Wednesday dashed
hopes that the economy had truly turned the corner  knocking
down equities  oil and commodities prices while lifting the
U S  dollar 
 The news rekindled demand for the dollar as a safe haven
and prompted profit taking in other currencies 
 The Australian dollar fell more than 3 percent and the New
Zealand dollar slid more than 4 percent as investors took
flight from higher yielding  commodity linked currencies 
 The Reuters Jefferies CRB index   a global
commodities benchmark  fell 2 8 percent as the dollar snapped
back from a year low versus the euro that was set earlier in
the day 
 Gold futures posted their biggest one day percentage drop
in almost two months  ending about 2 percent lower  as the
dollar rally and tumbling oil triggered heavy profit taking 
 Data showing the vast U S  service sector contracted for an
eighth straight month in May and a report showing employers
axed 532 000 private sector jobs last month soured investors 
 In another report  total U S  fuel demand over the four
weeks ending May 29 fell by 7 7 percent against year ago
levels  the U S  Energy Information Administration said 
 The news signaled a prolonged recovery that would delay the
pick up in business and consumer spending that is needed to
restore corporate earnings 
  The data just reminds people that the economy is still
losing jobs and economic growth is slow   said Giri Cherukuri 
head trader at OakBrook Investments LLC  which oversees  1 3
billion in Lisle  Illinois 
 U S  stocks snapped a four day winning streak  led lower by
sliding oil and energy related shares  DuPont Co  fell

193990,415506,CVX,IPO Look  Whiting USA Trust II,opinion,Based in Austin  Texas  Whiting USA Trust II  proposed WHZ  scheduled a  320 million IPO with a market capitalization of  368 million at a price range mid point of  20 for Friday  March 23  2012 WHZ is one of six IPOs scheduled for this week    Nine more on deck for the week of March 26 SUMMARY Whiting USA Trust II was formed by Whiting Petroleum Corporation to own a term net profits interest in certain long lived  predominantly producing properties located primarily in the Rocky Mountains  Permian Basin  Gulf Coast and Mid Continent regions of the United States    The parent Whiting Petroleum  WLL  has a market capitalization of  6 7 billion    You can see the organization  WHZ has an interest in a declining asset    NEGATIVE CONSIDERATIONSBecause payments to the trust will be generated by depleting assets and the trust has a finite life with the production from the underlying properties diminishing over time  a portion of each distribution will represent a return of the original investment  and the  return  amount is not clearly specified in the S 1  Based on the reserve report  production attributable to the underlying properties is expected to decline at an average year over year rate of approximately 8 4  between 2012 and 2021 Furthermore  the trust is precluded from acquiring other oil and natural gas properties or net profits interests to replace the depleting assets and production Also Based on the reserve report  the total estimated proved reserves attributable to the net profits interest had a pre tax PV10  value of  323 6 million as of December 31  2011  but the proposed market capitalization of WHZ is  368 million But maybe there is a  bonus  there  However  because the term of the trust continues until the later of December 31  2021  or the time when the terminal production amount has been produced and sold  trust unitholders will have the right to participate in additional proceeds attributable to the underlying properties in excess of 10 61 MMBOE in the event such amount is produced and sold prior to December 31  2021  RECOMMENDATIONThe initial projected return for 2012 is  4 02 per unit  or 20  payout in the first year However  part of the payout is return of capital  and that amount is not clearly specified in the filing Because of the above considerations we would pass on the WHZ IPO FORMATIONWhiting USA Trust II was formed in December 2011 by Whiting Petroleum Corporation to own a term net profits interest in certain long lived  predominantly producing properties located primarily in the Rocky Mountains  Permian Basin  Gulf Coast and Mid Continent regions of the United States  The net profits interest will entitle the trust to receive 90  of the net proceeds  calculated as described below  from Whiting s interests in the underlying properties after the effective date of the conveyance of the net profits interest to the trust  The trust will make quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its quarterly cash receipts of net proceeds attributable to the trust  after deduction of fees and expenses for administration of the trust  to holders of its trust units during the term of the net profits interest  TERMINATIONThe net profits interest will terminate on the later to occur of  1  December 31  2021  or  2  the time when 11 79 MMBOE have been produced from the underlying properties and sold  which is the equivalent of 10 61 MMBOE in respect of the trust s right to receive 90  of the net proceeds from such reserves pursuant to the net profits interest   subject to certain specified exceptions As of December 31  2011  the estimated proved reserves attributable to the underlying properties for the full economic life of the underlying properties  as estimated in the reserve report  were 18 28 MMBOE with a pre tax PV10  value of  408 5 million  For an explanation of pre tax PV10  value and a comparison of pre tax PV10  value to the standardized measure of oil and gas  please read    Major producing areas  beginning 1 Based on the reserve report  the net profits interest would entitle the trust to receive net proceeds from the sale of production of an estimated 10 61 MMBOE of proved reserves during the term of the net profits interest  calculated as 90  of the proved reserves attributable to the underlying properties expected to be produced during the term of the net profits interest  Based on the reserve report  the total estimated proved reserves attributable to the net profits interest had a pre tax PV10  value of  323 6 million as of December 31  2011  The exact rate of production attributable to the underlying properties cannot be predicted  However  because the term of the trust continues until the later of December 31  2021  or the time when the terminal production amount has been produced and sold  trust unitholders will have the right to participate in additional proceeds attributable to the underlying properties in excess of 10 61 MMBOE in the event such amount is produced and sold prior to December 31  2021  As of December 31  2011 and assuming its continued ownership of the underlying properties  the total estimated proved reserves attributable to Whiting s remaining interest in the underlying properties at the termination of the net profits interest  as estimated in the reserve report  are expected to be 6 49 MMBOE  or approximately 35 5  of total estimated proved reserves attributable to the underlying properties UNDERLYING PROPERTIESThe underlying properties include interests in 1 300 gross  390 3 net  producing wells located in 49 predominantly mature fields with established production profiles in 10 states  As of December 31  2011  approximately 96 4  of estimated proved reserves attributable to the underlying properties during the estimated term of the net profits interest were classified as proved developed producing reserves  2 3  were classified as proved developed non producing reserves and 1 3  were classified as proved undeveloped reserves  For the three months ended December 31  2011  the average daily net production from the underlying properties was approximately 4 988 BOE d  or 4 489 BOE d attributable to the net profits interest  and was comprised of approximately 72  oil  25  natural gas and 3  natural gas liquids  Based on the reserve report  production attributable to the underlying properties is expected to decline at an average year over year rate of approximately 8 4  between 2012 and 2021  assuming no additional development drilling or other development expenditures are made on the underlying properties after 2014  Whiting operates approximately 59  and 56  of the estimated proved reserve volumes and pre tax PV10  value  respectively  of these properties based on the reserve report Whiting believes that its retained interest in the underlying properties  which entitles it to 10  of the net proceeds from the sale of production attributable to the underlying properties during the term of the net profits interest and all of the net proceeds thereafter  together with its ownership of trust units  if any  will provide incentive for it to operate  or cause to be operated  the underlying properties in an efficient and cost effective manner  In addition  Whiting has agreed to operate the properties for which it is the operator as a reasonably prudent operator in the same manner that it would operate if these properties were not burdened by the net profits interest  Furthermore  for those properties that it is not the operator  Whiting has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the operator to operate the property in the same manner  however  Whiting s ability to cause other operators to take certain actions is limited  Please see  Risk factors   Whiting has limited control over activities on the underlying properties that Whiting does not operate  which could reduce production from the underlying properties  increase capital expenditures and reduce cash available for distribution to trust unitholders   MARKETING   SALESWhiting principally sells its oil and natural gas production to end users  marketers and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline facilities  In areas where there is no practical access to pipelines  oil is trucked to storage facilities  Whiting s marketing of oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond its control  the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted  During 2009  sales to Chevron USA  CVX   ConocoPhillips  COP   Plains Marketing LP and Marathon Oil  MRO  Corporation accounted for 13   13   11  and 11   respectively  of total oil and natural gas sales related to the underlying properties  During 2010  sales to Plains Marketing LP  Chevron USA  ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil Corporation accounted for 14   13   13   and 11   respectively  of total oil and natural gas sales related to the underlying properties  During 2011  sales to Plains Marketing LP  Chevron USA  ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil Corporation accounted for 16   14   13  and 11   respectively  of total oil and gas sales related to the underlying properties  Whiting believes that the loss of any of the 10  customers does not present a material risk because there is significant competition among purchasers of crude oil and natural gas in the areas of the underlying properties and  if Whiting were to lose any of their largest purchasers  several entities could purchase crude oil and natural gas produced from the underlying properties with little or no interruption SELLING TRUST UNITHOLDERPrior to the closing of this offering  Whiting Petroleum Corporation s wholly owned subsidiary  Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation  will convey the net profits interest to the trust in consideration for the issuance by the trust of 18 400 000 units  which will be distributed as a dividend to Whiting Petroleum Corporation  Of those trust units  16 000 000 are being offered hereby and 2 400 000 will be subject to purchase by the underwriters pursuant to its over allotment option  Whiting may from time to time sell any trust units it has retained  Whiting has agreed  however  not to sell any of such trust units for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus without the consent of Raymond James   Associates  Inc  and Morgan Stanley   Co  LLC acting as representatives of the several underwriters  See  Underwriting  USE OF PROCEEDSPrior to the closing of this offering  Whiting Petroleum Corporation s wholly owned subsidiary  Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation  will convey the term net profits interest to the trust in consideration for the issuance by the trust of 18 400 000 trust units  which will be distributed as a dividend to Whiting Petroleum Corporation  Whiting will pay underwriting discounts  the structuring fee and estimated expenses of approximately  23 2 million  assuming the underwriters do not exercise their over allotment option and an assumed initial public offering price of  20 00 per trust unit  associated with this offering and will receive all net proceeds from the offering  The estimated net proceeds to Whiting  assuming an initial public offering price of  20 00 per trust unit  will be approximately  296 8 million  and will increase to approximately  341 6 million if the underwriters exercise their over allotment option in full  Whiting intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the debt outstanding under its credit agreement  Borrowings under its credit agreement had a weighted average interest rate of 2 4  as of December 31  2011 and mature in April 2016  Affiliates of Raymond James   Associates  Inc   Morgan

193991,415507,CVX,Comparing And Modeling Chesapeake Energy And Chevron Prices,opinion,It is difficult to deny that there exist general feelings of oil as a driver of economic growth  My own experience shows that any visible market analyst does not miss any opportunity to comment of changing oil price  An intriguing thing about these comments is that any big change in oil price is perceived as a danger for real economic growth  independent on the change sign  Skipping the question of oil influence on the entire economy  we would like to address the question of the driving forces behind the prices of energy companies  The pricing power of companies associated with Energy category of the S P 500 list  we focus on this list in our articles  is of interest for many investors  Here we compare the price evolution of Chesapeake Energy  NYSE  CHK  and Chevron  NYSE  CVX  In our previous post we presented a pricing model for Halliburton  NYSE  HAL   Also we have been routinely reporting on similar models for ConocoPhillips  COP  and ExxonMobil  XOM   All these models were based on our general concept that the evolution of a share price can be  quantitatively  decomposed in a weighted sum  or difference  of two CPI PPI components  This concept was elaborated in a series of papers three years ago starting with the one predicting share prices for a COP and XOM since the early 1990s For Halliburton  we have exercised several models  The most basic model included the core and headline CPIs  where the core CPI  CC  was a proxy to an energy independent  dynamic  price reference and the headline CPI  C  played the role of energy price  which supposedly  moves the prices of energy companies  Therefore  we assumed that the difference between these two CPIs might express the energy pricing power relative to all other goods and services As an alternative  we have tested two more pricing models for Halliburton with the core CPI the consumer price index of energy  E  and the producer price index of crude petroleum  OIL  together with the overall PPI  We have found that the best model for HAL includes CC and E with the standard model error of  3 55 between July 2003 and February 2012 For this article  we have estimated three different models for share prices of two energy companies  Chesapeake and Chevron between July 2003 and February 2012 Figure 1 compares the evolution of actual monthly closing prices since 2003  The upper panel demonstrates that Chevron has a much better performance since 2009 and is currently at its historical peak   100  Chesapeake Energy has been fluctuating around  20  In the lower panel  we have displayed these prices as normalized to their respective peak values since July 2003  Chesapeake is now only at 34  of its peak in 2007  One might suggest that the difference in the overall behavior should be rooted in the driving forces behind these prices and thus can be caught in our models by the difference in defining CPIs All three studied models allow for different coefficients for defining CPIs  time lags and linear trend  The latter is an obvious component since we expect all share prices to rise with real economic growth All three models are shown below with the standard errors estimated for the same period in Table 1 CHK t   3 68C t    1 82CC t 1    9 45 t 2000    185 01CVX t   2 07C t    3 96CC t 12    13 74 t 2000   208 52 CHK t   172CC t 6    0 39E t    9 89 t 2000   235 34CVX t    2 65CC t 12    0 25E t    15 96 t 2000    277 77CHK t   1 11PPI t    0 026OIL t 12    6 75 t 2000    50 18CVX t   1 18PPI t    0 044OIL t 7    0 36 t 2000    138 25Table 1  Standard model errorsFigures 2 through 4 depict the observed and predicted prices for the three models  Table 1 implies  the lowermost standard model errors are highlighted  that the best CHK model is associated with the consumer price of energy and the core CPI  On the other hand  the price of CVX share is likely driven by the producer prices and  specifically  the price of oil  Therefore  the shares of energy companies not only demonstrate various time histories but are likely related to different goods and products  The investor could foresee the evolution of both prices if to project the defining CPIs and PPIs For CVX  the current price is at the expected level and any rise in oil price will likely reduce the price seven months later The current price level of CHK is slightly undervalued  We will be reporting on both companies and expect an interesting comparison with oil price fluctuating in a wide range Figure 1  Relative performance of CHK and CVX  The upper panel shows actual prices and the lower one   the prices normalized to their respective peak values since 2003 Figure 2 The observed CHK and CVX prices and those predicted from the core and headline CPI  Figure 3 The observed CHK and CVX price and those predicted from the energy index  E and the core CPI  Figure 4 The observed CHK and CVX prices and those

193993,415509,CVX,BP  Major  Undervalued  High Dividend Yield Oil Stock,opinion,Are there any  bargain basement  high dividend stocks with strong financials  undervalued earnings growth  and future dividend growth  Surprisingly  British Petroleum   BP   an energy stock that many investors dumped after its Gulf oil spill debacle  looks like one of the best stocks to buy once again  for these attributes Investors have been shunning Big Oil stocks for the past year  so this sub industry group as a whole is down a bit over  1   However  unlike two of its larger peers  Chevron   CVX   and Exxon   XOM   BP has actually been getting support from institutional buyers in the past few months  Technically speaking  BP is also in the upper region of oversold territory  with its RSI of 35 14 A lot of this new support has to do with BP s improving earnings and low valuations   BP has logged strong EPS growth in its most recent fiscal year  and recent quarter  Surprisingly  BP s sales growth over the past 5 years topped both Exxon and Chevron  and was just above industry averages   Although BP is only projected to grow 6 36  in its next fiscal year  its very low P E gives it an enticing PEG ratio Dividends  After the 2010 Gulf spill  BP needed to eliminate its   84 quarterly dividend payout for the balance of 2010  but then reinstated in 2011  at 50  less     42 quarter   In 2012  BP has been able to increase its quarterly dividends  for the first time since the spill  raising them over 14   to   48 share  BP has been a cash machine for a long time  and as it works through the Gulf settlement payouts  its cash flow will only get even better BP foresees future dividend increases  as it stated earlier in 2012 With operating cash flow generated by BP in 2011 reaching some  22bn   over 60  higher than in 2010   CEO Bob Dudley confirmed the company s expectation that net cash flow in 2014  in a  100 oil price environment  would be around 50  higher than in 2011  Half of the additional cash is expected to be used for re investment and half for other purposes including increased shareholder distributions  2012 will be a year of increasing investment and milestones as we build on the foundations laid last year  As we move through 2013 and 2014  we expect financial momentum will build as we complete payments into the Gulf of Mexico Trust Fund  restore high value production and bring new projects on stream   Source  BP website BP s dividend yield is now above those of CVX and Exxon  and is also above industry averages Covered Calls  Many income investors have begun selling covered call options in order to increase their income from dividend paying stocks  This options trading strategy is an easy way to double  or even quadruple your dividends  depending on the stock If you already own the stock  you can then sell 1 call option contract for each 100 shares that you own   One option contract corresponds to 100 shares of the underlying stock  If you don t own the stock  here s the sequence for selling covered calls on dividend stocks 1  Buy the stock  in 100 share lots   example  buy 200 or 300  instead of 250 shares 2  Sell 1 call option contract for each 100 shares that you own  at a strike price above the stock s current share price  The further above the share price you sell  the less premium you ll receive  The further out in time you sell  the more premium you ll receive  which will lower your break even  You receive this option   within 3 days of selling  often even the same day 3  Collect whatever quarterly dividends are due  as they pass their ex dividend dates 4  At expiration time  if the stock has risen above the strike price  your shares will be sold at the strike price  and you ll also pocket the difference between the strike price and your cost per share   If the stock isn t above the strike price then  the call option will expire  leaving you with the initial call premium   that you received  plus your dividends  as your profit These BP Oct  2012 call options pay nearly 3 times the amount of BP s 2 quarterly dividends during this 7 month period  This  45 Oct  2012 call option also holds a potential assigned yield of 2 66  annualized     65 share  the difference between the  45 strike price and BP s  44 35 share price    The catch is that your BP shares will be sold assigned at or near expiration time  if BP rises above the  45 strike price Cash Secured Puts  If you re still wary of BP s gulf spill headline exposure  an alternative options trading strategy would be to sell cash secured put options  and literally  get paid now to wait  The BP OCT   44 00 put option  which is below BP s share price  would pay you  3 65  share    365 per option contract   This gives you a lower break even price  of  40 35 High Options Yields  This put option pays out 3 8 times what BP s dividends pay over the next 7 months  In addition  you ll receive your options premium   within 3 days of making the trade  often even the same day  so you ll have the use of this   now  instead of waiting for the quarterly dividends  Note  Put sellers don t receive dividends  If BP is below  44 00 at or near the Oct  expiration  you ll be sold assigned 100 shares of BP  for every put contract that you sold However  your net cost will only be  40 35    44 strike price  minus the  3 65 put bid premium you received when you sold the put  Financials  While they aren t quite as impressive as some of Chevron s and Exxon s figures  BP s financial metrics are all above industry averages  with the exception of its operating margin  Although BP s Debt Equity ratio is higher than CVX and XOM  BP has a very high Interest Coverage figure of 31 8 Disclosure  Author is long shares of BP and XOM  and is short BP put options

   Crude oil prices fall to lowest level in four years
  Adds close of European markets 
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  Dec 5  Reuters    U S  and European stocks fell
on Friday after steep losses in the U S  labor market sent bond
prices higher in Europe and pushed the price of crude below  41
a barrel as the outlook for the global economy darkened 
 Investors in Europe dumped stocks and dove into less risky
fixed income securities  pushing a pan European stock index
down 4 percent  as investors reeled from data showing 533 000
Americans lost jobs in November  the biggest drop in 34 years 
 Oil prices slid more than 5 percent to a four year low
while the dollar climbed against European currencies and the
yen rallied on another flight to quality in the face of a U S 
recession that looms as the deepest since 1981 
  Just when you thought that the U S  economic outlook
couldn t get any uglier  it goes ahead and does   said Meny
Grauman  an economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto 
 Stocks sold off broadly as investors feared the job losses
will cause consumers to cut back spending and sharply reduce
corporate earnings 
 The energy sector was the biggest casualty on both sides of
the Atlantic  Exxon Mobil  fell 3 8 percent and Chevron
 dropped 2 4 percent  the Nos 1 and 3 drags on the Dow 
Total  slumped 8 9 percent and BP  6 6 percent 
the biggest drags on the pan European FTSEurofirst 300 index 
 Banks also were among the biggest drags in Europe  with BNP
Paribas  falling 7 5 percent and Credit Suisse
 dropping 5 5 percent 
  When you see such a shocking employment number  you
realize the devastating effect that can have on household
demand   said Henk Potts  equity strategist at Barclays
Stockbrokers in London 
 In early afternoon New York trade  the Dow Jones industrial
average  was down 88 01 points  or 1 05 percent  at

 was down 7 36 points  or 0 51 percent  at 1 438 20 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300  index closed
down 4 percent at 793 94 points  and has lost about half its
value so far this year 
 Euro zone government bond futures rose  pushing the 10 year
 cash yield below 3 percent and near Thursday s
trough of 2 939 percent  the lowest in over 30 years 
 The U S  unemployment rate rose to 6 7 percent in November
   dramatic news that would normally touch off a flurry of
safe haven buying of debt 
 But with 10 year euro zone and U S  yields    which move in
the opposite direction to their prices    near historic lows 
analysts said the near term risk was for market momentum to run
out of steam  as a fall in U S  bonds would suggest 
 Investors are reluctant to buy U S  government debt with
yields hovering off their the lowest level in over 50 years 
 The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note  fell
11 32 in price to yield 2 59 percent  The 2 year U S  Treasury
note  was off 4 32 to yield 0 87 percent 
  We re already at  yield  levels we ve never seen before 
It s just difficult to continue buying Treasuries at these
prices   said Kim Rupert  managing director of global fixed
income analysis at Action Economics in San Francisco 
 November s job losses were the steepest since December
1974  when 602 000 jobs were shed  Labor Department data
showed  and were much worse than forecast by analysts polled by
Reuters who had predicted a reduction of 340 000 jobs

 U S  light sweet crude oil  fell  1 96 to  41 71 a

significant decline in oil demand in developed economies

  Adds close of U S  markets 
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  Dec 18  Reuters    Fears of a worsening U S 
economy drove yields on long dated government bonds to fresh
50 year lows and led Standard   Poor s on Thursday to warn that
it could cut General Electric s top credit rating  pushing Wall
Street sharply lower 
 Signs of economic duress were visible throughout financial
markets  with U S  crude prices dropping more than 9 percent to
 36 a barrel and investors accelerating a safe haven scramble
into the relative safety of government securities 
 Oil s slide overshadowed an agreement on a record output
cut on Wednesday by members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries  while the International Energy Agency said
the market s fixation on falling demand was unlikely to end
soon 
  The price is not going higher because the market has
expected the  OPEC cut  number   the IEA s Executive Director
Nobuo Tanaka told Reuters   The global economy is getting
worse  so the market is responding to this  
 The U S  dollar  in response to speculation the Japanese
government may intervene to halt a recent sharp advance by the
yen  posted its biggest one day rise against the yen in more
than a month 
 U S  stocks turned sharply lower after Standard   Poor s
said there is at least a 1 in 3 chance it could strip GE s AAA
credit rating in the next two years if the American icon s
earnings and cash flow decline enough to warrant a downgrade 
 General Electric  shares tumbled 8 2 percent 
 The biggest drags on the Dow for the second consecutive
session were Exxon Mobil  and Chevron Corp   with
both falling about 5 percent 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  closed down 219 35

Nasdaq Composite Index  slipped 26 94 points  or 1 71
percent  at 1 552 37 
 The yen came off its highest level in more than 13 years
after Japanese authorities stepped up their rhetoric against a
stronger currency  which is hurting the nation s exporters 
 The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies  with
the U S  Dollar Index  up 1 75 percent at 79 95  Against
the yen  the dollar  rose 2 49 percent to 89 48 
 The euro  fell 1 32 percent at  1 4211 
 U S  bonds rallied for a third straight session  Longer
maturities yields have shed half a percentage point since the
Federal Reserve on Tuesday cut its benchmark interest rate
target to near zero percent in an attempt to end a yearlong
recession 
 The yield on the benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note
 fell as low as 2 04 percent  the lowest since the
early 1950s  while the 30 year Treasury  fell to a
record low of 2 52 percent 
 In Europe  a rally in defensive sectors  such as utilities
and telecoms  helped limit losses in European equities 
 Carrefour   the world s second biggest retailer 
sank 7 0 percent after warning it expects only slight growth in
2008 compared with previous guidance of about 7 percent 
 The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares

  There is more financial debris to come out of the
financial sector when fourth quarter results come through  
said Kevin Gardiner  head of Global Equity Strategy at HSBC

  And the near term economic data is going to remain pretty
poor for quite a while  so we can t rule out new lows for
stocks  but we re optimistic that we won t probably see them

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK  Feb 12  Reuters    Widespread fears that U S 
efforts to revive the economy and stabilize banks may prove
insufficient drove investors into safe havens like gold and
bonds on Thursday  and pushed world stock markets lower 
 More bleak economic data from Asia and Europe that pointed
to deflation in Japan and record plunges in industrial
production in the euro zone added to market unease sparked by
the lack of details in U S  rescue plans announced on Tuesday 
 Concerns over the health of the global economy dragged U S 
oil futures to a three week low below  35 a barrel and cut
two year yields on euro zone government debt to their lowest
since the euro began circulating in 1999 
 Safe haven buying marked trading across all asset classes 
lifting the dollar higher against most currencies and pushing
gold prices to new highs in Britain and India  A slide in
equity markets also was a catalyst in the flight to safety 
  Risk aversion has returned to the market with full force  
said Ole Hansen  senior manager with Saxo Bank in Copenhagen 
 That makes people seek out safe havens  which is reflected not
only in the inflows into gold but also the bonds market  
 Gold priced in sterling  and gold futures in India
 hit all time highs  adding to record highs on Wednesday
for bullion in euro  Canadian dollar and Swiss franc terms 
 Sliding stock prices have helped bolster gold as investors
move out of equities  a risky asset class  in favour of
bullion  Hansen said 
 Before 1 p m   the Dow Jones industrial average  was
down 115 09 points  or 1 45 percent  at 7 824 44  The Standard
  Poor s 500 Index  was down 10 78 points  or 1 29
percent  at 822 96  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down
4 40 points  or 0 29 percent  at 1 526 10 
 Uncertainty about the economy fueled selling across a broad
range of sectors in U S  equity markets  including energy 
which buckled as crude oil prices slid 
 Chevron  declined almost 2 percent while Exxon Mobil
 pared losses  down just 0 7 percent 
 Sales at U S  retailers rebounded in January  government
data showed  likely boosted by post holiday discounts  But
economists said retail data are volatile and should not be
taken as a sign that the decline in sales has bottomed 
 U S  jobless claims data also showed no signs of relief 
  No one believes the retail sales data and everyone fears
the trend of initial jobless claims will just continue to rise
and rise and put more and more pressure on the psyche of
consumers  which is already pretty fragile   said Jeffrey
Kleintop  chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston 
 Financial shares also dragged on the broader market  The
KBW Bank index  fell almost 6 percent due to persistent
worry about a lack of clarity over how the Obama administration
will cleanse troubled assets from banks  books 
 In Europe banks also were hit by doubts about the U S 
government s plan to rescue the financial system 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300 index  ended down
1 5 percent at 791 69 points 
 BNP Paribas  lost 5 5 percent and UBS 
fell 3 8 percent 
 Capgemini  topped the losers  Europe s largest
computer consultancy sank 9 1 percent after warning the global
economic slump would eat into sales and margins in the first
half of this year 
 U S  Treasury debt prices were bolstered as investors
fretted over government rescue plans for the financial
industry  But gains were limited and prices lost ground 
especially the 30 year long bonds  following weak demand at an
auction of the securities 
  The safe haven  bid  for Treasuries continues to exist  
said Mary Ann Hurley  vice president of fixed income trading at
D A  Davidson   Co in Seattle  But  she said  supply is a huge
thing  there is absolutely no way of getting around it  
 The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note  was
down 1 32 in price to yield 2 80 percent  The 2 year U S 
Treasury note  was slightly up in price to yield 0 91
percent

the yen  the dollar  gained 0 18 percent at 90 59 
 The euro  fell 0 57 percent at  1 2822 
 Oil losses come on the heels of a U S  government report on
Wednesday that showed a seventh straight weekly increase in
nationwide crude inventories  U S  light sweet crude oil 
fell 58 cents to  35 36 a barrel 
 Spot gold prices  rose  8 75 to  946 90 an ounce

194000,415516,CVX,FACTBOX Issues to be raised on Clinton s Asia trip,news,"Feb 16  Reuters    Hillary Clinton will visit Japan 
Indonesia  South Korea and China this week on her first foreign
trip as U S  secretary of state  She arrives in Tokyo on
Monday  Here are some issues likely to be raised 
 JAPAN
   Strategic reassurance  Japan would like reassurance that
it remains Washington s closest ally in Asia  amid pressure for
Tokyo to take a bigger global role 
   Security  Prime Minister Taro Aso s popularity is
sinking  and the opposition is able to stall bills in
parliament  so Tokyo would prefer not to face tough demands for
contributions to security efforts  including in Afghanistan 
that could turn off voters 
   Trade  Japan wants assurances the United States is not
turning protectionist 
   Japanese abductees in North Korea  Tokyo felt the Bush
administration s removal of North Korea from its list of state
terrorism sponsors last year eased pressure on Pyongyang to
settle the issue of Japanese citizens abducted decades ago 
Clinton said on her way to Japan that she planned to press
North Korea to account for the abducted Japanese 
        
 SOUTH KOREA
   North Korea  Clinton has offered North Korea normal
relations  a peace treaty and energy and economic assistance 
but made clear it would have to abandon its nuclear programmes
first  Pyongyang  which may be preparing to test fire its
longest range missile  has not commented on the offer  It has
recently threatened to reduce South Korea to ashes  The South
has pledged in response to uphold hard line policies against
the North  Amid the North s rhetoric  Clinton will likely
discuss how to revive six country talks meant to lead to
Pyongyang s nuclear disarmament 
   Trade  Seoul has also expressed concerns about U S 
protectionism  Lawmakers in the ruling Grand National Party say
a South Korea U S  free trade pact now pending in parliament
may not be ratified until April  The Obama administration has
expressed reservations about the pact  and said the provisions
on autos need to be revised 
   Command control  In April 2012  the United States will
hand South Korea operational control of its own troops in times
of war  ending a legacy of the Korean War  Clinton could
discuss preparations for the handover and plans for the
alliance 
   Afghanistan  Washington has approached Seoul informally
about contributing troops to Afghan operations  There seems to
be little appetite for such a mission in South Korea 
        
 CHINA
   Security  The United States and China will later this
month resume military to military talks that Beijing suspended
last year after U S  arms sales to Taiwan  China regards
self ruled Taiwan as a renegade province that it has vowed to
recover  by force if necessary  The United States switched
diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979  but
remains Taiwan s biggest ally and arms supplier 
   North Korea  Clinton will likely discuss six party talks
on North Korea s nuclear disarmament with Beijing  Washington
has has largely relied on China in recent years to pressure the
North over its weapons programs  But China  host of the
six party talks  will also seek reassurances it will not be
sidelined in any bilateral talks Washington holds with
Pyongyang 
   Trade and protectionism  The United States buys more
Chinese exports than any other country  and China is the
largest holder of U S  treasury bonds  Clinton could discuss
China s concerns about U S  protectionism and Beijing s role in
restructuring the global financial system 
   The yuan  Obama has already urged China to continue
appreciating the yuan  which the United States sees as
undervalued  China has halted the appreciation in recent
months  Beijing also criticised U S  Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner last month after he said Obama believed China was
 manipulating  its currency and would push for changes 
   Human rights  Clinton has said she would not be shying
away from talking about human rights issues but has noted there
is a  very broad agenda  in the relationship with China  Last
year Clinton urged then President Bush to boycott the opening
ceremony of the Olympics unless China improved human rights 
China says it protects human rights  but critics say it
tortures and jails dissidents and suppresses ethnic minorities 
   Climate change  Clinton is expected to lay the groundwork
to work with China on climate change  She said last week that
collaboration on  clean  energy offered a way to strengthen
ties with China  saying she would visit a  clean  thermal plant
while in Beijing that was built with U S  and Chinese
technology 
        
 INDONESIA
   Stability  President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono will
showcase the country s stability  Jakarta is also eager to
highlight how the world s most populous Muslim nation has
remained predominantly moderate 
   Trade  The United States is Indonesia s second biggest
export destination after Japan  but Jakarta is concerned over a
slide in exports of commodities such as palm oil  rubber and
nickel to developed economies  A number of major U S  resource
firms such as Newmont and Chevron also operate in Indonesia and
Jakarta wants to attract more investment 
   Security  Jakarta and Washington have cooperated in the
fight against Islamic militants  but Indonesia also wants to
modernise its poorly equipped military 
   Indonesia wants a bigger role in world affairs  notably
in the Middle East  It has friendly ties with countries such as
North Korea and Iran  and has previously sought ways to mediate
in disputes  It may look to leverage off this

194001,415517,CVX,UPDATE 3 Angola plans energy projects  Portugal investment,news,"  Angola eyes higher stakes in Portuguese firms
   2008 oil revenues soar 53 percent
   Sonangol delays listing owing to global crisis
 
 Adds buying 29 9 percent of Millennium Angola paras 11 12 
 By Henrique Almeida
 LUANDA  Feb 25  Reuters    Low oil prices will not affect
producer Angola s resolve to carry out multi billion dollar
investments at home and raise stakes in Portuguese firms  the
head of state owned firm Sonangol said on Wednesday 
  We are used to price volatility in the oil market and
remain committed to our long term investments   Manuel Vicente
told reporters 
 Sonangol plans to build a new  8 billion oil refinery in
Lobito and another plant in Soyo to help satisfy growing demand
for gasoline in an economy that has been growing in double
digits since the end of a civil war in 2002 
 Its only existing 65 000 barrels per day  bpd  refinery in
Luanda is also being revamped to increase production to 100 00
barrels per day  
 Vicente said Sonangol was also committed to building
Angola s first liquefied natural gas plant at a cost of  4
billion 
 Oil producers are struggling to deal with a drop of over
 100 per barrel for oil since July  OPEC member Angola has
joined in the group s output cuts aimed at putting an end to
falling prices 
 Vicente said Angola should produce 1 656 million barrels of
oil per day in 2009  down from a high of two million barrels
last year 
 Angola  which rivals Nigeria as sub Saharan Africa s biggest
oil producer and is also the acting president of OPEC  had seen
its 2008 revenues rise 53 percent from the previous year to
 26 6 billion  
 Sonangol s net profit rose 30 percent to  2 9 billion last
year 
 The state run company s war chest of  4 to  5 billion to
invest at home and abroad this year means it can increase its 10
percent stake in Portugal s largest listed bank  Millennium bcp
  
  If necessary  we will increase  our stake   It is in times
of crisis that one can grow   Vicente said  Millennium bcp 
announced late on Wednesday that Sonangol had bought 29 9
percent of its subsidiary in Angola 
 Millennium bcp closed up 1 17 percent on Wednesday at 0 60
euros  Vicente said Sonangol was planning to set up an office in
Lisbon to also carry out new investments in the real estate
sector in Portugal 
 
 NO LISTING
 Harder times will however delay plans for Sonangol to enter
the stock market and a busy political calendar in 2009 should
put off plans to hold a round of bidding for new oil block
concessions in Angola  Vicente said 
  The financial crisis requires that we re think these
plans   said Vicente   We have recently witnessed giants fall
like sheets of paper 
 Analysts said the Luanda stock market was unlikely to open
in 2009 because of Sonangol s decision not to float its shares
in the market  Sonangol is Angola s biggest company 
 Vicente signalled that bidding for offshore oil blocks 
which was suspended before parliamentary elections in 2008 
should remain on hold until presidential elections in the second
half of the year 
  In an industry like ours  a government that is ending its
mandate cannot hand out new concessions  It isn t cordial to do
so   he said 
 Chevron  Exxon Mobil Corp  and Total have all said they were
interested in expanding their exploration and production
activities in Angola    each already pump over 500 000 barrels
of oil per day from Angola s offshore reserves

 NEW YORK  Oct 6  Reuters    Fear gripped investors around
the world on Monday  causing them to dump stocks and snap up
safe havens after European leaders were seen doing too little
too late to stem a spreading financial crisis that threatens
global growth 
 European shares posted their worst day on record and the
Dow slipped below 10 000 points for the first time since
October 2004 as markets reeled on credit jitters and fears of
the fallout from a potential global recession  following the
emergency rescue of two big European banks and a move by
several European governments to guarantee bank deposits 
 Stocks slumped throughout Asia and Latin America  with
trading halted on both the Brazilian and Russian markets
because of steep plunges in stock prices 
  People have decided that markets have no ability to repair
themselves and politicians have control of this process   said
John Haynes  strategist at Rensburg Sheppard Investment
Management in London   The buyers have stepped away  and the
sellers are still there  
 Contagion from the credit crisis spread in Europe  gumming
up interbank money markets as banks remained reluctant to lend
to each other and investors fled to the safety of bonds 
 Euro zone government debt prices shot to 6 1 2 month highs
and U S  Treasuries surged amid mounting worries about the
impact of the world s deepest financial crisis in 80 years 
 Fears of a global slowdown hammered prices for industrial
metals  with benchmark copper tumbling almost 8 percent  and
aluminum and zinc prices falling by almost 5 percent 
 Crude oil prices fell below  90 a barrel to an eight month
low on fears of a global slowdown  before paring losses  Gold
futures jumped more than 5 percent and the yen soared across
the board amid heavy selling of riskier positions 
 Before 1 p m   the Dow Jones industrial average  was

194008,415524,CVX,Risk Rally Pauses  Bond Market Holds  Dollar Rebounds Slightly,opinion,Key newsThe risk rally pauses   US stocks post minor losses and Asian markets are mixed Bond market holds onto FOMC gainsDollar rebounds slightly   but the downtrend appears to remain in placeFocus today is on US Q4 GDP data and news regarding the Greek PSI talksMarkets OvernightFollowing the post FOMC gains US equity markets posted small losses yesterday with the S P500 index down 0 6   Economic data were mixed with decent US activity indicators and durable goods orders  up 3  in December   but a small rise in jobless claims and a surprise drop in new home sales Stocks are mixed in Asia overnight  but risk sentiment could see support later today from the confirmation of a further acceleration of US growth  in Q4  GDP data will be published at 14 30 CET With the risk rally pausing  the  bond market has been able to sustain Wednesday s FOMC gains and yields have even continued lower in the long end  The coming months are likely to see a continued battle  between improving macro data and expectations of further monetary easing  While it is difficult to evaluate how high a probability of QE3 is priced in the market  the strong mortgage performance could indicate that investors are increasingly looking for the possibility of MBS focused asset purchases   Also the currency market appears to be pricing an increasing probability of renewed Fed asset purchases  The DXY dollar index is down almost 3  from its 13 January highand while yesterday did see the greenback recover slightly  we expect modest dollar weakness to continue  That said  tail risks naturally remain skewed  to the downside in EUR USD given the debt roll over risks in southern Europe Yesterday saw a  further improvement on the European bond market with 10Y spreads to Germany tightening across the board  Italy   11bp   Spain   11bp  and Belgium   7bp   3Y ECB liquidity and improved global risk sentiment remain the key drivers  but note that the Greek PSI negotiations have still not been concluded  see Focus today   A bigger than expected increase in Spanish unemployment  published later this morning  is also a short term risk factor   Global DailyFocus today  The PSI negotiations between the IIF and the Greek government could be the centre of attention as an agreement seems to be moving closer  Greek mediasuggested yesterday that the average coupon on the new bonds would be around 3 75   but this has not been confirmed  A solution ahead of next week s summit would be welcomed by the euro area leaders  On the data front there will be a couple of interesting releases  In the euro area it will be interesting to see whether an effect of  the 3 year LTRO will show in the M3 data  In  the  US Q4 GDP data could attract attention  A substantial increase from 1 8  q q ann  in Q3 to 3 0  in Q4 is expected  Also earnings data from Samsung Electronics  Chevron and Ford Motor are worth keeping an eye on Fixed income markets  The news flow has mainly been positive throughout the week  as data indicate an ongoing recovery in the US and a mild recession in the eurozone  This supported the risk sentiment in general  but it has not pushed international rates higher as the FOMC was viewed as dovish  Eventually the improving flow of news should support higher rates in the longer part of the curve   mainly in the US  However  until the results of the Greek PSI are visible  the markets will continue to keep longer rates at suppressed levels  Today Italy will auction 3M and 6M bills worth EUR11bn FX markets  The arguments for buying the dollar during Q4 were strong  but have faded going into 2012  Improved economic data have reduced global recession fears  the  3Y ECB LTRO has supported sovereign bond markets more than had been expected  and the promise of further US monetary easing should growth dip again has removed some of the cyclical tail risks  As long as an agreement is reached on how to cut Greece s debt  we expect this to be enough for investors to continue unwinding long USD positions  This could lift EUR USD towards 1 32 technical resistance in the short term While our main expectation is for the dollar uptrend to be broken  we acknowledge the still significant euro tail risks  However  recent price action on the option market has made it much cheaper to hedge these via options   Scandi DailyNorway  Today focus is on the release of the business tendency survey  We expect that the more upbeat picture seen in the global PMIs in  January will be reflected in the Norwegian survey as well  however  note the very weak Norwegian PMI in January   All in all  the survey is expected to underline that the Norwegian manufacturing sector is little affected by the global slowdown   Swedish data yesterday indeed bolstered our call for another cut from the Riksbank in February  Trade balance was most notable with exports plunging  stressing a need for the Riksbank to lower its Q4 GDP forecast  the Riksbank had  0 05  q q in December  we have a tentative forecast of around   1 5  q q  Today s retail sales numbers provide the final demand side piece for the GDP puzzle  We expect retail sales to bounce in December as reflected in the  2 0  y y forecast  We also get household lending data for December today  We expect further moderation

194011,415527,CVX,Poland s Power Play for Energy,opinion,"Poland is setting the stage to become a rising player in the European natural gas market  Europe has long been reliant on Russia for its supply of natural gas  but domestic discoveries of shale gas along with strong governmental support for drilling might soon catapult Poland to the forefront of the energy landscape 
According to BP s 2011 Statistical Review of World Energy  Poland s production of natural gas has been relatively flat over the past 40 years  The country historically produced less than 1 percent of the world s natural gas  vastly paling in comparison to one of the biggest natural gas players  Russia  which produced 18 percent of the world s natural gas supply 

The European Union now imports 30 percent of its natural gas from Russia  says Morgan Stanley  and Poland has been one of the best customers  Last year  Poland alone imported nearly 63 percent of its natural gas 87 percent originating in Russia  The chart shows the vast web of pipelines that Russia has spun through Belarus  Ukraine  Slovakia and the Czech Republic in order to carry its gas to the other European nations 
BP reports that the only country outproducing Russia in natural gas is the U S   which accounted for nearly one fifth of the world s natural gas in 2010  However  the U S  s natural gas production rose to its highest level since 1973 due to the extraction of shale gas   Shale gas related horizontal drilling surged in early 2010 and shale gas output rose to account for 23 percent of total U S  production   reported BP 
The U S s new drilling technique  which extracts natural gas from rock deep underground  is  reshaping the world of natural gas   BP says  To unlock the resource in shale basins  engineers must employ horizontal and hydraulic drilling  commonly referred to as  fracking  or  hydrofracking   This requires pumping highly pressurized amounts of water  chemicals and sand underground to release gas trapped in shale formations 
Now this groundbreaking technique could shift Europe s natural gas market to the East  A report by the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  on  World Shale Gas Resources  found that Poland has the largest shale gas reserves in all of Europe  with 187 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas resources 

Specifically  the EIA finds three organically rich shale formations in Poland that are favorable for gas exploration development 
The Baltic Basin is roughly 102 000 total square miles in size  larger than the Marcellus shale basin in the U S   and extends over a portion of Poland  Lithuania  Russia  Latvia  Sweden and the Baltic Sea  This basin could contain significant levels of natural gas  making it the most promising deposit of this untapped resource in the region  Surrounding the Baltic Basin are Poland s gas rich regions of the Lublin and Podlasie basins 
Chevron began drilling the company s first exploratory well in southeast Poland this week and that s just the beginning  The EIA says a number of international firms such as ExxonMobil  Marathon Oil and PGNiG  Poland s state owned gas company  have been evaluating the Baltic and Lublin basins  but no exploratory wells have been drilled at Podlasie as of yet  Substantial infrastructure is also needed for companies to be able to extract and transport reserves  including thousands of miles of pipelines and dozens of rigs 
Helping to offset some of the transportation difficulties  Poland s largest state owned energy company recently announced plans to build approximately 620 miles of gas pipeline 
Although it may still be two to five years until the country is able to begin production  Morgan Stanley cites several reasons for Poland s likely success  a large resource base  gas pricing that is almost twice the pricing of the U S   a developed gas market  and political support that welcomes foreign firms and hydraulic fracking permits compared to other countries in Europe  Just as shale gas is significantly driving the supplies of natural gas in the U S   Poland s shale gas could shift where Europe gets its energy in the future ",2011-11-02,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/poland’s-power-play-for-energy-104382,104382
