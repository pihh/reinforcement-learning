35989,257504,INFY,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday  October 13 
1  Gloomy China trade data spooks investors
China s September exports plunged  while imports unexpectedly shrank after picking up in August  suggesting signs of steadying in the world s second largest economy may be short lived 
Exports tumbled 10 0  from a year earlier  far worse than forecasts for a decline of 3 0   while imports dropped 1 9   compared to expectations for a gain of 1 0  
That left China with a trade surplus of  41 99 billion for the month  the lowest in six months  the General Administration of Customs said on Thursday 
The surprisingly weak figures pointed to sluggish demand both at home and abroad  and deepened worries over the latest depreciation in the yuan  which hit a fresh six year low against the U S  dollar on Thursday 
2  Fed rate hike bets boost U S  dollar to 7 month highs
The dollar rose to fresh seven month highs against the other major currencies on Thursday  after minutes from the Federal Reserve s September meeting reaffirmed expectations of a December interest rate hike 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s value against a basket of six major currencies  rose to 98 12 at one point  the most since March 10  It was last at 97 85  down 0 1  in early morning hours in New York 
According to the minutes  several voting members of the policy committee judged a rate hike would be warranted  relatively soon  if the U S  economy continued to strengthen 
Markets are currently pricing in around a 65  chance of a rate hike at December s meeting  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool 
Against the yen  the dollar touched a session high of 104 63  which was the strongest level since July 29  before turning lower to 103 92 
The euro  meanwhile  inched down to an 11 week low of 1 0958 against the greenback  before recovering to 1 1017 
Elsewhere  the British pound hovered close to its weakest level in more than three decades  with GBP USD little changed below 1 2200  on fears of the impact of the U K  s impending exit from the European Union 
3  Global stocks drop amid Fed rate hike chatter  weak China data
U S  stock index futures pointed to a sharply lower open on Thursday morning  with the Dow futures falling more than 100 points  as traders eyed the release of data and earnings 
There are a few economic reports on Thursday  including data on weekly jobless claims and import prices at 8 30AM ET  12 30GMT   while the federal budget is due at 2 00PM ET  18 00GMT  
Meanwhile  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL    First Republic Bank   NYSE FRC  and Winnebago  NYSE WGO  are among companies set to report before the bell on Thursday morning  while Infosys  NYSE INFY  is due to report after the bell  Friday will see  Citigroup   NYSE C   JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  and  Wells Fargo  report 
Elsewhere  European and U K  stocks were broadly lower in mid morning trade  with Germany s DAX down more than 1   after minutes from the Fed s September meeting underlined expectations of tighter monetary policy before the end of the year and as weak China trade data dampened sentiment

 The buyback should be at the 52 week high price of Rs 3 850 share   they said  adding that  Infosys should also announce an ongoing buyback program to the extent of 40 percent of the previous year s net profits on a consistent basis   The company s shares were trading at 3576 20 rupees on the benchmark BSE index  on Wednesday 
The share buyback will help recover shareholder value the company has lost over the last three years  in which there has been a  dramatic valuation disconnect  between the company s stock value and that of its peers  the authors of the letter argued  The figure of 112 billion rupees was arrived at based on the current 25 percent limit set by India s market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India on share buybacks  the letter explained 
They pointed out that  in the three year period between April 2011 to July 2014  the broader BSE index gave a return of 34 4 percent while the BSE IT index gave a return of 47 9 percent and  within the IT sector  shares of Tata Consultancy Services Limited  BOM 532540   Infosys s larger rival  rose 119 2 percent  Infosys rose 4 percent in that time  they said 

 The Infosys board and the management receives requests on a variety of subjects from shareholders and investors on an on going basis  These are addressed by the board and the management in due course  In this particular case we have received this request only from three retail investors   Infosys said  in an emailed statement   Should there be any development that will impact our shareholders  we will immediately inform the regulatory bodies and shareholders on priority  
In June  Infosys named former SAP AG executive Vishal Sikka as its new CEO  Sikka took over on Aug  1  as the first non founder CEO of the company 
 Infosys today is seeing a major transition from a founder driven company to a non founder driven company     while the change is inevitable  the abrupt nature of the change raises some serious concerns not only in our minds but also with many stakeholders   Pai  Balakrishnan and Prahlad said in the letter  adding that  even after the share buyback  Infosys will have enough money for all its strategic goals 
 Our discussions with few large institutional shareholders of Infosys make us believe that they are supportive of this proposal   they said ",2014-08-06,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/infosys-faces-$1.8b-buyback-demand-from-former-directors-301299,301299

42494,264009,INFY,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Booking  Allergan  Honda Motor  Infosys And Activision Blizzard,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  November 13  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Booking Holdings   NASDAQ BKNG    Allergan   NYSE AGN    Honda Motor Co    NYSE HMC    Infosys   NYSE INFY   and Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  Top Stock Reports for Booking  Allergan and Honda Motor Co The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Booking Holdings  Allergan and Honda Motor Co  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see all of today s research reports here    Booking Holdings  shares have underperformed the Zacks Internet Commerce industry year to date  10 1  vs  20 4    The Zacks analyst believes that a secular growth trend in the online travel booking market and growing mobile usage penetration are tailwinds Booking Holdings reported third quarter results  wherein both earnings and revenues have grown year over year on the back of improving gross bookings  Moreover  solid growth in the booked room nights and strong momentum across global accommodation space contributed well  Also  strong efforts toward ramping up of merchant business drove the top line growth further Moreover  the company s strong position in international markets and growth opportunities in the domestic market are major positives  However  continued softness in agency business of the company remains a headwind  Further  macro headwinds and increasing advertising spend are concerns Shares of Allergan have gained 34 5  in the past six months against Zacks Generic Drugs industry s rise of 4 7   The Zacks analyst believes that Allergan s key products like Botox and new products such as Viberzi and Vraylar support sales Allergan also continues to deliver on its R D pipeline with some major product launches expected over the next couple of years  Biosimilars also represent significant opportunity  The acquisition by AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  could prove to be rewarding for Allergan s shareholders  Allergan s stock has outperformed the industry this year so far  However  in 2019  sales are being hurt by loss of exclusivity of key drugs  product recalls  pricing pressure and currency headwinds  Its blockbuster eye drug  Restasis  is also expected to face generic competition this year  Meanwhile  new competition for key growth drivers  Botox  Restasis and Linzess  is a concern Honda Motor s shares have gained 23 1  over the past three months against the Zacks Foreign Automotive industry s rise of 15 3   The Zacks analyst believes that focus on the development of EVs and self driving cars bodes well for the company  given the changing circumstances in the automobile industry The firm s frequent collaborations with companies like General Motors  NYSE GM  and Hitachi  among others  are expected to expand business and bolster prospects  Its healthy balance sheet  improving cash flows and investor friendly moves are other positives However  in anticipation of a slowdown in India and North America  along with a stronger yen  the company has narrowed sales and profit forecast for fiscal 2020  Further  high capex to develop advanced technologies may also limit its cash flows  Frequent recalls also remain a concern  As such  investors are recommended to wait for a better entry point

Modi led his party to a landslide victory in the world s largest election with close to 900 million eligible voters  The BJP won 303 of India s 543 parliamentary seats  21 more than it did in 2014 
We first take a look at Modi s achievements in the past five years  The economy grew at an average rate of more than 7  annually  His boldest move was demonetization  which resulted in cancellation of about 86  of the currency in circulation 
Other major economic reforms included an overhaul of the tax system and implementation of a new bankruptcy law 
Should we expect some big bang reforms during Modi s second term 
India s economic growth has slowed in recent months  The economy expanded 5 8  in the first quarter  and as a result  the country lost its title as the fastest growing major economy in the world 
The central bank cut its key lending rate for the third time this year as it seeks to put the economy back on track  What lies ahead 
US tech giants have been investing in India as it is very important for their global growth ambitions  Hundreds of millions of Indians have access to the internet now with cheap smartphones and data plans 
But recently the government changed e commerce rules  which impacted Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and Walmart   NYSE WMT   owned Flipkart  Alphabet s Google   NASDAQ GOOG   is being investigated for abuse of its Android platform 
 Will the US tech giants face greater regulation in India now

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog Top Stocks for UnitedHealth  Netflix and CaterpillarThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including UnitedHealth  Netflix and Caterpillar  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see all of UnitedHealth s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Insurance industry over the last three months  down  2 0  vs   2 9    UnitedHealth Group yet again delivered a positive earnings surprise with first quarter bottom line beating estimates and increasing year over year on higher revenues and membership growth Additionally  each of the company s business delivered double digit earnings growth  The Zacks analyst likes its robust Government business and continued strong performance at Optum  which are together driving long term growth  Its international business and strong capital position driving business investment are the other positives The company has been witnessing an increase in membership over the past many years  It again lifted its 2018 earnings guidance  buoying optimism among investors in the stock  However  membership loss in its fee based commercial as well as Brazilian businesses will contract the overall membership growth for UnitedHealth Group  Additionally  higher medical care ratio raises concern  You can   Shares of Buy rated Netflix have increased  140 5  over the last year  significantly outperforming the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry s gain of  26 6  during the same period  Netflix s first quarter results benefited from its robust library of original content that helped in expanding international subscriber base The company s efforts to attract viewers through investments in regional programming resulted in better than expected net addition of subscribers  Increase in paid membership despite a rise in subscription charges shows its competitive edge  Netflix now has 125 million subscribers globally The Zacks analyst thinks continuing subscriber additions and expanding content portfolio are the key catalysts that will help Netflix to sustain growth going forward  However  increasing market spend and higher investments on original acquired content will continue to hurt profitability  at least in the near term  Also  saturation in the domestic market poses concern  You can   Caterpillar s shares have gained  64  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Construction and Mining industry which has increased  61 5  over the same period  Backed by strong order rates  lean dealer inventories and strong backlog  Caterpillar projects EPS in  8 25  9 25 range for 2018  a 27  year over year rise at the mid point The Construction segment will benefit from continued demand improvement in North American residential  non residential and infrastructure

42579,264094,INFY,Accenture Rides On Buyouts   Cloud  Pricing Pressure Rife,opinion,"Accenture plc   NYSE ACN   is steadily gaining traction in the outsourcing as well as consulting businesses  Acquisitions are enabling the company to enhance cloud capabilities 
The company recently reported strong first quarter fiscal 2019 results  with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Adjusted earnings of  1 96 per share surpassed the consensus estimate by 12 cents and improved from the year ago quarter s figure by 17 cents  Net revenues of  10 6 billion beat the consensus mark by  131 9 million and rose 7  year over year on a reported basis and 9 5  in terms of local currency 
Accenture has an impressive earnings surprise history  It surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 4 6   For the fiscal second quarter  the consensus estimate moved down 2 5  in the past 30 days 
Acquisitions  Key Growth Strategy
In fiscal 2018  Accenture closed acquisition deals for a total consideration of  596 million  By the end of 2018  the company had made a total of 135 acquisitions  These buyouts have enabled Accenture to enter new markets  diversify and broaden product portfolio  strengthen cloud capabilities and maintain strong market position  They are expected to contribute significantly to the company s revenue stream 
Accenture PLC Revenue  TTM 
   Well Poised on Cloud
As enterprises progress with digital transformation efforts  the use of cloud services is expected to significantly increase going forward  Research firm Gartner expects worldwide public cloud revenues to grow 17 3  in 2019 to  206 2 billion  up from  175 8 billion in 2018  Per International Data Corp   IDC   the public cloud services and infrastructure market will witness a compounded annual growth rate  CAGR  of 21  during the 2016 2021 period  with spending reaching  266 billion in 2021 
So  the strategy of enhancing cloud capabilities through acquisitions is a step in the right direction and will drive growth in the long term 
Outsourcing and Consulting Gain Strength 
These two businesses of Accenture are growing steadily on rising demand for expertise to improve efficiency and reduce costs  On the outsourcing front  the company continues to see strong demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital related services and cloud enablement  On the consulting front  Accenture experiences strong demand for digital  cloud  and security related services 
Strong Cash Position
As of Nov 30  2018  the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  4 4 billion  A strong cash position enables Accenture to pursue strategic acquisitions  invest in growth initiatives and return cash through regular quarterly dividend payment and share repurchases 
Competitive Talent Market Is a Concern
Higher talent costs due to a competitive talent market coupled with President Trump s stringent policies on immigration is hurting consulting services providers like Accenture  The industry is labor intensive and heavily dependent on foreign talent 
Competition and Pricing Pressure 
Accenture s market share and revenues are primarily dependent on client relationships and the number of contracts secure  This along with the limited scope for product differentiation makes the renegotiation of large contracts extremely important  That said  competition from strong companies like Genpact   NYSE G    Cognizant   NASDAQ CTSH   and Infosys   NYSE INFY   is a persistent pressure  This eventually leads to pricing pressure 
Accenture currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

partnership with leading technology providers like Microsoft Corporation   NASDAQ MSFT   and Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   are anticipated to unlock fresh growth opportunities Despite these positives  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s growth momentum may be thwarted on account of unfavorable political climate in the United States  Over the past few months  Infosys has been struggling

fiscal 2016 Infosys  operating profit inched up 1 5  year over year to  634 million  Management believes that strong focus on operational improvement helped maintain the company s operating profits in the quarter Geographical   Industry wise PerformanceThe company witnessed growth in three of the four regions where it operates  Fourth quarter sales in North America  India and Rest of the World

developments in its strategy execution  as its software led offerings continued to gain momentum  and client success and employee engagement continued to decrease attrition  especially with top

42702,264217,INFY,Opening Bell  Trump Turmoil Tests Global Markets,opinion,"by Eli Wright
Global markets are struggling to determine what  precisely  US President Trump s latest policies will mean for the US and world economies  Of particular concern since the fallout is still roiling travel and unnerving businesses with H1B employees is the executive order he signed on Friday  putting in place a 90 day ban on citizens from seven Muslim majority nations and a 120 day ban on all refugees  Though portions of the ban have now been stayed by court orders and the White House reversed its earlier ban on green card holders from those seven countries not being allowed to re enter the US  the overall chaotic effects continue to permeate 
The uncertainty has led global indices broadly lower this morning  perhaps exacerbated by disappointing US new home sales and GDP numbers released at the end of last week  Safe havens  such as the yen and gold are up  Perhaps surprisingly  the US dollar is mixed though the Dollar Index is marginally up 
Many Asian exchanges were closed today for the Lunar New Year  However  the Nikkei was open  It fell 0 51  overnight to 19 368 85 
In Europe this morning  the FTSE is down 0 74   at 7 132 50  the DAX has fallen 0 61  at 11 743  and the Stoxx 50 is 0 73  lower  at 3 278 50 
The S P 500 closed down 0 09  on Friday  to 2 294 69 and the Dow closed 0 04  lower  at 20 093 78  The NASDAQ  though  ended the week a bit higher  up 0 1  5 660 78 
In pre market trading  the S P and Dow are both off approximately 0 4   but the NASDAQ has inched 0 05  higher  Some analyst believe Trump s recent actions might have a dampening affect on the most recent Wall St  rally
US Treasury yields are up across the board  the 2 year yield is 1 22   the 10 year yield is 2 492   and the 30 year yield is 3 074  
Forex
The Dollar Index is currently up slightly  rising 0 13  this morning  to 100 66 

The euro  which has been higher for most of January  is down 0 23   to 1 0674  It s been bullish since January 5  trading above 1 05  but the single currency will need to break some further resistance levels to change the long term bearish view  The first strong resistance handle appears at 1 088  followed by another at 1 12 
The pound is currently trading at 1 2522  moving mostly sideways since Thursday  but downside momentum is picking up  The next support handle is at 1 22  The first line of resistance is offered at 1 29  There are no major UK economic events on the calendar until the UK Manufacturing PMI on Wednesday  That will be followed by Construction PMI  the Bank of England s inflation report and interest rate decision on Thursday 
The yen is stronger this morning  rising 0 28   to 114 68  Medium resistance is offered at 115 61  but it s looking more likely that USD JPY will head down toward 112 5  The Bank of Japan s interest rate decision is expected to be announced this evening in the US  Though the central bank may paint a picture of a slowly strengthening economy  rates are expected to be held at  0 1  and the QE program will likely remain as is 
The Mexican peso is currently trading at 0 0478 and has actually strengthened 3  since Trump signed an executive order to build a US Mexico border wall  Ensuing events have led to a tense stand off been the two countries and the possibility of a trade war on the horizon 
It s difficult to predict where the peso will head next  Because of news driven events the currency s volatility has been staggering  It could fall to 0 045 support next or  depending on the volley from either the US or Mexico  move higher to 0 049 resistance 

One final note on the USD  The Core PCE price index  one of the items the Fed looks at when making its interest rate decision  comes out today  with an expected boost of 0 1   The Fed s next interest rate decision comes on Wednesday  Today s numbers notwithstanding  the markets largely expect the Fed to remain steady  but perhaps offer some language as to its next moves 
Commodities
Gold has ticked 0 07  higher this morning to  1 191 85  boosted by political and economic concerns over Trump s policies  Expect the yellow metal to again challenge  1 200  Silver is down 0 14   but the white metal is currently still above  17 and could reach  17 30  or possibly higher  on a reported sharp increase in speculator interest 
Oil initially extended its declines this morning  dragged down by the increase US output  but has recently turned higher  up 0 28  at time of writing  The commodity s recent narrow price range has become a challenge to traders  Anna Coulling provides three strategies to help garner profits  Crude oil is currently trading at  53 31  Brent is down 0 05  to  55 66 
Last week s EIA report showed that US weekly supplies had increased by 2 9M barrels  And on Friday  Baker Hughes reported that the US rig count count had increased from 551 to 566  That said  ANZ Bank said in a note that 

 The rise in U S  output should not be unexpected  However we expect the reductions being made by OPEC will far exceed any rise in the U S  and quickly reduce the global inventory that has been built up over the past two years  

Stocks
The Volatility Index is up 5 48  today  to 11 16  so US markets could be in for a ride  VIX complacency alongside other indicators are showing there could be a consolidation or even full scale sell off ahead
Some action to look for 
Last week s existing and new home sales data disappointed  the Real Estate sector was the second worst performing segment of the S P on the week  Keep an eye on today s pending home sales  With an expected increase of 1 1   the report should provide additional clarity on the housing sector 
After Trump recommended adding a hefty Mexican import tax last week  shares of publicly traded   which receive much of their produce from south of the border  dipped  Whole Foods  NASDAQ WFM  dropped 2 82   Kroger  NYSE KR  fell 1 13   and Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  declined 1 6   Suppliers and distributors were affected as well  Fresh Del Monte  NYSE FDP   one of the world s largest suppliers of fresh and prepared produce  fell 0 78  and food distributor Sysco  NYSE SYY  lost 0 62  
Trump s travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim majority countries and the protests and confusion the move triggered in US airports  has weighed on airlines  Among the losers  Delta  NYSE DAL  is down 2 36   Southwest  NYSE LUV  is 2 26  lower  United Continental  NYSE UAL  has fallen 1 27   American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  has dropped 5 32   and JetBlue  NASDAQ JBLU  is down 6 87

that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  but rose 4 8  on a year over year basis However  Infosys shares plummeted nearly 11  in pre market trading as the company slashed its revenue forecast for the full year in light of the fact that companies worldwide are reining in IT spending and shifting to cloud based software servicesThis is only the second time that Infosys has missed earnings expectations since Vishal Sikka took the helm of Asia s second largest software services exporter    Decent revenue growth drove the year over year improvement in the bottom line  However  foreign currency volatility and slower project ramp ups in large deals remained headwinds Quarterly DetailsRevenues increased 10 9  year over year to  2 501 million  but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 549 million  Moreover  in terms of constant currency  revenues were up 12 1  Top line growth was largely driven by lucrative contract wins  backed by the Renew New strategy  growth in delivery services and enhanced operational efficiency  Improvement in client relationships and better employee engagement also contributed to the overall quarterly performance However  revenues were negatively impacted by unexpected headwinds in discretionary spending in consulting services and package implementations  Also  slower project ramp ups in large deals restricted growth for the quarter Infosys  operating profit climbed 11 3  year over year to  602 million  Management believes that strong focus on operational improvement boosted the company s operating profits in the quarter Geographical PerformanceThe company witnessed growth in three of the four regions where it operates  First quarter sales in North America  Europe and Rest of the World rose about 2 5   0 6  and 6 9  sequentially  respectively  Meanwhile  sales in India declined 7 6  Industry wise PerformanceEach of the four reporting segments of the company registered modest growth  The Energy  Utilities  Communications   Services and Manufacturing   Hi Tech divisions emerged as the biggest gainers  wherein revenues rose 3 1  and 2 9  on a sequential basis  respectively  Revenues in the Banking   Financial division improved 2 2  sequentially  while that at the Retail   Life Sciences division grew 1  on a sequential basis Notable Developments in the QuarterInfosys secured major deals with the likes of Samsung  KS 005930  and Onegini for its Finacle banking solutions  to redefine mobile banking and payment services  It also partnered with KUKA Aktiengesellschaft to develop a software platform that will enable users to gather  assess and employ data to improve their own processes Apart from this  the company s strategic collaborations with leading technology providers in the industry and complementary acquisition plans added to its growth  The quarter saw Infosys extending its partnership with technology behemoth  Microsoft Corp  NASDAQ MSFT   to aid the digital transformation of health institutions through the deployment of smart analytics solutions  Also  Infosys teamed up with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services   AWS   to offer a suite of technologies to enable transition from legacy IT to a modern cloud based platform During the quarter  the company launched Infosys Mana  a knowledge based AI platform which drives automation and innovation by integrating machine learning with an organization s inherent knowledge Moreover  most of Infosys  businesses including Panaya  Skava   Edge software product recorded solid growth in the quarter that benefited both the top and bottom lines  In a bid to expand its market share and focus more on customers  the company came up with three distinguished offerings  namely  Artificial Intelligence  Knowledge based IT and Design Thinking last year  These services continued to gain solid traction by way of renewals Further  Infosys   Zero Distance  program  which aims to foster innovation in every project undertaken by it  witnessed steady progress during the quarter  This program contributed to employee improvement which  in turn  drove the company s overall performance  Infosys has significantly improved its content  thanks to the Zero Distance program LiquidityAs of Jun 30  2016  Infosys had cash   cash equivalents of  4 598 million  compared with  4 750 million recorded as of Jun 30  2015  The company paid  481 million in dividends during the quarter Guides HighInfosys  which is considered as a gauge for the health of the  3 trillion global enterprise spending market  dramatically reduced its guidance for revenue growth this fiscal year to 10  11 5   from the previous expectation of 11 8  13 8  INFOSYS LTD Price   To ConcludeAt the core  Infosys reported steady results despite formidable headwinds like sluggish macroeconomic growth and intensifying competition  Constant innovation  business realignment to attain better operational efficiency and major contract wins are likely to support the company s growth for the rest of the fiscal  Apart from this  rapid traction in its AiKiDo offerings and strategic alliances also bode well for future growth Infosys is betting on automation and other high margin services like artificial intelligence and digital technology to drive growth  going forward However  the company is grappling with a fundamental shift in the way clients buy and use technology  A rapid proliferation of customizable Internet based software is hurting Infosys  traditional outsourcing business Also  macroeconomic concerns like slowdown in China and economic uncertainty around Britain s decision to exit the European Union might compel corporations to hold back their discretionary spending  In fact  Gartner Inc  expects worldwide IT spending to be flat in 2016 over the previous year Infosys currently holds a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Better ranked stocks in the industry include Science Applications International

42758,264273,INFY,India s Economic Makeover,opinion,"On Tuesday    These four emerging markets  rich in labor and physical resources  used to be on the brink of expanding their economies in a major way 
But the current economic climate has dampened that hope for the majority of those countries 
However  as I pointed out  India is keeping the dream alive  It s the only country of the four with a gross domestic product  GDP  that s continued to expand over the last two years 
I ve spent a lot of time in India over the past 20 years  And each time  the country has impressed me with its growth potential  only to then disappoint because of a bureaucracy that has tamped down business opportunities with red tape  incompetence  and self dealing 
But it looks like that s all going to change  The newly installed government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a simple agenda  Make India grow 
And the anticipation has already increased valuations in the stock market by billions 
The State of the BRIC House
As you can see from the chart below  only India s GDP growth rate grew last year 

Russia will actually contract  despite what the chart shows  as the effect of lower oil prices wasn t completely factored in at the time these prognostications were made 
And China  while experiencing impressive growth initially  declined in 2014 and will continue to do so in 2015  The country needs to address the consequences of an overheated economy  which led to artificially high real estate prices and bad loans in every strata of the economy  China s exports are weak  too  and the country will look to stimulate its economy if the growth rate falls any further 
India  however  is on an upward trajectory  And that could mean some unexpected gains from the Indian rupee  which collapsed over the last few years 
A few companies  like tech giants Infosys  NYSE INFY  and Tata Motors Ltd  NYSE TTM   have been perennial performers in the market  But for the most part  the unpredictability of the Indian market has prevented most businesses from expanding into the country 
However  Modi has a track record of success  And his sometimes nationalist party  the Bharatiya Janata Party  has something to prove after finally gaining power in a system that s been dominated by the Congress Party and its Gandhi dynasty 
During his tenure as the Chief Minister in Gujarat  Modi s leadership and economic reforms made the Indian state a powerhouse and the recipient of billions in foreign investment  The result was more than 10  annual growth while the region was under Modi s stewardship 
It wasn t without incident or controversy  however  as conflict between the majority Hindus and minority Muslims boiled over frequently into violent confrontations  But that has subsided significantly as growth and diplomacy took center stage 
Now  Modi s focus is set squarely on stimulating growth 
That spells opportunity for investors willing to forget the country s unpredictable past and bet on the resurgence of its growth 
A Little Known Investment
Modi is clearly working to invest in the country s horrific infrastructure  loosen restrictions on foreign direct investment  and reduce the bureaucratic red tape that often dissuades investors from taking India seriously 
The Indian stock market has taken off  as a result  with valuations increasing by more than  400 billion or 41  since the announcement of Modi s candidacy 
To give you some perspective  that figure is less than the market capitalization of Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   However  it s a huge move for a market that has about  1 8 trillion in GDP  And like Apple  the Indian market has huge long term potential  if growth were to increase  
For now though  playing the Indian stock market is overdone and very expensive  In my opinion  investing in India s currency  the rupee  is a better move  and it s one many investors are failing to pay attention to 
The rupee currently buys half of what it did a few years ago  the monetary stimulus forced a self devaluation of the currency  But because of Modi s agenda  the rupee is set to rally  and the potential for strong economic growth will attract new money 
That influx of cash will eventually affect the rupee  and that s where your focus should be if you re seeking a lesser known avenue into this resurgent market 
One way you can get exposure is through the WisdomTree Dreyfus Indian Rupee  NYSE ICN  
India is poised to be the fastest growing major emerging market  possibly outrunning the growth of China over the next five years  Cheap oil  cheap labor  an educated work force  a growing middle class  and an undervalued currency are factors that ll propel the economy higher 
This is an opportunity that definitely requires your attention 
And the chase continues ",2015-01-25,Karim Rahemtulla,https://www.investing.com/analysis/india’s-economic-makeover-239575,239575
42759,264274,INFY,Top Trade Ideas  Week Of August 31  2015,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Choice Hotels  NYSE CHH 
Choice Hotels had been falling along trend support since the beginning of March  Last Monday  it broke that support and was bought   printing a Hollow Red Candle  showing the intraday strength  It then rose the rest of the week closing over resistance  and making a higher high  The RSI is moving up through the mid line as the MACD climbs  both supporting more upside 
Dril Quip  NYSE DRQ 
Dril Quip had fallen along with oil  with trend resistance driving it down  August accelerated that culminating in a bottom last Monday  Since then the price has been rising back through resistance and over the 50 day SMA  With a rising RSI  now in the bullish zone  and rising MACD  look for more upside 
Fiserv  NASDAQ FISV 
Fiserv has been moving higher along a rising channel since October 2014  A great long term stock  It spent most of the time in the top half of the channel  with only the 2 sell offs in October 2014 and last week driving toward the bottom  Despite the drop and recovery last week  the SMA s continue to show a smooth rise higher  The RSI is back at the mid line and rising with the MACD turning up   moving towards a bullish cross  And there is room to the top of the channel for a good short term profit 
Infosys  INYSE INFY 
Infosys had been moving in a very broad channel until pulling back  The bottom last Monday closed a gap from mid July and the recover closed smaller gaps higher  The last 3 days have exhibited a bullish 3 Advancing White Soldiers pattern  calling for more upside price movement  The bullish and rising RSI and the MACD turning back higher both support that case too 
JD com  NASDAQ JD 
JD com had built a Cup and Handle pattern over the last year  But that pattern failed when the price broke below 28 three weeks ago  The stock then retraces the entire leg higher from December with the low last Monday and finally bounced  The stock is now building energy as it consolidates under resistance  The RSI is moving back higher and the MACD is crossing up  Both would support a move higher  but wait for a break of price over the resistance line 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the unofficial last week of summer sees the equity markets have dodged a bullet  but still need to prove they have the strength to continue and not get pulled lower 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue to bounce in its downtrend  while crude oil continues higher  The US dollar index is biased to the upside in consolidation while US Treasuries are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets both look to continue their bounce in the downtrends  and may turn into reversals 
Volatility looks to remain elevated keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETF s NYSE SPY  NYSE IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  despite their rebounds higher  Their charts all show signs of both promise to the upside  but further risk or another turn lower  Best to keep all long trades on a tight leash  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Infosys Limited  NYSE INFY   a Indian technology company  had a great day on Wednesday  up 1 04 to 19 09  or 5 76   on 10 5 million shares  It is in a large wedge pattern  It popped out of the wedge on Tuesday  and then exploded on Wednesday  The targets for this stock are now 20  21  and 24 going forward 
Intel Corportation  NASDAQ INTC  is really looking good  It s in a nice  strong  3 wave corrective pullback  with the forth wave forming  It jumped 90 cents to 30 14  or 3   on 41 million shares  That s the best volume on an up day in about a month  It may follow through as early as Thursday  The declining topsline comes in around 32  so the next target is 31 1 4 1 2

42761,264276,INFY,A Handful Of Value Priced Legitimate Longs,opinion,"In sharp contrast to my Goofy Gambles post from yesterday  the charts below are honest to goodness valid long patterns  They just happen to be value priced right now due to the market getting battered so badly  Some of these may trek to lifetime highs  Others  like AF  will more likely poop out when they hit a wall of overhead supply  There are only a handful of these because  frankly  this isn t really a market that s prone to forming legitimately decent long setups anymore

42797,264312,INFY,S P Whipsaw And A Rip Up ,opinion,"The S P 500 futures  CME ESU14  opened sharply lower Thursday off the 8 30 open  down 23 handles from the overnight high of 1968 25  and then rallied over 19 handles before reversing back down in the late afternoon trade 
One trader on the CME floor said   The comments that the Fed raising rates soon and the health of a major Portuguese lender spooked the S P in the early goings   After closing above 17 000 for the first time last week  the Dow was down over 180 points after the open but ended down only 74 points in a wild day of ups and downs 
S P down 3 of last 4
MrTopStep has been big on following the up and down days  The S P  SNP  GSPC  will have occasional down days but actual losing streaks are hard to come by  One day losses are seldom  two day declines rare and as we have said  there have been no 3 day declines since January 
While the E mini has closed down 3 of the last 4 sessions  July 7  6 6  July 8  10 6  July 9  6 6  July 10  9 4  the S P continues to hold above 1950 00  Additionally  the S P 500 s long stretch of relatively quiet trading has worked in favor of the upside  the index has gone 58 consecutive trading days without a 1  move in either direction  which is the longest streak since 1995 
Despite this week s selloff  investors do not seem to be saying  Get me out   and we don t expect them to say it anytime soon

Which news to trade 
You may have noticed that our focus lately has been technical net changes  price levels  volume and order flow  We still watch the news  but lately it s almost like there s too much news to know which event to trade off of  No one event like Ukraine or ISIS is dominating 
Germany s success in the World Cup has renewed the idea of post WWII Germany as a resurgent power  They are close to getting half their energy from solar and renewables  for example  while the U S  is drilling and fracking away  And they just expelled our CIA chief  because of a spying program started by President Bush  which President Obama was only recently informed of by his own CIA director  Jokes about ticking off the Germans aside  this is hardly the time for the U S  to be hurting its relationship with Europe s biggest economy 
The question for traders  however  is  how does all of that stuff help you decide whether to buy or sell  It doesn t  When in doubt  follow the trend  keep your stops tight  and take profits sooner rather than holding on 
Our view
The markets constantly teach us lessons  but the one learned by a lot of folks yesterday was never sell a down open  As long as rates are at zero and the PPT is around  you can forget about selling weakness like that  Let s face it  the S P is NOT ready to roll over yet  Will it eventually  Sure it will  about 3 months before the Fed jacks borrowing rates 
The first real chance of a rate hike is in early 2015  Three months before that would be around October  Now  we re not calling a date or even a month for the correction  but it is worth noting that Black Monday of 1987  the mini crashes of  89   92   97  and  02 and the crash of 2007 all happened in October  That s nothing to rest a prediction on  but if we do get an October Surprise  don t be surprised 
We remain bullish overall  despite being down 15 points from last week s high  Watch for a  Late Friday Rip  this afternoon  Buy weakness and look for stocks to recover more ground on the upside

42859,264374,INFY,Weekend Update  New Lows Reached  Momentum Building For Next Thrust,opinion,VIX closed below its 10 week moving average at 1494  a setback from the prior week  There are two noteworthy items on the chart  The first is that no new lows were made  The second is that Stochastics are building momentum for an upward thrust  SPX reversal still validSPX retested its upper trading band at 1470 49 again this week  but could not make a new high  The reversal remains valid  Not shown on this chart is a potential crash trigger at the lower trendline of a small Broadening at 1395 00  This chart shows two of three or four potential Broadening Wedges that may cause a  pancake effect  as the decline breaks the supports of these formations  one after another  The result may be a much deeper than normal decline  NDX bounces above its 10 week average  The NDX bounced above its 10 week moving average at 2788 27 and closed positive for the week  At issue is that there are no further supports once it drops beneath it until mid Cycle support at 2377 63  The NDX is known for its swift declines when the top is finally in  Why  Will Never Go Away   What is amusing is that people still don t understand why the exchanges  and the regulators  coopted by the exchanges  allow HFT to continue  Here is the answer  in 2011 the CME made 31 5  of all its revenues from HFT  the ICE  25 1   the NYSE  21 4   the Nasdaq  17 1   the CBOE  22 4   and so on    The Euro is ready to decline again  The Euro has completed a reversal pattern from its recent top at 131 72  It is now in one of the most bearish of Elliott Wave counts  a third wave at three degrees  The following weeks should see a strong and persistent decline in the Euro  There may even be panic in the market outlook for the Euro          Europe s misery has continued to rise in the face of an ever easing ECB and political jawboning  As SocGen notes today  the UK s misery has turned back higher and the Euro zone s Misery Index has never been higher  These misery indices clearly reflect deteriorating economic performances in the main G10 countries  with some unsurprisingly weaker performances in Spain and Greece  leading the eurozone index higher  The US Dollar building a base for the next rocket launch  USD continued its backing and filling above its lower Triangle trendline and weekly mid Cycle support at 78 38  This formed a potential right shoulder for the inverted Head   Shoulders at the same Triangle trendline as the left shoulder  Because this pattern is not apparent in the daily charts  there is very little awareness of it and the ramifications of a powerful new trend in the Dollar  Gold has made a reversal pattern  Gold made a new high this week  but it is the final thrust of a Broadening Top  not seen on the weekly chart   The implications for gold are enormous  since this is a pre crash pattern  Investor sentiment is off the charts  suggesting there has been virtually no preparation for the panic to come  This is ripe for a reversal of trend   Will the fruit fall off the tree this week     Do Western Central Banks Have Any Gold Left      Somewhere deep in the bowels of the world s Western central banks lie vaults holding gargantuan piles of physical gold bars  or at least that s what they all claim  The gold bars are part of their respective foreign currency reserves  which include all the usual fiat currencies like the dollar  the pound  the yen and the euro    Treasuries may have broken the Wedge as hedge funds place their bets   USB appears to have broken beneath the lower trendline of its 43 month old Ending Diagonal formation and the 10 week moving average at 147 93  This may now send USB considerably lower  Ending Diagonals are usually completely retraced  suggesting a decline below its 31 year trendline and a target near Cycle Bottom support at 114 26  This forecasts a massive technical breakdown  A further decline may spark the first flash crash in bonds  which nobody is expecting  See below      Treasuries fell for the first time in three weeks after a report showing the U S  unemployment rate unexpectedly declined renewed concern the  s commitment to strengthen the economy may stoke inflation  Even so  hedge fund managers and other large speculators increased bets the 10 year note will continue to rally in the five days ended Oct  2  according to U S  Commodity Futures Trading Commission data  Speculative long positions  or bets prices will rise  outnumbered short positions by 161 790 contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade  Net long rose by 78 264 contracts  or 94 percent  from a week earlier    Crude declines into bear country   After a brief retest of its mid Cycle support at 93 21 and the 10 week moving average at 94 34  West Texas Crude reversed lower this week  closing below all Cyclical supports  Crude is now in a position to start accelerating downward   Is the China market an inverse of the U S  market  The Shanghai index has no news for the week as the Chinese people are on holiday  I have been discussing the observation that the Chinese market is not on the same Cycle as the U S  for some time  Now it appears that Chinese equities may be behaving exactly inversely to the U S  stocks  Happy investing    The India Nifty had a flash crash on Friday  More to follow The India Nifty appears to be developing cracks in its facade as attempts to reach Cycle Top resistance at 6025 33 have failed  The Liquidity Cycle finally finally started exerting its downward pull on Friday with a 15  flash crash and partial recovery  The decline may resume on Monday with more fireworks  including a Head   Shoulders neckline at 4560 00     While we have grown accustomed to the daily gyrations on mega volume in the US equity markets  it seems the HFT virus has spread as far afield as India this evening  India s National Stock Exchange was halted   with no price dissemination   as State Bank of India plunged over 14  in seconds on massive relative volume  and HDFC and Infosys also fell   dragging the Nifty Index down 3   Of course  the  error  is being investigated and SBIN has recovered its losses      The Bank Index makes a weekly reversal pattern  A waterfall ahead   BKX has concluded what appears to be a reversal pattern  A decline beneath its 10 week moving average at 48 64 or mid Cycle support at 46 07 confirms the reversal of trend and a probable flash crash in the week ahead  The efforts of the Fed to re liquify the banks created a cycle inversion  This  kick the can  mentality on Wall Street only makes the inevitable declines worse  The problem with the banks is insolvency  not illiquidity      very soon banks would be swamped with a tsunami of litigation  And after all  it s only  fair    the banking industry would not exist if it wasn t for the Fed and government s bailout and backstop of tens of trillions in liabilities at the peak  Now it s time for some  wealth redistribution    only instead of said government funded wealth tricking down to the common man  the only social group set to benefit are America s lawyers various  environment charges  aka charges related to mortgage put backs  legal and foreclosure related issues  have soared to a record 16  of pre provision earnings  As Goldman calculates  this is reducing EPS and returns by an average 17   Where it this  profit  going  Mostly to various class action suit organizing law firms and to pay for  800 hour legal retainers    Trouble ahead in Europe       In case there is still any wonder why absolutely nobody has no faith in the centrally planned house of cards that is the modern capital markets system  not retail investors  not institutional ones  not HFT vacuum tubes lately  and as of Monday  not even the Bank of International Settlements  aka the central banks  bank  here it is  In a report released yesterday  the BIS complained surprisingly loudly that in glaring disregard for the ever stricter demands of the Basel III rules  which incidentally will never be met   a very broke Europe continues to ignore every regulatory demand  To wit   The EU s plans for tightening bank capital rules fail to live up to the Basel III banking reform  an inspection team of global regulators has decided  The draft EU directive is  noncompliant  with the global deal in two important areas  Its definitions of top quality capital are looser in at least seven ways and a loophole allows many big banks to assume that their sovereign debt holdings are risk free   No Exit for the Fed     The onset of QEternity likely means the Fed s balance sheet will grow to over  4 trillion within the next year and  as UBS notes  although the Fed has suggested that it will not begin an exit strategy until 2015  the magnitude of the excess balance sheet argues for considering whether the Fed has the ability to unwind their balance sheet  We  like UBS  believe that the Fed will find it far more difficult to exit than they have found it to enter given the limitations of the exit tools frequently cited ,2012-10-09,Anthony M.

42861,264376,INFY,Loss In Rupee Is Gain in Gold  Nifty To Rise ,opinion,The Indian rupee extended its fall to trade at a low 55 89 versus its previous close of 55 5350  a level last seen on September 6  on strong US dollar demand from oil refiners   closed at 55 73  Oil importers are the biggest buyers of dollars in the domestic currency market with their demand peaking at the end of each month when they are required to make payments to meet import commitments  Traders say lack of dollar inflows and strong importer demand leading to exaggerated moves in the pair  The US dollar INR pair is gradually expected to inch up towards the next key resistance of 56 17  Traders said the absence of any large dollar supply in the market led to exaggerated moves in the dollar rupee  Traders will now on also remain watchful of any central bank intervention  Moves in shares are closely watched for gauging the foreign fund flow direction  Foreign funds have so far in 2012 purchased shares worth more than  19 billion  In the currency futures market  the most traded near month US dollar rupee contracts on the MCX SX and the NSE closed around 56 69  MCX Gold prices for December contracts have gained sharply as an after effect of the slide in INR against the US dollar  The dollar denominated metal will remain stronger in the eventuality of a weakness in the Indian rupee  Comex Gold prices have traded up 5  to  1755 from the recent decline close to  1668  But gold traded in India on the MCX   Multi Commodity Exchange has shot up from the lows of Rs  29 700  When Comex Gold slumped to  1668  to Rs  32 464 today  a massive jump of around 10  in the same period due to the INR weakness  Any weakness in the dollar will lead to sharper declines in gold prices in Indian Markets as the rupee will tend to appreciate against the dollar at a faster pace  I advise substantial profits booking in MCX Gold at these levels  A cautious approach to day trading in gold would be advisable till the US  remains below 56 80 INR Rupee Tech Specs  The rupee will now face a resistance close to 56 17   has support levels far below around 54 55  If the INR decidedly achieves a breakthrough above 56 17  then could go for its next target of 56 80 which can prove to be a very strong resistance  There can again be declines from this level towards 53 65  Traders should remain cautious and sell only on a sustained move downside from 56 80 levels as a strong bullish burst for the dollar above this technically strong resistance could lead the rupee to lower levels below 58 51 also  which at this time may look too far fetched  keeping the looming US fiscal cliff in mind  I would take a chance on selling on declines from a rise close towards 56 80 Nifty Closes Higher   Poised to Rise  The BSE Sensex and Nifty ended higher today  led by gains in export driven technology shares such as Infosys due to INR weakness against the US dollar  The benchmark BSE Sensex ended up 0 16   or 30 44 points  to end at 18 537 01  The 50 share Nifty also rose 0 17   or 9 30 points  to 5635 90  The market overall remained cautious  focusing on the outcome of Greek aid negotiations as eurozone finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund will meet later today to try to unfreeze the second bailout package for Greece  The BSE Sensex rallied more than 6  after the reforms were announced in mid September  But concerns over implementation  the fiscal deficit and falling foreign fund inflows have since pushed it down 3 3    We believe that this is the beginning of the realization that a sustainable turnaround in India s growth prospects would require considerable effort  well beyond the burst of measures seen in September   Deutsche Bank said last week in an analyst note headlined  Reality Check   Shares in Mahindra   Mahindra fell 3 3  after reports that the automaker entered into a takeover deal with an Italian private equity fund for 50  of British luxury car maker Aston Martin  The Nifty is gaining ground around its support of 5617   seems poised for a rise to its first resistance towards 5680  98  which if overcome with sustained strength  will lead to further bullishness in order to achieve 5815 its next resistance  If the Nifty closes below 5599 level  further weakness would set in and this could lead to a decline to a strong support range at 5509   5482 Policy Crossroads  Equity Markets are hoping the government will be able to manage some reforms as there no choice left given the current account deficit  given both the houses of the parliament were adjourned on the third day of winter session  The adjournment of parliament for a third consecutive day was another dampener for the local currency as hopes that the government would push through key reforms in this session received yet another jolt The government raised less than a quarter of its 400 billion rupee target in a 2G spectrum auction in mid November  A second auction is planned before March  but a senior government official told Reuters there would likely be at least a 200 billion rupee shortfall  The government succeeded in raising 8 1 billion rupees by selling shares of state run Hindustan Copper Ltd on Friday  although the deal was supported by buying from state institutions To put the deal in context  New Delhi aims to raise 300 billion rupees by selling shares in state companies this fiscal year  which ends in March  Excluding the latest sale  it has managed just 1 25 billion rupees so far  Manufacturing is contracting and exports are falling  India s October trade deficit of nearly  21 billion was its worst on record  Finance Minister P  Chidambaram s battle to tame the deficit takes place against the backdrop of a continued economic slowdown  and a fractious parliament where the government has lost its majority after its biggest coalition ally withdrew support to oppose its reforms  And a second round of reforms aimed at liberalizing the pension and insurance sectors has fallen victim to gridlock in parliament  It is not clear if the measures  long sought by investors  will be passed in the current winter session  Four weeks ago Chidambaram set himself an ambitious target  to hold the government s fiscal deficit for 2012 2013 to 5 3  of  GDP  Gross Domestic Product  even as skeptical private economists forecast a deficit closer to 6

companies expand their drilling operations further  which is not beginning to make a heck of a lot of sense  At the pricing levels of today  drilling for nat gas is nowhere near as profitable as drilling for oil  though sometimes the operations can result in both products  Many companies simply don t have ways to transport the nat gas they find  Then again  as a Journal article pointed out   Some gas fields produce so much ethane  a valuable liquid used to make plastics  that companies will drill regardless of gas prices  In addition  some companies need to continue drilling so they don t violate terms of leases on millions of acres of land   deals struck when gas prices were high   No word on whether any of the drillers have hit China Of course the above is great news for U S  consumers  with more than half heating their homes with nat gas  The government is forecasting an 18  price drop this winter Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said his government would ignore a World Bank affiliated arbitration body s ruling that it owed Exxon Mobil  900 million after Venezuela nationalized Exxon s assets in 2007 The Securities and Exchange Commission is stepping back from its longstanding practice of allowing companies to settle fraud charges by paying a fine without admitting or denying guilt when at the same time the individual or company has been convicted of criminal violations  If the SEC is acting alone  however  the agency would continue to use the language as part of the settlement process  At least it s a good step Former General Electric chairman Jack Welch

investment banks such as Goldman Sachs from proprietary trading  thus exacerbating a liquidity crunch  The banks have argued that banning proprietary trading would impact their market making functions  Japan and Canada are concerned about the impact on global government debt  Earlier  European officials voiced similar concerns on the effect of the rule on the  13 trillion eurozone debt market Raymond James Financial  Inc  acquired Morgan Keegan   Company  Being familiar with both when I was on the Street  this is one deal that makes eminent sense  Nice cultural fit  as both firms  executives put it  Raymond James will increase Morgan Keegan s existing presence in Memphis  for one   Unrelated to the transaction  the Memphis Grizzlies  Rudy Gay scored a season high 26 points in the team s win over a pathetic Knicks squad on Wednesday night  As one who flies Continental Airlines fairly frequently to Europe  I was disturbed to see that as part of its merger with United  Continental is making more unexpected stops in Canada on the leg home if it encounters strong headwinds over the Atlantic  The issue is United Continental are now employing smaller  less expensive to use jets that don t have the fuel capacity Some are pooh poohing this  pointing to only 43 flights out of nearly 1 100 that were impacted  but if you re on one of those that has to make a pit stop  these are not simple delays But for Canadian airports such as Goose Bay and Gander  the fueling stops are highly profitable  Now if you tell me that I get to purchase some premium  like Moosehead

blockbuster  remains the most popular with 1 3 million visitors The art market returned 11 percent in 2011  outpacing the stock market a second straight year  according to the Financial Times  Impressionist and modern art delivered returns of 14   while Old Master and 19th century art increased 4 8   I d still buy Russian art from the 19th century  if I were you  That era had some spectacular landscape artists just sayin  Barclays Capital analysts have concluded there is an  unhealthy correlation  between the building of skyscrapers and subsequent financial crashes  beginning with the Empire State building  built as the Great Depression was underway  and the current world s tallest  the Burj Khalifa  built just before Dubai cratered  Barclays warns that China and India are currently the biggest builders of skyscrapers  The report notes  Often the world s tallest buildings are simply the edifice of a broader skyscraper building boom  reflecting a widespread misallocation of capital and an impending economic correction  Long ago I worked with a brokerage firm  Thomson McKinnon Securities  and our chairman  in his infinite wisdom  decided we needed our own building  just as Wall Street was about to crash in 1987  We called it his  edifice complex   Shortly after moving in  we went under Back to China  it is indeed disconcerting that it is responsible for 53  of all the tall buildings currently under construction in the world As for India  it currently has just two of the 276 skyscrapers over 240 meters  yet over the next five years plans to complete 14   BBC
