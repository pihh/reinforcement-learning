14527,236042,YUM,Exclusive  Impossible Foods has stopped McDonald s burger talks  shares of Beyond Meat jump,news,"By Richa Naidu and Hilary Russ
SAN FRANCISCO NEW YORK  Reuters    Impossible Foods is no longer trying to win a coveted deal to supply McDonald s Corp  N MCD  with plant based burgers  telling Reuters it cannot produce enough of its imitation meat to partner with the world s No  1 fast food chain 
It is the latest twist in the battle of imitation meat makers hoping to convince more restaurants to offer their patties  But it was unclear how far talks had progressed with McDonald s  which declined to comment on the discussions 
Shares of Impossible rival Beyond Meat  O BYND  surged on Tuesday  closing 12 5  higher  after Reuters reported that Impossible was no longer in talks with McDonald s 
The stock had risen earlier in the day on Impossible s unveiling of its plant based pork products at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Monday  spurring further optimism about the sector 
Referring to McDonald s  Impossible Foods CEO Pat Brown told Reuters in an interview that  it would be stupid for us to be vying for them right now     Having more big customers right now doesn t do us any good until we scale up production  
Impossible Foods and its rivals are duking it out over partnerships with fast food chains to cash in on the roughly  3 500 per person average that Americans spend each year on food away from home 
The privately held  Silicon Valley based Impossible Foods teamed up with Burger King last year to launch its soy based Impossible Whopper in the United States  Impossible Foods is now working to more than double production instead of trying to win a deal the size of McDonald s  Brown said 
 I wish we had vastly more capacity than we do right now because the demand is high   he said  Impossible Foods said it had previously met with McDonald s but declined to disclose details about when it decided it would be unable to support a potential deal 
In late September  McDonald s launched a 12 week test of a P L T  burger in Canada  using patties made by Beyond Meat  But McDonald s has yet to offer a plant based burger as a regular feature on its menu at any of its roughly 14 000 U S  outlets 
 The P L T  is a craveable plant based burger with a patty recipe that is made by McDonald s  for McDonald s   the fast food chain said in a statement  It declined to provide any specifics on the results of the Canada test 
Beyond Meat told Reuters that talks with McDonald s are going  very well  and that its new and upcoming facilities around the world are guaranteed to help it keep up with demand   not just in the United States  but globally 
 We would have to work with them  McDonald s  on timing but  yes  we would be able to meet their demand globally   Beyond Meat s chief growth officer  Chuck Muth  said last month in an interview at the Los Angeles based company s office 
CAPACITY ISSUES
Beyond Meat  which is valued at about  5 billion after its IPO in May  weathered supply issues in 2017 and 2018  when hamburger chain A W Canada ran out of Beyond Burgers soon after launching nationwide  But Muth said recently announced facilities in Canada and the Netherlands would prevent future snafus 
Beyond Meat  whose products are made with pea protein  told Reuters in November that it aims to have production up and running in Asia by the end of next year 
 Beyond Meat doesn t want to drop the ball while there is amazing awareness building in the market  and they need to balance that with not over committing themselves   said Dan Altschuler Malek  managing partner at Beyond Meat investor Unovis Partners   The industry will continue to talk about pressure on supply for years   not because output hasn t increased but because consumer demand continues to exceed expectations  
McDonald s typically works with multiple suppliers to provide components for major menu items like burgers and French fries  Other fast food companies   including Yum  Brands   N YUM  KFC and Dunkin Brands   have tested and rolled out plant based versions of items on their menus  made by dominant suppliers Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods 
Impossible Foods declined to comment on when it believes it might have enough supply or manufacturing capacity to partner with McDonald s 
 When we are ready to do it  we would certainly like them to be a customer   Impossible s CEO  Brown  said   Right now  if McDonald s said they wanted us to be in all the restaurants  we d have to say  Sorry  we can t do it   






Impossible Foods has had capacity issues that have hurt customers in the past  In June  hamburger chain White Castle suffered a month long shortage of Impossible Slider patties  for instance ",2020-01-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-impossible-foods-pulls-plug-on-mcdonalds-burger-talks-shares-of-beyond-meat-jump-2054390,2054390

1  U S  China trade deal in the offing  
President Donald Trump said that the first day of trade talks between the U S  and China had been a  very  very good negotiation   raising hopes for at least a partial and temporary truce in the trade conflict between the two countries 
Trump is due to meet China s top negotiator Liu He later Friday  something that previous reports have suggested would only happen if there are substantial agreements in the talks 
The Wall Street Journal reported that a range of elements could form the basis for a temporary deal  including the suspension of planned increases in U S  tariffs  a relaxation of the U S  boycott of Huawei  and more Chinese purchases of agricultural products  Some form of commitment from China on not devaluing its currency has also been mooted  but would be unlikely to have any real teeth  analysts say

The British pound soared and pulled European stocks along with it on hopes that the U K  and EU will agree an amicable divorce at the end of the month

14549,236064,YUM,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday,news,"Investing com    Saudi Arabia kicks off the Aramco IPO  McDonald s fires its CEO and Wilbur Ross makes nice on auto tariffs  sending Asian and European markets flying  Plus Christine Lagarde heads to the lions  den  Berlin  to deliver her first speech as head of the European Central Bank  Here s what you need to know in financial markets on Monday  4th November 
1  Saudi Arabia starts Aramco IPO  details still unclear
Saudi Arabia finally started marketing the much delayed initial public offering Saudi Aramco  the world s most profitable company   albeit one whose vulnerabilities have been exposed in recent months by attacks on key infrastructure installations 
The kingdom is hoping to raise as much as  60 billion  at a valuation of  2 trillion  Bankers on the deal have routinely been cited saying that a valuation of between  1 2 and  1 5 trillion is more realistic  It isn t clear yet whether the sellers will accept a lower price in order to raise more money  or whether they will prune the IPO size to defend their valuation 
For comparison   the  60 billion being sought is only a whisker less than the  62 8 billion in net inflows to U S  stock funds in the whole of 2018  figures from Morningstar   so it s a fair bet that asset managers will be liquidating plenty of other positions to free up cash for Aramco  even though the listing will initially be confined to the local Tadawul index 
2  Ross Ignites Asian  European markets with trade talk
European and Asian markets flew higher in overnight trading after U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross raised hopes that Washington will drop its threats of import tariffs on foreign cars 
In an interview with Bloomberg TV  Ross  who has previously taken a hard line in reducing the U S  s deficit in autos  referred to  very good conversations with our European friends  our Japanese friends  our Korean friends  and those are the major auto producing sectors  
 Our hope is that the negotiations we ve been having     will bear enough fruit that it may not be necessary to put the 232  Section 232 of a 1962 trade law  fully into effect  may not even be necessary to put it partly in effect   Ross added 
The comments drove Nikkei futures 1 2  higher  the cash market was closed for a national holiday   while Korea s KOSPI rose 1 4   with Europe s Stoxx 600 and Germany s auto heavy DAX both hitting 22 month highs 
3  McDonalds punishes Easterbrook for side dish 
McDonald s  NYSE MCD  said its board had voted to fire chief executive Steve Easterbrook over an affair   which it described as consensual   with an employee 
McDonald s  NYSE MCD  shares have fallen over 10  in the last couple of weeks since the company reported stagnant sales and a drop in profits that reflected heavy investments aimed at keeping pace with changes in the restaurant sector  as customers increasingly opt for healthier items  and for delivery  Some of Easterbrook s changes have been unpopular with franchisees  and the company has steadily lost market share in recent years to rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill  NYSE CMG  
Even after the last two weeks  performance  the shares have doubled since Easterbrook took over in March 2015  outperforming other stalwarts of the sector such as Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM  and Restaurant Brands International  NYSE QSR

5  Lagarde makes her ECB debut   in Berlin
Christine Lagarde will make her debut speech as president of the European Central Bank at 2 30 PM ET  1930 GMT  
The location and event are particularly piquant  she ll be speaking in Berlin at an event to honor Wolfgang Schaeuble  the former German finance minister whose hard line in the repeated bailout crises of the euro zone earlier in the decade exposed the euro zone s most dangerous structural shortcomings 
As managing director of the International Monetary Fund  Lagarde repeatedly argued both for a more integrated fiscal policy at eurozone level  and for Germany in particular to stimulate growth with its own fiscal policy  Those calls fell on deaf ears for most of the time  but have gathered more support as the eurozone economy has stalled this year  not least due to a likely recession in Germany ",2019-11-04,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-monday-2011110,2011110
14579,236094,YUM,Philippines  Jollibee sets sights on Indonesia with Coffee Bean beachhead,news,"By Neil Jerome Morales and Martin Petty
MANILA  Reuters    Philippines   Jollibee Foods  Corp  PS JFC  is training its sights on Indonesia  with newly acquired U S  chain Coffee Bean   Tea Leaf its entry point in the economically expanding and densely populated Southeast Asian neighbor  its top officials said 
Jollibee has for years planned to bring its Chickenjoy fried chicken and sweet spaghetti restaurants to Indonesia  but last week s  100 million investment for the struggling coffee chain has bought it a foothold in the market of 260 million people 
 One thing that might emerge and very interesting is Indonesia   Chief Financial Officer Ysmael Baysa told Reuters 
The restaurant scene in Indonesia is cornered by the likes of Restoran Sederhana  McDonald s Corp  N MCD   and Yum  Brands Inc s  N YUM  KFC and Pizza Hut 
 Coffee Bean gives us an immediate presence in Indonesia and also gives us a platform on which we can further expand our business there   Baysa said 
Jollibee s purchase of money losing Coffee Bean from private equity firm Advent International and others was its largest foreign acquisition to date  and its second coffee brand after Highlands Coffee in Vietnam  Coffee Bean has 101 outlets in Indonesia among its 1 189 branches across 27 countries 
Jollibee  the Philippines  best known brand  started as two ice cream parlors four decades ago  but soon shifted to the burgers and fried chicken that have been a big draw at home and among many of the estimated 10 million Filipinos who work or have settled overseas 
Through its 12 brands and franchises  Jollibee operates 3 195 outlets in the Philippines and has a further 1 418 dotted across Southeast Asia  the Middle East  the United States  Britain and China  among them Smashburger  Yonghee King  Chow King  Greenwich  Red Ribbon  plus franchises of Dunkin in China and Burger King in the Philippines 
Jollibee is eyeing a turnaround of Coffee Bean to make it profitable in 12 18 months  Baysa said  Coffee Bean posted  313 million in revenue and a net loss of  21 million last year 
The Philippine fast food chain was worth  5 8 billion prior to announcing its acquisition but shed  890 million in market value in two days as investors sold its stock on concerns about it over spending on a money losing coffee chain  It has since recouped more than half of the losses 
Jollibee President and Chief Executive Ernesto Tanmantiong said the firm aims for 50  of sales to come from overseas within three to five years  from about 27  now 
It aims to be among the world s five biggest fast food firms  he said  adding it has no qualms about delving into a coffee market peppered with big names such as  Starbucks Corp   O SBUX  and Tim Hortons 
 It s a very big market to enter   he told Reuters  adding that the company would continue to broaden its portfolio of businesses when it sees good opportunities 
 Our strategy is to have strong organic growth as well as strategic acquisitions   he said ",2019-07-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/philippines-jollibee-sets-sights-on-indonesia-with-coffee-bean-beachhead-1939964,1939964

Surprise    Overall Margin Contraction ContinuesOn a non GAAP basis  operating margin contracted 90 basis points  bps  year over year to 17 2   The downturn was largely due to the impact from factors

651 4 million  driven by 607 store openings in a year s time and comps growth of 6  in the quarter under review Markedly  segmental growth was driven by robust performance of beverage   the company s

certain retail businesses to fully licensed markets In China  which is the company s main international market  new store development continues to be the number one growth factor  Its store count

14639,236154,YUM,2 Reliable Dividend Stocks Now Offering Excellent Entry Points,opinion,"2019 has proven to be one of the best years in many for dividend stocks  as investors snapped them up on mounting fears of recession  That massive flight to safety pushed the ProShares S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF  NYSE NOBL  index up 23  this year 
Can this upward move continue in 2020  Answering that question isn t easy when there s so much uncertainty about U S  economic expansion and the risks from the China trade dispute still dominate the headlines   and might very well consume the early part of the coming year 





That said  investing in dividend stocks still remains one of the best ways for investors to create a regular stream of income and wealth  Reliable dividend stocks generally offer higher yields than bonds and provide a hedge in times of extreme market volatility 
To help you start on next year s buying list  we have selected two stocks that pay growing dividends and whose values look attractive 
1  McDonald s
On the surface  it probably doesn t seem to be a good time to look favorably at McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD   the largest fast food chain in the world  It sells burgers and sugary drinks that many health conscious consumers try to avoid   and the stock has plunged in the last couple of months  But there s still enormous value to be had  especially for income investors The share price plummet was a response not only to the consumer shift  but also specifically to the fact that the board this month fired CEO Steve Easterbrook for having a consensual affair with an employee  Shareholders certainly aren t happy to see Easterbrook go  as during his tenure the stock proved a great winning bet Indeed  initiatives like all day breakfast and automated ordering kiosks helped send McDonald s shares to a total return of nearly 100  since his appointment was announced in January 2015  outpacing peers such as  Yum  Brands Inc   NYSE YUM  and Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International  NYSE QSR   as well as rapidly growing competitors including  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc   NYSE CMG  and  Shake Shack Inc   NYSE SHAK  MCD stock is down more than 18  since late August after hitting a record high  to close yesterday s session at  194 01  This weakness  in our view  opens a good entry point for income investors who were waiting on the sidelines  The sudden management change is certainly an unwelcome move  but it doesn t alter the strategic plan the company is working on to fuel growth For income investors  the most important factor to look at when picking a dividend stock is stability in income payments  The company has raised its payout each and every year since 1976  when it first started paying dividends  That consistency in dividend growth isn t in danger despite the recent setback  especially for a company which is producing commendable growth  McDonald s same store sales grew 5 9  globally in the third quarter  above the 5 4  that analysts polled by FactSet were expecting After delivering an 8  hike in its payout this year  McDonald s now offers quarterly dividends of  1 25 per share  That translates to an annual dividend yield of 2 59  at the current share price  Of note  this was the company s 43rd consecutive annual dividend hike 
2  Johnson   Johnson
We believe 2020 will be a good year to buy Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  shares  the world s largest maker of both consumer and pharmaceutical health care products 
The company lost its charm somewhat last year as investors focused on uncertainties related to liabilities from thousands of lawsuits targeting all sides of its business  The stock remained under pressure throughout this year amid litigation brought by nearly 12 000 plaintiffs over the company s baby powder and other talc products  The complainants allege that asbestos in those products caused them to get ovarian cancer 
Shares of J J  NYSE JNJ  are down about 7  from their highs this year  closing at  137 17 yesterday  as investors avoid the stock due to concerns about the liability costs  According to Chris Schott  an analyst at JPMorgan Chase   Co   these liabilities could touch  20 billion and the company has already been discounted in value to reflect that exposure 





But these short term troubles don t negate the fact that the drugmaker is still bringing in a lot of cash which means its ability to reward income investors remains intact  For the third quarter  Johnson  Johnson reported that sales rose to  20 7 billion  It also increased its full year sales and EPS guidance as a result of this strong performance 
We believe Johnson   Johnson will slowly overcome the litigation challenges and could prove a good bet for patient investors whose focus is earning steadily growing dividends  As mentioned earlier  the company has an excellent moat and stellar history of raising its payout for 55 years in a row  It currently pays  0 95 a share quarterly  which has grown 7  per year over the past five years  for an annual yield of 3 80  
Bottom Line
With their earning power remaining strong  the current weakness in both MCD and J J  NYSE JNJ  shares make them good candidates to add to your income portfolio in 2020  They are well managed  global companies and both have the means and strength to emerge resilient from their current challenges ",2019-11-27,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-reliable-dividend-stocks-now-offering-excellent-entry-points-200488272,200488272
14640,236155,YUM,An  America First  CEF With A 7 7  Yield,opinion,"Let s dive straight into a trap I ve seen many investors make in the past  And falling into this pitfall again today could cost you a 7 7  dividend in 2020  and considerable upside  too 
It involves China s stock market  which gives all indications of being a bargain today  Too bad it s anything but 
China Equities Get a Beatdown







Truth is  there do seem to be some screaming bargains in China focused  these days like the  Templeton Dragon Closed Fund   NYSE TDF   which trades at a 12 1  discount to NAV  Or the Morgan Stanley China Fund  NYSE CAF   which sports the same 12 1  deal 
But many Americans have been lured into the China story in the past decade  when it looked like the Red Dragon would finally lurch ahead of the US   only to have it end in tears 
Today  It s no different 
So read on as we dive into a crushing blunder so many folks make when investing in China  Then I ll show you a much better strategy and a CEF paying a hefty  and monthly  7 7  dividend that s more than worthy of your attention now 
The Lure of China
The trouble with China is that the country s eye popping economic growth doesn t always translate into stock market success 

Consider the early 2010s  when the flattened subprime mortgage bubble had America s economy on its knees  It looked like China s moment had arrived  and investors dutifully plowed cash into China focused ETFs  like the iShares MSCI China ETF  NASDAQ MCHI  
Here s what happened next 
The China Trap Springs






What s worse is the volatility these folks suffered  look at the whipsawing orange line above  compared to the steady rise of the S P 500  in blue  
Today  I m seeing more than a few shades of 2010  on the surface  the numbers out of China look fairly good  Reuters reports that China s National Bureau of Statistics has set its sights for 6 2  GDP growth in 2019  on track for the government s targets 
That just might have you thinking that Chinese stocks  with their weak year to date run  are out of whack with China s economic news  and therefore ripe for buying 
The problem  Beijing s numbers aren t always what they appear to be 
For instance  regional data says the government has overestimated GDP growth by 1 7 percentage points annually  according to a study by the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the University of Chicago  That would mean China s GDP is about 10  smaller than the government claims 
It gets worse  Big economic numbers can be manipulated  but credit markets can t  and China s bond market looks frightful  So far  2019 has seen a record number of bond defaults  surpassing the record set just last year 
Over the last two years  defaults have risen to over  16 7 billion  or a 400  spike  Moody s Investors Service expects first time defaults to rise even further in 2020  which could also drive total defaults to yet another new record 
The Safer Play for Bigger Returns and 7 7  Income
This is why I continue to recommend a focus on US stocks  American companies simply have more trustworthy accounting standards  better regulations and wider global reach 

This is where the beauty of CEFs comes in  because they let you hedge your bets  collecting a large slice of your return in cash  thanks to their high dividends  like the 7 7  paid by the US equity focused  Liberty All Star Growth Closed Fund   NYSE ASG 
Large payouts like that also mean you could live on dividends alone  if you re looking to your portfolio for income  and tune out the market s ups and downs  because you won t have to sell any stocks to generate cash 

ASG s portfolio is a mix of large cap US stocks like Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM   as well as small  and mid cap plays like property manager FirstService Corp  NASDAQ FSV  and education technology firm  Chegg Inc   NYSE CHGG  
It s a recipe that s easily beaten not only the China focused CEFs with over four times their total returns in the last decade but the S P 500  as well 
ASG Beats Chinese and American Stocks






Remember  much of this return was in cash  thanks to ASG s large  monthly  dividend  And that payout will continue to provide a nice hedge for ASG investors  as well as a high income stream  through the market s ups and downs over the coming decade  as well 
My Top 5 Picks for 2020 Crush ASG  8  Dividends  Fast 20  Upside Ahead 
ASG  great as it is  isn t even one of my 5 top CEF picks for 2020  Those 5 funds pay even bigger dividends than ASG I m talking 8  on average  with one of these income stars throwing off a payout above 10  
That s not all  unlike ASG  each of these 5 unloved CEFs trades at a huge discount so much so that I m expecting 20   upside from each of them in the next 12 months 
Look at it this way  if you dropped  100K into these 5 picks today  you could easily be looking at  8 000 in dividend income by this time next year   plus another  20 000 in price upside 
But you must act now  as recent volatility has income starved investors starting to take note of these funds  Their prices are going up  taking their big discounts  and our upside   with them

The fried chicken market used to be dominated by Kentucky Fried Chicken   NYSE YUM    but thanks to comparatively low prices to beef over the years and changing consumer taste  a fried chicken sandwich has become the go to menu item for fast food giants 
Restaurant Brands   NYSE QSR   Popeye s famously rolled out its Fried Chicken Sandwich this year to big buzz and long customer lines just to snag one  The company sold about 1 000 sandwiches a day before running out  Then there s Chick Fil A  which is now the third largest restaurant chain in America behind McDonald s   NYSE MCD   and Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX    Chick Fil A s original chicken sandwich is one of the most popular fast food menu items in the U S

14674,236189,YUM,Habit Burger Grill plans to offer Impossible plant based patty,news,"By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK  Reuters    The  Habit Restaurants Inc   O HABT   known as the Habit Burger Grill  plans to put a plant based meat patty from Impossible Foods Inc on its menu in the second half of this year as a limited time offering 
The agreement would put a third plant based meat producer on the map among YUM  Brands Inc  N YUM  restaurants  Yum said earlier this month that it would acquire Habit  a California based burger chain with over 280 stores nationwide  for about  375 million 
Habit would join Yum brands KFC and Pizza Hut  which ran short tests last year of plant based chicken nuggets from  Beyond Meat Inc   O BYND  and a plant based sausage topping called Incogmeato from Kellogg Co s  N K  Morningstar Farms  respectively 
 In probably the second half of the year  we ll do a system wide  limited time offering  with Impossible   Habit Chief Executive Office Russ Bendel told Reuters in a phone interview on Friday 
Consumer hunger for plant based meat alternatives has raged  with more retail stores selling the products and more big fast food chains putting them on their menus 
At times  that has led to shortages as producers struggled to scale up fast enough to meet demand 
In October  Bendel said during an earnings call that Habit had tested the Impossible patty in 2018 and liked it  but that  it was impossible to secure supply chain    throughout  2019    according to a transcript 
Supply shortages left White Castle  among other restaurants  without patties for its Impossible Slider sandwiches in June 
More recently  however  the major plant based meat producers have  brought more points of production and distribution on line  and helped mitigate supply concerns  Bendel told Reuters 
Impossible declined to comment for this story 
Habit has tested a number of plant based meat alternatives but been working more closely with Impossible for a burger sandwich  Bendel said 
 On the burger side  it just fit our needs   he said 
While known for its lower priced grilled burgers  which cost about  4  about 40 percent of Habit s entrees are items other than burgers  including a sushi grade ahi tuna sandwich  he said 
About 85 percent of Habit locations are on in the western United States  It has 8 stores in China and is developing a number of stores in Cambodia 
The transaction with Yum could close in the second quarter of this year  Bendel said  Shareholders must still approve the merger ",2020-01-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/habit-burger-grill-plans-to-offer-impossible-plantbased-patty-2067566,2067566

It was time to start a new Habit
Earlier this month  Yum  Brands announced its first foray into the burger category with a definitive agreement to acquire Habit Restaurants  NASDAQ HABT  for  14 per share in cash  or a total of about  375 million  Yum  says it plans to fund the deal using cash and debt  The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020  
Although The Habit Burger Grill is known as a burger chain  the menu also offers chicken sandwiches  salads  and ahi tuna at its nearly 300 company owned and franchised restaurants across the U S  and China  about two thirds of its locations are in California   With backing from Yum   Habit hopes to grow to 2 000 locations 
After the deal is complete  Habit will remain based in Irvine  California  and will continue to be managed by CEO Russell Bendel  who will report directly to Yum  Brands CEO David Gibbs 

The new Yum  CEO shakes things up
The deal signals a shift in the Yum  business strategy  coinciding with Gibbs succeeding CEO Greg Creed  who retired  The company hasn t acquired a stand alone fast casual restaurant chain since 1997  when Yum  went public after being spun off from PepsiCo  and hasn t been in the burger business since it sold the A W chain of restaurants in 2011  Gibbs said 

 With its delicious burgers and fresh proteins char grilled over an open flame  The Habit Burger Grill offers consumers a diverse  California style menu with premium ingredients at a QSR like value  The transaction is a win win because it allows us to offer an exciting new investment to our franchisees and to expand an award winning  trend forward brand through the power of Yum  s unmatched scale and strengths in franchising  purchasing  and brand building   

Yum  says Habit s company operated volumes have increased to  1 9 million per unit  rising nearly 50  over the past decade  The units are growing at a 28 4  compound annual growth rate  
What difference will the acquisition make for investors 
Yum  is looking for a catalyst  The company s efforts to turn around Pizza Hut are taking longer than anticipated  and its investment in Grubhub  the meal delivery service  resulted in a  60 million writedown of that investment in the third quarter of 2019 
Third quarter results weren t very tasty for Yum  Brands  Net income was reported at  255 million  or  0 81 per share  versus  454 million  or  1 40 per share  a year earlier  The Grubhub writedown shaved  0 15 per share off third quarter EPS 
The Habit acquisition was pretty small as acquisitions go  and Yum  investors won t see much  if any  impact on its financial results  But long term  the shift in strategy may build to something interesting in fast casual  where Yum  has not had a presence  Burger offerings are a good idea  but I d like to see Yum  emphasize the healthier side of Habit s menu and possibly make other acquisitions to bolster the category  
Although this is an intriguing development  I don t see any reason to invest at this time  The company needs a few quarters of better results  The new CEO is bringing a new vision and energy to Yum   but until financial results improve and the new strategy becomes clearer  I d avoid the stock ",2020-01-23,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plx1r,2066066

136055,357570,YUM,Yum  Brands Earnings  What to Watch,news,"Last year was a good one for most stocks  including those in the restaurant industry  But Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM  investors missed most of the market rally  with shares returning just 10  compared to the 29  average surge in the S P 500 
Wall Street punished the stock in October after the owner of the KFC  Taco Bell  and Pizza Hut chains revealed weak third quarter earnings results that raised questions about its growth prospects across its 18 000 plus Pizza Hut locations 
The company will get a chance to shift those expectations in an earnings report set to post on Thursday  Feb  6  Let s look at what shareholders will want to see from that announcement 
The Pizza Hut update
A key factor that attracts investors to Yum  Brands  business is its diverse operating model that spans three of the biggest global fast food niches  pizza  Tex Mex  and chicken  Yet that approach has been a liability lately because financial challenges in the Pizza Hut brand are threatening the wider portfolio 

Last quarter  core profitability declined overall as comparable store sales fell 3  for the pizza franchise in the core U S  market  That result stacked up poorly against competitors like Domino s  which has been growing at a 2  rate in recent quarters  It also stood out against the 3  global gains for Yum s other franchises 
In early November  Chief Operating Officer David Gibbs  who has since taken over the CEO position  warned investors to expect more disruption as Yum  Brands works to better position Pizza Hut to compete in a more delivery focused selling environment  That should include store closures and potentially a period of declining comps and falling margins  but we ll get more data on each of these trends in Thursday s report  
Building on its strengths
Yum  Brands  7  spike in restaurant count last quarter underlines the huge global growth opportunity it enjoys today  The fast food giant is also likely to announce a second consecutive year of rising operating profit when it closes the books on fiscal 2019 this week  
Those wins have given management more resources they can direct toward growth initiatives  and investors saw it put some of that cash to work in early January when Yum  purchased The Habit Burger Grill for almost  400 million 
Gibbs said at the time that the chain had  significant untapped growth potential  both in the U S  and internationally  Shareholders can expect to hear more about the details of that growth potential  and about management s specific plan for capitalizing on it following the deal s closing by mid 2020 
Looking ahead
As it looks out to the new fiscal year  Yum  Brands will have some positive global momentum to rely on  with comps likely landing at around 3  in 2019 following two consecutive years of 2  increases  That modest acceleration might be enough to convince management to make some aggressive predictions for 2020 
On the other hand  the tough competitive landscape implies big fights ahead in the pizza niche and in the broader delivery channel  We ll find out which scenario the company thinks will shape its upcoming results when Yum  updates its outlook on Thursday ",2020-02-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pq1i6,2073894
136056,357571,YUM,Why Yum  Brands Is My Favorite Restaurant Stock,news,"For Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM   there s more than meets the eye when it comes to its financials  Though the company in October reported a nine month decline in total revenue of 5   adjusted operating profit was up 7 6  year over year after adjusting for refranchising gains  while net income would have been up 13 6  year over year if volatile investment gains and losses were excluded 
The owner of the KFC and Taco Bell chains of casual dining restaurants has seen a dip in direct company sales  but this has been somewhat offset by a rise in revenue from rental and the sale of franchise rights  Yum  also owns the Pizza Hut and WingStreet brands and can offer customers a wide range of different dining options  
Here are several reasons why Yum  Brands continues to be my favorite restaurant stock 

Growth on many fronts
Yum  Brands in October reported a strong quarter  with same store sales growth of 3  across the whole group  Of particular note  the KFC division reported its 17th consecutive quarter of positive same store sales growth  along with a year over year increase of 8  in revenue  net of any foreign exchange impact    
Operating margins across the three key divisions also increased year over year in the quarter  The KFC division saw the biggest jump    7 6 percentage points    from 36  to 43 6   while Pizza Hut and Taco Bell reported low single digit percentage increases in operating margin 
Steady financial improvement
Yum  Brands  total revenue has dropped over the past five fiscal years    as can be seen in the chart below    but investors should note that within these numbers is an increase in revenue from franchisees  If the one off refranchising gain loss is removed  adjusted operating profit shows a steady and consistent climb  from  1 5 billion in 2014 to  1 76 billion in 2018  With the initiatives that the company has in store for its brands  as well as the strength of the franchising network  I am confident adjusted operating profit will continue to grow 

Partnership with a food delivery company
KFC U S  is partnering with GrubHub to add more locations for delivery and  click and collect  service  Click and collect allows a customer to order online and then drop by the restaurant to pick up his or her order without queuing  eliminating hassle and queues   Yum  COO David Gibbs said during the Q3 2019 conference call that online ordering was officially launched at KFC com on Oct  13 and the company at the time of the call had 2 700 KFC stores offering delivery  along with 3 700 stores offering click and collect 
This partnership should enhance the process of online ordering and boost overall business for Yum  Brands  By outsourcing the delivery to a dedicated food logistics partner  KFC can focus on what s important    ensuring it prepares the right orders and serves up great meals for its customers 
Acquisition of Habit Restaurants
Earlier this month  Yum  Brands announced the planned acquisition of Habit Restaurants  NASDAQ HABT  for  375 million  in a bold move to add a burger chain to its list of restaurant offerings  Management sees this as a good move as the Habit Burger Grill would add a new fast casual concept with burgers  sandwiches  and salads to Yum  Brands  portfolio of brands  This would allow the company to compete more directly with McDonald s and Restaurant Brands International s Burger King  
Habit Grill brings technological capabilities such as online ordering  a mobile app  and technology centric solutions to produce favorable store economies  This acquisition is in line with Yum  Brands  move to hire more executives involved in technology and marketing back in September   when it hired Clay Johnson as its chief digital and technology officer and promoted Gavin Felder to chief strategy officer  Johnson will help to accelerate the company s digital journey across mobile  online  delivery and restaurant operations  while Felder will devise long term strategies for growth and will work with Johnson to integrate information technology solutions  including restaurant automation  across store operations   
Pricing in continued growth
Trading at around 29 times earnings  investors are certainly pricing in continued growth  However  I feel this is a fair price to pay for a business with a great franchise model and a strong portfolio of brands  A recent increase in the quarterly dividend to  0 47 represents the icing on the cake  and the shares offer a forward dividend yield of around 1 8   
Yum  Brands is embarking on digitalization initiatives to drive further growth in the business  through the strengthening of its franchise network   while also improving engagement with its customer base  The acquisition of Habit should start contributing more meaningfully in 2020  while its existing portfolio of brands should also see continued growth in same store sales and revenues  Management is hitting the right levers by focusing its attention on digital channels and widening its customer segment base  and investors can look forward to more good news ",2020-02-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pq397,2073933
136057,357572,YUM,Yum China warns coronavirus outbreak to hit 2020 sales  profit,news," Reuters     Yum China Holdings Inc   N YUMC  said on Wednesday its 2020 sales and profit would take a hit  as the coronavirus outbreak has forced the fast food restaurant operator to temporarily shut more than 30  of its stores

Yum China also warned it could close additional stores  reduce operating hours  or take other steps  depending on the situation in China 
Same store sales at restaurants that remain open have fallen 40  50  since the Chinese New Year holiday period  relative to comparable Chinese New Year holiday period in 2019  the company said

136078,357593,YUM,Yum  Brands Throws Down a Challenge to McDonald s and Burger King,news,"Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM  has traditionally operated restaurants seen as an alternative to the more traditional burgers and fries establishments offered by McDonald s  NYSE MCD  and Restaurants Brands International s  NYSE QSR  Burger King  The company owns Taco Bell  Pizza Hut  and KFC    three non burger chains that greatly expanded the fast food market 
These days  McDonald s and Burger King face all sorts of burger focused challengers  A number of companies have launched or expanded higher end fast casual burger chains that put pricing and quality pressure on the established burger based players 
After focusing on being the alternative for so long  Yum  has decided to jump on that burger based trend and take on the big players more directly by buying the Habit Burger Grill  NASDAQ HABT  chain for  14 per share  or approximately  375 million 

What is Yum  doing 
It s a bold move that gives Yum  a brand that can stretch its appeal to new consumers  It s entering a very crowded space  but it can leverage what it already knows about its existing customers to deploy new Habit locations 
 As a fast casual concept with strong unit economics  The Habit Burger Grill is a fantastic addition to the Yum  family and has significant untapped growth potential in the U S  and internationally   said YUM  CEO David Gibbs in a press release 
Habit  he explained  offers higher quality burgers than a traditional fast food chain  but at a value price  That should position it well within the Yum  portfolio 
 The transaction is a win win because it allows us to offer an exciting new investment to our franchisees and to expand an award winning  trend forward brand through the power of Yum  s unmatched scale and strengths in franchising  purchasing and brand building   said Gibbs 
Why this is good for investors
Habit Grill faced a very tough road on its own  There are more than a few chains vying to be the fast casual leader for burgers  and competing as a stand alone is hard  especially when you offer a limited menu  Now Habit can open stand alones and leverage existing multiunit Yum  locations  That should allow for relatively quick  well planned expansion 
Shareholders got a roughly  3 per share premium from where Habit was trading at the previous close  That s a nice return that could easily be rolled into shares of the new  larger Yum  
For Yum  investors  the benefits are obvious  The company gets a product line that has some positive name recognition that complements its existing offerings  That s a deal that s not always easy to find  and it s hard to not see Habit becoming the fourth pillar of the company s growth strategy 
Habit has been a technology forward company  and Yum  can ramp that up  This is a case where the big company can learn from the smaller one  as well as the other way around 
 Over the past few years  we ve focused on becoming a total access brand by growing our delivery business  expanding our online ordering and mobile channels and enhancing the in store experience by introducing drive thrus  kiosks and technology centric solutions for operations   said Habit CEO Russell Bendel in the press release  
It s very rare that a deal makes this much sense  Yum  could use a differentiated burger brand  and Habit could use a deep pocketed owner  Both companies get what they need  and that should be good for shareholders ",2020-01-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pedjx,2053363
136079,357594,YUM,3 Reasons Why Yum  Brands Is Acquiring Habit Restaurants,news,"Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM  is about to get even bigger 
The parent company of KFC  Taco Bell  and Pizza Hut said Monday that it would acquire Habit Restaurants  NASDAQ HABT  a fast casual burger chain based in Southern California  Yum  is already the world s biggest restaurant company  with more than 49 000 locations in countries around the globe  Taking over Habit will give it more than 270 fast casual locations to work with  as well as a promising and fast growing brand 
Yum  CEO David Gibbs explained the move   We ve emerged from our three year transformation stronger and in a better position to accelerate the growth of our existing brands and leverage our scale to unlock value from strategic acquisitions  As a fast casual concept with strong unit economics  The Habit Burger Grill is a fantastic addition to the Yum  family and has significant untapped growth potential in the U S  and internationally  
Yum  is paying  14 per share  or approximately  375 million  a relative bargain considering that Habit debuted on the market at  18 per share in November 2014  Let s take a closer look at three reasons why Yum  is buying Habit 

1  The international potential could be huge
Founded in 1969  Habit has grown slowly over its history  as it was just a local Southern California chain for much of that time  Since its initial public offering in 2014  the brand has expanded more quickly  It now has over 270 locations in 13 states  with most of them company operated  though the brand also franchises  Still  that s almost nothing compared to fast food chains that Yum  operates which cover both U S  and international markets with thousands of franchised locations 
Yum  is likely hoping to do the same with Habit  following peers like Restaurant Brands International  which has aggressively expanded Burger King abroad  as burger concepts have proven popular with international diners  Shake Shack has also been well received abroad  and McDonald s has thrived around the world 
Gibbs said in the statement that Habit has significant untapped growth potential in the U S  and internationally  Expect Yum  to leverage its marketing prowess and franchisee network to open up Habit locations in foreign markets  something Habit would have struggled to do on its own  Habit hopes to grow to more than 2 000 locations with Yum s help  according to The Wall Street Journal 
2  Habit fills a hole in Yum s portfolio
With KFC  Pizza Hut  and Taco Bell under its umbrella  Yum has a diversified presence in fast food  Yet even with three distinct brands  it lacked the most popular fast food concept  a burger chain  Burgers and fries are the quintessential American fast food  and their popularity explains why McDonald s is the world s biggest restaurant brand by sales  with rivals like Burger King and Wendy s also popular globally  Acquiring Habit fills that gap for Yum   and gives the company a new brand where it can apply its marketing and franchising acumen 
Yum  also lacked a fast casual brand before this acquisition  With Habit  it gets a stake in a company known for higher quality burgers that are made to order  unlike those at most traditional fast food chains  Gaining a fast casual brand should also help give it exposure to a new audience  as some Habit customers don t frequent Yum  s other brands 
3  It s a good price for a strong brand
Though Habit struggled on the stock market during its five years as a publicly traded company  that was not the fault of the product  Habit and its burgers have earned a number of accolades over the years  In 2019  it was named Best Regional Fast Food in the USA Today Readers  Choice awards  and Thrillist named it one of the  underrated burger chains that need to be in every state  
Habit s post IPO spike came in part because its burger was named as the best in fast food by Consumer Reports shortly before its market debut  The chain s average restaurant sales of  1 9 million are above average for the industry  but the restaurant stock has struggled with high expectations  rising labor costs  especially in its home market of California   and the rise of third party delivery apps  which kept diners at home and ate into operators  profits  
At just  375 million for a critically acclaimed product line and a well performing business  Habit seems to be a bargain for Yum  Brands  If the fast food giant can expand the concept to 2 000 locations and open up international markets for Habit  there s little doubt that the deal will pay off over the long run ",2020-01-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/peflv,2053524
136080,357595,YUM,Yum  Brands Acquires Shake Shack Competitor,news,"Ever wondered why KFC  Taco Bell  and Pizza Hut parent Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM  has never added the hamburger to its fast food portfolio  No need to wonder any longer as the giant restaurant operator and franchise licensee has now rounded out its lineup of American fare by putting in a bid for Southern California based The Habit Restaurants  NASDAQ HABT  
The regional better burger chain is unlikely to become a fourth major pillar for Yum  any time soon  but the transaction has some implications for other companies in the industry  namely The Habit s regional rival Shake Shack  NYSE SHAK  and exclusive Chinese KFC  Pizza Hut  and Taco Bell franchisee Yum China  NYSE YUMC  

The deets of the deal
Yum  Brands will pay  375 million in cash to The Habit shareholders  good for a  14 per share payout  That s about a 33  premium over the stock s closing price prior to the announcement  although  14 per share is still nearly 70  less than the company s all time high  which it hit shortly after its IPO in 2015  It s been a painful ride for shareholders as the market came down from its sky high expectations for the small chain  While The Habit will continue to operate semi autonomously from its California home  investors will be shut out of any further rebound if the deal goes through    which is expected to occur by the end of the second quarter  
As for Yum  Brands  The Habit s nearly 270 locations    most of which are located in California with a few dozen on the east coast and a small handful of franchise owned stores in China    won t make much of a dent in overall results  One of the largest restaurant companies around  Yum  has more than 49 000 stores around the globe  generating  1 34 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2019  In fact  Yum  opens more net new restaurants every quarter than The Habit has in total  
Nevertheless  Yum  said The Habit will begin to add to the overall bottom line in 2021  and the hamburger chain could provide a boost to growth long term  After all  this is Yum  s first push into the burger industry  which has been growing relentlessly here in the U S  and is a popular franchise option for international operators  Plugged into Yum  Brands  massive ecosystem  The Habit could really take off in the years ahead  According to Yum  CEO David Gibbs   The transaction is a win win  because it allows us to offer an exciting new investment to our franchisees and to expand an award winning  trend forward brand through the power of Yum  s unmatched scale and strengths in franchising  purchasing  and brand building  
A hat tip to the better burger
And that is where things get interesting  Because The Habit already has a few franchised stores in Shanghai and one in Hangzhou  Yum  s franchise partner in the country  Yum China  will undoubtedly be interested in making a deal  KFC s single largest market is China  and Pizza Hut s No  2 market is there as well    although it has struggled the last few years  Taco Bell only has a couple of test stores as  Mexican food  is relatively unknown across the Pacific  The hamburger  though  is a different story  A patty    be it traditional ground beef or a chicken breast wedged between a bun    is a greasy  delicious  and popular beacon of Americanism around the globe  I m keen on what this deal will mean for Yum China going forward  as it could be a real growth driver for the restaurant operator looking to further tap into the country s massive middle class   
And then there s Shake Shack  The Habit s East Coast based better burger rival that is quickly expanding west  Over the last few years  it s Shake Shack that has been more successful in its expansion efforts  It had over 250 locations at the end of the third quarter  but there are another 40 slated to open in the U S  in 2020 and another 20 to 25 internationally  If The Habit ups its game under the auspicious eye of Yum   Shack could get a real run for its money   
However  as I ve been proven wrong on the matter  there could be plenty of room for two better burger chains  America s love of the better burger has thus far been insatiable  and it s not like Shake Shack and The Habit are going to begin stepping on each other s toes internationally any time soon  As network effects go  if The Habit and Shake Shack together start opening up locations at a fast pace  it may not be a zero sum game with one winner and one loser  Rather  two players spreading the higher quality hamburger gospel could be good for the industry overall and float both boats 
And it s this second scenario that I see as more likely now that The Habit will get some help from Yum   Investors in the fast food giant have to be happy with the price tag the company is paying for an emerging fast casual burger name to round out the portfolio  but my money is on Yum China and Shake Shack shareholders being the bigger beneficiaries going forward ",2020-01-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pe-py,2054285

136326,357841,YUM,U S  travel restrictions jeopardize rare exchanges with North Koreans,news,"By Dan Levine
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    When more than a dozen North Korean economic officials visited California and New York in 2011  U S  organizers hoped the tour would give the delegation ideas for market reforms and business innovations 
The North Koreans quickly made clear that was not why they had come  They wanted to secure U S  investment  particularly from restaurant giant  Yum  Brands Inc   NYSE YUM   said Susan Shirk  a University of California at San Diego professor who helped organize the visit 
 They really wanted to get KFC to North Korea   Shirk said  referring to the fried chicken chain  She added that Yum did not reciprocate their interest 
In recent years  a handful of visits from official delegations and athletes have provided rare opportunities for ordinary Americans and North Koreans to come together 
Those exchanges are now in jeopardy after President Donald Trump included North Korea in a group of nations that will face travel restrictions to the United States because they do not share enough information about visa applicants 
The new policy comes at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and North Korea over Pyongyang s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile tests  as well as escalating verbal threats from the country s leader Kim Jong Un 
While the travel restrictions are unlikely to have a broad impact   the number of non diplomatic travelers from North Korea per year rarely tops 50  according to U S  State Department data   human rights activists worry it has severed one of the few human bonds between the isolated country and the West 
 The main point in inviting these people here is to give them exposure to the U S   and see if one can open the door a bit   said Roberta Cohen  co chair emeritus for the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea 
A State Department official said the restrictions were necessary because  North Korea does not cooperate with the United States government in any respect and fails to satisfy all information sharing requirements  on visa applicants 
HUMANITARIAN PURPOSES
North Koreans wishing to visit the United States must first obtain permission from their own government  then apply for a visa in person at a U S  embassy  typically in Beijing  said Robert King  former U S  special envoy for North Korea human rights issues 
When North Koreans arrive in the United States they never go anywhere alone  King said  and are chaperoned by North Korean government minders 
In 2015  15 North Korean weightlifters along with coaches  reserves and officials traveled to Houston for the International Weightlifting Federation world championships  said Phil Andrews  chief executive officer of USA Weightlifting 
North Korea was planning earlier this year to take part in the 2017 world championships in Anaheim  California  in November  Andrews said  However  he does not know whether they will be allowed to come 
The new travel restrictions do not affect people who already have visas  and they include waivers for people with certain ties to the United States 
The State Department declined to comment on individual visa applications 
C  Jerry Nelson  professor emeritus at the University of Missouri  said some visits serve humanitarian purposes  In 2011  four North Korean scientists traveled to Missouri to collaborate with their U S  counterparts on soil quality testing methods  he said  in order to boost food production 
Referring to the economic officials  trip in 2011  Shirk said they seemed reluctant to express opinions but enjoyed their snapshot of American life  which included visits to a mushroom farm  department store and New York s Carnegie Deli 
 We arranged for people to go to families for dinner in San Diego   she said   They really liked that a lot  ",2017-10-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/us-travel-restrictions-jeopardize-rare-exchanges-with-north-koreans-535645,535645

136328,357843,YUM,Exclusive  China s Primavera  CITIC PE to raise dollar funds worth  5 billion   sources,news,"By Kane Wu and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG  Reuters    Chinese firms Primavera Capital Group and CITIC Private Equity plan to raise new dollar denominated funds totaling around  5 billion in a bid to bolster their firepower for offshore investments  six sources told Reuters 
Over the past year  private equity  PE  firms have become increasingly active in overseas dealmaking  enjoying greater flexibility with offshore fundraising abilities versus the more domestically focused firms that have been hit by Beijing s measures to curb a rampant outflow of capital 
Primavera  run by former Goldman Sachs  N GS  Greater China Chairman Fred Hu  aims to raise around  2 8 billion in its third fund and has started tapping prospective investors  known as limited partners  LPs   one of the sources said 
The official fundraising has not been launched and the fund size is yet to be finalised  another source said 
CITICPE  the investment arm of China s top brokerage CITIC Securities  SS 600030   is looking to raise around  2 billion and is targeting an early 2018 first close   an important milestone indicating the fund has crossed a minimum threshold and can begin making investments  another source said 
CITICPE confirmed the fundraising plan  saying the fund was officially launched in September 2017 
The fund  which has a hard cap set at  2 2 billion  is significantly oversubscribed and targeting a final close in the first half of next year  it told Reuters in an email 
Primavera declined to comment 
The two firms will join a slew of Chinese PE companies  such as Hony Capital  FountainVest Partners and China Media Capital  that have raised dollar funds since last year  according to data provider Preqin 
As of August  Greater China based PE firms had targeted to raise  25 9 billion in 26 buyout funds  and an aggregate of  48 3 billion in 42 growth funds  Preqin data shows 
Acquisitions made by Chinese PE firms amounted to  21 5 billion as of Monday  with the number of outbound deals jumping over 50 percent from a year ago  Thomson Reuters data shows 
 For minority stake deals  we prefer investing together with a strategic player for overseas M A   said Dasong Wang  CITICPE s managing director and head of the pharmaceuticals investment team   But we d only acquire overseas companies that have synergy with China  
CITICPE S PLANS
CITICPE said it would use the new fund to pursue growth and buyout opportunities across five core sectors   technology and internet  industrial and energy  financial and business services  consumer and leisure  and healthcare 
The fund will likely attract Singapore s state investors GIC  GIC UL  and Temasek  TEM UL  as investors  said one of the sources  GIC did not respond to a request for comment  Temasek declined to comment 
All six sources  with direct knowledge of the fundraising plans by Primavera and CITICPE  declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak to media 
Founded in 2008  CITICPE has nearly 100 billion yuan   15 billion  worth of assets under management and has invested in more than a 100 companies  its website shows  It counts global sovereign wealth funds and state pension funds as investors 
Its portfolio firms include biotechnology company  3SBio  Inc  HK 1530   ride hailing firm Didi Chuxing  bike sharing startup Ofo and food delivery app Ele me 
For Primavera  top deals include its role as a pre listing investor in  Alibaba  Group Holding  N BABA  and stakes in Alibaba units  including Ant Financial and logistics arm Cainiao 
It also teamed up with Ant Financial last year to buy a stake in Yum Brands   N YUM  spunoff China business for  460 million

136341,357856,YUM,Yum Brands  YUM  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Yum Brands  YUM  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This parent company of KFC  Taco Bell and Pizza Hut is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 12 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  180  
Revenues are expected to be  1 67 billion  up 7 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 08  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Yum 
For Yum  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 99  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Yum will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Yum would post earnings of  0 94 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 80  delivering a surprise of  14 89  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Yum doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/yum-brands-yum-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200503266,200503266

136389,357904,YUM,Retirement plan offered by Trump pick Puzder sheds light on Labor rule,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch WASHINGTON  Reuters    Fast food executive Andy Puzder  President elect Donald Trump s choice to head the Labor Department  could be in a position to undermine the agency s new rule on retirement advice which has long been opposed by the financial industry   Puzder has not publicly commented on the fiduciary rule  which is due to go into effect in April  but a glimpse into the 401 k  plans he offers his own employees at CKE Restaurants may provide a few clues about his philosophy   The plan is less generous than some of its fast food competitors  according to data and analysis from Brightscope Inc  a research company that rates 401k plans  In 2015  CKE opted not to match the retirement contributions of the plan s participants  according to Labor Department data  The plan also carries high fee investments  has low participation and generally scores worse than many of its rivals even in the notoriously high turnover  low benefit fast food industry  according to Brightscope   The CKE plan suggests that Puzder will bring  more of an industry friendly perspective to the office   said Mike Alfred  managing director at Brightscope  which ranks it below those at Jack in the Box  McDonalds and  Yum  Brands Inc   NYSE YUM   A spokeswoman for CKE  a privately held company that owns and operates fast food chains including Carl s Jr  and Hardee s  referred all questions to a member of Trump s transition team   A spokeswoman for the transition team did not have an immediate comment  FIDUCIARY RULE IMPLICATIONS  The plan could be a sign that CKE chief executive officer Puzder will seek to delay   or even potentially support reversing the fiduciary rule if he is confirmed in his new position by the Senate   The rule requires retirement advisers to put their clients  interests ahead of their own by eliminating conflicts of interest that can lead some brokers to recommend investments that will get them a higher commission or fee   It applies to 401 k  type plans as well as privately held Individual Retirement Accounts  The financial sector has opposed the rule  saying it may drive up the cost of getting good retirement advice and leave consumers with access to fewer products   But companies have already put money into getting ready for it  with some changing their broker compensation plans  With so much money already invested  financial firms may not wish to see it reversed now  said Barbara Roper  director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America   It s not just a slam dunk to reverse course   she said  Should Puzder want to take action against the rule  his quickest move could be to delay its implementation while the Labor Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission  which has considered a comparable rule for all investment advisers  take another look  One way to delay it could entail declining to enforce the rule  The rule likely will get delayed  Cowen and Company research analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote in a note to clients on Thursday  Puzder  does not sound like the type of individual who would be supportive of a fiduciary duty regime    Trump s adviser Anthony Scaramucci of Skybridge Capital has pledged to repeal it The rule is already in jeopardy  Several financial trade groups  including the Chamber of Commerce  have filed lawsuits to kill it   Republican members of Congress are gunning to have it repealed and may be able to muster enough votes without the fear of a veto after Trump becomes president  Missouri Republican Rep  Ann Wagner  a chief architect of a bill that would largely derail the fiduciary rule  on Friday praised Trump s plan to nominate Puzder   I look forward to working with Andy next year to repeal the fiduciary rule   she said in a statement  Progressive groups who support the rule are vowing to fight for its survival and plan to try and highlight its populist appeal for everyday Americans  
 The thing that we will try to do    is make incredibly clear that anyone who votes on the wrong side of this is putting themselves with corporate America up against the American public   said Lisa Gilbert  a director of Public Citizen s Congress Watch division who closely follows the issue ",2016-12-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/retirement-plan-offered-by-trump-pick-puzder-sheds-light-on-labor-rule-446895,446895
136390,357905,YUM,McDonald s sells most of China  HK business to CITIC  Carlyle for  2 1 billion,news,"By Elzio Barreto
HONG KONG  Reuters    McDonald s Corp  N MCD  has agreed to sell the bulk of its China and Hong Kong business to state backed conglomerate CITIC Ltd  HK 0267  and  Carlyle Group  LP  O CG  for up to  2 1 billion  seeking to expand rapidly without using much of its own capital 
The 20 year deal caps months of negotiations between the fast food chain  private equity firms including Carlyle and TPG Capital Management LP  TPG UL  as well as several Chinese suitors 
The U S  fast food chain said local partners will help speed up growth in the world s No  2 economy through new restaurant openings  particularly in smaller cities that are expected to benefit from increased urbanization and income growth 
 McDonald s globally overall is struggling and didn t have the money or intellectual resources to focus on China   said Shaun Rein  managing director at China Market Research Group 
The company has more than 2 400 restaurants in mainland China and roughly 240 in Hong Kong  The new partnership plans to add 1 500 in the two areas over the next five years 
Under the deal  Hong Kong listed CITIC Ltd will own about 32 percent of the business  with CITIC Capital  an affiliate company that manages private equity funds and other alternative assets  holding another 20 percent 
Carlyle will control 28 percent of the business  while McDonald s will retain a 20 percent stake  the companies said in a statement  The deal will be settled in cash and in shares in the new company that will act as the master franchisee for the 20 year period 
McDonald s originally wanted to raise up to  3 billion from the sale of the business  but later decided to keep a minority stake to benefit from exposure to future growth in China  a person with direct knowledge of the plans previously told Reuters 
The partnership will also aim to boost sales at existing restaurants  with menu innovation a key focus  Fast food firms including McDonald s and Yum Brands Inc  N YUM  are recovering from a series of food supply scandals in China that have undermined their performance 
 I m not sure how much more you can do with McDonald s in China  They re a well run company  so I m not sure that CITIC and Carlyle are able to add that much more aside from capital   Rein said 
McDonald s said in March it was reorganizing operations in the region  looking for strategic partners in China  Hong Kong and South Korea  The company later decided to keep its South Korea business 
Other companies that had bid for the China and Hong Kong assets included TPG  which teamed up with mini market operator Wumart Stores Inc  and real estate firm Sanpower Group Co Ltd  SPGCL UL   which owns British department store House of Fraser Ltd  HFPLC UL   sources have said

136412,357927,YUM,Can Tyson s  TSN  Q3 Earnings Help Continue Its Stellar Year ,opinion,"Tyson   NYSE TSN   is set to report its Q3 2019  Tyson ends its fiscal year after September  earnings results before market open on Monday  August 5  YTD  the stock has gained over 51   significantly outperforming both the S P 500 and the meats product market which have gained 16 4  and 27 4   respectively 

Overview   Fundamentals
Based in Arkansas  Tyson Inc  is the second largest meat processor in the world as of 2018  Tyson sells its meat through its own brand and multiple other popular brands such as Jimmy Dean  Hillshire Farm  Sara Lee  and Ball Park 
Along with selling its meats in retail stores such as Walmart   NYSE WMT   and Kroger   NYSE KR    Tyson also sells its offerings to chain restaurants such as KFC and Taco Bell  which are owned by Yum  Brands   NYSE YUM    as well as McDonalds   NYSE MCD    Tyson also recently began its efforts to enter the alternative meat market 
Tyson was an early investor in Beyond Meat   NASDAQ BYND    but sold its stake earlier this year in order to focus on its own alternative meat products  In June  Tyson announced it would roll out its Raised and Rooted brand  which featured plant based nuggets and  blended burgers   Although the products have yet to go on sale  Tyson may offer investors more information on the products and future alternative meat ideas 

TSN currently trades with a forward P E of 12 61  significantly below its industry average of 15 68  This suggests that Tyson stock is relatively undervalued based on TSN s impressive 2019 run and signals that its earnings outlook is headed in the right direction 
Q3 Outlook   Earnings Trends
Q3 revenue is expected to grow 10 51  from the year ago period to  11 11 billion  according to our Zacks Consensus Estimate  Last quarter  Tyson posted revenue of  10 443 billion  for a 6 9  jump  Tyson s revenues have continuously grown since 2007  and the company is not expected to stop anytime soon 
Tyson is expected to post total fiscal 2019 revenue of  42 90 billion  which would represent over 7  growth  An additional 5 92  growth is expected in fiscal 2020  This revenue growth could be even better if its alternative meat products end up being very successful 
In Q3  our  call for Tyson s chicken sales to increase over 26   a huge jump for its second biggest revenue stream  Tyson s largest revenue stream  beef  is also expected to grow its revenue  although the 2  growth that is expected is significantly less than that of chicken  Overall  beef and chicken sales account for over 65  of Tyson s total revenue 
Meanwhile  earnings are expected to decline by 2  this quarter and a total of 3  for fiscal 2019  giving quarterly and annual EPS of  1 47 and  5 97  respectively  Although earnings are expected to decline slightly this year  EPS is expected to rebound 9  in fiscal 2020  reaching  6 55  based on analyst predictions 
Bottom Line
As seen with the craze around Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods  alternative meats are trending right now and Tyson s expansion into the market could prove to be a huge success and help the stock significantly  That being said  there is a little while before that is relevant to its financials  so investors should primarily keep an eye on Tyson s top and bottom lines  as well as any updated guidance for the full fiscal year  If Tyson can continue to expand its revenues  its bottom line should catch up in terms of growth sooner or later

136475,357990,YUM,Yum Brands  YUM  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Yum Brands  YUM  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This parent company of KFC  Taco Bell and Pizza Hut is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 81 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10  
Revenues are expected to be  1 25 billion  down 9 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 29  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Yum 
For Yum  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 49  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Yum will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Yum would post earnings of  0 97 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 40  delivering a surprise of  58 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Yum appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/yum-brands-yum-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200410167,200410167

customizable experience that it offers across four platforms   Eat  Drink  Play and Watch   The company s distinctive model also generates favorable store economics and strong return  However  its limited international presence and high costs of operations remain concerns Nevertheless  shares of Dave   Buster s have gained 27 5  in the past year  outperforming the  s 18 5  rally  We are further encouraged by the company s better than expected earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  In fact  it posted better than expected earnings in each of the trailing four quarters  In the fiscal fourth quarter  earnings increased year over year on higher comps and unit growth Let us delve deeper into factors that shape the company s present performance Strong Entertainment Business EncouragesApart from great food or beverages  Dave   Buster s entertainment business has been driving growth  Notably  amusement and other revenues accounted for 55 5  of total revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  In fact  it is a major reason for the company s success  Further  the segment s revenues grew 10 7  year over year This is because increased dependence on gaming has cushioned the company from headwinds of consumer discretionary spending that characterizes the restaurant industry and is  in turn  driving market share and comps  Also  the shift toward increased focus on amusement is driving Dave   Buster s earnings  given its higher margin business  It is  in fact  this inclusion of entertainment that sets it apart Expansion   Other Top Line Building InitiativesDave   Buster s continues to pursue a disciplined store growth strategy in both new and existing markets  given the broad appeal of its brand  Management believes that it can grow the concept to more than 200 units in North America over time  It launched three stores during the fiscal fourth quarter in Milford  CT  Birmingham  AL  and Corpus Christi  TX  The company also opened the second 17K format store  taking the year s store opening count to 15 In fiscal 2019  management expects to open 15 16 stores in new locations  with 12  unit growth  Meanwhile  in addition to the growth potential that exists in North America  it is positive about the brand s significant appeal in certain international markets Coming to sales building efforts  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  Dave   Buster s appointed new vice president of Food and Beverage development to improve the speed of service through menu redesign and positive simplification in the kitchen area  In February 2018  the company streamlined its menu  and reduced the number of food orders by about 20  and beverage offerings by 12  to achieve increased efficiency  This year  the menu size was reduced by another 15   Currently  the company s menu comprises approximately 40 food items and over 20 different handcrafted cocktails Meanwhile  the company continues to evolve its amusement strategy on the back of new and riveting content  including games based on some of the world s finest movie properties  Additionally  Dave   Buster s believes that it can drive traffic by enhancing in store and out of store customer experience via digital and mobile initiatives as well as through employing better technology  The company thus intends to leverage its growing loyalty database as well as continue to invest in other mobile applications to build customer connections and drive frequent customer visitation ConcernsDave   Buster s non franchised model makes it susceptible to increased expenses  Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Dave   Buster s  instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs on the franchise  it is solely responsible for expenses of operating the business  In fiscal 2018  total operating costs increased 13 4  year over year Further  Dave   Buster s restaurants are located in the United States and Canada  and it has no exposure in international markets  While several other fast casual restaurateurs like McDonald s   NYSE MCD    Domino s   NYSE DPZ   and Yum  Brands   NYSE YUM   are capitalizing on the emerging market potential  Dave   Buster s seems to be slow on this front  We believe that the company needs to expand presence beyond the United States to offset the impact of cut throat competition in the saturated domestic market Dave

136561,358076,YUM,Yum Brands  YUM  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Yum Brands  YUM  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This parent company of KFC  Taco Bell and Pizza Hut is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 97 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1  
Revenues are expected to be  1 59 billion  up 0 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 53  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Yum 
For Yum  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 01  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Yum will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Yum would post earnings of  0 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 04  delivering a surprise of  25 30  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Yum appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/yum-brands-yum-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200381999,200381999

136571,358086,YUM,Yum posts unexpected fall in revenue as KFC  Pizza Hut struggle,news,"By Subrat Patnaik
 Reuters    Yum Brands Inc  N YUM  reported an unexpected drop in fourth quarter revenue as both its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurant outlets struggled to grow  hurt in part by the strong dollar 
The company  which is spinning off its China business this year  said total revenue fell to  3 95 billion in the quarter ended Dec  26  from nearly  4 billion a year earlier 
Analysts on average were expecting sales to rise to  4 02 billion  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
The company s shares dipped 1 4 percent to  71 45 in extended trading on Wednesday 
Yum Brands gets about half its sales from China  But that business has been besieged by food scandals and marketing missteps for the past two years  while the company also faces tough competition from nimbler rivals in the United States 
The company s sales at established restaurants in China rose 2 percent  increasing for only the second time in six quarters  It was also marginally higher than analysts  estimates of a 1 9 percent increase  according to research firm Consensus Metrix 
The increase in KFC s and Pizza Hut s system sales in the fourth quarter was the same as in the third quarter   up 6 percent at KFC and 2 percent at Pizza Hut 
But  Conlumino analyst Hakon Helgesen said KFC system sales fell 5 percent in the latest quarter  including the effect of a strong dollar  while Pizza Hut system sales declined 2 percent 
 One of the key issues for both brands is the relatively slim growth within the United States   Helgesen said 
 Both suffer from the challenge of maturity and  while they remain popular  the rather tired nature of the brands and a lack of meaningful menu innovation means they struggle to compete against rivals     
Sales at Pizza Hut restaurants open for more than 13 months rose 1 percent in the quarter  less than analysts  estimates of a 1 5 percent rise 
 Without the boost to growth provided by China  the legacy business will need to work much harder to reestablish its relevance   Helgesen said 
Yum Brands said it was on track to complete the spinoff of its China business by the end of the year 
The company reported a net income of  275 million  or 63 cents per share  in the latest quarter  compared with a loss of  86 million  or 20 cents per share  a year earlier

When looking at the last two reports  this parent company of KFC  Taco Bell and Pizza Hut has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 18 06   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Yum was expected to post earnings of  0 83 per share  but it reported  1 04 per share instead  representing a surprise of 25 30   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 74 per share  while it actually produced  0 82 per share  a surprise of 10 81  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Yum  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven

Yum  which derives approximately 52  of its sales from China  according to Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   estimated on Tuesday that its same restaurant sales in the world s second largest economy will slump to red figures for the 2015 fiscal year  It comes as a swath of economists have predicted that annual growth in China this year could fall below 7  for the first time in more than a decade  For the current quarter  Yum projects that same store sales in China will be modest with growth figures expected to hover in the mid single digits 
On Tuesday  the company announced that sales in China for its third quarter  which ended in early September  rose by 8  on the quarter  in the midst of weakness in its Pizza Hut division throughout the Asian markets  Among restaurants open for at least a year  sales grew by 2   halting a longstanding streak of double digit declines  Yum s China division is currently under new leadership after the resignation of Sam Su in August  Su  who is known mostly for transforming Yum s KFC brand into the largest foreign restaurant in China  was replaced by Micky Pant earlier this summer 
 We re pleased same store sales turned positive and we achieved restaurant margins of nearly 20  in our China business  However  the pace of recovery in our China Division is below our expectations  Outside of China  our Taco Bell and KFC Divisions continued to sustain their positive sales momentum while Pizza Hut was relatively flat   Yum Brands CEO Greg Creed said in a statement   Our new China Division CEO  Micky Pant  and his leadership team are taking significant actions to get sales  traffic and profits back to historic levels  
 Outside of China  KFC continued its solid growth across both emerging and developed markets  Taco Bell s same store sales growth was boosted by insight driven innovation coupled with industry leading value  We remain confident in the actions underway at Pizza Hut to turn this business around longer term  
Overall  Yum Brands reported net profits of  421 million or 0 95 a share during its third quarter  up from  404 million or 0 89 a share over the same period last year  Yum also saw its revenues increase by 2 2  to  3 43 billion  Analysts expected to see revenue of  3 67 billion on earnings of 1 06 per share  Yum also blamed the negative effects of foreign currency translation for lowering its operating profit by  29 million for the three month period

136617,358132,YUM,Shares in Yum  gain 2  after company names new head of China division,news,"Investing com    Shares in  Yum  Brands Inc   NYSE YUM  rose more than 2  in after hours trading after one of the world s largest restaurant chains shuffled its executive team on Tuesday afternoon by replacing the head of its fledgling China division  
Yum  Brands  the parent company of KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell  announced on Tuesday that it has appointed longtime executive Micky Pant as the CEO of its China division  replacing Sam Su  who is entering retirement  In January  2014  Pant became the CEO of KFC after previously spending five years as the company s head of global branding  Before joining YUM in 2005  Pant spent 10 years at Reebok in a variety of positions  including Global Chief Marketing Officer 
 Micky has been one of our most effective and visionary leaders at YUM for the past decade  He is one of the finest brand builders in the business with an unparalleled ability to understand consumer insights and to pursue strategies that build trust and loyalty   Yum  Brands CEO Greg Creed said in a statement   At the same time  he is a culture champion and world class business executive  who knows how to run and grow profitable businesses and attract world class talent 
Su  63  became chairman and CEO of Yum  in May  2010  after being appointed president of the company s China division in 1997  Yum  is the leading retail developer in China with more than 6 700 restaurants in over 1 000 cities  while KFC is the number one foreign brand in China with more than 4 800 restaurants in over 1 000 cities  according to the company s website 
 Sam Su is a restaurant industry pioneer in China  having established KFC and Pizza Hut as global powerhouses in the world s fastest growing economy  While we respect and support his decision to retire after a long and successful career with YUM  we are grateful he has built a strong leadership team to carry on and leverage the unprecedented growth opportunity that China presents   Creed added 
During the first quarter  Yum China s revenues fell 9  on a year over year basis to  1 26 billion  extending losses from the previous two quarters  Analysts remained concerned that the appeal of KFC and Pizza Hut among Chinese customers will continue to wane as the novelty of the restaurants throughout the world s second largest economy diminishes

136633,358148,YUM,Yum China s Shares Gain 0 3  In 6 Months  More Room To Run ,opinion,"Yum China Holdings  Inc    NYSE YUM    the largest restaurant company in China  is gaining solid momentum backed by a strong brand recognition  Following the separation from its parent company  Yum  Brands   NYSE YUM    Yum China has been leveraging the power of its two most important brands   KFC and Pizza Hut   to drive long term growth 
The company s shares have gained 0 3  in the past six months  outperforming the  s decline of 1 3    Earnings estimates for the current quarter and year have also gone up 20 7  and 0 6   respectively  over the past two months  reflecting analysts  optimism surrounding the future earnings potential of the company  Also  Yum China surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average of 6 74  
However  increased costs from labor  rent and operational initiatives may hurt the company s margins  Also  a limited franchised business model remains a concern 
Initiatives to Drive the Top Line
Yum China is focused on relentless unit growth of its restaurants in order to drive incremental sales  In the first quarter of 2018  the company opened 203 new restaurants and remodeled 125  The company currently possesses five restaurants per one million people in China  which is expected to grow to 15 stores per million 
Moreover  there is ample potential to grow the restaurant base to triple its current size  given the continued growth of the middle class discretionary spending  In fact  the company increased its new store opening target from the range of 550 600 to the band of 600 650 in 2018  reflecting 9  unit growth 
Another riveting growth potential of Yum China resides in its continual menu innovation to encourage top line growth  KFCs extraordinary performance is attributable to greater sales of menu offerings like crayfish burger  stuffed chicken wing and spicy chicken burger  Apart from such consumer preferred food items  the company also offers signature menus for Chinese New Year 
Yum China is also serving coffee across its restaurants and expanding the dessert category  In the first quarter of 2018  Matcha chocolate ice cream was launched and more new flavors are lined up for launch this year 
Yum China holds a leadership position in the Chinese restaurant space when it comes to delivery  mobile order and pay  and loyalty membership  The company is increasingly shifting toward digital and content marketing to expand its customer base 
In the first quarter of 2018  delivery represented 14  of the sales  up 39  year over year  More than 3 300 stores across 917 cities offer delivery services  The company also expanded its delivery for breakfast and late night dayparts  Meanwhile  the KFC Prime delivery  launched in the fourth quarter of 2017  is expected to reap additional benefits  The service offers its members with unlimited free delivery for 30 days at a subscription fee of 18 yen 
Coming to loyalty membership  Yum Brands created a robust loyalty program that has more than 120 million members combining both the brands  Backed by delivery and digital sales  the company s loyalty membership increased at a high double digit year over year for both the brands in the first quarter of 2018 
Increasing Costs   Lesser Focus on Franchising Hurt
Yum China is facing structural high cost of labor and rentals  Apart from wage inflation  the company is also bearing additional costs stemming from promotion  menu innovation and technological novelty  In order to curb labor cost  the company is increasingly focusing on delivery channels  which is again expected to curb its margins in the near term  Also  costs related to transactions and franchises are expected to gear up in the near future 
Notably  in the first quarter of 2018  total costs and expenses increased 12  year over year  due to a 20  increase in restaurant expenses  18  rise in general and administrative expenses and 12  hike in franchise expenses  Restaurant margin in the quarter came in at 17 9   reflecting a 250 basis point decline from the year ago quarter  The fall in restaurant margin was due to the investment in product upgrades  and promotions at Pizza Hut and its sales deleverage 
Also  unlike its major peers like McDonald s   NYSE MCD   and Domino s   NYSE DPZ    the majority of Yum China restaurants are company owned  This makes the restaurants susceptible to increased expenses  Hence  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company  by not signing enough franchise agreements  is unable to put the burden of costs onto the franchisees and is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business  You can see

136635,358150,YUM,McDonald s And BCE  2 Growth Stocks To Boost Your Dividend Income,opinion,"If you re in the market to build a steady flow of income  whether for retirement or for more immediate use  investing in dividend growth stocks such as McDonald s  NYSE MCD  or BCE  NYSE BCE  is an effective way to achieve that goal  McDonald s  of course  is a global fast food chain  BCE is a lesser well known Canadian communications company that provides wireless and data services across Canada  Both companies are great options to consider when building a portfolio for long term growth 
In contrast to GE s current dividend worries  companies that offer regular dividend increases generally run mature and stable businesses that can withstand recessions  financial crises and changes brought about by technology 
More importantly  rewarding investors on a sustained basis also tells us a lot about management s long term philosophy  These are companies that care about their reputation and want loyal investors 
Regular dividend increases also show that the management is in control of the company s financial destiny and has the ability to predict the future  It would look very unprofessional and damaging for a management team to hike dividends only to cut them after a couple of quarters 
Keeping these benefits in mind  here are two dividend growth stocks to consider for your portfolio  These companies have long histories of rewarding their investors and have made their intentions public regarding future hikes 
1  McDonald s Corporation
There are many reasons one may not like the largest restaurant operators in the world  McDonald s sells fast food burgers and sugary drinks that many health conscious consumers try to stay away from  But when it comes to paying dividends  McDonald s  NYSE MCD  TO MCD  has a tremendous track record 
The company has raised its payout each and every year since 1976  when it first started paying dividends  That consistency in dividend growth is very important when creating a stable income stream  particularly for your golden years  You don t want to invest in stocks which are unreliable and don t have a strong competitive advantage 
On this performance metric  there are few companies in the US that can beat McDonald s  Last year the company made  91 billion in system wide sales  more than double that of its nearest competitor  Kentucky Fried Chicken  NYSE YUM   At the close of 2017  McDonald s was running 37 241 restaurants worldwide  including 14 036 in the US and 23 205 globally 
After delivering a 15  hike in its payout early this month  McDonald s now pays quarterly dividends of  1 16 per share  That translates to an annual dividend yield of 2 79  at the current share price  That was the company s 42nd consecutive annual dividend hike  bringing it closer to the 3 year capital return target of  25 billion 
In a bid to win over health conscious customers  McDonald s is also cleaning its menu and is getting rid of some preservatives and fake colors from its burgers  In an announcement made early this month  McDonald s said it has removed artificial preservatives from its American cheese  buns and Big Mac special sauce  a move that affects almost two thirds of its burger lineup in the US 

For new investors  this isn t a bad time to buy MCD stock after its 4  pullback this year  The stock is currently trading at  164 66 and the majority of analysts have a bullish view on the company  forecasting an 11  upside potential in the stock value in the next 12 months 
2  BCE Inc  
Canada s largest telecom operator  BCE Inc   TO BCE  is another candidate that fits very well in a long term growth income portfolio  Unlike in the US where competition is cutthroat  the Canadian telecom market is dominated by just four big players 
These companies control about 80  of the broadband and video market and more than 90  of the wireless market  Among them  BCE stock is well positioned to produce superior returns for its investors  The company is spending billions of dollars to improve its network and prepare for the roll out of fifth generation services in coming years 
For income investors  BCE has been a reliable investment  During the past decade  the company has doubled its payout to  3 02 a share  With a dividend payout policy between 65  and 75  of free cash flows  BCE stock is a safe bet when compared with its heavily indebted American counterparts 

Trading at  40 57 and with an annual dividend yield of 5 75   BCE s valuations look attractive to lock in its juicy dividend yield 
Bottom Line
The secret for new investors is to start their saving journey early and focus on income generating stocks with a long term investment horizon  By investing in dividend growth stocks such as McDonald s and BCE  you can slowly build a retirement portfolio strong enough to produce a regular stream of income during your golden years ",2018-10-04,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mcdonalds-and-bce-2-dividendgrowth-stocks-to-boost-your-retirement-income-200346893,200346893

Fiserv  NASDAQ FISV   Ticker   FISV
Fiserv   FISV  seems to do nothing but go up  Thursday it pulled back to rising trend support and Friday held  The RSI is turning back up in the bullish zone with the MACD drifting  Look for a move up off of support to participate   
Visa  NYSE V   Ticker   V
Visa   V  started moving higher off of consolidation at the 100 day SMA in April  Since then it has continued higher with a few pullbacks to the 50 day SMA along the way  It is there again now  The RSI has reset lower in the bullish zone and the MACD is falling  Look for a reversal higher to participate

Verizon   VZ  started moving higher out of consolidation around the 200 day SMA in June  That continued to a top in August and it has consolidated there since  The RSI is rising in the bullish zone with the MACD crossed up and rising  Look for a push over resistance to participate

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which after one week of October sees the equity markets have given up strength with some sectors bleeding red in the shorter frame while holding key levels on the longer timeframe 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate in the downtrend while Crude Oil pauses in its move higher  The US Dollar Index is moving higher in consolidation while US Treasuries are trending lower  The Shanghai Composite comes back from vacation looking like a possible reversal to the upside but Emerging Markets resumed their downtrend 
Volatility perked up and may continue  making it more difficult for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  The IWM is in full blow short term downtrend but at support on the longer timeframe  The QQQ are consolidating on the longer timeframe but also leaking in the shorter view  The SPY looks the strongest on that longer timeframe but is also dipping to retest the January highs in the short run  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Iran and six world powers reached a long awaited nuclear deal that would end sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on the country s disputed nuclear program after more than two weeks of negotiating in Vienna early on Tuesday 
The accord will allow Iran to resume oil exports  sending crude prices down by more than  1 in New York and London  A deal is viewed as bearish for oil prices  as Iran reportedly hoards 30 million barrels of crude in its reserves ready for export 
An outflow of Iranian oil could depress crude prices in a global market already oversaturated by a glut of oversupply

136653,358168,YUM,Restaurant Brands Rides On Franchising Amid Competition ,opinion,"Restaurant Brands International Inc    NYSE QSR   has been undertaking various sales boosting initiatives that should continue to drive the company s top line 
However  intense competition and tricky consumer demand continue to be potential headwinds  The company s shares have lost 7  in the past year  underperforming the  s gain of 1 8   Moreover  downward estimate revisions for the current quarter reflect ongoing pessimism in the stock s prospects  Earnings estimates for the current quarter have gone down 6  over the past month 
Sales Building Efforts to Drive Top Line Growth
Restaurant Brands continues to focus on improving its level of service through comprehensive training  improved restaurant operations  reimaging efforts and attractive menu options to enhance overall guest satisfaction  and thereby drive comps  It believes that new product development is a key driver of long term success for its brands  and will continue to be in focus in 2018 and beyond 
This is expected to drive traffic of the company by expanding its customer base  spreading out into new dayparts  and continuing to build brand leadership in food quality and taste 
The company has unwavering focus on its goal to drive traffic and revenues at its restaurants through core product platforms  continual focus on a balanced menu design  expansion of delivery business  promotional offerings  efforts to grow breakfast daypart and product launches  Growth across each of its breakfast  lunch and dinner dayparts  supported by new products  is driving incremental sales at Tim Hortons restaurants  Its coffee  cold beverage  wraps and breakfast sandwich platforms  particularly continue to reflect strength 
In 2017  the company launched espresso based beverages in all Tim Hortons restaurants across Canada  Management expects this platform to continue growing  given the meaningful innovation it can introduce around its base products 
Restaurant Brands is also taking initiatives to re image its restaurants to a more modern d cor  In March 2018  Restaurant Brands announced a new Tim Hortons restaurant design called the welcome image  which entails a redesign of Tim Hortons restaurants  The company plans to re image a majority of its restaurants across Canada over the next four years 
Franchised Model Safeguards Earnings but Limits Operations
Given that almost 100  of Restaurant Brands  current system wide restaurants are franchised  its expenses are considerably low  Since the company signs franchise agreements for all its restaurants instead of operating them itself  this puts the cost burden on the franchisees that operate the businesses 
Thus  the reduced capital requirements are expected to facilitate earnings growth and ROE expansion for the company  Notably  Restaurant Brands have witnessed year over year earnings growth in each of the trailing four quarters 
However  despite such positives  a fully franchised model has its share of drawbacks and risks  Under this business model  the company s prospects depend on its ability to attract new franchisees for all its brands  and the willingness of the franchisees to open restaurants in the existing and new markets  The company has a limited influence over its franchisees  as a result of which its ability to control its restaurants  operations  and implement operational initiatives and business strategies is restricted 
Cutthroat Competition Remains a Headwind
Intense competition among fast casual  quick service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry is expected to remain fierce with respect to price  food quality  service  location and concept  which may in turn impact Restaurant Brands  revenues  The company is increasingly facing competitive pressure from restaurant bigwigs like McDonald s   NYSE MCD    Domino s   NYSE DPZ   and YUM  Brands   NYSE YUM   
If this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company does not make pragmatic use of advanced technologies to innovate across value chains  it has high chances of fading out like many other restaurant retailers  You can see

innovation  franchising and delivery are key growth drivers  The strategic sell out of the Qdoba brand is also expected to reap benefits  going forward However  decelerating comps growth  rising costs  along with the stiff competition in breakfast and lunch day parts raise caution  In the   the company s earnings and revenues not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also declined 7  and 21 1   respectively  from the year ago quarter  Also  system wide comps declined 0 1  in the first quarter while franchise comps dipped 0 2  Moreover  shares of Jack in the Box have declined 23 7  in the past year  widely underperforming the  s growth of 1 3   Earnings estimates have also been revised downward over the past month  reflecting analysts  concern surrounding the future earnings potential of the company Innovation in Menu   Delivery Services to Drive SalesJack in the Box  being one of the largest hamburger chains  makes regular menu innovations and also provides limited period offers  LPO  to drive long term customer loyalty  With focused menu inventions around premium products like Buttery Jack Burgers  the company witnessed increased comps in the second quarter of fiscal 2018  At its restaurants  the company continues to combat heightened competitive activity around breakfast day part  and carry out aggressive value deals across the industry by menu innovations and value offerings The company is also increasingly focusing on delivery channels  which is a growing area for the industry  Given the high demand for this service  management has undertaken third party delivery channels to boost transactions and sales  Currently  two third of the restaurant system is served by major delivery companies like DoorDash and Grubhub  Jack in the Box is currently testing a mobile application in a few markets that support order ahead functionality and payment  Management is reaping benefits in terms of higher ticket from the mobile orders Gains From Franchising   Qdoba Sell OutJack in the Box restaurants are currently 90  franchised and the company plans to increase the number to around 95  by the end of fiscal 2018  We believe  franchising a large chunk of its system will lower its general and administrative expenses  and thereby boost earnings  Moreover  over the long term  it would generate a higher return on equity by lowering capital requirements  This would also boost free cash flow  thereby enhancing its shareholders  return   Notably  the company believes that the majority of Jack in the Box s new unit growth will be through franchise restaurants  In fact  in the second quarter of fiscal 2018  the company sold 53 Jack in the Box restaurants to franchisees  Management has roughly 17 restaurants with signed LOIs  having a current 93  franchise mix Also  with the strategic sell out of the Qdoba brand  management is expecting to gradually witness a reduction in SG A in the second half of the fiscal  The Qdoba brand had become more of a drag in the past few quarters  given the poor restaurant level execution and a choppy sales environment  In fact  it generated a net loss of  0 6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 against net earnings of  1 4 million in the prior year quarter Limited International Presence   Stiff Competition Raise ConcernsThe American dining brands are keen on expanding in the fast growing emerging markets  While several other restaurateurs including Yum  Brands   NYSE YUM    McDonald s   NYSE MCD   and Domino s Pizza   NYSE DPZ   have opened their outlets in the emerging markets  Jack in the Box seems to be slow on this front  Thus  limited international presence might be a big disadvantage for the company and hurt its competitive position  Moreover  the company is experiencing increased competitive pressure in breakfast and lunch day parts  as many other restaurateurs have introduced aggressive value offers The company operates in the retail restaurant space that is highly dependent on consumer discretionary spending  Consumers  propensity to spend largely depends on the overall macro economic scenario  Although higher disposable income and increased wages are favoring the industry right now  it can change with the slightest disruption in the economy  This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company  therefore  is highly vulnerable to the inconsistent nature of consumer discretionary spending  If it does not make pragmatic use of advanced technologies to innovate across value chains  it has high chances of fading out like many other restaurant retailers  You can see  Today s

136668,358183,YUM,McDonald s wage plan renews debate on independence of franchisees,news,"By David Ingram  Mica Rosenberg and Lisa Baertlein NEW YORK LOS ANGELES  Reuters    McDonald s Corp s  N MCD  announcement that it will raise the average pay at its company operated U S  restaurants threatens to complicate an ongoing labor dispute that turns on whether McDonald s can be held responsible for the labor violations of its franchisees   The decision to hike wages to around  10 an hour will affect only 90 000 of the roughly 750 000 McDonald s restaurant workers in the United States  because almost 90 percent of McDonald s restaurants are run by franchisees  The International Franchise Association said on Thursday the move to raise wages was a  reminder  that McDonald s and its roughly 12 500 franchised restaurants are not  joint employers   The question of whether they are is at the center of closely watched cases before the U S  National Labor Relations Board  NLRB  in which McDonald s has been accused by the agency s attorneys of intimidating workers who participated in union organizing and in a national protest movement calling for higher wages  Steve Caldeira  president of the International Franchise Association  a trade group that represents franchisors including McDonald s and KFC parent Yum Brands Inc  N YUM   said the wage plan demonstrates independent decision making by franchisees separate from McDonald s   If the franchisees want to also raise the wages of their employees  they have every right as independent business owners to make decisions that allow them to hire and retain the best employees in the local markets where they operate   Caldeira said in a statement on Thursday  But some worker advocates downplayed the significance of the wage decision to the NLRB proceedings  The wage decision is not enough to show that franchisees are independent  said Catherine Ruckelshaus  general counsel of the National Employment Law Project  a nonprofit in New York that advocates for workers and has criticized McDonald s  She said the questions before the NLRB are different than simply wage levels   McDonald s is pretty unique in terms of its control over its franchisees  It micromanages  controlling things like when workers clock out and clock in  thanks to their technology   Ruckelshaus said  The technology includes a computer system that tracks the number of burgers sold and calculates whether a franchisee should take a worker off the clock to keep labor costs in check   Karen King  the chief people officer at McDonald s  said it would not be appropriate for the company to make a recommendation on wages to franchisees   Some may follow  Some may not  We can t dictate what they do in the wage arena   King told Reuters in an interview  King said the NLRB cases did not figure into the McDonald s wage move  A NLRB administrative law judge is presiding over the NLRB cases  and a consolidated trial is scheduled to begin in May  The NLRB attorneys have argued that Illinois based McDonald s and the franchisees should be held jointly responsible because corporate policies and franchise agreements have a major impact on working conditions  McDonald s has denied the allegations  Any decision by the judge  Lauren Esposito  is expected to be appealed to the five member board and  ultimately  to federal courts  The outcome of the proceedings could have wide ranging implications for franchise businesses and other types of employers  The decision to raise wages probably does put some pressure on franchisees to do the same  said Sara Senatore  restaurant analyst for Bernstein Research  a Wall Street research firm  She said that fast food chains such as McDonald s compete for workers with each other and with retailers such as Wal Mart Stores Inc  N WMT   which this month raised worker wages

136683,358198,YUM,Hate Uncertainty  Add This Top Dividend Stock To Your Portfolio,opinion,"It looks as though the second quarter of 2018 has gotten off to a disastrous start  Major markets are facing extreme volatility amid serious threats of a trade war between the world s two largest economies the U S  and China 
This is coming at a time when large cap tech stocks  which led the markets to record highs last year  are unlikely to repeat their performance this year  Amid this turmoil  for new investors whose objective is to build a nest egg by accruing a slow but steady income stream  picking appropriate stocks has become much more challenging 
For this type of investor  one of the best and safest strategies is buying  boring  companies  Research has shown that in the long run  stocks with low volatility and modest but steady growth models generally outperform growth stocks  Equities such as utilities  consumer staples and energy sector shares  provide risk adjusted returns  consistent dividends and steady earnings growth regardless of the state of the stock market 
If you re in for the long haul  with an eye toward building your retirement income  then this current market roller coaster shouldn t bother you  In this environment  the way to go is to scout for bargains in companies with strong competitive advantages 
With that theme in mind  here s my all time favorite stock  You can buy and hold it without worrying too much about the market s direction 

McDonald s Corporation
McDonald s  NYSE MCD  is a dividend stock you could hold on to for the next 50 years  My logic for such a bold call is simple  as long as McDonald s continues to pump out burgers you can be sure you ll be receiving your dividends  And I don t see that changing in any way for the foreseeable future 
Some of the most trustworthy names in the dividend world are the ones which sell very basic things like soda  electricity and cigarettes  These boring businesses rarely make the headlines in the financial press  but savvy long term investors have quietly been milking them every quarter for hefty payouts 
In this particular case  McDonald s has raised its dividend each and every year since the company began paying its first dividend in 1976  proving its global fast food business has the power to churn out cash no matter the economic or retail environment whether it s recessions  market turmoil or shifting consumer food preferences  That s the reason some investors call these businesses  forever assets   meaning you don t buy them to sell 
For McDonald s  the company s global scale and ongoing innovation are some of the key advantages that put them ahead of competitors  with a pretty big moat  Last year  the company did  91 billion in system wide sales  more than double that of its nearest competitor  Kentucky Fried Chicken  NYSE YUM   According to Forbes  McDonald s is currently the seventh most valuable brand in the world  with a brand value of  37 4 billion  By the end of last year  McDonald s was running 37 241 restaurants worldwide  including 14 036 in the U S  and 23 205 globally 
As part of Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook s turnaround strategy  McDonald s has been winning market share back through a variety of initiatives during the last few years That pushed its shares to all time highs early this year 
The major part of the company s growth strategy is to move away from restaurant ownership and grow their franchising  Already  80  of McDonald s restaurants are owned and operated by franchisees  but the company wants to increase that number to over 90  by the end of 2018 and ultimately to 95  as part of its cost cutting efforts 
The Bottom Line
Currently trading at  161 77 as of yesterday s close  MCD shares are down about 9  from their 52 week high  I think this dip offers a good buying opportunity for long term investors looking to add a solid dividend paying stock to their portfolio 
McDonald s pays quarterly dividends of  1 01 per share  At its current price  that translates to an annual dividend yield of 2 57   While the yield may not look that exciting to some investors  remember when you buy a stock such as McDonald s  you re doing so because you hate uncertainty  Your investment objective is to get paid each quarter through dividends and buybacks  And McDonald s has been doing exactly that for multiple decades ",2018-04-05,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-top-dividend-stock-for-investors-who-hate-uncertainty-200303216,200303216

The daily chart shows Yum Brands stock s entire rally since February 2016  As visible  its structure forms a clear five wave   labeled 1 2 3 4 5  The sub waves of wave 3 are not hard to identify as well  According to the theory  every impulse is followed by a three wave retracement in the opposite direction  In Yum  s case  it means a bearish reversal should soon give the start of a significant decline to at least  70 a share  In addition  the relative strength index shows a strong bearish  between waves 3 and 5  uncovering the weakness the bulls managed to keep in disguise since mid 2017 
If this count is correct  investors need to fasten their seat belts  because the anticipated three wave decline could erase about 20  of the company s market value  Besides  even fundamental measures like the price to earnings ratio  P E  and the price to free cash flow ratio  P FCF   which stand at 23 and 40  respectively  suggest Yum Brands stock is overvalued ",2018-04-30,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/yum-brands-stock-looking-at-a-20-correction-200310713,200310713

OSI is the U S  parent of Shanghai Husi Food  the factory at the heart of China s latest food safety scandal  That scare was triggered by a TV report alleging workers at Shanghai Husi Food used expired meat and doctored food production dates 
Regulators closed the plant on July 20  Police have detained five people  including Shanghai Husi s head and quality manager 
Burger King last week suspended the sale of any products from the Husi factories in Shanghai that supplied its restaurants and launched an investigation  Alix Salyers  a spokeswoman for the Miami based chain  said in an email 
 As a precaution  we have decided that we will no longer source any products from Husi or any of its related entities throughout China   Salyers said 
Burger King s China outlets might experience some temporary menu item shortages as a result  she added 
Yum Brands Inc  N YUM  the biggest Western restaurant operator in China with 6 400 restaurants  warned on Wednesday that the scare caused  significant  negative  damage to sales at KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in the period from July 20 through July 30 
After the scandal broke  Yum quickly cut all ties with OSI  which was not a significant supplier to the chain 
McDonald s Corp  N MCD   which has deep ties to OSI and was more dependent on the supplier  ended its relationship with OSI China  As a result  many of its 2 000 restaurants there have suffered meat shortages 
McDonald s Holdings Co Ltd  T 2702   the Japanese unit of the world s biggest restaurant chain  also withdrew its earnings guidance for the year after the scandal forced it to switch to alternative chicken supplies

136688,358203,YUM,U S  meat supplier OSI withdraws products made in Shanghai factory,news,"By Clare Baldwin HONG KONG  Reuters    U S  meat supplier OSI Group LLC  OSIGP UL  is withdrawing products made in a Shanghai factory from undisclosed outlets in the wake of a food safety scare last month that hit fast food chains McDonald s and Yum Brands Inc s KFC 
 While there have been no reported illnesses linked to any Shanghai Husi products  recovering this production is an important step in facilitating the investigations and rebuilding the respect and trust of our customers  the government and the people of China   OSI said in a statement late on Thursday 
OSI didn t say how much of Shanghai Husi Food Co s production would be withdrawn  nor from which outlets  OSI was not immediately available for comment beyond its published statement  and the Shanghai Food and Drug Administration regulator did not respond to requests for comment 
The scare was triggered by an undercover Chinese television report that showed workers at OSI s Shanghai Husi factory using expired meat and doctored food production dates  The factory was a supplier to McDonald s and Yum Brands  which have since said that the Husi scandal will have a material impact on earnings 
Yum has cut ties with OSI globally  McDonald s China and Hong Kong are no longer sourcing any products from OSI companies in China  and McDonald s in Japan has moved its sourcing to Thailand 
The scare  which has also involved restaurants in Hong Kong  Macau and Japan  is a sensitive issue for China  which has struggled to restore confidence in its  1 trillion food processing industry since six infants died in 2008 after drinking adulterated milk 
The withdrawal is a precautionary measure and is different from a recall which indicates a safety concern  said a person with direct knowledge of the situation  The person did not have permission to speak and did so on condition of anonymity 
Last month  OSI said an internal investigation had found practices at Shanghai Husi that were  absolutely inconsistent with our internal requirements   Workers at the plant also told Reuters hygiene standards at the factory were lacking  but production lines were temporarily cleaned up before inspectors arrived for pre scheduled audits 
OSI confirmed earlier this week that the Shanghai branch of China s Public Security Bureau has detained six Shanghai Husi employees  It said the Shanghai Food and Drug Administration and Shanghai Administration for Industry and Commerce had launched a joint investigation

U S  consumers have taken note  and so have food manufacturers and restaurant chains  More than a dozen companies have introduced new products or meals that are  enriched  or  fortified  with protein in the last few years  and the protein push is accelerating 
In July  Taco Bell  N YUM  started selling high protein meals  which contain Greek yogurt options and twice the meat as in its traditional burritos and bowls  In May  General Mills Inc  N GIS  introduced protein enriched Cheerios  which provided a bright spot at its Wednesday earnings call  In February  Kraft  O KRFT  started selling a  protein pack  with meat  cheese and nuts 
Protein has so far scored a big win for the companies  which are looking for new ways to beef up their profits as sales of traditional prepared foods slip and consumers seek healthier and fresher food options  The trend also has been a boon for the mostly Canadian  pulse  industry  which provides the dried seeds of peas  chickpeas  beans and lentils used to fortify many of these products 
Whether these protein enhanced products are actually healthier is another question  Soy  lentil and pea powder   extracted from those legumes and used in everything from pasta to milk   are  in fact  good sources of protein similar to steak or eggs  nutritionists said  But many of the products they are delivered in  such as granola  cereal and breakfast bars  are often high in fat  salt or sugar 
Besides  most Americans already get almost twice the daily protein they need  The average American consumes 79 grams a day of protein  but men only need 56 grams and women 46  according to the United States Department of Agriculture 
 Protein is not deficient in U S  diets   said Marion Nestle  professor of nutrition and public health at New York University   This is about marketing  
Some studies have said that because eating foods high in protein makes people feel fuller sooner  they tend to eat less and may be able to control their weight better  On the other hand  eating too much protein can lead to kidney disease  cancer and osteoporosis  while adults who eat diets high in animal protein are four times more likely to die of cancer and diabetes than those with low protein diets  according to a March 2014 study published in the journal Cell Metabolism 
To be sure  people would need to consume at least twice their recommended daily amount to potentially suffer serious health consequences  according to the USDA  The recommended amount is 0 8 grams per two pounds of weight  or 80 grams a day for a 200 pound man 
 Consumers think of protein as a hard working calorie   said General Mills Chairman and CEO Ken Powell in an interview with Reuters  That is fueling demand for everything from protein bars to Greek yogurt  he said   It s clearly an opportunity  
As the food industry scrambles to meet the demand  the effect has been felt along the supply chain  especially in Canada where most of the ground protein for U S  food makers is produced 
Canada produced a record 6 million tons of pulse in 2013  up from 4 5 million tons in 2012 and 4 3 million tons in 2011  according to Pulse Canada  an industry association that represents Canadian growers and processors  Privately held Best Cooking Pulses Inc in Portage la Prairie  Manitoba  has quadrupled its capacity in the last year  and opened a second plant to process the seeds 
 I see it being a fantastic opportunity   said Murad Al Katib  president and CEO of Alliance Grain Traders in Regina  Saskatchewan  one of the world s largest lentil and pea processing companies   Where we re seeing a lot of that growth is new product lines from major food companies    
BANKING ON PROTEIN
Food makers are eager to find new sources of revenue  Consumption of carbohydrate laden foods has fallen 5 percent in the United States while consumption of protein rich foods has risen 7 percent  according to a recent report by Credit Suisse investment analyst Robert Moskow 
Protein is becoming ubiquitous  It s piling up in extra meat servings at fast food restaurants and in everything from cereals to biscuits to cream cheese 
Dairy companies are even adding protein to milk  which already has about 8 grams per serving  Shamrock Farms  a Phoenix based milk producer  began selling its  Rockin  Refuel  muscle building milk in 2009 with added protein  The company is now expanding the line with additional sizes and flavors because of double digit sales growth 
Food makers also are repackaging existing products to appeal to protein seekers  For example  Kraft recently began selling its  P3 Portable Protein Pack   which features its Planters peanuts  Oscar Mayer luncheon meats and Kraft cheese in one package 
The company said the P3 is  one of our big bets  for 2014  It has  helped our business attract new consumers   said Kraft spokesman Basil Maglaris  who wouldn t provide sales numbers 
General Mills  which Wednesday reported lower than expected quarterly profit  is counting on its protein fortified snacks and expanded Yoplait Greek yogurt line to boost profits 
It plans to expand distribution of its recently introduced Cheerios Protein  fortified with soy and pea protein  which at 26 cents an ounce costs significantly more than the 19 cents an ounce traditional oat Cheerios 
Its Nature Valley protein bars  introduced in 2012  made over  100 million in sales in their first year  Its Yoplait Greek yogurt line  which contains twice the protein as generic yogurt  debuted in 2012 and in its first year netted  150 million in sales 
Morningstar equity analyst Erin Lash said these are impressive figures considering that 81 percent of new consumer packaged goods failed to hit  7 5 million in first year sales in 2011 
General Mills is counting on consumers like Maryland college student Madeleine Entwistle 
 I m cautious about the food I eat   said the 20 year old  who said she eats a couple of its Nature Valley protein bars a day   I would expect that it costs more because it has more nutrients  But I associate the foods as being better for me

136704,358219,YUM,Red Robin Banks On Sales Building Efforts  High Costs Rife ,opinion,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc    NASDAQ RRGB   has been bearing the brunt of high costs and soft consumer demand that is currently characterizing the U S  restaurant space  In order to counter these challenges  the company has undertaken various sales driving and cost cutting initiatives that seem encouraging 
Recently  this burger giant reported   where adjusted earnings of 78 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents by 41 8  and jumped a significant 122 9  year over year  The company has a good track record of earnings surprises in the recent past  wherein reported earnings have beat met consensus estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 23 17  
Also  Red Robin s shares have increased 18 6  in the past year  outpacing the  s gain of 11 9   Given its prudent growth initiatives  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company should keep performing well in the quarters ahead  You can see  
Initiatives to Increase Traffic   Sales Encouraging
With a viable business strategy  Red Robin has seen an uptick in revenues over the past few years  Despite a sluggish economic environment  the company has been posting year over year revenue growth since 2013 
This is attributable to the company s various traffic and sales building efforts  which also include consistent digital initiatives  In fact  owing to menu innovation  value offerings  increasing service speed  effective marketing strategy  remodeling programs and online ordering business  the company witnessed 17 5  year over year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2017  
To drive traffic and sales  Red Robin has improved its seating efficiency and lowered guests  waiting times  Moreover  it has rolled out its Kitchen Display System  KDS  that is linked to table management software  This is expected to result in annual sales growth of approximately  50 million as kitchens can handle higher peak volumes 
The company s remodeling initiatives are expected to boost its potential as a brand as well as improve guest experience  which in turn should drive revenues  Among the brand revitalization initiatives  the company is focused on menu innovation  operational improvement and making a better customer service platform 
In addition  Red Robin focuses on promotional and limited time offers to increase revenues  Moreover  key long term growth driver for the company is its guest loyalty program   Red Robin Royalty   initiated in 2011 with a goal to increase guest count  The company engages its guests through this program with offers designed to increase frequency of visits 
Furthermore  the company is set to grow its off premise  online ordering business via carry out  delivery and catering  The growing demand for off premise orders are resulting in higher traffic  In the fourth quarter of 2017  Red Robin delivered 8 3  mix in off premise  up 45  year over year 
On the delivery front  the company has partnerships with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   DoorDash and GrubHub  In fact  it is working with each provider to better integrate into its POS and KDS systems and ease the intricacy in operations teams  Also  curbside delivery is now available at more than 60  of its locations  The company is thus moving smartly on new revenue streams and expects off premise orders to become growth engine in the long run as it begins to actively promote the new offerings  reach more guests  thereby driving improved profitability 
Strategic Moves to Counter High Costs
Red Robin witnessed rising costs and expenses throughout the majority of 2017  mainly due to higher labor costs  The company is also investing heavily in several sales building initiatives like advertising and technical upgrades  which will result in elevated costs  Remodeling and restaurant maintenance also add to the already rising expenses 
In order to cut these high costs and improve margins  Red Robin outlined a go forward plan known as RED2  The primary objective of this initiative is doubling the company s EBITDA by 2020  The company is focusing on new supply chain management software  replacing its older manual system  This would result in improved control of waste and cost of goods  significantly reducing inventory levels at the restaurants 
Notably  in the last reported quarter  restaurant level operating profit margin expanded 70 basis points  bps  to 20 5  due to controlled expenses under the company s strategic plans 
Limited International Presence   Domestic Contraction Pose Concerns
American dining brands are keen to expand in the fast growing emerging markets outside the United States  While several other restaurateurs  including Yum  Brands   NYSE YUM    McDonald s   NYSE MCD   and Domino s   NYSE DPZ    have opened their outlets in the emerging markets  Red Robin seems to be weak on this front  Also  due to insufficient profit generation  the company has given up on its Burger Works fast casual concept  a small non traditional prototype with limited menu and services

136708,358223,YUM,McDonald s  KFC Still Popular In China After Food Scandal,news,"By    The China branches of fast food chains McDonald s  NYSE MCD   KFC  and Pizza Hut  have suspended their local supplier after allegations that the Shanghai based company was using expired meat for their products  For Kentucky based Yum  Brands Inc  NYSE YUM   owner of KFC and Pizza Hut  this most recent scandal adds to a long list of problems in China  
McDonald s and Yum have both announced that their China operations have stopped buying meat from Shanghai Husi Food Company  according to their respective microblog posts on Chinese social media on Sundayy  The statements were prompted by an investigative report by Shanghai based news company Dragon TV  The report accused the company of altering the expiration date on its meat products sold to the international fast food chains  as evidenced by an email allegedly sent to employees asking to extend the expiry date of 10 tons of frozen beef   Both restaurant chains apologized to consumers  adding that there would likely be shortages of some specific products 
Yum said that Husi meat was only supplied to branches in the southern province of Fujian  and also specifically identified its sausage and egg sandwich and its  spicy roasted burger  as two products that will affected by the expired meat allegations  A local Chinese fast food chain  Dicos  has also taken its selection of breakfast sandwiches off the menu 
KFC  which is the most popular international fast food joint in the country  seemed to be unaffected by the reports the following day  According to Chinese news source iFeng  KFC and McDonald s outlets were still brimming with customers at lunch time on Monday  One customer  going only by his last name Wang  was unfazed by the claims  Wang told reporters that he had not heard of accusations  and he would continue to eat there in the future  Another customer by the last name Lei  who said he dines at McDonald s frequently for lunch  said that he had heard about the chain using expired food but that since food safety problems are so prevalent in China  McDonald s is at least more trustworthy than other random restaurants 
On Chinese social media platform Weibo  however  the KFC and McDonald s scandal was in the top four trending topics  and the conversation was less forgiving 

 Is this what improved food safety standards are supposed to look like   one blogger said  in reference to China s newest efforts to improve overall food safety regulations which were announced last month 
  Did we really need another reason not to eat fast food  How disgusting   another blogger said 
 This is a shame because both business are quite successful and popular in China  but even with great business practice you must have a safe product   another user wrote 
 KFC seems to have many lives  how many scandals can it survive   asked another one  In the past  KFC in China has suffered from separate supplier issues  Aside from a market skittish about chicken products as a result of the recent bird flu scares  the company s local chicken supplier was investigated after its products were found to have high levels of antibiotics ",2014-07-21,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/mcdonald's,-kfc-still-popular-in-china-after-food-scandal-296493",296493
136709,358224,YUM,McDonald s China Will Likely Continue Using Scandal Ridden Food Supplier,news,"By    The Chinese stores of McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  will allegedly continue using food from plants owned by its scandal ridden supplier  OSI Group LLC  because the meat is still considered better than local alternatives  Unlike fast food conglomerate Yum  Brands Inc   NYSE YUM   which owns the KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants and has cut all ties with the supplier  McDonald s is responding to the scandal by using a different OSI plant 
According to an anonymous source within McDonald s  the fast food giant is switching from OSI s Shanghai Husi Food Co  plant  to an OSI owned plant  Henan Husi  in China s central Henan province  The Shanghai plant has been hit by widely publicized allegations of supplying local fast food chains with expired meat 
 For us  it is risky to find a local supplier to guarantee the quality  and the risk may even higher  not sticking with OSI    the McDonald s source told China Business News   Moreover  OSI has made a promise about the quality and safety  of future products   
McDonald s will rely on Henan Husi and a third undisclosed Husi plant to fulfill its meat supply needs until all of the supply chain can be moved to the Henan Husi factory   OSI  which is also currently under fire for separate violations in its American factories   is insuring that the Henan Husi plant will be up to par with the company s food standards  The Henan Husi factory has reportedly undergone an inspection by local Chinese authorities and been found to have no food or safety issues  Sheldon Lavin  the CEO of OSI  described the Henan plant as one of the company s  newest state of the art  facilities  according to the report 
 McDonald s vice president of global media relations  Heidi Barker Sa Shekem  did not confirm to the International Business Times that the company would continue its relationship with the local Husi suppliers in the new Henan location 

 The investigation continues and we are closely monitoring the situation   Sa Shekem said via email about the recently revealed OSI scandal   When asked specifically if the scandal hit supplier was still considered to be a less risky option compared to other local options  Sa Shekem responded   We require all of our suppliers to follow rigorous quality and food safety standards everywhere we do business  
Considering OSI s long relationship with McDonald s  which began in 1955 when OSI became McDonald s first beef supplier  such reports are not far fetched   While we are stunned and disappointed by the situation in Shanghai  together with our supplies  we stand on McDonald s decades long proven track record of food safety around the globe   Sa Shekem said ",2014-07-25,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mcdonald's-china-will-likely-continue-using-scandal-ridden-food-supplier-298097,298097
136712,358227,YUM,Scandal Embroiled OSI s History Of Alleged Labor Violations,news,"By    The American meat processing conglomerate at the center of a food safety scandal in Asia that led to recalls of products sold by McDonald s and KFC has for years confronted another challenge at home  a series of allegations that it violates federal labor standards 
OSI Group LLC has been at the center of intense international scrutiny since July 20  when Chinese regulators shuttered OSI s Shanghai Husi Food Co  Ltd  meat processing plant after a local TV station aired an investigation revealing that Shanghai Husi had sold tainted meat to fast food chains in Asia 
But the Aurora  Illinois based company s American subsidiaries have long been plagued by lawsuits alleging that it violated employees  rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act  FMLA  by penalizing or firing workers for taking time off to recover from injuries or for maternity leave 
Chinese authorities detained five individuals connected to the company just days after the report revealed that Shanghai Husi sold expired meat and meat that had fallen on the floor to several fast food chains  including McDonald s NYSE MCD and Yum Brands NYSE YUM owned KFC  that then distributed the products to restaurants from China to Japan 
The company responded swiftly  posting a July 23 statement on the OSI website in which chairman and CEO Sheldon Lavin apologized for the scandal in China 
 For more than 100 years  OSI has provided safe  quality food and is currently operating at the highest standards in 17 countries serving more than 40 countries around the world   the statement read  The company announced on July 27 that it had recalled all Shanghai Husi products 
On July 23  International Business Times revealed allegations of food safety and labor safety violations by former employees of OSI s West Chicago  Illinois  meat plant  which reportedly produces more than five million beef patties per day 
In an emailed response  the company said on Friday that the claims were  unconfirmed allegations by someone whom we believe to be a disgruntled former employee  and unconfirmed allegations by an anonymous source   The statement also said that  OSI s West Chicago facility firmly upholds our commitment to food quality and safety  We have zero tolerance for the actions alleged in the IBT story  and will thoroughly investigate the claims  
According to court documents reviewed by IBTimes  the type of labor violation    particularly failure to comply with the FMLA    alleged by one of the former West Chicago plant workers has also been at the center of lawsuits against other OSI operated facilities across the country 
OSI Group is an international holding company under which a number of subsidiaries operate in more than 40 countries  With about 19 500 employees and revenues of  5 9 billion  it was the the 62nd largest privately held American company in December 2013  according to Forbes 
Its U S  operations are conducted under the name OSI Industries LLC  and include meat processing plants in Illinois  Iowa  Utah and Wisconsin  OSI s American operations also encompass a number of other subsidiaries  including South Carolina chicken producer Amick Farms and Wisconsin meat producer Fair Oaks Farms 
Over the past 15 years  former employees have filed a number of lawsuits detailing alleged labor violations at OSI Group  OSI Industries and other OSI operated companies 
One complaint seen in multiple cases is that the company allegedly did not allow an employee to take enough time off to recover from injuries  including those sustained on the job  a type of leave covered under the FMLA 
 In any company of our size  there may be occasions where policies aren t carried out     even when clear guidance is given   an OSI spokesman said Tuesday in an emailed response to an inquiry about the allegations   If that happens at OSI  we want to know about it as soon as possible so that we can take corrective action  
In one ongoing lawsuit  former Amick Farms worker Ysrael Julien alleges that the company violated his rights under the FMLA when it fired him for taking time off work to recover from serious injuries he sustained in a June 2013 car accident 
The Delaware man  who worked at Amick s poultry processing plant in Hurlock  Maryland  for 25 years  alleges in the complaint he filed against the company last month that his doctor first ordered him to take five weeks  leave from his job there after the accident 
Amick accommodated the request  but when his physician ordered him to take another two weeks off work at the conclusion of the five weeks because he had not yet been fully rehabilitated  Julien alleges in the court filing that  Human Resources refused to comply and told him to get his doctor to reinstate him immediately  As neither his doctor nor he was willing to put him at medical risk  he stayed off work per doctor s orders  and then  on August 23  received a letter stating he was terminated effective August 7  
Julien alleges that his firing was unlawful under the FMLA  and he stated in the complaint that he has  filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission     alleging he was retaliated against in part because of his disability and was denied a reasonable accommodation  

OSI stated in response to an inquiry by IBTimes that  following his termination  some previously unknown facts were brought to light in connection with Mr  Julien s lawsuit  We and Mr  Julien recognized that some miscommunications occurred between the Company and Mr  Julien that would have had a bearing on the Company s termination decision  As a result  the Company and Mr  Julien are currently in the process of resolving this matter and getting him back to work with the Company  
Julien s case  which had not been resolved as of July 30  is not an isolated one  as similar allegations have cropped up both at Amick and a number of other OSI owned facilities 
Anthony Haupfear  an inmate at Lower Savannah Pre Release Center in South Carolina  who worked at Amick Farms as part of a prison pre release work program  filed suit against Amick Farms and its human resources director  Anissa Turner  in February 2009  The case was eventually dismissed without prejudice  but Haupfear s claims were similar to Julien s 
He alleged in a court filing that he badly injured his wrist while lifting an eighty pound tub of chicken at the Amick facility on Sept  2  2008  and was ordered by a doctor not to do any heavy lifting until his wrist healed  But Haupfear alleged he was told that Amick said the injury led directly to his firing and that   because it was my fault  that  is why  I was fired   concluding that  my job was taken because of my injury  
Haupfear said in his complaint against the company that he hoped his suit would help ensure  that this business will not continue to do people this away  sic   
Former West Chicago OSI plant worker Rosa Maria Ramirez said in an interview last week that OSI consistently committed labor violations in order to ensure high productivity at the plant  She echoed Julien and Haupfear s claims  alleging that she was pressured by OSI to work while injured  though she was not fired because she worked through the pain 
 I ve hurt myself there multiple times  I did something to my shoulder a couple of times  but they forced me to come back to work   she said    OSI s  doctor said I was fine and if I did not come back to work I would be fired  My doctor said I needed surgery  
The extent of alleged FMLA violations by OSI s companies has not been limited to employees being terminated in connection with injuries 
Chicago resident Carla Washington sued OSI Industries on April 13  2001  alleging that she was demoted by the company after she returned from maternity leave in 2009 
  O n September 20  1999  Carla Washington returned from her maternity leave  In violation of the FMLA  and the regulations enforcing the Act  she was not reinstated to her position of recruiter or an equivalent position   the complaint alleged  Instead  the job had been reassigned to a temporary worker and Washington was assigned a temporary position  learning about the positions of other employees  and doing  clerical work which was not previously a job duty   she alleged in the complaint 
The complaint went on to allege that   o n October 19  1999  Carla Washington was told by her immediate supervisor that she was being discharged  in violation of U S  code  Court records show that the suit was dismissed with prejudice and without costs on Oct  10  2011 
According to an article in Bench   Bar of Minnesota  the Minnesota State Bar Association s official publication  lawsuits claiming FMLA violations are on the decline nationwide 
 In the last decade  the  Department of Labor  has handled between 1 800 and 3 500 FMLA cases annually  with the number generally decreasing   the article states   The agency finds a violation in roughly half of those cases  resulting in back wages to employees totaling between  1 5 million and  3 7 million per year  trending closer to the  1 5 million figure in the last several years  The downward trend likely reflects a better understanding of the FMLA requirements by human resources professionals and management personnel  ",2014-07-30,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/scandal-embroiled-osi's-history-of-alleged-labor-violations-299288,299288
136714,358229,YUM,Yum says China food safety scare hurting KFC  Pizza Hut sales,news," Reuters    Yum Brands Inc  N YUM  on Wednesday said a television expose showing improper meat handling by one of its Chinese suppliers caused  significant  negative  damage to sales at its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants over the past 10 days 
 If the significant sales impact is sustained  it will have a material effect on full year earnings per share   Yum said in a regulatory filing 
Shares in Yum  which counts China as its No  1 market  tumbled 6 1 percent in extended trading  down  4 45 to  68 55 
The latest food safety scandal to rock China came as Yum s restaurant sales there had just begun recovering from a slide last year due to an avian food outbreak and a food safety scare

136737,358252,YUM,When Is McDonald s Responsible  Or Not  For How Its Franchisees Operate  ,news,"By    McDonald s workers have filed class action suits in three states alleging the world s largest fast food chain engages in a several methods to keep payroll expenses down  including practices that violate federal labor laws such as not paying overtime  removing hours from their timecards and ordering them on and off the clock depending on consumer demand while expecting them to remain nearby to clock in when needed    
The suits target Oak Brook  Ill  based McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD   its U S  subsidiary and franchise operators at a time when the nation is paying increased attention to low hourly wage practices by publicly listed companies  McDonald s was targeted  the lawyers involved in the cases said  because of its outsized presence in the services industry  but they didn t rule out future suits against other major quick service restaurant chains like Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM   which owns KFC  Taco Bell and Pizza Hut 

The seven lawsuits  including one in Los Angeles County Superior Court that was amended  could affect about 30 000 current and former employees  including about 25 000 in California  The suits were announced Thursday by lawyers representing the workers and labor rights activists  supported by the Service Employees International Union  demanding that quick service restaurant chains pay their employees at least  15 an hour 
 McDonald s and our independent owner operators share a concern and commitment to the well being and fair treatment of all people who work in McDonald s restaurants   the company said by email on Thursday   McDonald s and our independent franchisees are committed to undertaking a comprehensive investigation of the allegations and will take any necessary actions as they apply to our respective organizations  
The suits all contend that the parent corporation shares responsibility for all McDonald s outlets even if they re independently owned  Most of the company s more than 14 000 outlets are independently owned franchises  McDonald s Corporation brought in  9 3 billion from its franchised restaurants last year  a 3 percent increase from the previous year  according to the company s regulatory filing  It paid out  3 1 billion in stock dividends in the same period 
 If McDonald s is going to engage with a very low capitalized franchisee and impose a lot of restrictions and fees and other requirements  it can t do that without being held responsible for any violations that happen   said Catherine Ruckelshaus  general counsel at the National Employment Law Project  during a Thursday conference call   These lawsuits could send an important message to franchisors and any other entities that insert businesses or individuals between them and their workers that they need to do that responsibly  
The franchise system  says some labor rights activists  is used by the fast food industry to separate the corporate parent from policies carried out by individual operators 
 Two industries that I could name off the top of my head  that have similar systems  are farming and garment   said Jim Reif  of Gladstein  Reif and Meginniss  an attorney who filed the New York suit on Thursday   In farming you have an entity called a farm labor contractor who is supposed to be the middleman that the farmer uses to try to insulate himself from the farmworkers  In garment you have the sweatshop operator who the garment manufacturer tries to use to insulate the manufacturer form the workers in the sweatshop  This is a recurring theme in a lot of different industries  
But the lawyers bringing these suits contend that McDonald s is more involved in franchise operations than it s willing to admit  For example  they say both corporate owned and franchise outlets are connected by a software labor tracking network that monitors the ratio of sales to revenue in real time and warns store managers when specific employees are approaching overtime eligibility 
Here s a rundown of the seven suits 
California
Four lawsuits in California claim McDonald s and its franchisors failed to pay overtime when it was due  altered pay records and deprived their hourly low wage workers of timely meal and rest breaks  One of the suits against makes similar claims on behalf of an estimated 25 000 McDonald s employees in the state 
Michigan
Two lawsuits in Michigan against McDonald s  its U S  subsidiaries and two franchise operators running a combined 21 McDonald s outlets in Metro Detroit claim that workers were expected to show up at a certain time and then at times asked to wait until enough customers show up before clocking in  The suits allege workers are also asked to clock out for extended periods under corporate provided software that monitors the ratio of sales to labor costs in real time  When the ratio dips below a corporate set target  workers are asked to clock out and wait until the ratio meets a specific target  While these wait times are considered off the clock  the suit claims it violates federal laws because employees are tethered to the store and must remain on the premises or close enough to clock in on short notice  Therefore when accounting for these period of down time and factoring it into the workers hourly rate  their hourly wage average dips below the local minimum wage rate  which would be a violation of federal labor law  The Michigan suits also claim these workers  who earn between Michigan s  7 40 an hour minimum and  7 50 an hour  are forced to buy their own uniforms  a cost that would push some workers  wages below the minimum hourly rate 
New York
In the suit filed in New York federal court claims workers were required to wash their own uniforms at their own expense without compensation  These outfits  part of the company s branding  must typically be washed three or four times a week separately from other clothes because of the cooking grease and smell  The suit contends this is a violation of a New York state requirement that employers compensate employees for the cost of uniform maintenance  Since many of these workers make the  8 state minimum wage  the cost of washing the uniforms also would push the wage below the legal limit if washing the clothes were considered a work related expense ",2014-03-13,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/when-is-mcdonald’s-responsible-(or-not)-for-how-its-franchisees-operate -272046,272046

facing a new food safety scare in China  denting the fast food companies  efforts to shore up reputations and businesses that were hurt by a 2012 safety scandal in one of their biggest markets   McDonald s and KFC parent Yum apologized to customers on Monday after Chinese regulators shut a local meat supplier following a TV report that showed workers picking up meat from a factory floor  as well as mixing meat beyond its expiration date with fresh meat   The companies said they immediately stopped using the supplier  Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd  a unit of Aurora  Illinois based OSI Group  and had switched to alternates  They added that the factory served restaurants in the Shanghai area   The report on China s Dragon TV brought Yum and McDonald s back into the firing line following the sales battering 2012 scandal that involved chicken pumped with excessive amounts of antibiotics    We will not tolerate any violations of government laws and regulations from our suppliers   said Yum China  which required all of its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants to seal up and stop using all meat materials supplied by the Husi factory   The division  Yum s No  1 business unit  had just seen its KFC restaurants bounce back from the double whammy of the food safety scare and a bird flu outbreak    If proven  the practices outlined in the reports are completely unacceptable to McDonald s

biggest market as measured in number of restaurants    I think this is going to be really challenging for both these firms   said Benjamin Cavender  Shanghai based principal at China Market Research

tempt cost conscious diners with healthy  home grown fare    Both companies said they are investigating the issues highlighted in the report and said that switching suppliers will cause some temporary product shortages   News of the scare spread quickly to diners negotiating Shanghai s lunch hour rush on Monday    For now I won t go to eat at McDonald s or KFC  at least until this whole thing settles down   said Xu Xinyu  24  a financial services worker  eating at a noodle shop near a McDonald s outlet in downtown Shanghai   Yet Chinese consumers may already have developed a comparatively thick skin when it comes to food scandals   Isn t everywhere like this   asked student Li Xiaoye  20  eating a beef burger in a Shanghai McDonald s outlet   I ll keep going because wherever I eat  the

 Food safety is the most important thing for McDonald s  and we always strictly abide by national laws and regulations and related standards to ensure consumers can enjoy our products at ease   McDonald s said in the statement 
According to China s official Xinhua news agency  the Chinese government suspended operations of Shanghai Husi after local media reported Monday that the company was selling meat beyond the expiration date  A representative of OSI Group also confirmed that the company is under investigation  the Wall Street Journal reported 
The incident is considered a fresh setback for both McDonald s and Yum after the companies were hit by a food safety scandal in China about 18 months ago 

In December 2012  Shanghai authorities said that tests conducted from 2010 to 2011 by a third party agency found high levels of antibiotics in eight batches of chicken supplied to Yum  China s biggest fast food chain  by Liuhe Group  which also supplied meat to McDonald s in China at the time 
 I think this is going to be really challenging for both these firms  and especially for Yum   Benjamin Cavender  a Shanghai based principal at China Market Research Group  told Reuters   Yum had just started rebuilding credibility and had some decent sales news which just came out for the second quarter  I think this is going to really set them back  ",2014-07-21,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mcdonald’s,-yum-suspend-meat-purchase-from-chinese-supplier-296319",296319

 NEW YORK  Oct 4  Reuters    U S  stock index futures fell
on Tuesday  a day after equities hit 13 month lows  as European
officials considered making banks take bigger losses on Greek
debt and on expectations Greece would default soon 
 Wall Street has fallen for the past two sessions and the
broad S P 500 index was on the verge of entering bear market
territory as investors feared that the crisis in Europe could
make a recession more likely in the United States 
 To add to market pessimism  Goldman Sachs cut its gross
domestic product outlook for advanced economies for 2012 
seeing growth of 1 3 percent versus its previous view of 2 1
percent 
  The main driver of our shift in views has been the
escalation of bank funding stress in the Euro area  alongside
deeper public budget cuts in a number of European countries  
Goldman said in a note 
 The STOXX Europe 600 Banking Index  sank 4 percent
on Tuesday while Franco Belgian bank Dexia  dropped 14
percent to a record low in intraday because of its Greek
exposure  European shares tumbled 3 4 percent    EU 
 U S  banks were likely to remain in focus and continue to
be pressured by the same issue  On Monday  Morgan Stanley
 closed at its lowest since December 2008 
 European finance ministers were considering making banks
take bigger losses on Greek debt and delayed a vital aid
payment to Athens until mid November  setting up a crunch point
in the region s sovereign debt crisis  For details  see

  The economy is in a protracted slowdown  and until there s
a resolution with Greece  that situation will continue to
linger over the market   said Robert Pavlik  chief market
strategist at Banyan Partners LLC in New York   This could turn
into a self fulfilling prophecy of recession  
 S P 500 futures  fell 11 9 points and were below fair
value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures  sank 116

 The benchmark S P is down 19 4 percent and near bear market
territory  which would be a 20 percent decline from a high set

136770,358285,YUM,American Eagle Outfitters  Regis  McDonald s And Yum  Brands As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 26  2017    highlights American Eagle Outfitters   NYSE AEO   as the Bull of the Day and Regis Corporation   NYSE RGS   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on McDonald s Corp    NYSE MCD   and Yum  Brands  Inc    NYSE YUM   Here is a synopsis of all four stocks   The struggles of traditional retailers have been well documented  and basically no mall based chains have been immune to the industry shifting changes in consumer shopping habits  Nevertheless  some companies have adapted better than others  American Eagle Outfitters is one of those companies American Eagle Outfitters is a specialty retailer of casual apparel  accessories  and footwear for men and women between the ages of 16 and 34  The company sources  designs  and markets a line of clothing classics like jeans  khakis  and T shirts under its American Eagle Outfitters and AE brand names for exclusive sale in its stores and e commerce marketplaces Two weeks ago  American Eagle reported quarterly earnings that missed our consensus estimate  However  the report included several encouraging results and solid guidance  Shares have surged about 13  since the earnings announcement  This report also ushered in a number of positive estimate revisions  helping the stock earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Latest Earnings ResultsAmerican Eagle reported its third quarter earnings results on December 6  The company posted earnings of 37 cents per share  which missed our consensus estimate of 39 cents and slumped about 9 8  year over year However  total net revenues increased about 2 1  and marked record quarterly sales for the company  Consolidated comps increased 3  an improvement to the 2  comps growth witnessed in the year ago period  These Q3 results represented the company s 11th consecutive quarter of positive comps Even more importantly  American Eagle s e commerce business exhibited impressive expansion  Online sales exhibited growth in the high teens and represented about 25  of the company s total revenues But American Eagle did mention some positive trends at its brick and mortar locations  In fact  management said that traffic and transactions improved in the quarter  Brand wise  comps rose 19  at the company s aerie stores and inched up 1  at AE brand outlets The company also noted that its positive momentum continued into the fourth quarter  with sales of Black Friday and Cyber Monday exceeding expectations  American Eagle anticipates Q4 comps to increase in the mid single digits  Earnings are expected to fall in the range of  0 42 to  0 44 per share  While personal service companies like salons and barbershops are technically lumped into the broader retail sector  these operations have the benefit of being  un Amazon able   However  an improved economy has sparked a trend toward higher quality brands in this space  leaving low budget options like Regis Corporation in the dust Regis Corporation owns  franchises and operates beauty salons  Regis  corporate and franchised locations operate under concepts such as Supercuts  SmartStyle  MasterCuts  Regis Salons  Sassoon Salon  Cost Cutters and First Choice Haircutters This company has a lackluster earnings performance history and has witnessed declining earnings estimates  The stock is currently a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and should probably be avoided as we head towards the New Year Latest Results and OutlookIn early November  Regis posted its latest quarterly results  The company reported earnings of 10 cents per share  missing our consensus estimate of 13 cents  Regis also posted revenues of  310 million  missing our consensus estimate of  334 million and declining from the  431 million reported in the year ago period  The company has now missed estimates twice this year Since this lackluster report  estimates for the company s upcoming fiscal periods have moved lower  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current quarter is now nine cents lower than it was just 60 days ago  We now expect Regis to witness just breakeven earnings in the current quarter Key StatsWhat may be more concerning than the company s shaky earnings picture is its worrying balance sheet  Regis  cash flow is retreating at a rate of 3 74  right now  and its total liabilities at the end of the most recent quarter were  528 million  up from  505 million at the end of year ago period The stock has a Forward P E of 83 00  meaning that its share are trading at a significant premium compared its earnings outlook  RGS has earned an  A  grade in our Growth category  but that is mostly due to softer year over year earnings comparisons  And the stock is sporting a PEG of 11 86  so investors are not getting a great price for that earnings expansion Additional content McDonald s vs  Yum  Brands  Which Is the Tastier Stock The restaurant industry has been lacking zing over the past few quarters  Negative comps resulting from sluggish traffic  along with rising costs  continue to take the shine out of restaurant stocks Nevertheless  some of the big names like McDonald s Corp  and Yum  Brands  Inc  have done well on the back of strong fundamentals and innovative offerings In fact  McDonald s and Yum  Brands are two companies that have adopted a de risking strategy  dropping their ownership of restaurants through refranchising  This reduces capital requirements  boosts earnings per share growth and makes them less vulnerable to food inflation In addition  growing free cash flow allows both the companies to make investments for increasing brand recognition and shareholder returns With both carrying a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   let s find out which company is placed better with respect to some key parameters You can see  Share Price MovementYear to date  McDonald s has had a more impressive run on the bourse with a return of 41 2  while Yum  Brands has gained 30 3  in the last year  Notably  both have outperformed the  that has rallied 14 4  in the same time frame Projected Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  Earnings growth is definitely necessary and it along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company s strong prospects Both McDonald s and Yum  brands have their own initiatives in place to boost earnings  While McDonald s is keen on operational excellence  product innovation  offering a value menu and rolling out more limited time offerings  Yum  Brands is working on a strategic transformation plan to drive growth at KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands  It is also shifting toward a single point of sale system in the United States Yum  Brands is expected to see higher earnings growth than McDonald s in 2018  Its EPS is projected to grow 13 1  while that of McDonald s is expected to increase 6 8    So  Yum  Brands has an edge over McDonald s in this respect Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and manufacturing efficiency  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors Both McDonald s and Yum  Brands have outperformed the industry year to date  which has a net margin TTM of 15 8   However  McDonald s has a lead since its TTM net margin is higher at 22 4   compared with Yum  Brands 16 1 ValuationThe EV EBITDA ratio offers a clear picture of a company s valuation and its earnings potential  Typically  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  This signals that a stock is undervalued Both McDonald s and Yum  Brands are overvalued relative to their broader industry that has an EV EBIDA value of 13 8  However  McDonald s holds the edge here with a lower EV EBITDA value of 16 1  compared to Yum  Brands  19 8 Earnings History  ESP and EstimatesBoth McDonald s and Yum  Brands have delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the prior four quarters  While McDonald s has an average earnings surprise of 5 2   Yum  stands out with an average earnings surprise of 7 8  However  McDonald s of  0 54  lends it an edge over Yum  Brands  which has an Earnings ESP of  7 04  While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald s full year has increased 0 15  over the last 30 days  it has remained unchanged in case of Yum  Brands over the same time frame To ConcludeOur comparative analysis reveals that McDonald s has an edge over Yum  Brands in terms of share price movement  net margin  EV EBITA ratio  Earnings ESP and estimate revisions  Yum  Brands  on the other hand  is better poised than McDonald s in terms of projected EPS and boasts a solid earnings surprise track record So  with a lead in most of the evaluated metrics  McDonald s  appears to take precedence at the moment Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums

outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 10 straight quarters now  with a trailing four quarter average of 18 4  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement What Does the Zacks Model Unveil Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Herbalife this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive

release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 10 and  4 50 for the second quarter and 2017 has remained stable in the last 30 days and this reflects a year over year decline of 14 7  and 7 2   respectively Furthermore  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  1 14 billion for the second quarter  down 5  from the year ago period  However  revenues of  4 59 billion are anticipated for the full year  which is up 2 2  from 2016 Factors at PlayHerbalife has recently come under the scanner after some law firms like Faruqi   Faruqi  LLP and Lundin Law PC declared investigation related to possible violations of federal securities laws against the company  It should also be noted that on Jun 4  this California based company  slashed its sales guidance  which was raised during first quarter 2017 conference call  This was due to the new tougher Federal Trade Commission rules in the U S  that are expected to hurt company s business more than anticipated  Also  softness in its Mexico operations and distributors adopting the latest protocols are expected to dent sales in the to be reported quarter The company now expects sales to decline in the range of 2 6  from 0 5 4 5   guided earlier  Also  volumes are anticipated to decrease 4 8  compared with previous range of 1 5  for the second quarter  Management too expects the quarter to be a challenging one in 2017 compared with the year ago quarter  Currency is also likely to hurt its results Notably  Herbalife has been battling with billionaire investor Bill Ackman since Dec 2012  when Ackman made a  1 billion bet against the nutrition company  accusing it of being a pyramid scheme i e  it employs deceptive marketing practices for improving business  Also  it received a civil investigative demand in 2014 from the FTC related to its marketing practices Though the company resolved the probe with the FTC and paid  200 million through fines and settlements without being named a pyramid scheme  it was forced to prove that 80  of its annual sales come from documented consumer purchases  Interestingly  the company outpaced the key threshold of 80  under its agreement with the U S  Federal Trade Commission  It announced that 90  of the U S  sales in May were documented purchases  which consisted of over three million receipted retail transactions In fact  Herbalife has remained upbeat about its prospects

A look into Haverty Furniture s stock performance  reveals that its shares have been underperforming the  for the last six months  In the said time frame  the stock has increased 3 9   compared with the industry s growth of 23 4  

Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement 
Factors at Play 
On Jul 10  the company reported second quarter sales figures  wherein it recorded improved sales of 1 1  year over year  Though growth was backed by higher average ticket and custom upholstery and accessories sales along with increased internet traffic  it was offset by the sluggish consumer traffic  However  second quarter sales growth was also much weaker than the preceding quarter s recorded figure of 3  
Comparable store sales were down 0 2  for the second quarter  weaker than the comparable store sales growth of 1 6  in the first quarter  The company believes that the quarter s sales were hurt due to a delay in Easter  Haverty Furniture stores remained closed for Easter  which was in April this year versus March last year 
Post the adjustment in Easter shift  written comparable store sales for the second quarter were down 0 7   lower than the 4 5  growth reported last year for full second quarter 2016  Written sales for the second quarter were up 0 6   compared with preceding quarter s written sales growth of 1 0  
Despite sluggish written comparable sales  the company remains encouraged by new merchandises that are expected to flourish stores over the coming weeks through summer  The company believes that business will benefit as housing strengthens in the region and the general economy improves  We also remain encouraged by the solid fundamentals of the company and its solid store expansion plans to strengthen its presence in key markets with additional or repositioned stores  Moreover  the company is making innovations with respect to its technology developments  Also  its shareholder friendly moves are noteworthy 
Which Way Are Estimates Trending 
Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and 2017 has been declining for the last 30 days  However  the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents per share and  1 23 for the second quarter and full year 2017 reflect a year over year decline of 20 8  and 5 8   respectively 
Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  191 8 million for the said quarter  down 1 5  from the year ago period  For 2017  Zacks consensus revenue is pegged at  843 2 million  reflecting a 2 6  year over year increase Haverty Furniture Companies  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Haverty Furniture is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Haverty Furniture has an Earnings ESP of  5 26  as the Most Accurate estimate is 18 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 19 cents  Moreover  the company carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions

Chesapeake Energy 2Q 17 earnings
Chesapeake Energy 2Q 17 earnings are expected to amount to 14 cents per share on  1 06 billion in sales  The company s stock price has been languishing in the  5 per share range for some time  held down first by management problems and now by low energy prices  Debt also remains an issue for Chesapeake Energy  as its debt levels dwarf its  4 2 billion market capitalization  It seems most of the bankruptcy concerns have passed  although what the company really needs is for oil prices to rebound

Nomura analysts raised their price target for the company in a note to investors earlier this week  boosting it from  78 to  85 per share on expected strength  Because they feel that Yum  Brands will end up having better than expected sales momentum this year  they raised their target multiple for the stock  They continue to rate the fast food chain operator as a Buy and said they believe full year earnings for this year to be  2 80 per share  an increase of 6 cents from their previous estimate

136904,358419,YUM,5 China Stocks For Profits In Second Half Of 2017,opinion,"On Jun 5  China s central bank said that both China s economy and its financial markets were reflecting a sufficient degree of stability  The People s Bank of China did not downplay the challenges facing the economy altogether  and continued to emphasize on the need to reduce systemic risk  But its confidence in the economy was in keeping with those of independent analysts and market watchers 
It is now widely believed that China s economy will experience a marginal deceleration in the months ahead  However  most economists think that growth will remain largely steady  Additionally  the slight slowdown is largely attributable to institutional measures taken to combat surging debt levels and an overheated housing market  Given that China is likely to remain one of the world s fastest growing economies  it makes good sense to invest in stocks from the country at this point 
Manufacturing  Services Strengthened in June
The world s second largest economy ended the first half of the year on a strong note  depicting strength across services and manufacturing  Data from China s National Bureau of Statistics  NBS  showed that the country s manufacturing PMI increased from the level of 51 2 achieved in May to 51 7 in June 
The highest reading since March was achieved during a period when the metric was widely expected to decline  According to the NBS  new export orders  production and new orders increased at a more rapid pace compared to May  Meanwhile  prices of inputs moved lower for a third successive month 
Additionally  China s non manufacturing PMI increased from 54 5 in May to 54 9 in June  This is the second best level achieved since May 2014  The PMI for the services sector increased by 0 3 points to 53 8 while the construction PMI gained one point to hit 61 4 
Economy Stable  Says China s Central Bank
Meanwhile  on Monday  the People s Bank of China stated that China s financial markets and economy continue to enjoy a significant level of stability  However  the central bank continued to characterize the external environment as  complex  and emphasized the need for reducing systemic risk  In another report released on Tuesday  the central bank reiterated the need to reduce systemic risks  widely believed to lead to a marginal slowdown for the economy in the quarters ahead 
China s regulators are taking a series of measures to reduce the country s burgeoning debt levels and cool down its overheated property markets  Besides curbs on home buying  authorities have cracked down on shadow financing practices  which will likely raised debt levels on the books of banks  According to Reuters  the quantum of China s shadow financing nosedived to 28 9 billion yuan in May after coming in at 177 billion yuan in April 
But despite efforts being taken to deleverage the economy  most economists believe that growth and industrial output will continue to be stable  According to a Reuters poll  industrial output is likely to increase by 6 5  in June  in line with May s increase 
And though growth is expected to moderate from the first quarter pace of 6 9   estimates for this key metric have been rising recently  A recent survey from Bloomberg estimates that GDP will come in around 6 8  during the second quarter  Meanwhile  Australia   New Zealand Banking Group increased its estimate for the full year from 6 5  to 6 7  on Jul 4 
Our Choices
Despite the number of challenges facing the economy at present  China s central bank thinks the country s economy and financial markets continue to be stable  Such sentiments are being echoed by independent commentators even as June s official data was upbeat overall

136905,358420,YUM,McDonald s Valuation Poses Downside Risk,opinion,"With more than 37 000 restaurants in over 100 countries  McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  is considered an American icon around the world  Even more impressive is the stock s history  Investing  2 250 for 100 shares in McDonald s IPO in 1965 would have left you approximately  10 million richer 
Though the company has faced multiple challenges on its way to dominance  the fast food chain has continued delivering impressive results through the decades  It is also a Dividend Aristocrat meaning it belongs in the exclusive club of companies which have paid and increased dividends for at least 25 consecutive years  In point of fact  its record of increasing dividends stands from 1977  representing 40 years of aristocratic status 
McDonald s Rewards Shareholders
For Q1 17  analysts were expecting EPS of  1 33 on revenues of  5 5 billion whereas the company outperformed market expectations and delivered EPS of  1 47 on  5 68 billion of revenues  EPS rose by 19 4  on a YOY basis  The better than expected Q1 earnings  large stock buybacks and the allure of the ever increasing dividend has made it an investor favorite once again  And as a result  McDonald s stock has catapulted higher 
MCD s stock was trading at around  120 to start 2017 and in less than 6 months  shares have risen by over 25   During the same period  the majority of its competitors have been unable to keep up  Jack In The Box Inc  NASDAQ JACK   13   Wendy s  NASDAQ WEN   14  and Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM   14   However  Restaurant Brands International Inc  NYSE QSR  has also been impressive increasing 30  over the same period 
SSSG  The Magic Number Driving MCD
Same store sales growth  SSSG  measures the increase in a company s revenues from its existing chain of restaurants  It is ultimately determined by a combination of the total ticket or meal size and foot traffic in the restaurant  It s important to use this metric to analyze McDonald s as opposed to simply revenue growth because the company is transitioning into a franchised store model  In 2012  19  of McDonald s restaurants were company owned and 81  were franchisee owned  This has since shifted to 15  owned vs 85  franchisee owned as of 2016  respectively  As a result of this refranchising effort  overall revenue has declined but overall margins and profitability has increased 
In Q1 17  McDonald s posted SSSG of 4  which beat analyst expectations of 1   An inspiring development  the food chain registered positive SSSG growth in all its markets  U S   International Lead Market  High Growth Market  and Foundation  partly due to aggressive marketing and its Experience Of The Future  EOTF  initiative  The company has started introducing self order kiosks and tablets in seating areas to enhance the overall customer experience 

Experience Of The Future
McDonald s is expected to post revenues of  22 4 billion for fiscal year end 2017 which would represent a fall of 8 9  from the  24 6 billion in fiscal year 2016  As previously noted  converting company owned stores into franchise stores will reduce total sales but will also lighten its asset base and reduce operating costs 
Going forward  the fast food giant is planning to refranchise 3 500 restaurants by the end of 2017 and 4 000 more by the end of 2018  Wall Street believes this will help McDonald s EBITDA and EBITDA margin reach  10 billion and 50   respectively  by fiscal year 2018  This is well above the  9 3 billion in EBITDA and 37 6  margin achieved in fiscal year 2016 
Furthermore  the company has been concentrating on three areas to drive its SSSG  digital  delivery and EOTF  Under the EOTF project  the company is introducing various tablets in restaurants that will help customers bypass long queues at the cash counter as well let them customize their own orders 
By the end of 2017  McDonald s also plans to start its mobile order and pay system in 20 000 restaurants across the world  4 000 of which will be in the US   By 2020  the company plans to convert all of its traditional restaurants to EOTF restaurants 
These initiatives will surely resonate well with investors on the heels of Panera Bread Company  NASDAQ PNRA  successful implementation of a similar strategy  However  investors should not expect a similar buyout while the market values McDonald s total equity at over  120 billion 
Current Valuation Poses Downside Risk
Assuming McDonald s can achieve  50  EBITDA margins beginning in 2018 and sustain a 3  SSSG into perpetuity  finbox io s 5 year DCF analysis calculates fair value of approximately  137 per share  These aggressive assumptions imply that the stock is currently 10  overvalued 
The EBITDA exit multiple of 13 5x  at the midpoint  implied from the analysis below is telling and requires further examination 
Source  finboxCredit Suisse  SIX CSGN  recently raised its target price to  165 for MCD highlighting that  McDonald s trades in line or at a discount to most of its franchise peers  
Yes  the company s 15 7x EBITDA multiple trades below its benchmark average of 16 1x  However  this may not be the greatest comparison  According to CapitalIQ  McDonald s EBITDA multiple has average 11 0x since 1994  furthest the data goes back   11 1x over the last 10 years  11 9x over the last 5 years and 13 9x over the last year  While McDonald s multiple might be trading at a slight discount to its peers  it is trading at a large premium to its historical average 
The EBITDA exit multiple of 13 5x implied in the DCF analysis seems reasonable as it is above historical averages but below the current multiple 
Furthermore  the last time McDonald s EBITDA multiple traded at over 15 0x was in late 1999 when the stock was just above  45 per share  By mid September 2000  the stock dropped 38  to  28 per share 
Don t expect McDonald s stock to drop nearly 40  within the next year but value investors may want to wait for some pull back before buying  The fast food retail giant is making positive strides to becoming relevant again but there is simply too much risk priced into the current share price ",2017-07-06,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/resurgence-of-mcdonald’s-but-stock’s-valuation-poses-downside-risk-200199529,200199529

136934,358449,YUM,Are China Stocks A Good Bet As Economy Slows  5 Picks,opinion,"Fresh estimates from an official think tank indicate that China s economy will grow at a slower rate in the second quarter  This is keeping with recently released economic reports which reveal that key indicators slipped in April  Officials have also stated at several points that they would be willing to accept a slower pace of growth as China attempts to mitigate risk in its economy 
Yet  foreign investors remain enthusiastic about China  choosing to focus on its inherent and emerging strengths instead of dwelling on its weaknesses  Among these positives are a stable yuan  strong earnings and low valuations  which make investing in stocks from China an extremely attractive proposition 
Growth Slated to Slow in Second Quarter
According to an article published in a state owned newspaper on Saturday  China s GDP will decline to 6 8  in the second quarter of this year  Such a figure is lower than the first quarter s growth rate of 6 9   The projection released by government think tank State Information Center also estimates that consumer inflation will come in at around 1 4  during this period while producer prices will increase by 6 5  
Taken together  this represents a picture of slower  yet stable growth  Recently released economic data seem to support such a trend  In April  industrial production declined to a yearly pace of 6 5  from the rate of 7 6  recorded in March  Similarly  retail sales declined from 10 9  to 10 7   Growth in fixed asset investment growth slowed to a pace of 8 9  for the first four months of the year compared to the first quarter s rate of 9 2   
Foreign Investors Remain Bullish
It has been widely accepted that a slowdown in growth is a natural consequence of the government s attempts to reduce China s financial risks  Speculation in the property market and alarming debt levels are being addressed through a variety of regulatory measures  The extent of the problem can be gauged from the fact China s credit to GDP ratio increased from 141  in 2009 to 260  in 2016 
But foreign investors  including influential financial majors such as Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  continue to maintain a bullish stance on China  They point to the rise of the MSCI China Index which has neared its highest level in 22 months  This is a remarkable performance given that it has recovered by nearly 41  from the low it touched in Feb 2016 
Several factors are responsible for the optimism of foreign investors  First  the yuan is passing through its most stable period since 2015 when it was devalued 
Additionally  earnings for China s companies  including those listed on both the MSCI China index and the Shanghai Composite are projected to increase by the greatest extent in seven years  China s stocks are also undervalued compared to their global counterparts  Such an argument in borne out by the fact that the MSCI China index currently trades at a 24  discount to the MSCI All Country World Index 
Our Choices
Foreign investors remain bullish about the prospects of China s stocks despite a projected slowdown in growth  A combination of attractive valuations  strong earnings performance and a stable yuan are the reasons for their optimism 
Picking select stocks from China looks like a smart option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult 
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score

136968,358483,YUM,Is Yum China A Better Bet For Investors Than Yum  Brands ,opinion,On Nov 1  2016  Yum  Brands  Inc    NYSE YUM   announced that it has spun off its all important China division into an independent  publicly traded company Yum China Holdings  Inc    NYSE YUM   Post separation  Yum China holds exclusive rights of the KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China  and also has the provision to add new brands  At the end of Feb  2017  Yum China had more than 7 600 restaurants in over 1 100 cities mostly under the KFC and Pizza Hut brand  Taco Bell too opened its first restaurant in China at the end of 2016  Additionally  Yum China owns the Little Sheep and East Dawning concepts outright  The company is expected to be able to triple its unit count in the long term Meanwhile  the new Yum  Brands  will have the provision to triple its unit count in the long term with strong growth from the emerging markets  Also  it will receive a license fee of 3  of the sales generated in China through KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell  However  the company will not get any fees initially for new units in China In fact  post separation  each of the companies   Yum  Brands and Yum China   is expected to return about 15  annually to shareholders through earnings growth and dividends The spin off has certainly led to the establishment of two powerful  independent companies  each well capitalized with long runways for growth and value creation  Among the two  Yum China has emerged as a bigger winner with its stock rising 22 3  since the date of separation  while Yum  Brands recorded a gain of 5 7  What s Driving Yum China Faster than Yum  Brands The division s spin off has made Yum  Brands a more asset light company  in large part  as many company owned restaurants have been in the Chinese market  Post spin off  the company aims to drive growth by employing greater focus on the development of its three iconic global brands  particularly in the U S   increasing its franchise ownership  and creating a leaner  more efficient cost structure Particularly  the company is committed toward becoming at least 98  franchised by the end of 2018  Thus  Yum  Brands  expects to become a  pure play  franchisor with more stable earnings  higher profit margins  lower capital requirements and stronger cash flow conversion Yum  Brands China business   which accounted for more than half of the company s total revenue   played a pivotal role in its solid performance  over the last few years  In fact  its manifold efforts are poised to reap benefits in the long term  But slight uncertainty surrounding the company s business post the spin off of the China unit  soft sales backdrop in the U S  restaurant space along with increasing competition might continue to weigh on its performance In fact  for 2017  while EPS is expected to grow 11 4   sales are likely to witness a decline of 48 6  However  Yum China performed well after its spin off from Yum  Brands  The company has been successful in attracting customers with its loyalty program  digital leadership and more delivery options  thereby driving comps Yum China is also hoping to fuel growth with Taco Bell brands and plans to open more units this year  In 2017  the company seems to be confident about opening 550 600 new restaurants  while delivering double digit growth in operating profit  excluding the foreign currency impact Meanwhile  we note that a new generation of millennials who are digitally cultured and brand driven are fueling consumption growth in China  In fact  constant growth of the middle class and urban population there is anticipated to create the world s largest market for restaurant brands  with Yum China as the market leader With almost no debt and substantial free cash flow  Yum China has thus by far been successful in delivering strong growth and is expected to continue doing so  Additionally  for 2017 sales growth is pegged at nearly 4   while earnings per share  EPS  is likely to improve 10 7  Earnings ResultsYum China has exceeded earnings expectations in both the quarters it has reported so far  Focusing on the first quarter 2017 results reported on Apr 5  we note that adjusted EPS of 44 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18 9   Sales of  1 28 billion  however  fell slightly short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 29 billion  Same store sales grew 1  in the quarter  Also  comps at both KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining witnessed a rise of 1  and 2   respectively  in the said quarter Meanwhile  post separation  Yum  Brands reported fourth quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of 79 cents per share  which surpassed with the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 7   Further  earnings increased 19  year over year due to lower share count and higher revenues  Meanwhile  total revenue of  2 02 billion also inched up 2 4  year over year primarily owing to higher franchise and license fees and income  Notably  revenues came almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate Estimate Revisions TrendOver the last 60 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Yum China s current year s earnings has moved up 5 2   reflecting three upward revisions versus none downwards  Also  next year s earnings estimate has inched up 7 3   on the back of two upward revisions as against no downward revisions  All these positive earnings estimate revisions testifies the unwavering confidence that analysts have in the company and also adds to the optimism in the stock On the contrary  Yum  Brands  current year estimates have remained flat over the last two months  given one upward revision versus two downwards  However  next year earnings estimates have jumped up 1 3  over the past two months on the back of one upward and downward revision ConclusionYum China  sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  looks like the smarter pick for investors in the restaurant industry right now  given better estimates and analyst sentiment  superior price performance and clearer growth opportunities  But that does not mean Yum  Brands  with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  have no chance of performing well  However  based on the current circumstances  we advise investors to put their money on Yum China Key PicksOther favorably ranked stocks in the Zacks categorized  include Restaurant Brands International Inc    NYSE QSR   and Papa John s International Inc    NASDAQ PZZA    While Restaurant Brands sports a Zacks Rank  1  Papa John s currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank stocks here Restaurant Brands  earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 19 20   Meanwhile  for 2017  EPS is expected to improve 14 9  Papa John s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 10 26   Further  for 2017  EPS is expected to grow 10 2  Zacks  Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to

136969,358484,YUM,Snap Inc  s  SNAP  New Augmented Reality  World Lenses  Could Lead To More Marketing Dollars,opinion,"Snap Inc    NYSE SNAP   introduced its new  World Lenses  that allow users to send photos or videos with special effects added onto the background of any location or setting in a further push into the world of augmented reality 
 on Tuesday that its users would now be able to alter any photo or video by adding 3D objects and text  such as a crying cloud or a giant moving OMG  to any scene with the use of their rear facing smartphone camera  The new  non selfie Snapchat lenses encourage users to  paint the world around you with new 3D experiences   according to Snap s official announcement 
Snap users simply tap the screen in order to look through available World Lenses  which will be updated and changed   Users can then add them to any photo or video in real time  Users will also be able to walk through  under  or over any 3D objects they place in their surrounding by simply looking at their phone 
Snapchat first introduced its selfie lenses  which enable users to cover their faces with puppy masks  swap faces with friends  and a laundry list of other mostly goofy features  over a year ago 
Evan Spiegel s company did not use the phrase  augmented reality  in Tuesday s announcement or the accompanying video  but much like the once ubiquitous Pok mon Go  the new lenses do just that augment the real world with virtual displays in real time 
The introduction of Snapchat s second generation augmented reality feature comes at a time when the newly publicly traded company remains under siege from Facebook Inc    NASDAQ FB   and its photo sharing app Instagram for domination among the coveted millennial demographic 
According to a  report  there are no initial sponsors for Snapchat s new World Lenses  But it seems highly unlikely that this is a long term strategy since Snapchat s first lenses quickly became popular and spawned an array of money making corporate sponsorship opportunities 
Money Making Potential 
Brands have a wide range of potential uses for the new augmented reality feature on the disappearing photo and video app 
It isn t hard to imagine Yum  Brands  Inc  s   NYSE YUM   Taco Bell an early Snapchat adopter that quickly tapped into its youthful marketing potential paying for users to be able to place floating tacos above their friends  heads 
Aside from sponsored world lenses  another potential money making opportunity for Snap is the ability to obtain more user data  Just last week  Snap planned to fully roll out its    tool that enables marketers to see if Snapchat ads or sponsored lenses actually lead to real sales 
Snap s introduction of the new rear facing camera augmented reality filters could potentially lead to more non selfie pictures  which very well could provide the app maker with more geographical information  as well as greater insight into what products users surround themselves with  
Snap s stock price was up 2 21  to  20 38 per share through morning trading on Tuesday  Snap is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold    that it is set to host its first quarterly earnings call on May 10

136994,358509,YUM,Could A Capital Spending Boom Push Stocks Higher In 2017  ,opinion,"Cash Hoarding Era May Be Coming To An End
We can gain some insight into the economic confidence of business leaders by monitoring shifts in investments in plant  property  and equipment  With business leaders anticipating tax cuts  investments in infrastructure  and a more friendly regulatory environment under the Trump administration  conditions are more favorable for capital expenditures  From  

Despite years of near zero interest rates that made borrowing cheap  many big U S  corporations have been hoarding cash or plowing money into safer pursuits in the wake of the recession  Some  like General Motors Co  NYSE GM   and railroad CSX Corp  NASDAQ CSX    borrowed to prop up pension plans  Others  including Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD   and Yum  Brands Inc  NYSE YUM   used cheap debt to repurchase shares  Meanwhile  overall spending on building new factories or upgrading aging equipment languished  That is likely to change soon   We could be in store for a significant  capital expenditure  boom   said Charles Mulford  an accounting professor at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta 

Rare Annual Signal Last Seen Before Secular Turn In 1982
The return of  animal spirits  to both the corner office and financial markets aligns with this week s stock market video  which covers a very rare annual signal that was nailed down on December 30  2016  From Yahoo Finance 

 Outside years  as Citi s chart outlines  are big time bullish for stocks into the next year  In the last 81 years  there have been only two  outside years  before 2016  which will meet the standard if the S P 500 closes above 2 135  it s currently trading near 2 250   1935 and 1982  Both of these years were followed by the S P enjoying double digit gains    28  in 1936  and  17  in 1983   which potentially sets the table for a monster rally into 2017  

The video covers the importance of what an outside year tells us about market psychology and makes numerous comparisons between 2016 17 and the 1982 84 period  A kind viewer noted on  the time investment to review the evidence covered in the video is  time very well spent for long term investors  

Trump Could  Ignite Animal Spirits 

How is it within the realm of possibility the U S  stock market is entering a new secular bull market after consolidating for over 16 years  One theory was covered recently by  

Economic changes under the Donald Trump administration may be more significant than shifts from  the socialists to the capitalists  in the U K   U S  and Germany from 1979 to 1982  according to Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio  Comparing Trump to Margaret Thatcher  Ronald Reagan and Helmut Kohl  Dalio said the incoming administration may have a much bigger impact on the U S  economy than can be measured by tax changes and fiscal spending  The Trump era could  ignite animal spirits  and attract productive capital  the billionaire fund manager wrote in a LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  post on Monday ",2017-01-04,Chris Ciovacco,https://www.investing.com/analysis/could-a-capital-spending-boom-help-push-stocks-higher-in-2017-200171383,200171383

However  the analyst likes the company s solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy  and content addition continues to add selection to Prime memberships  Also  the AWS generates much higher margins than retail  so it has a very positive impact on Amazon s profitability  Amazon has agreed to pay  50 million to stream 10 NFL games during the upcoming 2017 season   You can  
Shares of Celgene have gained  8 5  year to date  underperforming the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics sector which has gained  2 8  over the same period  Celgene and other drug makers  shares have remained under pressure given ongoing questions about pricing issues and other regulatory uncertainties 
These issues notwithstanding  Celgene s multiple myeloma drug Revlimid continues to grow on the back of market share gains and increased duration  The Zacks analyst likes Celgene s ongoing label expansion efforts and pipeline development  The company anticipates several pipeline related events over the upcoming quarters and next few years  Estimates remain static ahead of first quarter results   You can  
Facebook shares lagged the S P 500 index following the election  but have more than made up for that underperformance since the start of 2017   the stock is up  22 3  in the year to date period vs   5 1  gain for the index in that time period  Despite strong results  Facebook  as expected  maintained a cautious stance on future growth prospects  Perhaps far more important to the market is the long term opportunity for Facebook through monetization of key properties like Instagram  Messenger  WhatsApp and Oculus 
The prospect of higher engagement levels of its huge user base is another key positive in the Facebook story  The company is also dabbling in AR VR and AI technologies  which also bode well for growth  Estimates have gone up ahead of the upcoming earnings release   You can  
Shares of Walgreens Boots have done better than the embattled Zacks Retail Drug Stores industry in the year to date period  WBA is down  0 5  vs  decline of  3 6  for the peer group   but the stock has lagged the broader Zacks Retail sector in that same time period  The stock has been helped somewhat by the expected integration synergy related to the impending Rite Aid deal   
Walgreens Boots reported a dull second quarter fiscal 2017 with earnings meeting and expectations while sales fell behind  The company appears on track to execute strategic tie ups and a cost reduction plan that is expected to strengthen margins  A strong balance sheet and a track record of returning excess cash to shareholders  pays an attractive dividend  currently yielding 1 8   are some of the other positives in the Walgreens story   You can

    Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that Yum  Brands is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients Zacks ESP   for Yum  Brands  stands at  1 84  because the Most Accurate estimate is  1 11 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 09  A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise   Zacks Rank  Yum  Brands currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates  Conversely  Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement The combination of Yum  Brands  Zacks Rank  3 and  1 84  ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat What is Driving the Better than Expected Earnings We expect Yum  Brands  U S  division comps to continue to be strong in the to be reported quarter  backed by strength in the Taco Bell  Pizza Hut and KFC brands  Taco Bell s expanded line of breakfast offerings should drive comps  while Pizza Hut comps will likely benefit from menu innovation and digital initiatives  Meanwhile  KFC s revamping of outlets and introduction of healthier menu items should continue to boost comps Further  backed by various initiatives on the sales and digital front  Yum  Brands  performance in some of the key developed markets is expected to remain impressive in the quarter  Meanwhile  the company s refranchising efforts should facilitate earnings per share growth and ROE expansion However  slowdown in emerging markets could dent sales while negative currency translation might hurt earnings  Meanwhile  the China division posted flat comps in Q2 after recording positive comps in the previous three quarters  suggesting that a complete recovery will take more time Particularly  Pizza Hut in China continues to disappoint and might keep international revenues under pressure in the third quarter  Nonetheless  Yum  Brand s KFC division in China has been performing well  aided by robust unit growth and popularity of the value box meals  and is expected to continue doing so Other Stocks to ConsiderYum  Brands is not the only company looking up this earnings season  Here are some other companies to consider as our model shows they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Wingstop Inc    NASDAQ WING   has an earnings ESP of  9 09  and a Zacks Rank  2 Restaurant Brands International Inc    NYSE QSR   has an earnings ESP of  4 88  and a Zacks Rank  3 Buffalo Wild Wings Inc    NASDAQ BWLD   has an earnings ESP of  4 00  and a Zacks Rank  3 Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ",2016-10-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/yum!-brands-(yum)-to-report-q3-earnings:-a-beat-in-store-200156771,200156771

The stock has also moved out of  sell  territory and it is now a  hold   while the earnings ESP suggests that the most recent estimates have been positive  This is definitely a good sign for YUM heading into the release  but let s not discount the impact from a sluggish industry  The overall space is ranked in the bottom 25   so it may be difficult for YUM to breakout given these trends YUM  BRANDS INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   
Starting on November 1st  Yum China will be available for purchase on the NYSE under the symbol  YUMC   Any additional details regarding this spin off are likely to weigh on the report  and especially since the China division seems to have rebounded a bit following the food scare from a few years ago  Is it still a good idea to eject the China division given that this could be a high growth area for the future  We will have to see on the report this week  making this a stock that could see some seriously volatile trading in the days and weeks ahead

137071,358586,YUM,5 Things To Watch When Yum  Brands Reports Earnings On Wednesday,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM   which develops  operates  franchises and licenses a variety of fast food restaurants in the U S  as well as internationally  reports Q3 2016 earnings on Wednesday October 5  after the market closes 


1  Earnings and Revenue
YUM  Brands which owns Pizza Hut  Taco Bell and KFC  is expected to report revenue of  3 4 billion for the quarter  on EPS of  1 1  During last year s Q3  the company reported revenue of  3 4 billion  on EPS of  0 97  Wall Street is therefore expecting flat sales growth but a 13  rise in profitability  Yum s three fast food chains  along with its operations in China  each report individually  so here s what to look for per segment 

2  Pizza Hut
The Pizza Hut division has over 14 000 units  of which 55  are located in the U S  and 95  are franchised and operated by a third party  Over the past two quarters  Pizza Hut brought in  511 million in revenue  or about 9  of YUM  Brands  total revenue  Sales have declined by about 5  because of refranchising efforts  meaning the company franchised some of its wholly owned restaurants to third parties  Operating profit grew by over 6  and operating margins grew 3 3  to 25 8   thanks to lower pension costs in the U S  Same store growth on the other hand  is flat for the quarter   for the second year in a row 

3  KFC
The KFC division of YUM  is made up of just over 15 000 units  of which 70  are located outside the U S   and 90  are operated through franchise agreements  With  1 3 billion in revenue since the beginning of the year  KFC represents about 23  of YUM  Brands  annual revenue  KFC  the largest segment of YUM  outside of China is still growing  and has posted same store sales growth of 2  during the last quarter  in line with last year s growth  Revenue has declined 2  due to unfavorable changes in currency values  something KFC is especially vulnerable to because of the large amount of units it operates outside the U S 

4 Taco Bell
With about 6 500 units  nearly all of them based in the U S   and 85  of its restaurants franchised  Taco Bell is the smallest of YUM  Brands three fast food chains by physical presence  Its sales however with  889 million over the last 6 months surpassed those of Pizza Hut  Taco Bell has largely cooled down from an extraordinary 2015  when same store growth reached 6   Today  growth is flat on the year  As with YUM  s two other restaurant chain divisions  lower costs have brought improved margins  At 29   Taco Bell s are higher than the norm 

5  China
China is the most exciting part of YUM  Brands  portfolio  The China division includes all three fast food chains within China  which amazingly  represent 51  of all of YUM  s sales today  More important  a spin off of the China business will take effect on October 31  Beginning November 1  all YUM s operations in China will begin to trade on the NYSE as Yum China Holdings under a new symbol  YUMC 
The Chinese business is inherently different from the rest of YUM s international segments  because almost all restaurants are company owned  not franchised  Over the past two years  foreign exchange has been hurting the company s business in China  but lower costs of sales due to changes in tax structures have offset this  resulting in higher operating profit  China still has room to grow both in margins and in sales 
Conclusion
Everywhere but in China  YUM  Brands is continuing the move to franchise operations  which is improving operating margins  That s good news 
Its P E ratio of 27 is average  if a bit high  For comparison sake  McDonald s  NYSE MCD  2015 P E was 23 and its full 2016 P E is estimated to be 21  While defensive investors might shy away from YUM because of the relatively high P E ratio and possible recession risks  at  90 29 per share at yesterday s close  the company isn t grossly overpriced 
However  the growth potential for the China spin off is stronger than that of the parent company  and YUMC should trade at a higher earnings multiple  It should be noted that higher volatility is expected  especially during the early months after YUMC s IPO  when prices of new offerings are generally more sensitive than those of more established  older companies 
That being said  opportunities should arise to buy into the China spin off at a lower than average P E  which would make it a safer position and obviously more beneficial over the longer term  Buy on low volatility and hang on to reap the rewards from China s growing middle class ",2016-10-05,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-things-to-watch-when-yum!-brands-reports-earnings-on-wednesday-200157016,200157016

137095,358610,YUM,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Red Robin Gourmet Burgers  McDonald s And Yum  Brands,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   September 15  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Restaurants  part 3  including Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc     McDonald s Corp  NYSE MCD      and Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM   Inc      

Industry  Restaurants  part 3

Link  

While an improving U S  economy and slightly lower energy costs are driving consumer spending  it would be prudent for investors to take a closer look at the dampeners threatening growth in the restaurant industry  Particularly  sluggish comps growth and traffic trends along with rising labor costs could spell trouble for the restaurateurs 

Below  we discuss some of the headwinds that are plaguing the restaurant industry 

High Expenses   Costs related to various sales and comps boosting initiatives along with restaurant re imaging expenses are hurting margins for companies 

Moreover  restaurants like Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc      intend to make additional unit openings going forward  Thus  higher marketing and pre opening costs associated with the same are expected to hurt profits 

Also  there has been considerable debate in the recent past over restaurant workers  wages  Workers at quick service restaurants claim that their employers  profits have not trickled down to them proportionately  which is leading to strikes for wage hikes  These incidents significantly hurt the reputation of restaurants  As a result  the companies are compelled to make minimum wage increases  which again lead to narrower margins  Also  higher labor costs due to the competitive labor market are expected to continue to keep profits under pressure 

Restaurant management turnover is another critical headwind for operators as turnover rates are now at the highest level since the recession  according to a report by Black Box Intelligence  This is further compelling restaurants to either hike wages or provide benefits  at the cost of margins  to retain or attract employees  Companies like McDonald s Corp      are working on these lines 

Soft Comps   Traffic Trends   Most of the restaurateurs have been bearing the brunt of soft comps and traffic trends in the first half of 2016  which is a matter of concern  Per market analysts  diners are visiting chain restaurants less often and instead spending more per visit  which is hurting traffic  Throughout the beginning of this year  consumer behavior has been volatile and the willingness to spend on most goods  especially eating out  has shown signs of decline 

Moreover  increase in menu prices at times prevents them from dining out  In fact  the second quarter of 2016 marked the second consecutive quarter of negative comps growth in the restaurant industry  per a report by TDn2K s Black Box Intelligence 

Macro   Political Issues Other Challenges   The restaurant industry is grappling with difficulties like intense competition in the U S   decelerating growth in Asia along with weakness in some parts of Europe  wherethe economic political conditions are expected to be further challenging post Brexit 

Also  food safety issues among consumers have been hurting comps of restaurants like Yum  Brands  Inc       which has faced serious food safety allegations in China  Back in the U S   Chipotle continues to reel under the negative publicity associated with the E  coli and norovirus outbreaks in several states  which surfaced toward the end of 2015  which has impeded sales of the fast casual restaurant 

Currency Headwinds   Negative currency translation is a concern for companies like Domino s Pizza  Yum  Brands and McDonald s as these have considerable overseas presence  Thus  fluctuating currency exchange rates might hurt the international sales of these companies 

In fact  given recent currency fluctuations  McDonald s expects foreign currency translation to have a more considerable impact on reported results than estimated earlier  Notably  the company expects adverse currency translation to hurt EPS in the range of 9 cents to 11 cents for 2016  up from the earlier guidance of 5 cents to 7 cents  Moreover  Domino s Pizza anticipates foreign currency to have an  8 million to  12 million year over year impact on pretax earnings in 2016

YUM  Brands  Inc  CEO s Comments 
Greg Creed  CEO  said 

Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM  delivered second quarter core operating profit growth of 7  and EPS growth  excluding Special Items  of 9   Given our strong first half results and current trends in China  I m pleased to raise our full year core operating profit growth forecast to at least 14  from 12  previously  I m particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum at KFC China  which delivered better than expected same store sales growth of 3   This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of positive same store sales growth at KFC China despite the second quarter being our most difficult of the year from a historical sales overlap standpoint  Importantly  our China Division is off to a good start in the third quarter for both KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining  including a return to positive same store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining in recent weeks 
Outside of China  challenging industry conditions in the U S  contributed to soft sales results  However  our three brand divisions in the aggregate delivered core operating profit growth largely in line with our expectations and remain on track to deliver against their full year core operating profit growth targets  We re confident in our plans to drive second half sales improvement led by a continued focus on innovation  value and our core products 
This is a transformational year for our company as we remain on track to finalize the separation of our China business with a targeted completion date around October 31  2016  ultimately creating two powerful  independent  focused growth companies  Our capital structure is fully in place and we plan to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders both prior to and after the spin  I look forward to sharing additional details on the transformative initiatives we are undertaking as we become a more heavily franchised company at our New York investor conference on Tuesday  October 11th  Business Wire

YUM Technical Analysis

YUM opened trading yesterday at  85 65 which was down from the previous days trading of  85 77  YUM closed trading yesterday at  85 74 and spiked up after market to  89 60  equivalent to a 5  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time YUM traded above these levels was on August 6th  2015 when it traded at highs of  89 67  Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that YUM has been on an overall upward trend dating back to February 11th when it traded at its 52 week low price of  64 58  YUM has a float of 364 16 million shares and traded 1 80 times the normal daily trading volume on Wednesday  For trading purposes  I would like to see YUM open trading on Thursday above  88 30 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 30 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

   The agreement with Amrest is part of Yum brands  refranchising strategy  That is  by refranchising  Yum  Brands has adopted a de risking strategy by reducing its ownership of restaurants  Notably  the company is committed to become at least 96  franchised by the end of 2017  Refranchising a large portion of the system reduces the company s capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion 
Free cash flow will continue to grow  facilitating reinvestments to increase brand recognition and shareholder return  Notably  the shift to refranchising has substantially benefited the company s operating margin over the years  Moreover  since a major portion of its business is refranchised  Yum  Brands  currently carrying a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   will be less adversely affected by food inflation than most of its peers

137143,358658,YUM,Earnings Primer  5 Companies To Watch,opinion,"Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM 
Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure   Reports July 13  after the close 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings of 76 cents per share on  3 10 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top  Compared to a year earlier  earnings are expected to grow by 9  with revenue remaining unchanged  Revisions activity since Yum s last report show that EPS estimates are rising into the report  while sales have trended downward 

What to Watch  While the fast food industry has rebounded in recent years  Yum s results have been mixed  Earnings have seen double digit gains in the last 3 quarters while revenue has been near zero or negative over the same time period  The stock has largely tracked these ups and downs  decreasing 5  in the past 12 months 
Yum Brands is responsible for operating notable chains such as KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell  In recent quarters there have been robust domestic results which have offset sluggish growth internationally  The first quarter featured a system sales increase of 5  with same store sales up 2  over the same period  Yum China stood out compared to its other divisions  boasting an 11  rise in system wide sales and 6  in same store sales 
Comps are expected to remain high this quarter on the back of strength in the Taco Bell  KFC  and Pizza Hut brands  Taco Bell has been hugely successful with its breakfast offerings while menu innovation and increased efficiency in KFC and Pizza Hut should also drive comps  Emerging markets might have a difficult time sustaining its upward momentum due to currency headwinds  Meanwhile  China continues to face headwinds in the form of a stagnant economy  fall out from food safety scandals and increasing competition 
Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL 
Industrials   Airlines   Reports July 14  before market open 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 62 on  10 55 billion in revenue  7 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  17 million on the top  Compared to a year earlier this represents a 32  increase in earnings with sales expected to decline by 1   Per share estimates have dropped 15  in the past 3 months and should continue to be cut over the next few days  Fortunately  the stock reacts well to earnings  rising 5  in the month following a report 

What to Watch  The airlines are one of the worst performing sectors this year with stocks down over 20  across the industry  Shares of Delta are down 25 3  since the start of the year  largely driven by macroeconomic volatility  rising oil prices  recent terror attacks and generally lower demand  This has been the primary contributor to flat YoY revenues 
Recent events have been contributed to the decline in the airline industry this year  Terrorist acts around the world  especially those at airports  have scared some from traveling  Furthermore  the Brexit vote last month is expected to have lingering effects on the airline industry which could see a negative impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates 
Delta has already reported that key metrics have decline in the past 3 months  PRASM  passenger revenue per available seat mile   one of the most important metric for airlines  declined by 5  over the quarter  Delta and its peers have been struggling to hold onto current price levels as excess seating capacity increases and demand for pricey last minute business tickets decline  Delta recently cut its projected operating margin to 17  for Q2  down from previous forecasts in the range of 21 to 23  
JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM 
Financials   Diversified Financial Services   Reports July 14  before the open 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  1 44 on revenue of  23 83 billion  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  50 million on the top  Compared to year earlier this represents a 7  decline in earnings and 3  in sales  Shares of JPMorgan are down 5  year to date and typically don t react to quarterly results 

What to Watch  JPMorgan  the largest of the retail banks in terms of assets under management  kicks things off for banks when its reports Q2 earnings Thursday before the market opens  Across the board  the banking sector will be impacted by the Brexit vote  low interest rates and currency headwinds  Fortunately  the rebound in the oil market and gas prices will alleviate pressure on energy loan losses going forward 
Regardless  JPM has exceeded earnings expectations in 4 of the last 5 quarters and is typically viewed as one of the better performing financial institutions  Last quarter  the company reported increases in consumer banking and asset management sectors  Net interest income increased as well  despite rates staying close to zero during the period  However  significant declines were seen in commercial and investment banking sectors  Overall net income and revenue were down on a yearly basis with a high likelihood of continuing through the remainder of fiscal 2016 
Second quarter results are shaping up to feature some similar factors from past results  An early surge in trading activity this quarter appears as if it will be offset by Brexit and other macro concerns  Moreover  investment banking is likely to remain weak  dampened by a persistent decline in M A activity and weakened IPO market  Fortunately the mortgage business should see a big boom from lower mortgage rates  Energy loans and expense management should also not be a big thorn in the Chase s side 
Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC 
Financials   Commercial Banks   Reports July 15  before the open 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  1 03 on  22 3 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  30 million on the top  Compared to a year earlier this reflects earnings that are in line and a 5  increase in sales  Shares of Wells Fargo are down 5  year to date and typically increase 3  in the 30 day post earnings period 

What to watch  Currently  Wells Fargo is the only of the 6 big banks that is not expecting declines on the top and bottom line  Despite some shakiness in the banking sector  Wells Fargo s earnings have been relatively resilient given it has little exposure to risky trading and investment banking businesses  Furthermore  the bank s operations and investments are largely isolated compared to its large cap peers  Still  the current economic landscape has caused the bank to reduce its profitability targets for the remainder of the year  Wells Fargo recently lowered its full year target return on assets to the range of 1 1  to 1 4   The bank sees continued stress in its oil and gas portfolio this year with the potential for additional reserve increases or more credit losses 
On the plus side  loan growth is expected to be a key driver this quarter as mortgages sit at all time lows  Wells Fargo has the largest loan portfolio in the financial sector  primarily supported by its mortgage portfolio  An increase in loan and deposit growth from this could offset low rates and in fact boost overall net interest income  The bank s U S  focused operations gives them the highest probability of walking out of Brexit and future macro events unscathed 
Citigroup  NYSE C 
Financials   Diversified Financial Services   Reports July 14  before the open 
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  1 16  four cents higher than Wall Street s consensus  Revenue expectations are slightly higher than the sell side  with the Estimize community expecting  17 796 billion  as compared to  17 762 billion  Earnings expectations have trended downward by 8  since last quarter  while revenue estimates are down 3   This puts YoY growth expectations at  22  for EPS and  7  for sales 

What to Watch  Last quarter was a mixed bag for Citigroup  with the bank beating on the bottom line  missing on the top line  and recording YoY declines for both measures  A lot of the weakness in the past couple of years have come as the bank s traditional engines of trading revenue  fixed income and currencies  have slumped due to high regulatory costs  After years of cost cutting  the Citigroup decided to expand its business in the equity market  Trading revenues should have been strong in Q2 after a rough start to the year 
Like many of the other big banks  the U K  s unexpected decision to leave the EU may lead to a decrease in fee income and a further slowing of M A activity  With Brexit uncertainty looming and causing the Fed to hold off on any further interest rate hikes  stagnant interest revenues will be a problem for Citi as well  The stock is down 24  in the last year  meaning investors will be paying close attention to any guidance given for the second half of the year ",2016-07-12,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-this-week-7-11---yum,-dal,-jpm,-wfc,-c-200141301",200141301

137148,358663,YUM,Casella Waste  Valeant Pharma  Yum Brands And CSX Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   July 14  2016    highlights Casella Waste    as the Bull of the Day and  Valeant Pharma    as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Yum Brands Inc     and  CSX Corporation  NASDAQ CSX     

Here is a synopsis of all four stocks  

  

Casella Waste    has met or beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  Over that span  there was one meet and more importantly to aggressive growth investors  each report saw solid beats on the top line  The stock is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and today it is the Bull of the Day 

The Numbers

CWST beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 0 24 by  0 05 for a 20  positive earnings surprise  The topline was equally as impressive with the company reporting revenues of  125M and that was  7M more than expected for a 6 3  positive revenue surprise 

Description

Casella Waste Systems is a regional  integrated solid waste services company that provides collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services  generates steam and manufactures finished products utilizing recyclable materials primarily throughout the eastern portion of the United States and parts of Canada  The Company also markets recyclable metals  aluminum  plastics  paper and corrugated cardboard all processed at its facilities and recyclables purchased from third parties 

Earnings History

As noted above the company has a solid recent history of beating the number  Two of the last four reports coming in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate there is a clear signal here that company executives know how to manage Wall Street 

The Spetember 2015 quarter  the other beat in the last year  was also a big one  The company posted a beat of  0 01  but that was a strong penny as it was a 14  positive earnings surprise  Like each of the last 5 quarters  the company beat on top as well 

The company is slated to report earnings again on or around July 28 

 

People tend to raise their eyebrows when they hear that a management team that has led a company into mounting troubles  decided to award  100 million in retention bonuses to the same people that got them into trouble in the first place  Especially  if that team has had some accounting problems  signed a distribution deal that has resulted in a negative average selling price  ASP   and lost  373 7 million dollars last quarter  These are a few reasons why Valeant Pharma    is the Zacks Bear of the Day 

This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is a pharmaceutical company that develops  manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products primarily in the areas of neurology  dermatology and branded generics  The Company produces medicines that meet the special health problems of patients  Valeant s development pipeline strategy comprises both new compounds as well as product life cycle management  Its early and late stage drug candidates have unique formulations and mechanisms of action including retigabine for the treatment of epilepsy and pain  taribavirin of the treatment of chronic hepatitis C  and several dermatology candidates for the treatment of rosacea  acne  and dermatological fungus 

Earnings Results

In the first quarter 2016  the company saw total revenues of  2 4 billion  a 9  increase from Q1 15  but that was one of the very few bright spots  On a year over year basis  the company increased their cost of goods sold to 27  from 24   SG A expenses increased  239 or by 42   investment in research and development rose  47 million or 42   Further  the company posted a net loss of  373 7 million in Q1 16 compared to a net gain of  97 7 million in Q1 15  Adjusted net income was  442 6 million compared to  704 2 in the year ago quarter 

Management s Take

According to Joseph Papa  Chairman and CEO   The first quarter s results reflect  in part  the impact of significant disruption this organization has faced over the past nine months  This has been a difficult period for Valeant and its stakeholders  and while there are some challenges to work through in certain business operations in 2016  such as our U S  dermatology unit  the majority of our businesses are performing according to expectations

137149,358664,YUM,Yum  Brands  YUM  Up On Q2 Earnings Beat  Raised Outlook,opinion,"Shares of Yum  Brands Inc  NYSE YUM    rallied nearly 5  in afterhours trading on Jul 13  after the quick service restaurant operator reported better than expected second quarter earnings results and upped its profit outlook   for the second time this year 
	Adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents by approximately 1 4   Further  earnings surged 8 7  year over year owing to higher margins  Adjusted earnings per share exclude certain charges associated with the agreement reached in 2015 with KFC U S  franchisees and costs associated with the planned spin off of the China operations 
	Meanwhile  total revenue of  3 01 billion declined 3 1  year over year and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 1 billion by 2 9  mostly due to soft comps reported in most of the segments Comps Discussion
	Yum  Brands currently reports under four segments   China  KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell  From Jan 2016  the company s India business integrated its three restaurant brands into the global KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell divisions  Meanwhile  the company is on track to spin off the China business into an independent  publicly traded company by Oct 31  2016 


		YUM  BRANDS INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise


   


China division s comps were flat in the quarter  better than the decline of 10  posted in the year ago quarter  However  it compared unfavorably with the 6  growth witnessed in the last quarter 
	Notably  a 3  surge at KFC was offset by an 11  plunge at Pizza Hut Casual Dining  Notably  results at KFC China were better than expected and marked the fourth consecutive quarter of comps growth despite the second quarter being most difficult for the company from a historical sales overlap perspective 
	Management stated that the China division is off to a good start in the third quarter for both KFC and Pizza Hut  including a return of positive comps growth at the Pizza Hut division in recent weeks 
	Comps at the KFC division were up 2   same as the year ago quarter growth and compared favorably with prior quarter growth of 1   Growth was witnessed across U S  markets  developed markets and emerging markets Pizza Hut posted flat comps  same as the year ago quarter but compared unfavorably with last quarter s 3  increase  Comps grew 1  in U S  markets and declined 1  each in developed and emerging markets Taco Bell comps declined 1  year over year  Sluggish comps reflect intense competition in the domestic market  especially in the breakfast segment  The figure compared unfavorably with the prior quarter growth level of 1  and the year ago improvement of 6  
	Restaurant margins improved at China  was flat at KFC and declined at the Taco Bell and Pizza Hut divisions 2016 Guidance
	Management expects operating profit growth  in constant currency  of at least 14  in 2016  up from the prior guidance of 12   Notably  this is the second time the company has raised its operating profit growth forecast  In first quarter 2016  the company had raised the same from 10  to 12   Notably  management lifted its outlook mainly encouraged by its strong first half results and the current profitability trends in China Our Take
	The China division posted flat comps after recording positive comps over the last three quarters  suggesting that a complete recovery will take more time  The economic growth rate of the country has moderated lately  making consumers cautious about their discretionary spending  Further  increasing preference for healthy and nutritious food among U S  consumers  along with intense competition  is denting the company s domestic sales 
	However  the company s efforts to capitalize on high growth emerging markets like Russia  Latin America  Asia  Middle East and Africa for future growth could partially mitigate these headwinds Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider
	Yum  Brands has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Better ranked restaurant stocks are Carrols Restaurant Group  Inc    Famous Dave s of America Inc   and Dave   Buster s Entertainment  Inc    All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

137151,358666,YUM,ASX 200 Powers Through 5400,opinion,"We ve seen flat finish to the S P 500  but there were some interesting market moves to put on the radar  Firstly  we should consider that the S P futures were down 0 2  at 16 00  the close of the ASX 200 cash session   so having moved modestly higher it s no surprise to see our call for the Australian equity market now above 5400 
The key level to watch will be the 27 May high of 5427  so it will be interesting to see if the bulls can push the index into this prior high  The ASX 200 has rallied for the last five consecutive days  putting on close to 5  in the process and we have seen only one occasion in 2016 where the index has rallied for six days in a row and that was in early March 
The balance of probability therefore suggests buying on the sixth day of gains is probably not the best strategy  from a risk reward perspective  and one should perhaps wait for a slight pullback  although in December the market did rally for nine consecutive days 
If one is to focus on the market internals we can see good participation in the recent rally  with the percentage of companies above their 10 day moving average increasing from 55  to 84   The materials sector looks like a thing of beauty right now  see below chart  and the 7 7  rally in the last five sessions has taken the materials sub index trading above its 50   100  and 200 day average 
Sellers will be more prominent in this sector today though given the collapse in oil prices overnight  on higher gasoline inventories and small losses in iron ore  BHP Billiton Ltd  AX BHP  s ADR if we use as a proxy for the space is 1 3  lower 

The focal point will likely be the FX and rates markets today though with traders adjusting last minute positioning ahead of the Bank of England meeting at 21 00 AEST  with the swaps market pricing the probability of a cut at 81   On the political front all the focus has been on the construction of Theresa May s Conservative cabinet 
It seems clear that the markets feel pretty comfortable with May at the helm  in what is going to be a very  interesting  12 months for the UK economy and one feels that she is the best person to guide through this tough period  However  the appointment of Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary has been met with a strong degree of scepticism and one of the reasons we have seen renewed GBP selling in my opinion 
Philip Hammond has been promoted from Secretary of State to replace George Osborne as chancellor and he will have a huge task given the UK s 7  fiscal deficit  David Davis has taken position as the aptly named Brexit Secretary 
In Australia we get the June employment print with the market expecting 10 000 jobs to be created and the economists calling for a range of  20 000 to  30 000 jobs  The 12 month average for total job creation is  19 600  with an average of 4200 full time jobs created monthly over the same time 
Expect the AUD to be sensitive to this release given the interest rate market is so finely balanced for an August cut  To put some perspective on the release it is one of three key influences that could dictate an August cut  with the others being the Q2 CPI print  27 July  and financial market volatility  Good numbers today should see AUD USD find a firm footing above 76c  with GBP AUD eyeing a re test of the 11 July low of a 1 7045 
Japan looks set for slightly higher open  despite USD JPY sitting nicely in the middle of the sessions  104 88 to  103 91 range  USD JPY is a tough one  but my trading bias is to sell rallies in the pair and the obvious area to fade the move into is  105 90 and just below strong horizontal resistance 
On the stock side we have seen some good flow on Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM  in the US after hours session  with the stock up 4 5  at the time of writing  The focus though is on JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   as they will have a clear read through into other banking stocks  The market expects Q2 EPS of  1 43 or  24 5 billion revenue  but it will be interest from a more global perceptive to hear Jamie Dimon s comments on plans for  Brexit  ",2016-07-14,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/asx-200-powers-through-5400-200141767,200141767

Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  

How Chipotle  CMG  Can Get Its Groove Back

Simply put  Chipotle    is in a slump  The E  coli issue that plagued a handful of its restaurants last year sent hordes of loyal customers fleeing to competitors  Now  it looks like many of those customers might be gone for good 

Shares of the fast casual Mexican chain have fallen over 17  on the year  and on Tuesday the stock hit its lowest point in three years  In the first quarter  the company reported its first quarterly loss in history  and it s obvious that Chipotle is at a major turning point 

If Chipotle wants to bounce back soon  something has got to give  Although the brand s rise in popularity can at least partially be attributed to the simplicity of its menu offerings  Chipotle has to do something new to get customers back in the door 

   

With that said  we brainstormed some ideas about how Chipotle can get its groove back  Here s what we came up with 

New Menu Items

As I said before  Chipotle needs to get customers back in the door  and one way to do that is to offer something new  Just a quick glance at Chipotle s competition shows that the company is lagging behind on its menu offerings 

For example  Jack in the Box s    Mexican chain Qdoba has a devoted following thanks to its queso  Coming in both mild and spicy  Qdoba queso is available for no additional charge on any of its menu items  I mean  c mon Chipotle  What kind of self respecting Mexican food restaurant doesn t have a queso option  

In the most recent Harris Poll awards announced last week  Chipotle lost its tag as the  after holding the crown for three consecutive years  In fact  Chipotle fell in fourth behind Qdoba  Yum  Brands     owned Taco Bell  Baja Fresh  and the winner  Moe s Southwest Grill 

As a heads up to Chipotle  Moe s offers bacon as a topping and Baja Fresh serves fish and fire grilled shrimp  I understand that Chipotle has made a name for itself with its current menu  but it s time to start trying new things 

It does appear that Chipotle has at least recognized this fact  Just over a month ago the company announced that it was expanding its  option to more restaurants around the U S 

Slimmer Options

Along those same lines  Chipotle needs to look at ways to slim their menu down  I don t mean reduce the amount of options  I mean offering healthier  lower calorie versions of their dishes 

Last week  Chipotle stock took a hit after the release of a  that showed it may not be the healthy option many of its customers think it is  While Chipotle boasts about its organic and natural ingredients  that doesn t necessarily mean that its dishes are  good for you  

An easy fix for this issue is for Chipotle to offer a smaller portion size option  Moe s already serves  junior  sizes of its burritos  and it seems like Chipotle could easily implement a lower calorie menu that simply made its dishes smaller 

Promotions

Back in February  Chipotle offered all of its customers a free burrito as an apology for the food safety issues  In the short term  free giveaways and promotions cut into profits  but they can be an effective way of getting people to be return customers 

Chipotle needs to do more of this  Again  it will hurt for a bit  but a random free burrito giveaway or a  Taco Tuesday  promotion will serve to remind everyone that Chipotle s food is delicious and safe  and they should definitely come back and eat again 

Bottom Line

To any Chipotle executives that may have read this article  you re welcome  I humbly offer all of these suggestions to you for free  but shoot me a message if you want to hook it up with some coupons  All jokes aside  these ideas are just common sense ways to shake things up  which is something I think we can all agree Chipotle needs to do as soon as possible

The product emerged from a new partnership between PepsiCo Inc  s  NYSE PEP  Frito Lay and Burger King  The move is not the first of its kind  bearing resemblance to Yum  Brands   NYSE YUM   subsidiary Taco Bell s Doritos Locos Tacos mash up  The new item is one of many in Burger King s attempt to discover new profitable ventures 
Mac  n Cheetos will be sold for about eight weeks or until supplies run out at a small number of locations  Priced at  2 49  the five piece trial dish already appears to be generating buzz  However  QSR stock has not seen much movement with the announcement  currently down 1 4  since opening bell 
This is not Burger King s only trial dish  the other recent one being the Whopperito  essentially a chopped up whopper wrapped in a tortilla  Considering the success that the Doritos tacos had for Taco Bell  it s no surprise that Burger King is going out of its way to find the next big thing

137173,358688,YUM,Is It Time To Buy This Fast Food Chain ,opinion,"Sonic Corp   NASDAQ SONC  Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure   Reports June 23  After Market Closes
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of 43 cents on  167 94 million  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top
Sonic continues to see strength in core menu items  value based promotions and limited time items
The company is indicating that same store sales would fall in the range of flat to a 4  increase  lower than reported in its annual guidance
Lately we are seeing a buying opportunity in the fast food space  The trends that favored fast casual 5 years ago are shifting back to fast food dining  This past earnings season we saw Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM   McDonald s  NYSE MCD  and Wendy s  NASDAQ WEN  beat earnings expectations on increasing demand and rising comparable store sales  Sonic has its sight set high that Thursday s earnings will cause a spike in share prices
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of 43 cents on  167 94 million  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top  Compared to a year earlier  this reflects a 19  increase in earnings with sales growing as much as 2   Shares are currently down 10  year to date and typically don t make any gains following a report  
Sonic is best known for its quick services restaurants that bring a nostalgic 1920s drive in appeal at an inexpensive price  The company continues to see strength in core menu items  value based promotions and limited time items  The combination of sales leverage and a favorable commodity cost environment helped Sonic deliver a strong second quarter  Q2 featured a 6 5  increase in same store sales driven by 5 new store openings and improving margins  The company has invested heavily in technology initiatives to sustain its recent momentum and further differentiate themselves from its peers in the fast food industry 
Unfortunately  the company is already indicating softer same store sales trends  In May  management indicated same store sales would range from flat to a 4  increase lower than its annual guidance for growth of 4  to 6   The company s strengths such as growing net income  earnings a and expanding profit margins should be enough to outweigh weak operating cash flow and the early reports of declining sales

137174,358689,YUM,Forget Brexit  Celebrate July Fourth With These ETFs,opinion,"Americans seem all set to celebrate Independence Day by vacationing hard over this weekend  As per the   about  43 million Americans will travel from June 30 through July 4   trumping the 11 year high Memorial Day travel by nearly 5 million more travelers  Obviously  with this  it will hit a record this holiday weekend 
And this makes sense especially in an economy which is on the mend  Improving wages and still cheaper gas prices will give Americans the freedom to splurge on discretionary activities 
Despite the recent gains in oil prices  the level isn t so high that inhabitants will cut back on traveling  AAA indicated that  drivers have already saved  20 billion on gasoline this year compared to 2015  
People spend their summer holidays vacationing by road or air  So transportation stocks and ETFs become the largest beneficiaries of the travel trend 
Travel Modes in Detail As per the AAA survey  84  of Americans will hit the road thanks to the cheapest holiday weekend gas prices in 11 years  The figure is up 1 2  year over year  The source indicated that the national average price for a gallon of gasoline is 47 cents lower year over year  As far as air travel is concerned  there will be a 2 2  surge year over year 
Considerably lower average airfare must have heated up air travel this year  Also  European travel is likely to be in vogue courtesy of the falling pound and euro in the Brexit aftermath  CurrencyShares Euro ETF  NYSE FXE   lost over 2 5  in the last five days and CurrencyShares British Pound Sterling ETF  NYSE FXB   plummeted over 9 8  during the timeframe  as of June 29  2016   read

Industry  Restaurants   Part 3 

Link  

A gradually improving U S  economy and lower energy costs are driving improved consumer spending and the resultant improvement in sales are tailwinds for the restaurant industry  But are they enough  Let s find out 

High Expenses to Dent Margins    Costs related to initiatives to boost comps  and pre opening and restaurant re imaging expenses are dampening restaurant margins  Also  there has been considerable debate in the recent past over restaurant workers  wages  Workers at quick service restaurants claim that their employers  profits have not trickled down to them proportionately  which is leading to strikes for wage hikes  These incidents significantly hurt the reputation of restaurants  As a result  the companies are compelled to make minimum wage increases  which again lead to narrower margins 
	Restaurant management turnover is another critical headwind for operators as turnover rates have not only returned to pre recession levels  they are now exceeding them  according to a report from Black Box Intelligence  This is further compelling restaurants to either hike wages or provide benefits  at the cost of margins  to retain or attract employees  Companies like McDonald s Corp     and Domino s Pizza  Inc      are working on these lines Soft Traffic Trend    Traffic has remained negative in all of the first four months of 2016  which is a matter of concern for the industry  Per market analysts  diners are visiting chain restaurants less often and instead spending more per visit  which is hurting traffic  Throughout the beginning of this year  consumer behavior has been volatile  and the willingness to spend on most goods  especially eating out  showed signs of decline  Moreover  increases in menu prices at times prevents them from dining out  Restaurants that are bearing the brunt of soft traffic include Brinker International  Inc      Macro   Political Issues Other Challenges    The restaurant industry is facing difficulties like intense competition in the U S   a slowly recovering European economy and decelerating growth in Asia  Naturally  some restaurateurs like Brinker  with wide exposure in these regions  are facing macro headwinds 
	Also  food safety issues among consumers have been hurting comps of restaurants like Yum  Brands  Inc       which has faced serious allegations regarding food safety in China  Back in the U S   Chipotle bore the brunt of successive incidents of food borne illnesses  like salmonella  E  coli and norovirus  which dampened sales of the fast casual restaurant in 2015 and 2016 Currency Headwinds    Fluctuating currency exchange rates are also a concern  Currently  the strong U S  dollar is lowering the value of overseas sales of companies like Domino s Pizza  Dunkin  Brands Group  Inc      Yum  Brands and McDonald s as these have considerable overseas presence  Meanwhile  McDonald s and Yum  are also likely to be hurt by the devaluation of the Chinese yuan in the form of weak sales going forward  as China is one of their key operating regions Affordable Care Act to Hurt Margins    The Affordable Care Act  commonly known as Obamacare  is expected to have an adverse impact on operators  U S  health care reform as per the Act imposes several new requirements on employer health benefits  The law entailed restaurants with 100 or more full time equivalent employees to offer health care coverage to substantially all full time employees and their dependents from last year

The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  0 69 and revenue of  4 017 billion  slightly higher than Wall Street s estimates
The fast food tycoon made headlines this past quarter when they announced its intent to split its operations
China currently contributes 56  of Yum Brand s revenue and over 50  of its operating margins
Best known as the parent company of Taco Bell  Pizza Hut and KFC  Yum Brands  N YUM  is scheduled to report Q4 2015 earnings February 3  after the market closes  The fast food giant made headlines this past quarter when they announced a split of its operations  featuring a sole China division  Until Yum completes the Yum China spinoff  China is still what matters most to Yum  representing 35  of its current operating income  On top of weakness in China  macroeconomic concerns  including foreign exchange headwinds and contaminated poultry have put pressure on the company s bottom line  Even with so much hinging on China  Yum is expected to report modest gains in key metrics such as same stores sales and revenue  The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  0 69 and revenue of  4 017 billion  slightly higher than Wall Street s estimates  Compared to Q4 2014  this represents a projected YoY increase in EPS and revenue of 14  and 1   respectively  Since the announced split  Yum estimates have seen heavy downward revisions to the tune of 17  and 4  declines in EPS and revenue  respectively  
Like a number of multinational restaurants brands  Yum faces macroeconomic headwinds from a strong dollar  weakness in China  health concerns and wage increases  Naturally  all eyes will be on China  which contributes 56  to Yum Brands  revenue  With such a high exposure to China  it is no surprise that revenue growth has been volatile  Sales in China have continued to falter due to waning public perception and a contamination scares with one of its largest suppliers  That said  Yum still plans to open 700 additional units on top of the 6 900 already existing stores in China  
Amongst its three core brands  Pizza Hut continues to struggle with flat revenue and same store growth  Fortunately  the Pizza Hut brand accounts for less than 10  of Yum s revenue  On the other hand  KFC and Taco Bell are expected to make same store sales gains thanks to a robust value oriented menu  Taco Bell has made a remarkable recovery from its 2006 E  Coli outbreak and is now a huge catalyst to Yum s success  Armed with great brands  Yum has the ingredients to overcome the recent economic turmoil ",2016-02-02,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-watch:-will-tacos-carry-yum-382904,382904

137217,358732,YUM,Papa John s Stock Set For Continued Expansion,opinion,"Papa John s International Inc  O PZZA 
When you think take out pizza  usually something like Domino s Pizza Group Plc  N DPZ  or Pizza Hut  N YUM  comes to mind  However  it would be prudent for you to pay attention to that other take out pizza joint Papa John s as it has some characteristics of a fantastic asset 
Over the past 10 years  Papa John s has grown its revenue from  969 million to  1 6 billion by the end of 2015  for an average annual growth rate of 5 5   Net profit has grown over this same period from  46 million to  72 million  an average annual growth rate of 4 6   Operating cash flow has grown from  84 million to  158 million  representing a 6 5  average annual growth rate 
You witnessed shares outstanding shrink from 69 million to 40 million shares by the end of 2015  an astonishing 42  reduction  This has meant that earnings per share has grown at an annual average rate of 10 3   outpacing the revenue  net profit  and operating cash flow growth over the past ten years  As an owner in the business  as Papa John s bought out other owners and destroyed the stock  you would have seen your share of the profit pie rise 
What makes Papa John s particularly fascinating is that the original founder  John Schnatter  still operates the company as CEO and owns a 26  stake in the company  Schnatter has been skilled in both operating the business and allocating the excess capital produced by the enterprise  which is a rare trait to possess for a corporate CEO  as CEOs tend to be good at either or  but not both 
On the operation side  Schnatter planned out the growth and expansion of Papa John s in 3 stages  First  he built out the corporate restaurants that the company owns directly  Then  he started franchising out and collecting fixed payments from franchisees  And finally  Schnatter started to bring the development of the ingredients that go into making Papa John s pizza s in house  meaning that the corporate head office could collect profits from both franchising and selling the ingredients to franchisees  After this structure had been built  Schnatter began worldwide expansion  This structure has allowed the company to successfully expand to 4 000 stores spread over 36 countries 
Along with good operational skills  Schnatter has been great on the asset allocation side of the equation  as represented by the share buybacks over the past 10 years  Schnatter bought back stock aggressively when the stock was trading below its normal price earnings ratio of around 23 4 from 2005 to 2013  He slowed down the pace of buybacks after 2013 when the stock has been perpetually valued way 23 to almost 40 times earnings  This type of activity demonstrates that Schnatter is not just blindly buying back shares for the sake of buying back shares  he is purchasing them back when they are quantitatively undervalued 
With Papa John s  you are looking at potential ownership in a company that has been consistent with growing its revenue and profits over time  You get to ride along with the original founder and CEO  John Schnatter  who shows signs of being both a great business operator and capital allocator for shareholders  At the current stock price  it probably doesn t make sense to initiate a position quite yet  as it is trading above its historic normal P E ratio of 23 4  There will be opportunities to potentially get the shares at below 20 times earnings  It is around these prices of entry that outstanding results should follow from ownership in the company  For now  I would put Papa John s on the watch list  study the company  and patiently wait for a more attractive entry point

137219,358734,YUM,Bonus Trade Idea For The Week April 11  2016  YUM,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Yum Brands  NYSE YUM  made a high just under  100 in May of 2015  From that point the stock started to pullback  losing 33  of its value before it was done  The downtrend morphed into a bottoming consolidation in October 2015 that lasted until the beginning of March  That is when the rise off of the ultimate low broke above the prior resistance  It continued higher to a consolidation that has been in place for the last 2 weeks 
This consolidation is happening right at the gap down spot from October  The gap has been filled  It is also happening just under the 61 8  retracement of that downward leg  A push through resistance gives a short term target of 85 50 on a Measured Move higher  The full price action since May 2015 has also traced out a bearish Shark harmonic  but with a Potential Reversal Zone  PRZ  at 92 50 above  This is your intermediate term target 
The momentum indicators are bullish but showing possible signs of fading  The RSI is strong but the MACD has crossed down  but is well into positive territory  Also note that the 50 day SMA is heading up for a Golden Cross up through the 200 day SMA  There is resistance higher at 82 50 and 83 50 followed by 86 50 and 89 75 before 93  Support lower comes at 80 60 and 76 70 before 75  Short interest is low at just over 2  and the company is due to report earnings after the close April 20th  The stock also goes ex dividend April 13th 
The options chains see weekly expirations for Yum  The April chain sees very large open interest on the call side compared to the put side  The biggest open interest on the Call side is at 75 and then 77 50 followed by 90 above  The Puts have biggest open interest at 90 and then below at 77 5 and 75  This would suggest a move lower this week  The April 22 Expiry sees much less open interest with the majority below the current price and biggest at 79 on the Put side and 77 5  78 and 80 on the Call side  Out in May the open interest is focused above and at the 87 5 and 90 Strike  with some size at 82 50 and 80 as well 
Yum Brands

Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 82 50 with a stop at 80 50 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 82 50 with a April 22 Expiry 82 5 80 Put Spread and selling a May 87 5 Call  The options constitute a collar that gives protection for a  2 50 move lower and allow  5 of upside  without any cost 
Trade Idea 3  Buy a May 82 5 87 5 Call Spread   2   and sell the April 29 Expiry 77 Put   1  to add leverage and lower the cost 
Trade Idea 4  Buy an April 82 May 77 5 Put Diagonal  Buy April and sell May  for a 40 cent credit 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which heading into April Options Expiration week sees the equity markets have stalled in some respects and may be starting to turn back lower 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue its reversal higher as crude oil rises  The US Dollar Index looks weak and headed lower while US Treasuries are strong and rising  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue its drift higher as Emerging Markets are starting to turn lower  Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETFs NYSE SPY  NYSE IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts show some weakness  especially in the SPY  with the IWM and QQQ a bit strong and consolidating  but no longer rising short term  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well ",2016-04-11,Gregory W.

137220,358735,YUM,3 Numbers To Watch When Yum  Brands Reports Q1 Earnings,opinion,"Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  0 85 on  2 64 billion in revenue  2 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  16 million below on the top 
Taco Bell has been Yum  Brands   NYSE YUM  best performer  carrying growth from strong breakfast sales in domestic markets
Later this year  Yum plans to spin off its China business into its own separate entity despite a laundry list of health scares in the region
Popular fast food brand  Yum Foods  is scheduled to report first quarter earnings Wednesday  after the market closes  Yum Brands is responsible for bringing us notable chains such as KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell  Lately  results have been mixed  with EPS missing in 4 of the last 8 quarters  Revenue results have been even worse off  missing in 7 of the last 8 quarters  The stock has largely tracked these ups and down  but overall has remained relatively flat in the last 12 months  Unfortunately  Q1 results aren t expected to be much better  The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  0 85 on  2 64 billion in revenue  2 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  16 million below on the top  Compared to a year prior  earnings are expected to grow 5  while sales should increase an anemic 1   Just like earnings  the stock is relatively inactive leading up and through quarterly results 

In recent quarters  Yum brands have performed remarkably well in domestic markets despite an uptick in health conscious Americans  This comes on the back of strong sales growth throughout its Taco Bell division  The introduction of new menu items and a breakfast category have already surpassed expectations  Last quarter  Taco bell posted a 4  increase in comps followed by KFC with a 3  increase and Pizza Hut at 1   The success of these brands have only partially offset sluggish growth in China and India  Recently  Yum issued soft guidance in its international markets as it recovers from a slew of food safety scares over the last two years  International sales will also come with the negative impact of currency headwinds  which should subside as the year goes on and the US dollar stabilizes  Later this year Yum will spin off its China business into its own separate entity  which many believe will unlock huge value  Apart from China  the company witnessed a comp decline in its equally important India division ",2016-04-20,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-numbers-to-watch-when-yum!-brands-reports-q1-earnings-200125692,200125692
137244,358759,YUM,Pessimism Still Very High     Bulls Enjoying The Negativity Off The Lows,opinion,"When markets get overly optimistic  meaning too many bulls  they have a tendency to struggle  even if it takes a while before they go down appreciably  See how the market did nothing most of last year except to move laterally  Then we had the strong and powerful move lower that took the S P 500 down 14   Now we re dealing with the opposite effect  The bull bears spread now at minus 4 2   which is off last week s minus 10  reading  but still below 0  which is very good news for the bulls  The Rydex bear fund is also at three year highs  which shows you the bears are still quite aggressive  which is a negative for them  of course  The market has shown a few gap ups here over the past couple of days  and may now be headed for a lateral bull flag type of set up 
There s no given amount of time it has to stay in the flag  but it s in a flag for now  and that normally resolves itself from the direction it came from  which was up  Add in that bull markets usually tend to test the old highs over and over  even if the levels fall a bit shy  It s not out of the question that we ll continue to trend higher overall  Not easily  but trend that way  We saw it today as overbought  short term charts allowed for yet another move higher in the indexes  before encountering resistance at S P 500 2000 or the mid point from the recent high to low  They also encountered overbought again  with some short term negative divergences  The fall wasn t bearish off the top  so I d say again that it appears the indexes are trying to set up bull flags to work their way higher over time  No guarantee of this  of course  based on the continuing flow of poor economic news  but this is what appears to be setting up in just about every index I see  Times are a bit better now for the bulls  Nothing special  but at least a bit better 
For the bull market to continue on further than it already has  they have to start with improving global economies  We are seeing anything but that for the most part  especially here at home over the past few months  Declining manufacturing and services  declining job creation  and the list goes on and on  To make matters worse  from a technical perspective  any move to new highs would create massive negative divergences on the monthly index charts across the board  They would be quite severe in nature  and often how bull markets make their final highs  If the fundamental picture continues to erode and cannot help the technical picture  I d say the end is near for the bull market  even if we make a higher high first 
I believe that even if the fundamental picture does improve  the bull would still end  but the process would take longer to play out  Also  it wouldn t be as severe in price or time  Those nasty monthly charts in the end  I believe  call a top if we make new highs  or even if we don t  Hopefully  we can push things out  until sometime later next year  but a lot of that depends on the fundamentals  All we can do is see how they come in day by day  Maybe we can get more surprises  positive  like we did with the Euro Zone earlier this week  On the other hand  the news out of China is so terrible that it s hard to imagine things turning around bullish any time soon 
The early earnings numbers are painting a bad picture for future growth out of China  The earnings season is upon us now  This scares me for the bulls  since a lot of the economic problems have recently occurred and seems to be accelerating  I believe many CEO s were not prepared three months back during the last earnings season in terms of their future guidance  Most were taken by surprise by the recent down turn overseas as well as here at home  Maybe there will be more warnings than normal  I would expect no mercy since many P E s are simply too high  Yum  Brands  Inc   NYSE YUM  for instance  Crushed on bad news last night  Nu Skin Enterprises Inc  NYSE NUS  and Adobe Systems Incorporated  NASDAQ ADBE  as well 
Many pre earnings warnings are occurring now  It doesn t look like a good season is upon us  and  if so  the CEO s should throw in the towel and guide way down  so as to be to beat three months down the road  during the next earnings season  It seems the market isn t done with knocking out some stocks  even though they ve already been crushed  If you re bad on your numbers you will continue to get smoked  So  as always  be smart about what you hold in to those reports  I think this will be the toughest quarter in quite a few years  All that said  just know the numbers  2000 to 2031 is key resistance on the S P 500  with 1954 both gap support and the 20 day EMA ",2015-10-08,Jack Steiman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pessimism-still-very-high.....bulls-enjoying-the-negativity-off-the-lows-267444,267444
137245,358760,YUM,5 Stocks To Watch Today  UA  MCD  CAT  AMZN  GOOGL,opinion,"The deluge of earnings continues  with these five big names set to report today 
Thursday  October 22

Under Armour  N UA 
Consumer Discretionary   Textiles  Apparel   Luxury Goods   Reports October 22  before the open
Estimize is currently expecting EPS of  0 45  one cent higher than Wall Street s consensus  Revenues are also slightly higher at  1 181B vs  the Street s  1 173B  This would easily get  out of the red on the bottom line  with 10  EPS growth  after two negative quarters  Revenues are expected to stay in their recent range with 26  growth 

What to watch  Investors have taken this stock up 45  since the beginning of the year  but some worry that it is overvalued  With a forward P E of 46 it s certainly priced to perfection  and will have to hit analyst s predictions for Q3 or else risk a significant drop in price  By comparison  Skechers  N SKX  trades at 20x and Nike  N NKE  at 25x  The main focus for UA this quarter will be on footwear  college athletic apparel and women s apparel  The spike in popularity of basketball shoes makes the footwear segment an obvious target  Currently footwear accounts for less than 20  of UA s total revenues  vs  competitor Nike for which footwear makes up around 65  of revenues 
Under Armour should get some help from the Steph Curry line which is rumored to have sold  100M  worth of shoes in the last year  The company also recently signed an apparel and footwear deal with the University of Wisconsin worth nearly  100M over a decade  and is pursuing the University of a Texas in a deal that could be worth  15M  a year  These deals add up quickly and help increase awareness with fans  The company is also going to try to more effectively penetrate the women s market  currently dominated by brands such as lululemon  O LULU  
McDonald s  N MCD 
Consumer Discretionary   Hotels Restaurants   Leisure   Reports October 22  before the open
The Estimize community expects EPS of  1 28  one penny higher than Wall Street  Revenues are anticipated to come in at  6 452B vs  the Street s  6 440B 

What to watch  As with competitor Yum  Brands Inc  N YUM   which released dire results two weeks ago  expect  to post poor results on account of China  While China s slowing economy doesn t help matters  there are other issues in that region that are impacting the fast food giant  Food quality issues that surfaced a year ago in which a main meat supplier was relabeling expired meat has made once loyal customers hesitant to return to the restaurant  It also seems possible that the cachet of American quick serve restaurants is beginning to wear off as a slew of new international and domestic chains have emerged on the scene  but that hasn t stopped McDonald s from adding more locations in China 
Add to that currency headwinds which will take their toll once again this quarter  as MCD receives over half of its revenues from overseas  The company is taking a number of measures to reinvigorate its brand  cutting unpopular items from the menu and implementing digital strategies that range from touch screen ordering to mobile ordering options  As consumer tastes trend towards fresh ingredients and customizable meals  MCD is trying to deliver but having issues scaling  A commitment to higher wages will make a dent in the bottom line this quarter  but is certainly a great move for public perception  Also  expect to hear comments on the success of McDonald s all day breakfast which has been performing well across the country  but comes with smaller margins 
Caterpillar  N CAT 
Industrials   Machinery   Reports October 22  before the open
The Estimize community is looking for EPS of  0 79  4 cents ahead of Wall Street  Revenues are anticipated to come in at  11 252B vs  the Street s  11 110B 

What to watch   forewarned about a less than stellar Q3  cutting their sales guidance to account for restructuring costs that include 10 000  layoffs  The company also foreshadowed higher R D costs as they invest in new products and technologies  Backlogs have been on the decline for the last couple of quarters  specifically in three areas  Construction  Energy and Transportation and Resource Industries  A drop in the demand for commodities such as energy and base metals has had the biggest negative impact on Caterpillar  The industrial giant falls within the machinery industry in the S P 500  which is expecting a YoY drop in profits of 12 2  in the third quarter  with revenues anticipated to decline 9 4   Other industries in which CAT is involved in are also expecting sharp decreases  with oil  gas and consumable fuels estimated to see a 65  decrease in EPS and 27 7  decline in sales  Metals   Mining  within the materials sector  is expected to fall 62 6  on earnings  and 15 4  on revenues 
Caterpillar is typically seen as a proxy of global growth  but the picture for the second half of the year and even into 2016 isn t a pretty one and has investors worried about the state of the world economy  One bright spot could be construction which continues to improve  especially on the commercial front 
Amazon  O AMZN 
Consumer Discretionary   Internet   Catalog Retail   Reports October 22  after the close
The Estimize community expects  to post EPS of   0 05 for Q3  higher than the Street s expectation for   0 10  Revenues are anticipated to come in at  24 909B vs  the Street s  24 856 and company guidance of  24 400B  Keep in mind  however  last quarter the company was expected to post an EPS decline of  0 08  but blew everyone away when results came in at  0 19  179  growth YoY  Revenues also beat and grew 20  

What to watch  Notorious for overspending  it seems Amazon could be working itself out of a hole of poor investments such as the Amazon Fire Phone  Competitors can t seem to keep up with their Prime service  with the likes of Wal Mart  N WMT  and Best Buy  N BBY  doing their best to price match and offer similar shipping deals that haven t yet caught on  Prime customers are incentivized to use the service to get deals  and have online cloud storage  free 2 day shipping  instant streaming videos etc  Wal Mart began offering an unlimited shipping membership for  50 annually  but does not offer the other perks of Amazon Prime 
A big boon for AMZN will be its Prime day event which will be counted this quarter  Amazon s Prime Day sale  held in July  topped expectations and drove record revenues during a normally slow period  The company saw more orders than it did on Black Friday of 2014 34 4M  They also saw a 266  increase in worldwide orders 
Alphabet  Inc   O GOOGL 
Information Technology   Internet Software   Services   Reports October 22  after the close
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  7 33  8 cents higher than Wall Street  Revenues ex TAC are expected to come in at  15 2B as compared to the Street s  15 1B consensus 

What to watch  While both EPS and revenue growth for  were in the double digits last quarter  weakness in cost per click  CPC  had a negative impact once again  now going on 2 years of steady decline  Sales from search ads have not kept up with the pace of search volume due to the emergence of programmatic buying  matching relevant ads with content  and user generated content  Advertisers have been allocating more of their budget towards mobile in response to increasing traffic from mobile devices  Google  O GOOG  dominates the PC search market  with 65  of market share  but desktop revenues continue to fall  and make up less of Google s value now as compared to mobile revenues  Recognizing this trend  the tech giant has been increasingly investing in mobile  recently introducing deep links for mobile apps to help surface mobile content during search  Ad volume growth should also be a bright spot  as GOOGL implemented its enhanced campaigns program to combine ad marketing campaigns across mobile  desktop and laptops  Growth in video ads thanks to YouTube should also be a good thing  as online videos remain one of the fastest growing segments ",2015-10-22,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-tomorrow---ua,-mcd,-cat,-amzn,-googl-268853",268853
137264,358779,YUM,Earnings Still Matter ,opinion,"Many years ago  if you asked someone what drove stock prices  they would give you a simple  honest answer  earnings  If a company had strong earnings  and those earnings were projected to grow  then the stock price was strong  If not  then not 
Take a time machine back to that same person and tell them about the new world in which what drives stock prices is the USD JPY  Yep  the ratio of the US dollar to the Japanese Yen is what everyone follows  pip by pip  tonight being yet another example  as everyone is tied up in knots as to what that chortling buffoon Kurado is going to announce   What the USD JPY has to do with honest to God equity value is beyond me 
In spite of this  earnings still matter  and as we head into another earnings season  the bulls better pray to whatever pagan gods they worship that company after company magically defy the downturn that the economy is quite obviously entering  It isn t off to a good start this evening  however  as the charts below show 
First off  there is Yum  Brands Inc  NYSE YUM   which is the organization that owns the fine dining establishments Kentucky Fried Chicken  Taco Bell  and Pizza Hut  I guess even the morbidly obese typical American gastropod has had his fill over low quality  over salted  over greased crap that these dreadful little venues crank out  as the stock has lost nearly one fifth of its market cap after hours  after having already dropped substantially in recent months  

Software make Adobe Systems Incorporated  NASDAQ ADBE  is having a relatively gentle time of it  as its percentage loss is  as of this writing  at least  still confined to the single digits  All the same  it s pretty ugly out there 

These are just two companies out of the thousands that will be reporting in the weeks ahead  Let s hope this is representative of plenty of bad news to come ",2015-10-07,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-still-matter-267305,267305

Stocks slipped on Monday as concerns over Greece turning its back on its debt obligations led to weakness in European benchmarks  The German DAX declined by 1 69   the French CAC was lower by 0 85   and the Spanish IBEX fell by 1 97  
The Athens General Share benchmark shed 4 75   maintaining the trend of lower highs and lower lows that dates back to April of last year  Seasonally  the Greek benchmark tends to perform positively between January and May  however  with the ongoing struggles continuing to overhang the European country  equities have yet shown anything close to the average gains for this time of year  a bottoming pattern has yet to materialize  Greek officials plan on meeting with creditors on Wednesday in hopes to discuss a compromise to current austerity measures  equity markets are likely to remain on edge until some kind of resolution has been met

137278,358793,YUM,Analysts Remain Positive on Yum  Brands On China Spin Off Speculation,opinion,"Rumors have been circulating for a while that KFC  Pizza Hut  and Taco Bell owner Yum  Brands  NYSE YUM  will spin off its China division as it is still recovering from an expired meat scandal which took place in August of last year 
After attending a YUM investor conference in China last week  J P Morgan analyst  believes these rumors are turning from a  possibility  to a  probability   On May 15  the analyst upgraded his rating on Yum  Brands from Neutral to Overweight and raised his price target from  83 to  108 
Ivankoe believes that due to current market conditions  spinning off the China division of Yum Brands  will create both short term and long term share holder value  The analyst noted   Perhaps timing starts in 2H15 when Yum China s sales performance should allow investors to see recoverability from last year s crisis  
John Ivankoe has rated Yum  Brands 10 times since April 2009  earning an 80  success rate recommending the company and a  13 5  average return per YUM recommendation  Overall  the analyst has an 80  success rate recommending stocks and a  14 6  average return per recommendation 
On May 18  Oppenheimer analyst  maintained an Outperform rating on Yum  Brands and raised his price target from  90 to  105 following the company s investor conference in China  noting that he is  more excited that fundamental upside lingers   The analyst commented that  the business operated like a standalone with self funding abilities   Furthermore  Bittner was happy that YUM management  reiterated its commitment to restoring top to bottom fundamentals  and  the potential of separating the China business  
Brian Bittner has rated Yum  Brands 13 times since January 2013  earning a 92  success rate recommending the stock and a  16 2  average return per YUM recommendation  Overall  he has a 77  success rate recommending stocks and a  19 8  average return per recommendation

137311,358826,YUM,Breakfast Wars  Double Digit Sales Growth Expected By Yum  Brands,opinion,"Yum  Brands Inc  NYSE YUM  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings after the market closes on Tuesday  April 22nd  Yum  Brands is the parent company of the Taco Bell  KFC  Pizza Hut  and WingStreet restaurant chains  The biggest news of the quarter from Yum  came when they announced they would be offering breakfast at Taco Bell featuring the AM CrunchWrap and Waffle Taco  Yum  is attempting to challenge McDonald s 30  market share on breakfast as well as the big coffee chains  Dunkin  Donuts and Starbucks  who both enjoy significant morning food sales  This quarter Wall Street is expecting EPS growth of 14c per share and an increase in revenue of 11 8  compared to FQ1 of last year  Here s what investors expect from Yum  on Tuesday 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Yum  to report 84c EPS and  2 834B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 18 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 84c EPS and  2 843B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Yum  to report in line with the Wall Street consensus on EPS but beat revenue expectations by a small margin 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 5 and 3 times respectively  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a small differential between the two groups  revenue expectations 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 78c to 89c EPS and from  2 695B to  3 001B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a moderate distribution of estimates on YUM 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 
 
Over the past 4 months the Wall Street and Estimize forecasts have been moving in opposite directions  which is unusual  The Wall Street EPS forecast dropped from 87c to 84c while the Estimize consensus converged from 83c at the beginning of the period to 84c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus fell from  2 873B to  2 834B while the Estimize consensus increased from  2 805B to  2 843B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and the direction of analyst revisions is often a leading indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is BradHewitt91 who projects 87c EPS and  2 830B in revenue  BradHewitt91 is ranked 13th overall among over 4 150 contributing analysts  Over the past year BradHewitt91 has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 52  and 50  of the time respectively throughout 702 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case BradHewitt91 is expecting Yum  to report significantly higher EPS but slightly lower revenue than either Wall Street or the Estimize community predict 
This quarter Yum  attacked McDonald s hold on the breakfast market with ads mocking Ronald McDonald  On Tuesday the first battle of breakfast will take place and we will see who is winning the breakfast war  Analysts expect both top line and bottom line growth from Yum  Brands while McDonald s is predicted to report slightly higher revenue than last year but lower earnings  McDonald s is forecast to report year over year revenue growth of only 2  while Yum  brands sales are predicted to expand much more rapidly and growth by 12  compared to FQ1 of last year accroding to forecasts from the Estimize com community

137351,358866,YUM,China Vs  SEC  Clash Of The Balance Sheets,opinion,China and the United States are on a collision course   over accounting  Last week  the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC   the Chinese affiliates of the world s top five accounting firms with violating securities laws for refusing to hand over information on suspect Chinese companies to investigators  The move is the latest  most dramatic step in an escalating standoff that could easily lead to a financial version of Armageddon  the forcible  and unprecedented  delisting of all Chinese shares currently traded on U S  exchanges  including big name stocks like Baidu  BIDU   Sinopec  SHI   and China Mobile  CHL    causing losses of billions of dollars and damaging the perception that the United States is friendly to Chinese businesses  Accounting audit practices may seem like a topic more likely to lull nations  and magazine readers  to sleep  But as anyone who lost money investing in Enron or with Bernie Madoff knows  playing fast and loose with accounting rules can have huge consequences  Accounting is the language of business  and lying about revenues or liabilities is fraud  Washington created the SEC in the wake of the Wall Street Crash of 1929 to ensure that companies that offer their shares to the public are what they claim to be  To meet that objective  the SEC requires that all companies selling securities to the public to submit annual financial statements audited by a qualified third party  If a company doesn t file reports that have an auditor s stamp of approval  its stocks and bonds cannot be traded on a public exchange  After the scandal following the 2001 collapse of energy giant Enron  in which the company s auditor  Arthur Andersen  faced criminal charges for covering up dodgy accounting practices  Congress passed the Sarbanes Oxley Act to tighten up regulation of auditors and the audit process  The new law created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  PCAOB   a quasi public entity that reports to the SEC and is responsible for policing the auditors  Now  in order to perform qualified audits  an audit firm must register with the board and submit to rigorous and regular inspections by its staff  Over the past decade  roughly 400 Chinese companies have listed their shares on U S  stock exchanges  A few are multi billion dollar state owned enterprises  such as China Life  China Telecom  and PetroChina  More than 100 were so called backdoor listed companies that circumvented the cost and scrutiny associated with an initial public offering by buying and merging into a U S  firm whose stock was already listed  As U S  listed stocks  all of them have chosen to submit themselves to SEC regulation in order to tap U S  and global investors for funds via U S  markets  Because the bulk of their operations are in China  these companies must rely on auditors licensed in China   in many cases the Chinese subsidiaries of the top global audit firms   to audit them  For the SEC to accept their audits  these China based auditors must register and maintain good standing with the board  The problem is that the Chinese regulator  the China Securities Regulatory Commission  CSRC   refuses to allow the board to inspect the U S  registered  China based auditors  as required by Sarbanes Oxley  It sees the idea of a U S  regulator overseeing a Chinese auditor as a violation of China s national sovereignty  For some time now  the board has been negotiating with the CSRC  trying to get them to accept some form of cooperative inspections  or even allow it to observe Chinese inspections  So far  these talks have gone nowhere  It s not unusual for the United States to get pushback from foreign countries or foreign companies on new regulations  When Sarbanes Oxley first passed  several U S  listed European firms  as well as many U S  companies  objected to a provision requiring listed firms to perform an annual audit of internal controls  in addition to the traditional audit of financial statements  They argued that this extra requirement was so costly and burdensome  they might no longer bother to maintain their stock listings in the United States  seriously undermining the position of the U S  capital markets on the world stage  In response  the SEC temporarily suspended the rule for foreign companies  and eventually scaled down the requirement for all companies to a less onerous  top down review   Recent events  however  have made it a lot harder for the SEC to show similar flexibility toward China  Since 2010  a number of short sellers researching in China have leveled high profile accusations of fraud against Chinese firms listed on U S  markets  Five companies targeted by Muddy Waters  the best known of those short sellers   in market value through June 2011  Several others have seen their shares rendered nearly worthless or been forced to declare bankruptcy  These firms allegedly engaged in malfeasance ranging from questionable accounting practices to inflate revenues and profits  making up numbers out of thin air  and hoping no one has the resources to prove otherwise   embezzling funds  and even being total shams  The SEC has also raised concerns about a popular holding structure  called the Variable Interest Entity  that many U S  listed  China stocks  use to operate in certain industries in China  such as media and education  where foreign ownership is prohibited  The U S  listed company exercises operational and financial  control  via contracts  allowing it to claim the China business as its own  Virtually all Chinese Internet start ups listed in the United States are structured this way  The SEC worries that Chinese authorities could someday invalidate the contracts as illegal  leaving U S  investors holding completely worthless shares  In response  the SEC has launched fraud investigations into several U S  listed Chinese companies and their executives  ordering their China based auditors to hand over confidential documents to examine for potential evidence of wrongdoing  In the most visible case  the SEC in May 2011  for Deloitte China a federal court subpoena to turn over its audit work papers for Longtop Financial Technologies  a Hong Kong based maker of financial software that short seller Citron Research had accused of fraudulent accounting  prompting Deloitte to resign the account  citing  recently identified falsity  in Longtop s financial statements   Deloitte China fired its lawyer for accepting the subpoena  and refused to comply  In a court filing explaining why  Deloitte  that Chinese regulators had issued an extraordinary threat  telling auditors that handing over audit work papers would violate China s  vague and draconian  State Secrets law  allowing China to  dissolve the firm entirely and to seek prison sentences up to life in prison for any  Deloitte  partners and employees who participated in the violation   The refusals come at a time when Chinese local authorities  embarrassed by the allegations  have been cracking down on short sellers  researchers   access to company disclosure filings and sometimes  and even jailing research teams conducting due diligence within China  The SEC  for its part  asked the judge in the Deloitte case for a stay until this coming January  to see if it could work out some kind of solution with its counterparts at the CSRC  Last week s decision to file charges against all five top global audit firms in China appears to signal an end to the SEC s patience  In its court filing  the SEC expressed frustration   that since 2009  the CSRC had refused to provide any meaningful assistance on 21 information requests arising from 16 securities investigations into U S  listed Chinese firms  The Chinese  it has concluded  are simply stonewalling  While the details may seem arcane  the ramifications can hardly be overstated  Chinese auditors could face financial penalties  but they could also be disqualified from conducting SEC audits  If Chinese auditors get de registered  U S  listed Chinese companies won t be able to find anyone to sign off on their audits  leading all of these firms to have their shares forcibly delisted  en masse  from U S  markets  Shareholders would still own their shares  but those shares would be much harder to buy and sell  making them worth considerably less  Some domestic players think China has outgrown its need to rely on U S  capital markets  State owned China Development Bank has  a  1 billion war chest to help buy out U S  listed Chinese companies and take them private  Rather than caving in  their defenders argue  Chinese companies should come home and relist on domestic or Hong Kong stock exchanges  where they might command even higher valuations  Given that China s Shanghai Index is down two thirds from its peak five years ago  and with Hong Kong regulators raising similar concerns about fraud  this path may not be as easy or as promising as it sounds  Chinese companies won t be the only ones affected if SEC qualified Chinese auditors go the way of the dodo  Plenty of multinationals listed on U S  markets  many of them headquartered in the United States  have substantial parts of their business in China  Yum Brands  YUM  takes in  from the KFC and Pizza Hut outlets it has in China  Car sales in China  for 34 percent of General Motors   GM  profits  These numbers matter to their global bottom lines  and to sign off on their SEC filings  their lead auditors in the United States need a PBAOC registered Chinese auditor to vouch for them  If no such auditors exist  these companies have a problem   There may be clever workarounds  such as dividing up the work among so many auditors that none of them is vouching for a  substantial  part of the business  but it s a costly and cumbersome solution  Nor is it clear if easy loopholes can be created for multinationals with substantial China operations without tearing a big hole in the fabric of U S  securities regulation   The SEC  though  may feel it has no other option  China s constraints effectively place Chinese companies completely beyond the reach of U S  securities laws  If this were just a theoretical concern  there might be room to maneuver  But with dozens of Chinese stocks traded on U S  exchanges dragged down by fraud allegations  costing investors billions of dollars in losses  the SEC has to act  And each action it takes brings the United States and China one step closer to an ugly financial divorce ,2012-12-12,Patrick Chovanec,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china-vs.-sec:-clash-of-the-balance-sheets-147258,147258
