1  China s Xi Is Readying For  Full Scale Trade War 
Escalating trade rhetoric continued to nag at investors after Chinese President Xi Jinping warned his cabinet to get ready for a  full scale trade war   according to a research note from macro research firm SGH Macro Advisors 
Xi made the comments during a meeting of China s highest decision making body  which gathered to discuss China U S  relations 
Chinese officials have concluded it appears inevitable the U S  will impose tariffs on  34 billion worth of Chinese goods on July 6  and will respond accordingly with tariffs of their own 
The report added that the People s Bank of China  PBOC  is ready to refrain from buying U S  Treasurys  or even cut its purchases 
China is a massive holder of U S  Treasurys  and investors have been concerned about the impact of the PBOC shedding those bonds 
The mounting trade frictions between the world s two largest economies prompted a sell off in global stock markets  including China  which entered bear territory 
Chinese blue chips sank 2  to be a whisker above 13 month lows as a resolution of Sino U S  tensions remained a distant prospect 
In addition  China s central bank guided the yuan to a six month low against the U S  dollar  sending the Chinese currency tumbling and stirring speculation Beijing was allowing its currency to weaken to bolster exports 
2  U S  Stocks Set To Take A Beating
U S  stock futures pointed to sharp losses at the open  as worries over a brewing trade war between the U S  and China kept buyers on the sidelines 
At 5 55AM ET  the blue chip Dow futures were down 140 points  or around 0 6   the S P 500 futures slumped 12 points  or 0 5   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a loss of 58 points  or roughly 0 8  
Stocks closed slightly higher on Tuesday  but mixed messages from the Trump administration regarding trade kept a lid on gains 
In earnings news  results from  General Mills   NYSE GIS  and Paychex  NASDAQ PAYX  will be the highlights 
Elsewhere  European markets were under pressure as financials and industrials stocks suffered  Bank shares fell to their lowest since December 2016 while the autos sector  a prominent target of higher U S  tariffs  neared a 10 month low 
Earlier  Asian shares ended lower  as further falls in Chinese stocks and the yuan sent ripples across the region 
3  Dollar Holds Steady  10 Year Yield Slips To 2 85 
Away from equities  the U S  dollar held steady against a basket of currencies  as concerns over heightened trade tensions continued to weigh on market sentiment 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  was 0 1  higher at 94 44 
The euro dipped 0 1  against the dollar to 1 1635 
Sterling was effectively flat at 1 3210 
Against the safe haven yen  however  the greenback extended last session s losses to trade at 109 85  The yen is often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions 
In the bond market  the U S  10 year Treasury yield edged down to 2 85  
4  U S  Durable Goods Data  Fed Speakers On Tap
Market players will focus on a fresh batch of U S  economic data to gauge the health of the world s largest economy 
The Commerce Department will publish a report on durable goods orders for May at 8 30AM ET  amid expectations for a decline of 0 9   Orders for non defense capital goods excluding aircraft   which serves as a proxy for business spending plans   is expected to show a 0 3  rise

5  Oil Continues Higher Ahead Of Fresh Weekly U S  Inventory Data
The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended June 22 at 10 30AM ET  amid forecasts for an oil stock drop of 2 5 million barrels 
The data will also offer fresh indications on how fast domestic output levels continue to rise  U S  crude production   driven by shale extraction   is currently at an all time high of 10 9 million barrels per day  bpd  
After markets closed Tuesday  the American Petroleum Institute said that U S  oil inventories fell by a whopping 9 2 million barrels last week

136887,358402,PAYX,Bull Of The Day  Paylocity  PCTY ,opinion,"Enterprise cloud technology and demand for it are accelerating in our increasingly digitalized world  Paylocity  PCTY  is a cloud based service that provides payroll and human capital management software solutions and has positioned itself to take shareholder returns to the clouds  Sell side analysts are becoming increasingly optimistic about this company propelling it into a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
PCTY has demonstrated insane share price appreciation so far in 2019  with shareholder returns of 77 5  in the past 8 months  trading just off its all time highs 

The Business
Paylocity provides payroll and HCM software solutions to medium sized US businesses  defined as businesses that employ anywhere from 20 to 999 individuals  The company currently services about 20 200 clients as of the end of June 
Paylocity has adopted the golden standard of cloud based software as a service  SaaS   Subscription based services provide the company with a consistent and growing revenue stream that allows investors to be comfortable with excessively high multiples 
PCTY s SaaS subscription based software has been attracting an accelerating number of clients as its functionality progresses  and more medium sized businesses find a competitive need to attain cloud based HR software solutions  Without the infrastructure of a large corporation  it is more economical to use Paylocity s cloud instead of investing in in house infrastructure   
Paylocity has seen an accelerating client base that expanded 21  this past year with an over 92  retention rate  The company has been able to consistently grow its revenue per client through its broadening product offering that s meeting more client needs 

This business has plenty of room to grow  There are over 638 000 medium sized businesses in the US employing more than 45 million people according to Paylocity s most recent 10 K  meaning that they have only penetrated 3  of their total accessible market  TAM   The company continues to advance its current portfolio of diversified products and services to attract a growing customer base 
PCTY is allowing smaller businesses to receive the same level of payroll and HCM support as a fortune 500 company through its diverse breadth of cloud based platforms 
Competitors include ADP  NASDAQ ADP   ADP   Paychex  NASDAQ PAYX  Software  PAYX   and Paycom Software  PAYC   Paylocity s competitive advantage lies in its cloud based tech  a niche in medium sized businesses  and its product offering breadth 
Valuation   Performance
Paylocity has been experiencing positive gains in all the right financial metrics illustrating a topline CAGR of 34  since the company went public 5 years ago  PCTY s gross margins have ballooned from 49  in 2014 to 67   illustrating productive economies of scale along with consistent profitability and free cash flow growth  The firm has a healthy balance sheet with a growing stockpile of cash and no debt 
Having no debt on the balance sheet can be considered a double edged sword  The firm is at no risk of default being completely funded by equity and its own cash flows  but the argument could be made that they aren t leveraging all available capital to expand their business  None the less the company s financials appear to be quite healthy 
Paylocity just recently turned a profit  so the most useful valuation metric is going to be forward P S  PCTY s forward P S is 9 6x  trading above both the broader software market and its 5 year median  This firm s valuations have expanded as its businesses model progressively proves itself

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Broadridge Financial Solutions and Paychex are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that BR likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than PAYX has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
BR currently has a forward P E ratio of 25 16  while PAYX has a forward P E of 29 55  We also note that BR has a PEG ratio of 2 52  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 3 28

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  3 08   A quarter ago  it was expected that this payroll processor and human resources services provider would post earnings of  0 89 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 89  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Paychex  which belongs to the Zacks Outsourcing industry  posted revenues of  980 40 million for the quarter ended May 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 26   This compares to year ago revenues of  871 10 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters

Paychex shares have added about 30 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 4  
What s Next for Paychex 
While Paychex has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Paychex was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

137027,358542,PAYX,Here s Why You Should Hold On To FTI Consulting  FCN  Stock,opinion,"FTI Consulting  Inc    NYSE FCN   is currently benefiting from lower tax rates that are contributing to the bottom line  Shares of the company have rallied 37 1  over the past year  against the 9 5  decline of the  it belongs to 

Factors Driving FTI Consulting s Performance
Increased regulatory scrutiny and a proliferation of corporate litigation are likely to increase the demand for FTI Consulting s products  Additionally  structural change has become a necessity in the rapidly evolving global markets as management teams look to fend off rivals  protect intellectual property rights and transform businesses via M A  divestiture and other restructuring activities  These developments call for FTI Consulting s specialized skill sets and are likely to boost revenues 
Lower tax rates  as a result of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  are contributing to FTI Consulting s bottom line  The company witnessed lower effective tax rate of 31  in third quarter 2018 compared with 22 2  in the year ago quarter  In the quarter  earnings came in at  1 00 per share  up from 83 cents in the year ago quarter 
With the bottom line in good shape  the company continues to pursue opportunities in areas like business transformation services  transaction advisory business  restructuring  retail  construction  data and analytics  cyber business  information governance and international arbitration  This makes it an excellent partner for global clients dealing with international arbitration issues  thereby generating continued revenue growth from the existing international operations 
FTI Consulting raised 2018 earnings per share  EPS  guidance to the range of  3 60  3 80 from the previous expectation of  2 90  3 30 
Summing Up 
Despite significant growth prospects  FTI Consulting is not free from overhangs  Higher investments in hiring professionals are likely to increase costs and put pressure on bottom line growth  Also  the company remains susceptible to seasonality and foreign exchange risks  Nevertheless  we believe that strong international operations bode well for FTI Consulting 
Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider
Currently  FTI Consulting carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
A few better ranked stocks in the Zacks  sector are Automatic Data Processing  Inc    NASDAQ ADP    Paychex  Inc    NASDAQ PAYX   and Navigant Consulting  Inc    NYSE NCI    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

137052,358567,PAYX,Republic Services  RSG  Rides On Internal Growth  Debt High,opinion,Shares of Republic Services  Inc    NYSE RSG   have gained 13 8  on a year to date basis  significantly outperforming the 4 4  rise of the  it belongs to   The company has witnessed a 12 6  rise in share price since it posted strong third quarter 2018 results The company s third quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and improved 22 4  year over year   Quarterly revenues of  2 6 billion beat the consensus mark by  1 8 million and improved marginally year over year on a non adjusted basis and 4 1  on a pro forma basis Republic Services has an impressive earnings surprise history  having outpaced estimates in three of the last four quarters  It delivered average trailing four quarter positive earnings surprise of 3 9   Over the past 60 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings has moved up by 2 cents What s Driving Republic Services  Solid Internal GrowthRepublic Services continues to grow internally with the help of long term contracts for the collection  recycling and disposal of solid waste materials  Such agreements increase the company s contracted revenue base  thereby strengthening its market position Further  the company continues to look out for strategic price increase in order to offset increased costs  improve operating margins and enjoy an appropriate return on its substantial investments in vehicles  equipment  landfills  transfer stations and recycling centers  The company s business stands to benefit from increasing demand for recycling of waste products Republic Services third quarter 2018 revenue growth includes a positive impact of 2 2  internal growth  The internal growth was basically driven by 2 4  increase in average yield  increase in fuel recovery fees by 80 basis points  bps  and increase in energy services revenues by 10 bps  which were  partially offset by decrease in total volume by 10 bps and 1  decrease in recycling  processing and commodity revenues Operational Efficiency Streamlining Cost StructureRepublic Services is focused on increasing its operational efficiency by shifting to compressed natural gas  CNG  collection vehicles and converting rear loading trucks to automated side loaders  which will streamline the cost structure  improve revenue quality and enhance growth through profitable investment opportunities  Almost 19  of the company s fleet operates on natural gas and nearly 75  of its residential routes have been converted to automated single driver trucks The company is highly optimistic about the usage of CNG vehicles  which will help it compete effectively on grounds of maintaining a clean environment  Despite higher expenses  CNG reduces the company s overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses Tax BenefitThe tax reform policy  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  effective since Dec 22  2017  are contributing to Republic Services  bottom line  The company s third quarter 2018 earnings included a benefit of 12 cents from the tax reform  The company enjoyed a lower effective tax rate of 22 7  for the reported quarter compared with 37 4  in the prior year quarter  Reduced taxes will likely lead to greater retention of profits  thus helping the company to allocate more funds toward growth initiatives as well as reward shareholders through share buyback or increased dividend payments Shareholder Friendly MovesWe are impressed with Republic Services  consistent efforts to reward its shareholders  In the first nine months of 2018  Republic Services repurchased shares worth  574 9 million and paid  340 million in dividends  In 2017  the company repurchased shares worth  610 7 million and paid  440 5 million in dividends  In 2016  the company repurchased shares worth  403 8 million and paid  418 9 million in dividends  Such moves indicate the company s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business RisksRepublic Services  balance sheet is highly leveraged  As of Sep 30  2018  long term debt  net of current maturities  was  7 56 billion while cash and cash equivalents were  81 9 million  Such a cash position implies that Republic Services needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt  High debt may limit the company s future expansion and worsen its risk profile Additionally  Republic Services continues to face weak landfill pricing due to high cost of landfills and leachate  This limits the company s ability to

Total revenues of  83 6 million missed the consensus mark by roughly  24 million and declined 25 5  year over year  The decline was primarily due to weakness across listing and e commerce services

137055,358570,PAYX,WM Or RSG  Which Waste Management Stock Is Better Placed ,opinion,"The waste management market is likely to gain traction backed by rise in population  increase in environmental awareness  and rapid industrialization and urbanization  Strict government restrictions to limit landfills and steps to increase the collection of waste for recycling are also expected to create opportunities for the industry 
Per a new report by Allied Market Research  the global waste management market size is projected to witness CAGR of 6 2  from 2017 to 2023 to reach  435 0 billion 
Notably  The Zacks  Industry has a  in the top 14   36 out of the 250 plus groups   This indicates a relatively favorable earnings outlook for the industry 
Given this backdrop  it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two waste removal services stocks   Waste Management   NYSE WM   and Republic Services   NYSE RSG    Both the stocks are part of the broader   one of the 16 Zacks sectors   While Waste Management has a market capitalization of  40 billion  Republic Services  market cap is  25 1 billion 
As both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   we are using certain other parameters to give investors a better insight  You can see  
Price Performance
Republic Services clearly scores over Waste Management in terms of price performance  Shares of Republic Services have gained 19  in a year s time  outperforming the 12  rise of Waste Management and 10  rise of the industry 

Earnings Expectations
Earnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company s strong prospects 
Waste Management s earnings for 2018 are projected to grow 28 6  while that of Republic Services are expected to increase 25 9   For 2019  Waste Management s earnings are expected to register 7 1  growth compared with 5 9  for Republic Services 
Thus  Waste Management has an edge over Republic Services in terms of yearly projected earnings growth 
Estimate Revisions
The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Waste Management s 2018 earnings inched up 1 5  in the past 60 days  For Republic Services  estimates for 2018 moved up 0 7  in the same time frame 
Earnings Surprise History
The earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock s performance in the previous quarters 
Waste Management and Republic Services have an impressive earning surprise history  with their earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters 
However  Waste Management has delivered a higher average positive earnings surprise than Republic Services  The reading for Waste Management is 4 5  compared with 3 9  for Republic Services 
Net Margin
Net profit margin helps investors evaluate a company s business model in terms of pricing policy  cost structure and operating efficiency  and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits  Hence  a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors 
Waste Management s TTM net margin of 11 6  places it favorably in comparison to the industry s figure of 11  and Republic Services  figure of 9 5  
Valuation
EV EBITDA is a commonly used multiple for the waste management industry  We observe that while Republic Services and Waste Connections have EV EBITDA ratios of 13 9 and 13 6  respectively  the industry s figure stands at 12 4  Although both the companies compare unfavorably with the industry  Waste Management has a lower EV EBITDA value than Republic Services 


 
So  Waste Management looks cheaper than republic Services 
Bottom Line
Our comparative analysis shows that while Republic Services scores over Waste Management in terms of year over year price performance and earnings estimate revisions  Waste management has an edge in terms of yearly projected earnings growth  surprise history and net margin 
Although faster share price rally in the past year led to a rich valuation for both stocks compared with the industry  Waste Management is trading slightly cheaper compared to Republic Services

137058,358573,PAYX,Why Paychex  PAYX  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Paychex  NASDAQ PAYX  in Focus
Headquartered in Rochester  Paychex  PAYX  is a Business Services stock that has seen a price change of 0 09  so far this year  The payroll processor and human resources services provider is paying out a dividend of  0 56 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 29  compared to the Outsourcing industry s yield of 0 48  and the S P 500 s yield of 2 02  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 24 is up 8 7  from last year  Paychex has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 10 32   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Paychex s payout ratio is 90   which means it paid out 90  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
PAYX is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is  2 85 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 11 76  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  PAYX is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2018-12-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-paychex-payx-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200367407,200367407
137059,358574,PAYX,Paychex  PAYX  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Paychex  NASDAQ PAYX  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 19  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This payroll processor and human resources services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 63 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 8  
Revenues are expected to be  856 73 million  up 3 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 17  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paychex 
For Paychex  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 30  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Paychex will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Paychex would post earnings of  0 65 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 67  delivering a surprise of  3 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Paychex doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-12-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/paychex-payx-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200367445,200367445

it belongs to and the Zacks S P 500 composite  While the industry rose 9 4  in the said time frame  Zacks S P 500 composite declined 1 6   The company reported third quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 75 cents per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents but rose on a year over year basis  Revenues of  1 41 billion lagged the consensus estimate by  19 4 million but came ahead of the year ago figure by  12 million  Adjusted revenues of  1 35 billion increased  10 million on a year over year basis Fiserv has an impressive earnings surprise history  having outpaced estimates in three of the last four quarters  It delivered average trailing four quarter positive earnings surprise of 1 5   Over the past 60 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings has been revised 1 2  upward What s Driving Fiserv  Acquisitions  A Key Growth CatalystFiserv continues to expand its product portfolio and enhance its offerings with the help of strategic acquisitions  On Oct 31  Fiserv completed the acquisition of the debit based assets of Elan Financial Services  a unit of U S  Bancorp USB  for approximately  690 million  The deal includes the purchase of Elan s debit card processing  ATM Managed Services and MoneyPass surcharge free network  It should boost Fiserv s payments portfolio  widen its client base and provide new solutions to enhance the value proposition for its existing 3 000 debit solutions clients In 2017  Fiserv completed four acquisitions   Online Banking Solutions  Inc   PCLender  LLC  Dovetail Group Limited and Monitise plc  These buyouts helped the company to improve cash management and digital business banking solutions and transform payments infrastructure We believe that the company will continue to pursue accretive deals  which will boost its market share and customer base going forward Diversified Product Portfolio to Attract CustomersFiserv looks well poised on the back of its diversified product portfolio  In third quarter 2018  Fiserv s DNA platform had eight clients and expects to reach nearly 30 by the end of 2018  In the first nine months of 2018  it had more than 20 clients  Zelle had 50 new clients in the last reported quarter  Zelle transactions grew more than 50  sequentially and more than 10 times year over year  While debit transactions recorded double digit growth  Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 23  in the last reported quarter to nearly 8 million Further  the company seems to be actively engaged in enhancing its services  In October 2018  Fiserv announced the launch of a flexible and interactive financial planning tool  which integrates with home office systems and streamlines manual processes  to help financial advisors operate more efficiently and collaborate with clients in their investment targets  In September 2018  the company announced the launch of Originate  a new suite of solutions aimed at helping banks and credit unions deliver enhanced digital account opening and loan origination to customers In August 2018  the company upgraded its unified managed account  UMA  services to help financial institutions and advisors operate more efficiently and announced the launch of two enhanced consumer authentication solutions  step up authentication and identity verification to help call centers counter card fraud The diversified product portfolio has led to a steady flow of customers  considering the rapidly changing financial services industry and increasing demand for digital banking and payment services RisksFiserv s balance sheet is highly leveraged  As of Sep 30  2018  long term debt was  4 82 billion while cash and cash equivalents were  673 million  Such a cash position implies that Fiserv needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt  High debt may limit the company s future expansion and worsen its risk profile Additionally  Fiserv s policy of acquiring a large number of companies results in some integration risk  Acquisitions can negatively impact its balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill and intangible assets  which totaled  7 25 billion or 67 5  of the total assets as of Sep 30 Zacks Rank

137118,358633,PAYX,TTEC Or PAYX  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Outsourcing stocks have likely encountered both TTEC Holdings  TTEC  and Paychex  NASDAQ PAYX   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  both TTEC Holdings and Paychex are holding a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
TTEC currently has a forward P E ratio of 18 20  while PAYX has a forward P E of 23 86  We also note that TTEC has a PEG ratio of 2 28  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 2 81 
Another notable valuation metric for TTEC is its P B ratio of 4 14  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  PAYX has a P B of 10 22

Top Line Expectations
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  975 million  indicating an improvement of 5 4  from the year ago quarter  The expected improvement is likely to be on the back of strong recurring revenue growth  driven by internal growth and acquisitions  This growth is likely to be partially offset by decline in event driven revenues

Bottom Line Expectations
The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 70 cents  indicating year over year growth of 29 6   The upside is likely to be driven by lower tax rates as a result of the 2017 tax reform policy  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   partially offset by decline in excess tax benefit  ETB  and strong operations  Moreover  increased investments in new products and technologies are likely to offset bottom line growth

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  Sykes Enterprises is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Paychex has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that SYKE s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
SYKE currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 49  while PAYX has a forward P E of 25 15  We also note that SYKE has a PEG ratio of 1 45  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 3 07 
Another notable valuation metric for SYKE is its P B ratio of 1 58  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  PAYX has a P B of 12 20 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SYKE s Value grade of A and PAYX s Value grade of C 
SYKE is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that SYKE is likely the superior value option right now ",2018-06-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/syke-vs-payx-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200326062,200326062

Clearly  it mattered  and was especially important to my chances to major in economics  I recall studying for four hours a day for nearly two weeks in a row  and ultimately  I believe it turned out pretty well as I got an A in the class  Ultimately  economics became my major and it is a subject which I truly enjoy  As such  I found it encouraging that Paul Ryan  the House Majority Leader and architect of the recently passed tax cut  also specialized in economics  but much of his training came at the foot of the noted conservative Jack Kemp  the ex pro quarterback and a free market officianado  Anyway  there is much conjecture about the effectiveness of the recent tax cut  but my thought is it is based on sound economic principles  so now I am sure you will breathe easier 
From an investment point of view  now is the time to consider things like the tax cut as 2018 is imminent  Based on my perspective  with a brisk economy  new stimulus with Ryan s creation passing  and interest rates headed higher  based on the Fed statements and consensus view   banks seem ideally positioned to benefit  especially if the long end of the yield curve continues to strengthen  2 5  on the 10 year Treasury   I also look at the sorry state of affairs in Venezuela and the dramatic reduction of its ability to produce and refine oil and think energy related stocks have a nice chance of doing much better in 2018 
The thesis is also probably helped by the dramatic reduction in investment over the last few years as the largest oil companies have been far more concerned with returns on capital than growing production  Also  efficiency in the shale space has stagnated over the last year  and taken together  in combination with consistent oil demand  makes energy quite intriguing  but I am biased on the long side toward the industry  As for areas to avoid  I believe large cap tech  where 30  returns took place in 2017  you know  the Amazon s and Netflixes of the world  is vulnerable for lackluster returns for quite some time  I don t see large corrections  just not much appreciation  I think 2018 will start out with sellers taking gains they postponed in 2017  so the first month may see some selling pressure  potentially offset by fresh money from year end bonuses and distributions  As an aside  a few weeks ago I mentioned the tax bill could include the potential elimination of choices on allocations for sales  but that did not make it into the final version  It seems the investment industry has a bit of influence with Mr  Ryan and his minions 
In the markets this week  earnings were light but FedEx  NYSE FDX  reported a strong number with optimism about how the tax plan will help business in 2018  Nike  NYSE NKE  suffered on the margin front  and Paychex  NASDAQ PAYX  was solid as it is tied to the small business market  a good place to be with a improving economy  Bitcoin bs continued with two small companies  Litespend and Long Island Iced Tea  The first rocketed higher when they announced an acquisition of a blockchain company  with no revenues and owned by the CEO   and the second changed their name to include blockchain  Definitely worth a billion dollar improvement in market value  no question  Not that I would ever suggest such a thought  but if one wanted to profit from cryptocurrency  the safer strategy is to own things like the CME  CBOE Holdings Inc  NASDAQ CBOE   TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation  NASDAQ AMTD   The Charles Schwab Corporation  NYSE SCHW   or E TRADE Financial Corporation  NASDAQ ETFC  as they will benefit from the futures speculation  If one was more aggressive  you could arbitrage Bitcoin by selling the higher futures price and buying the lower one from the respective exchanges  right now it is the CME  CBOE  and TD   The futures price at each exchange is calculated differently  which is why there may be an opportunity  Not for the faint of heart  to be sure 
Anyway  I hope you enjoy the holidays  and good health to you and yours

137247,358762,PAYX,Paychex  PAYX  Soars On Q1 Earnings Beat And Upbeat  18 View,opinion,"Paychex Inc    NASDAQ PAYX   commenced fiscal 2018 on an impressive note  reporting solid results for the fiscal first quarter  wherein the top and bottom lines  both  came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  Moreover  the company registered year over year improvement on both the counts 
The company reported non GAAP earnings per share of 62 cents  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and grew 11  year over year  The upside mainly stemmed from higher revenues and efficient cost management 
Shares of Paychex were trading up nearly 5  at the time of posting this blog  Notably  the stock has returned 10 3  in the last three months  outperforming 6 1  growth recorded by the  

Quarter Details
Paychex reported total revenues  including interest on funds held for clients  of  816 8 million  up 4  year over year  Excluding interest on funds held for its clients  total services revenues  Payroll service and Human Resource Services  ascended 4  year over year to  803 1 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at  816 million 
Payroll Service segment revenues went up 2  from the year ago period to  457 8 million  primarily on the back of higher revenues per check and client base 
Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 7  year over year to  345 3 million  chiefly driven by strong growth in client base and worksite employees  elevated revenues from retirement  as well as online HR administration services  The growth was partially offset by tough comparisons wherein the segment s revenues benefited from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act 
Interest on funds held for clients increased 14  on a year over year basis to  13 7 million  mainly benefiting from higher average interest rates earned 
Paychex s total expenses flared up 2  from the year ago tally to  471 8 million due to increased investments in technology and PEO business  Acquisition related expenses also contributed to this increase  However  total expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  contracted 110 basis points  bps  to 57 8  
The company s operating income grew 7  year over year to  345 million  In addition  Paychex s operating margin expanded 110 bps to 42 2   chiefly driven by lower total expenses as a percentage of revenues 
Net income came in at  227 8 million  up from  217 4 million reported in the prior year quarter 
Balance Sheet   Cash Flow
Paychex exited the fiscal first quarter with cash  cash equivalents and corporate investments of  368 2 million compared with  323 4 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter  The company has no long term debt  It generated operating cash flow of  343 6 million during the reported quarter 
During the quarter  Paychex paid  179 1 million as dividend and repurchased shares worth  94 1 million 
Guidance
Buoyed by splendid fiscal first quarter results  the company raised its revenues outlook  The company now anticipates total revenues to jump 6   up from the previous estimate of 5   This translates to revenues of  3 34 billion  which is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 31 billion 
Human Resource Services revenues are now projected to grow in the range of 12 14   up from 8 10  projected earlier 
Apart from this  the company revised its guidance for operating margin and effective tax rate  Operating margin is anticipated to be between 39  and 40  compared with the previous guidance of approximately 40   Effective income tax rate is now projected to be in the band of 35 35 5   down from the previous estimate of 35 5 36  
All other guidance provided during fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results remained unchanged  Management expects Payroll Service revenues to climb year over year in the range of 1 2   while Interest on funds held for clients and investment income is expected to grow in the mid to upper teen range 
Net income is still likely to advance 5  year over year on a GAAP basis and 7  on a non GAAP basis  Non GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be up in the range of 7 8   which comes to  2 35  2 38  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  2 37 
Our Take
In the fiscal first quarter  Paychex s earnings and revenues both surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  Moreover  the year over year improvement on both counts is encouraging  Furthermore  the company s upbeat revenue guidance for the fiscal is impressive 
Paychex s investments in product development  technology and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth boost our optimism  We also believe the company s expansion initiatives  such as joint ventures and acquisitions  will likely support its long term growth strategy 
Product launches are likely to be the other growth drivers  Also  Paychex s focus on small  and mid sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities 
However  unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing   NASDAQ ADP   and Insperity   NYSE NSP   remain key concerns 
Currently  Paychex has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
A better ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Synaptics Inc    NASDAQ SYNA    which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
The stock has a long term EPS growth rate of 15

Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

137271,358786,PAYX,Paychex Expands PEO Capabilities With HR Outsourcing Buyout,opinion,Paychex Inc    NASDAQ PAYX   appears to be striving to capitalize on the rising opportunities in the professional employer organization  PEO  industry  In this regard  the payroll and human resource solutions provider recently acquired Charlotte  NC based HR Outsourcing Holdings  Inc   HROI  for an undisclosed amount Founded in 2001  HROI is a well know name in the PEO industry  which  along with its subsidiaries  offers human resource solutions to small and medium sized businesses in over 35 states across the U S  Importance of HROI Buyout A PEO is a firm or company to which organizations can outsource their HR functions  including payroll and benefits administration  The benefits offered by a PEO make it a viable choice for organizations The most important benefit is that an organization gets full administrative support without investing in technology and employees  Apart from this  a PEO takes care of all aspects of an employee s tenure  Organizations get trained representatives who can better address their HR related matters  Moreover  the growing regulatory burden on small companies signifies that the need to outsource non core activities is growing Therefore  in our opinion  the acquisition is a strategic fit for Paychex as more and more companies are willing to use PEO services rather than creating their in house HR management departments  Also  both the companies have similar target customers   small and medium sized businesses As of May 31  2017  Paychex had nearly 605 000 payroll clients but the market is still highly untapped  Per the company  there are about 12 million businesses in the U S  under its total addressable market  half of which are still untapped The recent buyout of HROI will expand its services  thereby helping it to add to its customer base Bottom LineThe company s initiatives to boost revenue growth through acquisitions are encouraging  Since its inception  the company has completed 13 acquisitions of which eight were under the leadership of current president and CEO  Martin Mucci These buyouts have helped the company to expand its services as well as global reach  thereby boosting its revenues  Notably  in the last five fiscals  i e  2012 to 2017  the company has seen its revenues rise at a CAGR of 7 2  Going ahead  one of the key secular growth drivers of Paychex is the demand for outsourcing  Human Resource Services outsourcing is a large  less than half penetrated market that offers significant cost saving potential The company seeks to capitalize on this opportunity by periodically introducing products and services for upselling to the client base and moving into the mid market However  for the last few months  payroll client growth has been affected by political uncertainty  which in turn is impacting outsourcing decision making in the mid market  This was highlighted by Paychex during its fourth quarter fiscal 2017 conference call This makes us sceptical about the company s near term performance  Intense competition in the outsourcing space from major players like Automated Data Processing   NASDAQ ADP   and Insperity   NYSE NSP   could add to its woes Paychex has underperformed the  to which it belongs to in the last year  The stock has lost 8  of its value in the said period while the industry declined just 1 3  Currently  Paychex carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  A better ranked stock in the same industry space is Broadridge Financial Solutions  Inc    NYSE BR   which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  The stock has an estimated long term EPS growth rate of 10  Zacks  10 Minute Stock Picking SecretSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars But here s something even more remarkable  You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar  And then you can apply it to your portfolio in as little as 10 minutes a month ,2017-08-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/paychex-expands-peo-capabilities-with-hr-outsourcing-buyout-200208795,200208795

Paychex   growth looks unattractive when compared to its publicly traded peer group  Fiserv Inc  NASDAQ FISV   Total System Services Inc  NYSE TSS   Vantiv Inc  NYSE VNTV   and The Western Union Company  NYSE WU

137359,358874,PAYX,Paychex  PAYX  Reports In Line Q4 Earnings  Revenues Beat,opinion,"Paychex Inc    NASDAQ PAYX   reported strong results for fourth quarter fiscal 2016 wherein the bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line beat  Nevertheless  the company marked a year over year improvement on both counts 
Earnings of 49 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew 11 4  year over year mainly on the back of higher revenues 
Quarter Details
Paychex reported total revenue  including Interest on funds held for clients  of  753 9 million  up 9  year over year  Moreover  it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  751 million  Excluding interest on funds held for its clients  total services revenue  Payroll service and Human Resource Services  grew 9  year over year to  741 6 million 
Payroll Service segment revenues went up 5  from the year ago period to  430 4 million  primarily on the back of higher revenue per check and client base  The acquisition of Advanced Partners contributed approximately 1  to the segment s revenue growth 
Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 14  year over year to  311 2 million mainly driven by solid growth in client base and worksite employees  increased revenues from retirement and online HR administration services 
Interest on funds held for clients increased 14  on a year over year basis to  12 3 million primarily benefiting from higher average interest rates earned 
Paychex s total expenses increased 8  from the year ago figure to  477 6 million due to 6  rise in compensation related expenditure  However  total expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  decreased 30 basis points  bps  to 62 3  
Consequently  Paychex s operating margin expanded 30 bps to 36 6   In dollar terms  reported operating income increased 10  year over year to  276 3 million 
Net income came in at  178 1 million or 49 cents  up from  161 2 million or 44 cents reported last year 
Balance Sheet   Cash Flow
Paychex exited fiscal fourth quarter with cash  cash equivalents and corporate investments of  352 1 million compared with  327 2 million at the end of the previous quarter  The company has no long term debt  The company generated operating cash flow of  1 018 billion in fiscal 2016 
During the fiscal  Paychex repurchased approximately  107 9 million common stocks and paid  606 5 million as dividend 
Guidance
Paychex issued the fiscal 2017 outlook  Management expects 4  year over year increase in Payroll Service revenues  Human Resource Services revenues are likely to grow in the range of 12 14  
Total service revenue is likely to increase 7 8   Interest on funds held for its clients and investment income are projected to grow in the mid single digit range 
Operating income as a percentage of revenues is likely to be 38   Effective income tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 35 5  to 36   Net income is likely to increase 8  year over year 
Our Take
Paychex reported strong fourth quarter results with earnings coming in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues surpassing the same  Moreover  the company issued an optimistic fiscal 2017 guidance  signifying that it is relatively well placed despite the current macroeconomic sluggishness 
Furthermore  we are encouraged by Paychex s investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth  We also believe that the company s expansionary initiatives  such as joint ventures and acquisitions  support the long term growth strategy 
Product launches are expected to be the other growth drivers  Moreover  Paychex s focus on small  and mid sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities 
However  unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing   NASDAQ ADP   and Insperity   NYSE NSP   remain the primary concerns

137385,358900,PAYX,A Safe 3 5  Dividend Yield And No Debt,opinion,"Paychex  O PAYX  has paid uninterrupted dividends since going public in 1988  While the company held its dividend flat during the financial crisis  it has otherwise increased its dividend every year since the mid 1990s and currently yields 3 5  
PAYX has a very durable business model that throws off predictable free cash flow  We believe its dividend is very safe and offers at least average growth prospects  making it a good fit for our Conservative Retirees dividend portfolio 
Let s take a closer look at the business Business OverviewPAYX was founded in 1971 and provides a range of payroll  human resource  and benefits outsourcing services to over 590 000 small and medium sized businesses  It offers a wide range of services including payroll processing  e g  calculate  prepare  and delivery employee payroll checks  prepare payroll tax returns  collect and remit client s payroll obligations  etc    retirement services  e g  401 k  plan design  record keeping  and plan management services   insurance  e g  group health insurance  health care reform  workers  comp  etc    and a fully outsourced human resource solution  e g  on site personnel  employee handbooks  etc    Essentially  PAYX helps businesses outsource non core administrative services in a cost effective manner so they can focus on their strengths 
Approximately 61  of PAYX s revenue is derived from payroll services  includes a growing portfolio of standalone services   expense management  applicant tracking  time and labor   with the remaining 39  from human resource services  e g  retirement  insurance  human resources  Business AnalysisThe services PAYX provides to businesses are mission critical   payroll taxes must be correctly calculated and paid on time  insurance policies must conform with health care reform  proper records must be kept for 401 k  plans  and more 
As a small business owner  you want these jobs done correctly and efficiently  These aren t tasks you want to lose any sleep or energy over  With fewer resources compared to larger companies  outsourcing these administrative tasks  which are constantly evolving as government regulations change  is usually more efficient 
With 50  years of operating history  a large direct sales force  numerous indirect sales channels  50  of new core payroll clients are referred by existing clients  CPAs  and banks   and substantial market share  PAYX is the trusted brand of choice 
PAYX has dominant market share positions in its key businesses  The company is  1 and  2 in payroll services for small and medium sized businesses  respectively  PAYX pays one in every 15 private sector workers in the U S     1 in retirement services recordkeeping  as measured by number of plans    23 in insurance services with more than 140 000 H R covered lives  and provides HR services to more than 31 000 clients with over 858 000 worksite employees 
As long as customers  administrative needs are being met with quality service at a reasonable price  they have few reasons to switch vendors  Their employees also become familiar with PAYX s software  about 90  of PAYX s mobile app usage comes from its clients  employees who are doing things such as accessing their check stubs and W 2s   raising switching costs  As a result  PAYX s client retention rate reached a new record high  82   during its most recent fiscal year 
PAYX has also evolved to offer clients a larger scope of services compared to many smaller competitors  Going back just 10 years  PAYX s business was 100  payroll services  However  the company now offers an array of human resource services  39  of revenue   which leverage the information gathered in PAYX s base payroll processing service  Human resource services competitors that lack payroll services must depend on vendors like PAYX to power their solutions  putting them at a disadvantage 
PAYX s broad product portfolio offers simplification and convenience for customers  but it also helps lower their costs in some cases  For example  PAYX can pool together its customers to increase their purchasing power for insurance products 
With no debt and over  900 million in cash on the balance sheet  PAYX can also acquire products to fill gaps  maintain the most fully integrated technology and service available in the marketplace  remain entrenched with its customers  and expand its growth opportunities  For example  PAYX recently acquired Advance Partners  which serves the temporary staffing industry  PAYX previously had no exposure to this market but can now access the 3 million employees it has 
Finally  it s worth mentioning that PAYX also earns interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax ore regulatory agencies or to client employees  PAYX is a safe dividend stock that would also see some benefit if rates ever rise 
Despite the scale  regulatory expertise  service breadth  switching costs  and brand advantages enjoyed by PAYX  this is still a fragmented marketplace with fairly low barriers to entry Key RisksUnlike many other businesses  PAYX is somewhat refreshing in today s macro environment because it has no overseas exposure  is not sensitive to commodity prices  and has no currency risk  It is most sensitive to the U S  labor market  which has been improving 
However  as a technology company  PAYX is at somewhat greater risk of disruption than many other businesses because the pace of change tends to be faster 
Investors seem to have two primary concerns with PAYX   the lack of growth available in the company s core payroll services business and  such as Zenefits and Gusto  formerly known as ZenPayroll  
Regarding growth  the payroll services market is rather mature  However  it continues growing at a low single digit pace  More importantly  PAYX has successfully expanded its portfolio to include numerous human resource services  These businesses account for a significant part of PAYX s sales mix  39   and have consistently grown at about a double digit pace  Their market  
The company also offers various accounting and financial services  e g  cloud based accounting  payment processing  etc   to businesses but notes in its annual report that  these services are in their infancy  
The takeaway is that PAYX has expertise in introducing  or acquiring  new products needed by small and medium sized businesses  and its existing distribution channels are very effective at quickly scaling up new services  We expect the company to continue finding growth opportunities adjacent to the payroll services market  With over 10 million addressable businesses in PAYX s geographic markets  there should be plenty of opportunity for continued growth 
New entrants pose a greater concern to us as they have made a strong case for themselves with users  Technology  e g  the cloud  is accelerating the rate of change in the industry  and start up costs are increasingly insignificant  Newer software companies typically have products that offer better user experiences  lower costs  and greater innovation compared to large incumbents such as PAYX 
Zenefits is the most newsworthy rival and was founded in 2013  The company s private market valuation reached more than  4 billion over the summer of 2015  despite expectations of generating up to  100 million in sales this year 
Zenefits runs a very different business model than PAYX  It provides free  cloud based solutions that reduce human resource paperwork and provide a single place to manage payroll  health insurance  and other systems  Zenefits makes money by acting as an insurance broker and collecting a commission on the health insurance coverage that businesses purchase from health care providers  However  it also launched its own payroll processing service in November 2015  reducing its dependence on partners such as PAYX 
Like many startups  Zenefits has hit some bumps that could endanger its future  A Wall Street Journal article from November 2015 noted that the company is  falling short of its aggressive revenue targets   has frozen hiring in certain departments  and has reduced pay for some executives  Regulators have also provided headwinds  arguing that the company is illegal because its free software constitutes a gift  which isn t allowed in the health insurance business 
Like many tech startups  Zenefits is not likely profitable and  depending on how growth shakes out in the coming years  might not even survive  Fidelity Investments marked down the value of its investment in Zenefits by 48  during the third quarter of 2015  it invested in May 2015  
On the payroll side  Gusto has emerged as a strong new entrant  Gusto is much cheaper than PAYX and provides a more pleasant user experience  It also recently added human resource services to significantly improve the scope of its offering 
PAYX can combat new entrants in several ways  First  it can use its  900  million in cash to acquire them or invest in similar functionality to stay relevant for its customers  Since Gusto and Zenefits emerged several years ago  hundreds of imitators have cropped up that PAYX could pick off 
The company is also investing in its software to stay  good enough  for customers not to switch  Roughly 80  of PAYX s clients now have an online connection to them   accessing reports  using mobile apps  processing their payroll  Its new Paychex Flex solution also received favorable reviews by PC Magazine  PAYX will continue investing in cloud based technology and mobility applications to improve the user experience 
Perhaps most importantly  PAYX has strong brand recognition and trust in the market  Payroll and human resource services must be working correctly 100  of the time  Until Gusto and Zenefits establish a longer track record  many of PAYX s customers are less likely to jump ship  However  they could push for reduced pricing in future contract negotiations 
Until we see signs that PAYX is starting to struggle with profitable growth  we believe the highly fragmented nature of the market  secular growth in human resource services outsourcing  and strong brand and sales channels maintained by PAYX will keep the company chugging along Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
PAYX s dividend payment appears to be very secure with a Safety Score of 81  even despite the company s relatively high payout ratio 
Over the last four quarters  PAYX s dividend has consumed 80  of its earnings and 72  of its free cash flow  These payout ratios are on the higher side of dividend stocks we prefer to invest in and leave the company with less margin of safety and typically lower dividend growth rates  The business needs to be very stable and have a clean balance sheet to justify high payout ratios  PAYX does  
Looking at longer term trends in payout ratios provides additional perspective  As seen below  PAYX s payout ratios have increased from about 50  in 2005 to 70 80  today  This means that dividend growth outpaced earnings growth  which is not sustainable  Overall  the company s higher payout ratios mean that future dividend growth will need to be driven by earnings growth Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
While PAYX s payout ratios are higher than we like  the business is very stable  During the financial crisis  we can see that the company s sales actually grew by 1  in 2009 and only fell by 4  in 2010  The stock also outperformed the S P 500 by 12  in 2008  Business customers lay off employees during tough economic times  but they still require PAYX s mission critical services Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Since PAYX primarily delivers its services over the internet  it operates with low fixed cost  The company s scale leverages these costs and allows PAYX to earn very strong returns on invested capital   signs of an economic moat Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Not surprisingly  PAYX throws off substantial free cash flow each year  With a client retention rate in excess of 80   the company has great visibility Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Finally  PAYX s balance sheet is in excellent condition  The company has no debt and over  900 million in cash and investments  The company has plenty of flexibility to acquire complementary products  return more cash to shareholders  and reinvest for growth 
All things considered  PAYX s 3 5  dividend yield appears to be very safe  While the company s payout ratio is higher than we like to see  this risk is mitigated by PAYX s predictable cash flows and pristine balance sheet Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
PAYX s dividend Growth Score is 65  suggesting that the company s dividend growth potential is above average  PAYX has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1988 and compounded its dividend at a mid single digit pace over recent time periods Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Since the company s payout ratios are relatively high  70 80    we believe future dividend growth will align with earnings growth   somewhere in the mid  to high single digit range  PAYX also has the balance sheet  no debt  to continue growing its dividend regardless of economic conditions 
PAYX held its dividend flat during the financial crisis but has otherwise increased its dividend each year since the mid 1990s  While it s not close to being a member of the S P Dividend Aristocrats Index  it sure has been a reliable dividend payer ValuationPAYX trades at 23x forward earnings  22x excluding net cash  and offers a dividend yield of 3 5   which is in line with its five year average dividend yield of 3 5  
With 6 9  earnings growth potential  the stock could deliver a total return between 9  and 12  per year going forward  While it s not a bargain  PAYX s high quality and consistent fundamentals make it appear to be trading at a reasonable price today ConclusionPAYX is a sticky  time tested business that provides mission critical services for its customers  It shares many traits with some of our favorite blue chip dividend stocks and has an extremely reliable dividend  While we will continue monitoring the competitive landscape  we expect PAYX s strong brand  deep sales channels  broad product portfolio  regulatory expertise  switching costs  and flexible balance sheet will keep the company relevant for many years to come ",2016-01-13,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-safe-3.5-dividend-yield-and-no-debt-379913,379913

137406,358921,PAYX,Insperity Allies With ICBA,opinion,"Human resource and business solutions provider Insperity Inc  NYSE NSP  was selected by Independent Community Bankers of America  ICBA  as their Preferred Service Provider  ICBA represents 6 500 community banks operating in the U S 
The alliance therefore allows Insperity to offer its human resource  financial and pay roll related services to a wider number of clients  Likewise  the community banks selecting Insperity s products and services will now be able to consolidate their administrative operations and focus on providing enhanced services to their customers instead 
Insperity provides human resources as well as business solutions to small and medium businesses to help them perform better  We expect the current partnership with ICBA to improve the company s growth prospects 
It is worth noting that in the last reported quarter  Insperity s revenues increased 4 1  on a year over year basis  The improvement was attributed to higher average paid worksite employees  up 2 3   and higher revenue per worksite employee  up 1 7    The company reported average client retention of 87 0  during the quarter  Nonetheless  higher than expected expenses impacted the bottom line 
We believe management s initiatives to expand the number of Business Performance Advisors and implement a healthcare reform strategy will be beneficial in the long run  Moreover  the company s software as a service and other adjacent business services are gaining traction and are expected to help improve 2014 results 
Although the company has a debt free balance sheet  competition from Automatic Data Processing Inc   NASDAQ ADP   Paychex Inc   NASDAQ PAYX  and ManpowerGroup  NYSE MAN  remain the headwinds  Moreover  the company provided a tepid full year guidance  which will remain an overhang on the stock ",2014-05-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/insperity-allies-with-icba-214512,214512
