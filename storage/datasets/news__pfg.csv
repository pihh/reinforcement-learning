14381,235896,PFG,Principal Global bullish on U S  stocks despite increased tail risk CEO,news,"By Tomo Uetake TOKYO  Reuters    Principal Global Investors bought U S  shares on recent market dips as the asset management firm saw the U S  economy chugging along in spite of worries about a trade war  Chief Executive Jim McCaughan said on Monday  McCaughan said the ongoing trade spat between the United States and China is likely to ultimately lead to a compromise  rather than a full scale trade war   Most likely  you get concessions  you get a face saving compromise and both can declare a victory   McCaughan told Reuters in an interview  but warned that the risk of a trade war was not negligible   It s more serious than a  tail risk   which is usually a 5 percent probability or less    Diversification can act as a counter balance   he said  Headline risks stemming from a potential U S  China trade war and geopolitical tensions on the Korean Peninsula and Iran could lead to higher market volatility  said McCaughan  estimating an about 20 30 percent negative tail risk   In many of our strategies  we have a strategic allocation and we ll rebalance when they get out of whack  So weakness in equities would tend to make us a buyer   he said    In terms of volatility  markets so far this year have actually been more like the markets in the 80s and 90s  Back then  1 percent move  in a day  was pretty common  Those days were back   Despite the market volatility  McCaughan expects U S  economy to continue to grow between 2 3 percent with inflation well contained around 2 percent in the next three years  He expects only one more U S  interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve this year  while many market participants estimate two to three rate raises   On a 70 or 80 percent probability  you ll probably see equities going up and you ll see bond yields stay pretty close to the current levels  maybe go up a little bit  My best guess of the 10 year treasury yield  US10YT RR   a year from now  is 2 80 percent   PGI is the asset management arm of Principal Financial Group  NASDAQ PFG   headquartered in Des Moines  Iowa  and had  454 billion in assets under management as of Dec  31

This comes just days after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reached out to Chinese officials with an invitation to resumed trade talks 
Trump s willingness to press ahead with tariffs drummed up renewed fears of a full blown trade war and raised questions about how committed the administration was to ending the trade dispute with China

President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  John and welcome to everyone on the call  This morning  I ll share performance highlights for the fourth quarter and full year and accomplishments that position us for continued growth  Deanna will follow with details on our financial results and capital deployment 2019 marked Principal s 140th anniversary and a year in which we closed one of the largest acquisitions in our Company s history  We are proud to serve more than 33 million individuals  including China  and nearly 200 000 businesses in more than 80 markets around the world  And I d like to thank both our customers and our employees for being a part of Principal s journey 2019 was another good year for Principal  We delivered non GAAP operating earnings of  1 6 billion  a 2  decrease compared to a strong 2018 that benefited from a large PGI performance fee  This result reflects ongoing fee pressure  continued investments in the business  and the impact from the Institutional Retirement   Trust or IRT acquisition  Throughout 2019  we continued to demonstrate strong business fundamentals  balanced investments in our businesses with expense discipline and be good stewards of shareholder capital  deploying nearly  2 1 billion  including  1 2 billion for the IRT acquisition  This acquisition doubles the size of our U S  retirement business and positions us as a Top 3 retirement player  The integration remains on track and we ll be hard at work throughout 2020 to make sure the transition is as seamless as possible While working to integrate the acquisition  we continue to grow our existing U S  retirement business in 2019  Compared to 2018  our RISP sales increased 30   recurring deposits grew 10   and we saw a double digit growth in employer matches  Also I want to highlight strong results in U S  Insurance Solutions  including record pre tax operating earnings for the segment in 2019  Most Specialty Benefits and Individual Life had record sales in 2019  In particular  Individual Life increased sales by 17  compared to 2018  Additionally  group benefits had very strong in group growth as our customers expanded their businesses and hired more employees Our 2019 Principal Financial Well Being Index  our proprietary survey of small  to medium size business owners and leaders  shows that business owners are expecting continued growth in 2020  while investing in their own employees  We are well positioned to help these business owners grow with our retirement and protection offerings  Over the course of 2019  AUM increased  109 billion to a record  735 billion  This was a 17  increase over 2018 and provides a strong foundation for 2020  Additionally  we ended 2019 with  146 billion of AUM in our China joint venture and  898 billion of assets under administration and the IRT business After going negative in 2018  total Company net cash flow returned to positive for the full year at  17 billion  This included positive net cash flow from every business unit  2019 caps a strong decade  Principal delivered positive total Company net cash flow in nine of the last 10 years  despite a very competitive environment  RISP had its strongest year for net cash flow since 2012 and was  7 billion in 2019  This was higher than our targeted range of 1  to 3  of beginning of year account value  When the IRT retirement plans migrate to the Principal platform in 2020 and 2021  the assets will be reported in operations acquired  RIS spread at  4 billion of net cash flow in 2019  driven by strong sales in pension risk transfer  income annuities  and investment only  Principal International also generated  4 billion of net cash flow in 2019 and marked its 45th consecutive positive quarter  This result primarily reflects a rebound in Brazil throughout the year as well as strong flows in Hong Kong Principal Global Investors  net cash flow improved in 2019 to a positive  1 1 billion  including  2 7 billion in the fourth quarter  The New Mexico Scholar s Edge 529 Plan funded during the quarter with  1 4 billion now managed by PGI  with a majority of these assets invested in our retail mutual funds  This contributed to the best quarter for net cash flow in our retail mutual fund platform since the first quarter of 2015  Clearly  2019 benefited from the management and distribution changes we ve put in place in PGI and we re confident in the opportunities that lie ahead  The synergies between PGI and Principal International continued to evolve and drove a large platform win in Hong Kong during 2019  The team continues to look for opportunities to leverage both our global asset management expertise and the distribution force we have in local markets The importance of saving for retirement continues to gain traction as private pension reform discussions advanced around the world in 2019  As a leading retirement provider  we re excited about the approval of the SECURE Act in the U S  We work closely with policy makers and regulators to expand access to retirement saving plans and deliver guaranteed income in retirement through the workplace  Today  30  of the retirement plans we onboard annually in the U S  are with companies that have never offered a plan  The SECURE Act seeks to improve access to workplace retirement plans by allowing small employers to join multiple employer plans and increase tax credits for start up 401 k  plans  While the SECURE Act is an important step to expand workplace retirement plan  access and guaranteed income options  we expect market growth will take time to materialize Outside U S   we continue to use our knowledge and expertise to advocate for plan designs that enable workers to fund retirements that may last 40 years  Throughout 2019  several governments have made pension reform a priority  including Brazil and Chile  With our expertise and global footprint  we ll continue to partner with governments around the world to promote sustainable policies and desired outcomes for its citizens Turning to Slide 5  our investment performance remains very strong  At year end  79  of the Principal s mutual funds  ETFs  separate accounts  and collective investment trusts were above median for the five year and 71  were above median for the three year  Our one year performance rebounded to 84  above median compared to 41  at the end of 2018  Additionally  for our Morningstar rated funds  87  of the fund level AUM had a four star or five star rating at year end  This strong performance positions us well to attract  retain assets going forward Throughout 2019  we continued to execute on our customer focused solutions oriented strategy as we expanded our global distribution network and array of retirement  investment  and protection solutions  We re in more than 120 total placements with more than 70 different offerings on more than 50 different platforms  This reflects continued strong interest in our specialty solutions oriented and alternative capabilities as well as our success in getting these investment options added to third party distribution platforms  recommended list and model portfolios Additionally  the IRT acquisition enhances our ability to distribute through the consultant channel  Our increased capabilities and depth of relationships with the consultants  RIAs  and specialist firms will accelerate our ability to achieve new sales  We also advanced our accelerated digital investments throughout 2019 to create better customer experiences and drive revenue growth  while gaining efficiencies  We re now two years in and our investments are on track  We saw incremental benefits to both revenue and expenses in 2019 from these capabilities For example  Principal Real Start  our new digital and mobile platform to enroll retirement plan participants  has shown tremendous potential to get participants on track to save enough for retirement  Since its launch in the fourth quarter of 2018  more than a 0 25 million participants completed the experience and chose deferral rates that are 60  higher than other enrollment methods and one of four participants have elected to auto escalate their deferral rate up to 10   Additionally  our fully digital experience for purchasing term life insurance launched in the third quarter of 2019 and is one of the first of its kind in the industry  On average  it delivers policies to customers two thirds faster than traditional methods While Deanna will cover this in more detail  I want to emphasize our balanced approach to capital deployment  In addition to strategic acquisitions and investments in our business  in 2019  we returned more than  860 million to shareholders through common stock dividends and share buybacks  We enjoyed noteworthy third party recognition throughout 2019  reflecting our Company s dedication to its core values  Pensions   Investments named Principal one of the best places to work in money management and we re one of only five companies to have made that list every year since the program was launched in 2012  We received multiple awards from Forbes  including being named one of America s Best Large Employers  one of America s Best Employers for Diversity and Number 5 on their list of Best Employers for Women  And Cogent Syndicated recognized Principal as a defined contribution service winner with the highest satisfaction score in Plan Advisor Service   Support  as well as Participant Service   Support  the two most critical categories for continued recommendation among defined contribution advisors While we re incredibly proud of the external recognition  Principal s record level of giving back in 2019 also speaks volumes about our Company culture  Our employees donated more than  6 million and volunteered 55 000 hours of their time in 2019 to help people around the world learn  earn  and save  This team effort shows how Principal strives not only to do business  but to do good in the communities where we live and work In closing  I m very proud of our accomplishments in 2019 and I m confident in our ability to execute on our strategy in 2020  We ll continue to balance investing in our business  while managing expenses in line with revenues to deliver long term value for our shareholders Deanna Deanna D  Strable    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Dan  Good morning to everyone on the call  This morning  I ll discuss the key contributors to our financial performance for the quarter and full year as well as capital deployments and our capital position at year end  Net income attributable to Principal was  301 million for the fourth quarter and  1 4 billion for the full year  Quarterly net realized capital losses of  96 million were primarily driven by derivative losses associated with hedging activities with minimal credit losses  Reported non GAAP operating earnings were  396 million for the fourth quarter or  1 41 per diluted share  Excluding significant variances  fourth quarter non GAAP operating earnings increased 13  and non GAAP earnings per diluted share increased 14  compared to fourth quarter 2018  The year ago quarter was negatively impacted by a 14  decline in the S P 500 and unfavorable macroeconomics in Latin America Reported full year 2019 non GAAP operating earnings were nearly  1 6 billion or  5 58 per diluted share  Non GAAP operating ROE  excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation was 13 1  at year end  The full year non GAAP operating earnings effective tax rate was 16 9   within our 2019 guided range  As communicated on our 2020 outlook call  we expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be between 16  to 19  As shown on Slide 4  we have three significant variances during the fourth quarter  including negative  14 million in RIS Fee  primarily integration costs from the IRT acquisition and a negative  3 million impact in Principal International due to lower than expected in encaje performance in Latin America  These were mostly offset by a  12 million benefit in PGI from a reduction in an earn out liability for Principal Real Estate Europe  formally known as Internos  This reduction was due to a change in the timing and pattern of revenues during the earn out measurement period stemming from two factors  Market dynamics allowed the team to sell several properties and liquidate assets in a fund  maximizing returns for our clients  which is always our priority and we had a delay in receiving regulatory approval to launch a key fund during the measurement period  Principal Real Estate Europe continues to perform well and their strong interest in their investment strategies  As a reminder  in the prior year quarter we had significant variances  primarily due to unfavorable macroeconomic factors that had a net negative  54 million impact to reported non GAAP pre tax operating earnings Looking at macroeconomic factors in the fourth quarter  the S P 500 Index increased over 8  and the daily average increased more than 4  compared to the third quarter of 2019  On a trailing 12 month basis  the daily average increased 6   in line with our full year price appreciation assumption Moving to foreign exchange rates  I d like to remind you that revenue expenses and pre tax operating earnings are translated using average foreign exchange rates  while AUM is translated using the spot rate  Fourth quarter AUM benefited slightly from favorable movements in spot rates relative to the third quarter  but the average rates remained a headwind  Impacts to pre tax operating earnings included a negative  4 million compared to fourth quarter 2018  as well as third quarter 2019 and a negative  24 million on a trailing 12 month basis Mortality and morbidity were in line with or better than our expectations for the fourth quarter and full year in Specialty Benefits and Individual Life  Very favorable claims benefited Specialty Benefits full year pre tax operating earnings by approximately  19 million  driven by  10 million of favorable group life and disability claims in the fourth quarter and  9 million of favorable group life claims in the second quarter  Over a longer period of time  loss ratios remain within our guided range RIS spread had an experience loss in the fourth quarter that was slightly worse than our expectations and the prior year quarter  negatively impacting pre tax operating earnings  For the full year  experience was below our expectations with a net negative  20 million change from 2018  Over a longer period of time  experience is in line with our expectations Both long term and short term interest rates declined throughout 2019  Our near term earnings are most sensitive to changes in the interest on excess reserves or IOER rate  The IOER rate was lowered 85 basis points in 2019  including a 25 basis point drop in the fourth quarter  This negatively impacted revenue  primarily in the IRT trust and custody business and was reflected in our 2020 guidance for RIS Fee Turning to expenses  As we ve experienced in prior years  we expected total Company operating expenses to be higher in the fourth quarter than the average of the first three quarters due to seasonality of certain expenses  Excluding IRT and higher variable expenses  fourth quarter operating expenses and compensation and other expenses are in line to slightly lower than expected levels  It s critical that we continue to execute on our investments to position us for long term growth  Our digital investments continue in 2020  We expect the net pre tax impact to be slightly less than the  50 million to  60 million net impact in 2019  as more benefits are expected to emerge in 2020 The following comments on business unit results exclude significant variances from both periods  Starting with RIS Fee on Slide 6  pre tax operating earnings of  129 million were in line with expectations  Lower DAC amortization expense was offset by a true up of costs associated with the IRT business  Full year 2019 net revenue growth of 11  is above our guided range as the acquisition brought on additional net revenue in the second half of the year  The quarterly margin was maintained at 25  in the fourth quarter  Longer term  we expect margins to expand once the acquisition is fully integrated and the expense synergies are realized Importantly  the legacy RIS Fee business continues to perform well  The fourth quarter margin was 33  for the legacy business  above the guided range  As the acquired business begins to transition to our combined platform in 2020  it will become increasingly difficult to provide stand alone details on the legacy business  The fundamentals of our legacy business remains strong  Compared to full year 2018  sales of  18 billion increased 30   defined contribution participant count increased nearly 300 000 participants or 8   and net cash flow of  7 billion increased 140  and with more than 3  of beginning of your account values above the 1  to 3  targeted range  This was driven by strong sales  10  growth in recurring deposits  and low contract lapses Turning to Slide 8  RIS Spread s pre tax operating earnings of  92 million were lower than expected  primarily due to unfavorable experience losses  lower than expected net investment income and the impact of lower annuity sales  RIS Spread s full year net revenue growth and margin were within our guided ranges  In 2019  account values grew nearly 13  on strong sales of  10 3 billion  This includes a record  3 9 billion of pension risk transfer sales  nearly 50  higher than 2018  Looking ahead  the pipeline for pension risk transfer sales remain strong  despite the low interest rate environment As shown on Slide 9  PGI s pre tax operating earnings of  132 million were above our expectations  This was primarily due to growth in management fees and performance fees  partially offset by higher variable expenses  PGI generated  51 million of performance fees in the fourth quarter  Of this   32 million was related to a Principal Real Estate Europe fund  Per the acquisition agreement  these were distributed to the investment team and the previous owners  resulting in an immaterial impact to pre tax operating earnings  A portion of the other performance fees earned during the quarter were also pass through as compensation  As a reminder  performance fees are volatile quarter to quarter  Full year 2019 operating revenues less pass through expenses increased 2   This was within our guided range and excludes the impact of the accelerated performance fee in 2018  PGI s margin ended the year at 36   within our guided range Moving to Slide 10  Principal International s pre tax operating earnings of  80 million were in line with our expectations and negatively impacted by foreign currency translation  A benefit from higher than expected inflation in Brazil was more than offset by elevated expenses isolated to the quarter  We believe that fourth quarter s pre tax operating earnings  excluding significant variances  is a good starting point to use to estimate PI s earnings in 2020  Excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review  PI s full year margin of 39   was at the high end of our guided range  while net revenue growth of 5  was at the low end of our guided range  primarily due to foreign currency headwinds Turning to Slide 11  Specialty Benefits pre tax operating earnings of  98 million were strong  due to favorable claims and growth in the business  Specialty Benefits had a very strong year and continues to perform well  On a full year basis  Specialty Benefits premium and fees increased a strong 7  over 2018 and were within our guided range  This was driven by record sales of nearly  400 million  strong retention  and in group growth  The full year margin was over 14   130 basis points higher than last year and was at the high end of our guided range As shown on Slide 12  Individual Life s pre tax operating earnings of  46 million were in line with our expectations  As part of our third quarter assumption review  we lowered our long term interest rate assumptions  This decreased Individual Life s earnings run rate by about  2 million to  3 million per quarter with the impact beginning in the fourth quarter  On a trailing 12 month basis  Individual Life s premium and fee growth of 5  and margin of 18  were within our guided ranges  Individual Life had record full year sales of  270 million  an increase of 17  over 2018 with over 60  coming from the business market  as we continue to focus on solutions for business owners At  96 million for fourth quarter  Corporate s pre tax operating losses were in line with our expectations  For the full year  losses of  380 million were higher than our guided range  As discussed on previous calls  higher security benefit expenses  as well as increased debt expense and lower net investment income related to the IRT acquisition impacted corporate losses relative to our 2019 guided range Looking ahead to 2020  I want to remind you that we typically have elevated payroll taxes in PGI and higher claims in Specialty Benefits in the first quarter  Capitalizing acquisition costs in our group benefits business will improve first quarter earnings for Specialty Benefits  but we continue to expect earnings in the first half of the year to be slightly less than the second half With lower interest rates throughout 2019  I want to provide details on some of the impacts on our general account businesses  During the fourth quarter  our new money yield of 3 2  was about 50 basis points lower than the overall portfolio yield  excluding variable investment income  This will provide some headwinds to earnings  but it will take time for the new money yield to have a meaningful impact on the overall portfolio yield and our operating earnings  We remain disciplined in updating our pricing for interest rate movements  We re conservative in the products and liabilities we have exposure to and we remain diligent around asset liability management  While higher rates are incrementally positive  our diverse business mix positions us well in this low interest rate environment As shown on Slide 13  we committed and deployed  240 million of capital in the fourth quarter  including  152 million for common stock dividends   84 million in share repurchases and  4 million to increase ownership in one of our focused investment teams  This brings full year capital deployments to nearly  2 1 billion or 150  of net income  well above our  1 billion to  1 4 billion guidance  2019 deployments included  1 2 billion for the IRT acquisition and more than  860 million was returned to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases  At the end of 2019  we had  168 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization  As always  we will continue to take a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment As a reminder  on our 2020 outlook call  we increased our free cash flow target to 70  to 80  of net income in excess of capital used to fund organic growth  We are targeting  1 4 billion to  1 7 billion of external capital deployments in 2020  The full year common stock dividend was  2 18 per share  a 4  increase over 2018  Last night  we announced a  0 56 common stock dividend payable in the first quarter  a 4  increase from a year ago  Our dividend yield is approximately 4  and on a trailing 12 month basis were slightly above our targeted 40  net income payout ratio  Our capital and liquidity position remained very strong  including an estimated risk based capital ratio of 410  at year end  We ended 2019 with nearly  1 2 billion at the holding company  nearly a  150 million in excess of our targeted 400  risk based capital ratio and over  400 million of available cash in our subsidiaries  In addition  a low leverage ratio and no debt maturities until 2022 provides us significant financial flexibility As part of our 2020 outlook  we provided estimated revenue for full year 2019 by business unit to use as a starting point for 2020  Actual results  excluding significant variances  were within these ranges  I want to remind you that our 2020 margin guidance for RIS Fee excludes the IRT integration costs  We continue to expect approximately  55 million to  65 million of integration costs in our reported pre tax operating earnings in RIS Fee  We will continue to identify these integration costs as significant variances throughout the year Looking ahead to 2020  we continue to expect an annual growth rate in non GAAP operating earnings per share in the high single digits over 2019 excluding the impact of the 2019 significant variances and integration costs in 2020  2019 was a good year and we remain confident in our diversified business model as well as our ability to execute on our strategy and consistently deliver above market growth This concludes our prepared remarks  Operator  please open the call for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  The first question will come from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Alex Scott    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi  good morning  First question I had was on RIS Fee  I just wanted to see if you could provide some comments on the way the end of the year has gone in terms of any changes to the plans  I know there s been some moving pieces around the way commissions are paid in the past  Also  just thinking about the proprietary versus non proprietary mix of assets  would you anticipate that that as a percentage of AUM would sort of begin to flat line or would that continue to move down the pace it has been moving down Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  thanks  Alex  This is Dan  Thanks for the question  A couple of notes before I throw it over to Renee  I don t    when I reflect on the results for 2019  they were really positive  If you look at that plan growth on a full year basis  over 250 000 new participants being added over that period of time and frankly the sales number is really  really strong  So  the fundamentals of the business remain very much intact  As you know we ve had historically very strong proprietary asset management sales in large part because performance has been good and again it differs on size  whether it s small  medium  or large  but we feel very good about our ability to continue to provide a comprehensive bundled solution  including administration  record keeping and asset management  and there s a lot of collaboration that occurs between PGI and RIS to make that happen  but I ll throw it to Renee  I know you re excited about what you ve got going on  not only 2019  Renee  but 2020 Renee Schaaf    President Retirement and Income SolutionsYeah  absolutely  So  Alex  thank you for your question and the first question that you had was around the movement that we re seeing from commission based compensation agreements to fee based  And the guidance that we provided last year on this was we would typically see about    revenue pressures of about 1  to 2  due to this  which of course doesn t impact pre tax operating earnings because it s netted out in the expense line  But what we are seeing is exactly in line with that  And so  when we look at fourth quarter results  we see about 1  to 1 5  movement from commission to fee based and that s exactly what we would anticipate Your other question dealt with the percent of proprietary assets and what we might anticipate seeing there  First off  we re really proud of the results  our sales results in 2019  and we introduced pricing and the way that it s packaged to encourage and to incent proprietary    sales of proprietary assets  And so  if you were to look at the percent of proprietary assets for our small and medium sized plans  you would see that they run above market  above industry  and institutional is pretty much in line with what we see in industry  Despite that  we do see downward pressure on this as kind of a normal  something we ve been talking about now for several quarters  It s the result of more propensity for employers  particularly large employers to move toward passive and also the bifurcation of the record keeping decision from the asset management and the investment management decision  If you look at net cash flows overall for target date funds  they ve been fairly flat  but we re pleased with what we see in terms of how we perform to market  but we do anticipate that we ll continue to see pressure here ongoing simply because of the bifurcation between record keeping and investment management decisions Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerDoes that help  Alex Alex Scott    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYeah  it is very helpful  And look  I appreciate that the flows and the sales have been quite strong there  So  I don t mean to take away from that  Second question I had was just on SECURE Act  If you could provide any more details on sort of the action plan  Are you going after multi employer pooling  And is anything in the works there Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  certainly  And as you know  we advocated for the passage of the SECURE Act  We feel good about it  Really sort of three key pieces  The first of which is the formation  as you know the    of the MEPs  multiple employer plans  We ve been in that business for a very long time  So we understand how to work with contracts that have adopting employers  So the fundamentals are very much in place  There will be a change  we ll end up partnering with a third party to help us facilitate that  but there is very much a battle plan in place to help provide small  to medium sized employers gain coverage and improve adequacy The other was the in plan income solution  which again  we ve been in the annuity business for 75 years  we know how to do that  The safe harbor is going to give customers more confidence about adding that provision  and then there is a small incentive for small plan formation in the way of a tax credit  So  I d say  all in all  we look at that as being a positive  And as I said in my prepared comments  this will take time to merge  This won t happen overnight  But just like the last major piece of pension legislation  which gave us auto enroll and auto escalate  these things collectively put us on a better position to cover more American workers  So  net positive for the SECURE Act Alex Scott    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks very much Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome OperatorThe next question is from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research  Please go ahead Erik Bass    Autonomous Research LLP    AnalystHi  thank you  First  just one follow up on the SECURE Act and specifically the open MEPs  do you see that as all kind of new opportunity  Or do you get a sense from any of your existing small plans that they may be looking to move into kind of an open MEPs structure to try to lower their costs Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I actually think it s going to be far more new than existing  And again  you have to recognize and we  again as I mentioned earlier Eric  have some experience in this space  because there are limitations  There will be of a limited number of planned choices  There are other constituents involved in the decision making  So  not only will we see emerge multiple employer plans with both multiple record keepers out there providing those services  but I got to believe every single organization like Principal will participate there and as we continue with this digital transformation have our own small employer plans that are very cost effective  very convenient and would effectively allow them to have perhaps a little bit more flexibility  But Renee  you want to add some additional comments there Renee Schaaf    President Retirement and Income SolutionsYeah  I agree that I think we ll see most of the plan take up be with new plans and start up plans  Perhaps  the one reason why existing plan sponsors might be interested in open MEP is if they can curtail their fiduciary liability and we re still waiting on final regs to see exactly how that may play out  but that could be a driver for    to incent existing plans to adopt the open MEPs structure but I agree it s going to be predominantly driven by new plans and start up plans Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerBut the regs for what I described in three buckets is over 800 pages long and it s still going to require the industry to digest that Erik Bass    Autonomous Research LLP    AnalystGot it  Thank you  I appreciate the color there  And then secondly  I was hoping you could talk about the impact of the macro and political disruption in Hong Kong and Chile and just provide an update on what impact do you see that having potentially on near term results in these markets and for Principal International overall Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerIt s a good question  I ll make a few comments before throwing it the Luis  And again  I think it s a reminder to all of us as you think about what is appropriate pension policy by country  you also have and although we don t    aren t in the record keeping business in France  you also have people on the streets demonstrating against the changes to their pension policies and we ve been saying for years that the era of personal responsibility and accountability is here  Governments aren t in a position to fund it  And sure enough  as you look at Chile and Hong Kong and France and other areas around the world  including Brazil  you re seeing more pressure being placed on elected officials to come up with a reasonable retirement policy for people aging  And so  on one hand  it s a huge opportunity for Principal  at the same time  we ve got to make sure that we re advocating and we re helping steer and drive pension policy and I can t think of a better person to talk about that on the international front than Luis Valdes  Luis Luis Valdes    President and Chief Executive Officer Principal InternationalOkay  thank you very much  Hi  Erik  A couple of things first to start with  The root cause of these social unrest in Hong Kong and Chile are  first of all  completely different  Also  I think that we have to keep in mind that in both places they do have different political systems in nature  so hence the evolution pace  path of the negotiations and solutions are going to be different  are going to take a quite amount of time and at this moment are kind of unknown What do we have in common in these two places  First  we have had no major disruptions in our operations in both places and we have had second  a minor short term financial impact in both locations  I wanted to say something  We re reporting record AUMs for Hong Kong for 2019 and we re reporting in trailing 12 month basis record operating earnings for Hong Kong as well  So  this is a micro scenario in the short term  Going into macro perspective and having said that and because the severity and the duration of this social unrest  both markets are going into a no growth  if not in a recession for the next couple of years  So what we re doing in light of this new reality  we are recalibrating our operations in Chile and in Hong Kong with two main objectives First of all  to continue servicing our clients and to protect their interest and to continue improving their customer experience  And second  to keep our expenses in line with our revenues going forward  We re well prepared and we ll continue monitoring how the macroeconomics are going to evolve in those markets  but we are taking actions and  Indecipherable  expense actions in order to be pretty much more in line about what is    might happen in those markets Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerHopefully that helped  Eric Erik Bass    Autonomous Research LLP    AnalystYes  thank you Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAppreciate it OperatorThe next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with J P  Morgan  Please go ahead Jimmy Bhullar    JPMorgan Chase   Co     AnalystHi  good morning  I had a couple of questions  First  on the    overall  your results were obviously pretty strong  but it seems like retirement earnings for each of the past    the fee side  each of the past couple of quarters have been a little light  And I m not sure how the Wells block is performing versus your initial expectations and specifically on how much of a headwind the low Fed funds rate is for income on trust accounts for the acquired block Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Good  good questions and make no mistake  there is a headwind with interest rates continuing to fall and it is having a negative impact on that trust and custody business  But again  I get back to the fact we are in this for the long haul and feel very good about the fundamentals Renee  you want to talk a little bit further about the integration and where we stand Renee Schaaf    President Retirement and Income SolutionsAbsolutely  Thank you for the question  Jimmy  and I think first off to just speak a moment about the fourth quarter results for fee  We re very pleased with the results  particularly when you look at the legacy business  the growth that we re seeing there  the profitability that we re seeing there  really very good and very strong  Our sales results I think and our net cash flow results are particularly pleasing and we re excited about the impact that we see on TRS  Our new sales are really being fueled by TRS and that goes all across the board in terms of defined benefit sales being up 33   ESOP sales being up 70   our record year for sales for non qualified  So  a lot of strength in the organic growth machine of that legacy business As you pointed out  when we look at the IRT business  the area of pressure that we have seen is in the interest on excess reserves and we saw an 85  decline in the basis points that would reflect for that business and so we are seeing pressures there  That s been accounted for in terms of our guidance for 2020  but it does pressure results for fourth quarter Jimmy Bhullar    JPMorgan Chase   Co     AnalystHow much of a    are you able to quantify how much of a headwind that is on an annual basis  if    assuming a stable Fed funds rate this year versus where it would have been when you announced the deal Renee Schaaf    President Retirement and Income SolutionsYeah  So  if you were to take the 85 basis points and annualize that  the impact on revenue was about  25 million to  30 million impact annualized  but to state it differently  so we have that  of course  baked in to our 2020 outlook Jimmy Bhullar    JPMorgan Chase   Co     AnalystOkay  And if I could ask one more  you ve been fairly active with deals  but most of them have been small sort of tuck in type transaction international markets and asset management  So  if you just comment on your interest in deals and specifically if you would be open to a large transaction  you ve been mentioned as an acquirer of some of  Phonetic  like large public companies in the press recently  but just wanted to see if that s something that you would be open to as well Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  right now  what I would say is we are going through the digestion process of the Wells Fargo IRT business  Our highest priority is successfully migrating those customers  the employees  the participants and reassuring the advisors and the distribution community that we are    they are in safe hands  And so  job one  successfully migrate those customers and so  we ve got our hands full for another five quarter  say  as we transition through that limited resources to execute and bring those clients on board  But again  as Renee was saying  we re very happy about the progress In other parts of our business  asset management is not as connected in terms of the resources and if there is the right opportunity that presents itself to Tim Dunbar and his team around asset management  that allows us to add capabilities and scale  we would want to do that  Outside the country  in terms of replicating more of what we do for PI  we ve been on the record before  we like the countries that we re in  From time to time  we do get presented with the opportunity to again add capabilities and scale and we we d look at each one of those on a one off  But bottom line is  right now  we ve got our hands very full with digesting what we have on the full service side Does that help  Jimmy Jimmy Bhullar    JPMorgan Chase   Co     AnalystYes  thank you Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks for the questions OperatorThe next question is from Humphrey Lee with Dowling   Partners  Please go ahead Humphrey Lee    Dowling   Partners    AnalystGood morning and thank you for taking my questions  I have a follow up question to Eric s question earlier for Principal International  So  but looking at the kind of expenses for this quarter  they looked a little bit elevated and then specifically looking at earnings contribution by country on a local currency basis and adjusted for encaje  Chile was lower than what it had been running for the past few quarters and then also China looked a little weaker  Like I was just wondering  can you talk about what s going on there  Like from Luis  comments earlier  it didn t sound like you re seeing any structural changes or any systemic things going on in there  But I was just wondering  is there any kind of some one off expenses or anything that you can provide some color on Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI ll make two broad statements before asking Luis to add to it and the first thing I would say is  when you re dealing with emerging markets  there s always a lot of volatility  There is political volatility  currency  FX  inflation  certainly encaje introduces its own set of complexity  So we re quite accustomed the fact that if you re going to do business in emerging market  it comes with a lot of volatility The second thing I would point out and I still remember that 10 years of which PI was such a big tailwind every single quarter  PI represents about 19  of our earnings and if I add Chile and Hong Kong together  it s about 10  of the total earnings  So the bottom line is we are at any given time going to have disruption and volatility in these various markets in which we do business  And I wouldn t look at any one quarter in any one year around expenses and somehow think that that was not something that we would manage effectively So  Luis  you want to take it from there Luis Valdes    President and Chief Executive Officer Principal InternationalYes  Hi  Humphrey  Let me start with China first  in order to try to explain what you re asking  We have certainly    it looks like that fourth quarter for China is kind of a low quarter  We have a delta between third quarter and fourth quarter of  2 9 million in OE pre tax and we have a delta of  3 5 million in revenues  So  let me try to explain this very  very quickly  The whole difference is about the average AUMs for the fourth quarter  When you look in the fourth quarter end to end comparison with three quarter  Phonetic   it looks flat  But we have a lot of volatility the intra quarter  particularly we have  7 billion of negative net customer cash flows in October  then we had positive net customer cash flows considering November and December  So the whole quarter we have a  3 3 billion negative net customer cash flows  but the path was completely different  So the average was pretty much more lower than you can expect So with that  the impact in our revenues  just because the lower average AUM  it was at  2 2 million to start with  Then you have another small impact in terms of  0 5 million in FX  Having said that  this was totally expected for the year  the  5 5 billion negative net customer cash flows in 2019 after having  33 billion    positive billion dollars in net customer cash flows in 2018  The reason for is  Indecipherable  a profound movement from money market funds in which we re heavily weighted in the Chinese market into equity markets during 2019  We were pretty flat when the average industry had a negative 6  down from money market funds  So  we are doing  I would say  well end to end  but the explanation for China is average AUM for the fourth quarter Going into Chile  certainly  we should have a  26 1 million to explain in OE  Let me go very quickly with that  Easier to explain the delta is at  50 million in cash here   13 million  Phonetic  positive in the third quarter  minus  3 million negative in the fourth quarter  So you have a delta of  15 million there  Elevated prepayment fees in the third quarter by  4 million and then the FX impact in terms of revenues was another  6 million just within the third quarter and the fourth quarter  So  with those numbers  you can make the math for Chile  So  in a constant basis and adjusted basis  Chile  third quarter and fourth quarter was a flat    I would say flat growth for Chile  That is essentially the explanation for both countries Humphrey Lee    Dowling   Partners    AnalystI appreciate the color  thank you for that  Shifting gear to PGI  net flows were positive for the full year and as you look into the pipeline for 2020  do you expect the positive flows to continue  And then  I have another question on the performance fees Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI know I do  I ll ask Tim to answer for himself  Tim Timothy M  Dunbar    President Principal Global Asset ManagementYeah  thanks a lot for the question  We did see a lot of momentum building in 2019 for our net cash flows  I think we talked a little bit about some of the changes that we ve made to management into the distribution team and really to the infrastructure and ecosystem of our distributing our products and that bodes really well  I think the other thing I d mention is just the strong investment performance and while it s nice to see a pop in the short term investment performance  what I think I m most proud of and what we really focus a lot of our efforts on is really the consistency of the long term investment performance And if you look at that three year 71   five year 79  and 10 year 91   that really bodes well for the types of solutions we re trying to create for our clients and our strategy of building retirement investments for all of our clients So  I think that s the backdrop of how we feel about moving into 2020  which is we have some momentum gaining  Obviously  each quarter will have dynamics that will be a little volatile or a little different from quarter to quarter  but as we look at the backdrop  we have a strong pipeline  we have strong interest in a wide array of our diverse capabilities  So  we look pretty positively at 2020 Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Humphrey OperatorThe next question will come from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse  Please go ahead Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  Good morning Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystOne follow up on the SECURE Act  A few years back  you used to provide some stats on what were your small accounts  and I think maybe we could get a sense of what the fees on those accounts were  Could you give us a rough idea of what percent of your RIS deposits relate to small accounts and what the fee ranges there  And with that answer  as we move to MEPs  what would be the differential in fees if those accounts were to move into a MEP Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So I want to make sure and get a good answer here  but I certainly don t remember providing historical pricing because the reality is that we custom price nearly all of these plans  and are they TRS  are they not  what percentage proprietary a product and there is a such a wide range there  What you can sort of expect is I sort of    even the definition of what is small  what is medium and what is large and the reality is it kind of in our mind  we break it into a third  a third  a third  About a third of that total account values are in the small  about the third in what we describe as a medium and then third  which is large  And proportionately  the basis points that you get on a smaller plan is going to be larger than the very largest plans that we have  But on average  the margins are very comparable in the end So getting back to the full question around MEPs  that is a question  I think that is still yet to be answered  Make no mistake  there will be a lot of cost associated with the establishment and the oversight of these MEPs  I don t want anybody to get off this call think that it s a panacea that with the passage of a MEP  there is all of a sudden going to be an incredibly low cost option out there  because it    I just don t think that that s going to materialize  It will over time provide choice to small employers as Renee described earlier  who may not or may feel that there is a different fiduciary role that is being completed or different investment options  but I suspect we re a year away from being able to answer your question  Andrew  on the specificity around the competitive nature of in a MEP or a small plan Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot you  Okay  And then maybe shifting over to Specialty Benefits and you had a really nice change in premium over the last 12 months of premium and fees of about 7   As you look forward  where do you see most of the growth coming  Would you expect it in voluntary  And with that  are you seeing any signs of heavy competition and pricing pressure Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI can never remember a time where we didn t have heavy competition and pricing pressure in any of these benefits  but again a lot of credit to Amy and her team for what they re putting in place  their focus  their attention  but I ll let her specifically answer your question Amy C  Friedrich    President U S  Insurance SolutionsYeah  With regard to kind of starting with the pricing pressure  I think we do always see that pricing pressure  I think what    and I feel like a bit of a broken record here talking about the small case market  but when you look at the small case market  there are just some dynamics there that sort of serve as natural gates that keep some of our other competitors out of there  You got to do things in the scale to    you have to process 10 000 cases a year as opposed to 1 000 cases a year  You have to do some things with your in force pricing  you have to be willing to look at it as an advantage that you can have    make a pricing decision because you re    most of your block is only in a one year rate guarantee  So what I can guarantee for us is we will continue to grow in that small case market  We ve built a system that works for that footprint  we have the underlying technology and we have an awesome sales force lined up against that  I would argue that some of the relationships we have with brokers and advisors who serve those markets and again  they are not always the bigger name sort of regional or national players  a lot of these are people who have businesses that serve small local communities and we ve established really deep and strong relationships there So  as the economy continues to grow  as businesses continue to hire and add  I would continue to see that being a fuel for our premium and fee growth for SBD Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks for the questions  Andrew Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks OperatorThe final question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW  Please go ahead Ryan Krueger    Keefe  Bruyette   Woods    AnalystHi  thanks  good morning  My first question was on International  You referenced the  80 million of adjusted earnings as a good starting point going into 2020  That seems a bit lower than what was implied by the guidance in December  So  I just wanted to clarify if I was thinking about that correctly  And if so  what caused the change Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerLuis  if you want to help clarify that Luis Valdes    President and Chief Executive Officer Principal InternationalYes  Let me try to put this in perspective  because we have had this discussion and particularly  when you re looking what we have reported in Q3 first  So  it looks like we are    we have a comparison with that  It s  92 million versus  80 million  It s important to put this in precise  very easy to explain the difference  First of all   4 million headwind in FX  the same  4 million that we have in additional and an elevated prepayment fees and  3 million more about elevated expenses that are related with the recalibration of our business in Hong Kong and Chile  So  if you re taking that in consideration  you    immediately you re going to make the math between  92 million and  80 million  I really believe that as we said and Deanna said  the  80 million     81 million that we are proposing is a good representation of our run rate into 2020 and it s pretty much more in line with our guidance that we put together in the month of December for PI Ryan Krueger    Keefe  Bruyette   Woods    AnalystOkay  thanks  And then just last one  Deanna  you mentioned  high single digit EPS growth from a normalized level in 2019  Is the normalized level around  5 55  if I m making all the right adjustments Deanna D  Strable    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 5 55  so I think    are you looking at on an after tax basis or a pre tax basis Ryan Krueger    Keefe  Bruyette   Woods    AnalystI was    I think    I thought the high single digit growth was for adjusted   Deanna D  Strable    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerEPS  you re right  Yeah  I don t have that right in front of me  I think how we would do that is we took out all significant variances in 2019 and then we normalized for the integration costs in 2020  So we can get back to you on that exact EPS  but that s how    that s what led to that calculation Ryan Krueger    Keefe  Bruyette   Woods    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you OperatorWe have reached the end of our Q A  Mr  Houston  your closing comments  please sir Daniel J  Houston    Chairman  President and Chief

Bargain Stocks with Impressive EV EBITDA RatiosThe price to earnings  P E  ratio is widely considered by investors as a yardstick for evaluating the fair market value of a stock  It is preferred by many investors to handpick stocks trading at a bargain  However  even this universally used valuation multiple is not without its limitations Is EV EBITDA a Better Alternative to P E Although P E enjoys great popularity among value investors  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative  EV EBITDA gives the true picture of a company s valuation and earning potential  Additionally  it has a more comprehensive approach to valuation   EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   The first constituent of the ratio  EV  is a firm s market capitalization plus the market value of its debt and preferred equity minus cash EBITDA  the other element  is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Typically  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice  takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making company  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  EV EBITDA  in contrast  is less amenable to manipulation and also can be used to value firms that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA side Moreover  EV EBITDA allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels and is a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have substantial depreciation and amortization expenses However  EV EBITDA is also not without its shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  The ratio varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements As such  a strategy solely based on EV EBITDA might not yield the desired results   But you can club it with

141541,363056,PFG,Why Principal Financial  PFG  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Principal Financial  PFG   which belongs to the Zacks Financial   Investment Management industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This financial services company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8 45  
For the last reported quarter  Principal Financial came out with earnings of  1 52 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 40 per share  representing a surprise of 8 57   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 32 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 43 per share  delivering a surprise of 8 33  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Principal Financial  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Principal Financial has an Earnings ESP of  2 96  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on October 24  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-principal-financial-pfg-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200471939,200471939
141542,363057,PFG,Principal Financial  PFG  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q3 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Principal Financial  PFG  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 44 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 8  
Revenues are expected to be  3 88 billion  down 10 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 03  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Principal Financial 
For Principal Financial  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 87  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Principal Financial will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Principal Financial would post earnings of  1 40 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 52  delivering a surprise of  8 57  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Principal Financial appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/principal-financial-pfg-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q3-release-200474729,200474729

Financial Group  Inc    NASDAQ PFG   Add These 5 Stocks with Solid Sales Growth to Your PortfolioStrong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market  The companies putting more emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage  as strong sales generally get converted to growth Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing growth of a business  This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base Flat or declining sales rise indicates obstacles for the company and offers limited scope for sustained growth  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors Without impressive top line growth  bottom line improvement may not be sustainable over the long term  While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses  a sustainable bottom line recovery usually requires robust sales growth  However  sales growth in isolation doesn t indicate much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits Hence  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees

141570,363085,PFG,7 Valuable Low Price to Sales Picks For A Rewarding Portfolio,opinion,When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less

141572,363087,PFG,PFG Vs  OAK  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Financial   Investment Management stocks have likely encountered both Principal Financial  PFG  and Oaktree Capital Group  LLC  OAK   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Principal Financial has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Oaktree Capital Group  LLC has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that PFG s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
PFG currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 72  while OAK has a forward P E of 15 28  We also note that PFG has a PEG ratio of 1 41  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  OAK currently has a PEG ratio of 2 55 
Another notable valuation metric for PFG is its P B ratio of 1 12  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  OAK has a P B of 4 24 
Based on these metrics and many more  PFG holds a Value grade of A  while OAK has a Value grade of F 
PFG stands above OAK thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that PFG is the superior value option right now ",2019-09-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pfg-vs-oak-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200466535,200466535
141573,363088,PFG,Pick These 7 Low Price to Sales Stocks For Value Returns,opinion,A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the price to sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price

141574,363089,PFG,Pick These 5 Bargain Stocks With Impressive EV EBITDA Ratios,opinion,The price to earnings  P E  ratio is widely considered by investors as a yardstick for evaluating the fair market value of a stock  It is preferred by many investors to handpick stocks trading at a bargain  However  even this universally used valuation multiple is not without its limitations Is EV EBITDA a Better Alternative to P E Although P E enjoys great popularity among value investors  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative  EV EBITDA gives the true picture of a company s valuation and earning potential  Additionally  it has a more comprehensive approach to valuation   EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   The first constituent of the ratio  EV  is a firm s market capitalization plus the market value of its debt and preferred equity minus cash EBITDA  the other element  is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Typically  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice  takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making company  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  EV EBITDA  in contrast  is less amenable to manipulation and also can be used to value firms that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA side Moreover  EV EBITDA allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels and is a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have substantial depreciation and amortization expenses However  EV EBITDA is also not without its shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  The ratio varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements As such  a strategy solely based on EV EBITDA might not yield the desired results   But you can club it with the other major ratios in your stock investing toolbox such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen bargain stocks Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential Here are five of

141608,363123,PFG,Principal Financial  PFG  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Principal Financial in Focus
Principal Financial  PFG  is headquartered in Des Moines  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 19 72  since the start of the year  The financial services company is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 54 per share  with a dividend yield of 4 08   This compares to the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield of 2 94  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 95  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 16 is up 2 9  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Principal Financial has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 11 52   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Principal Financial s payout ratio is 38   which means it paid out 38  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for PFG for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 86 per share  with earnings expected to increase 5 97  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  PFG presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-08-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/principal-financial-pfg-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200454609,200454609
141609,363124,PFG,7 Low Price to Sales Stocks Likely To Deliver Robust Value,opinion,A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the price to sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price

These 5 Bargain Stocks with Enticing EV EBITDA Ratios Value investors generally have a fixation on the price to earnings  P E  multiple while seeking stocks that are trading at a bargain  P E  without a shadow of a doubt  is the most popular multiple used by investors to assess the fair market value of a stock  But even this straightforward  broadly used valuation metric suffers a few downsides Why EV EBITDA is a Better Approach Although the widespread use of P E stems from its simplicity  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better approach as it offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA  also referred to as the enterprise multiple  determines the total value of a firm while P E considers only its equity  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  In a nutshell  it is the total value of a company The other element  EBITDA  gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could imply that a stock is  has a more complete approach to valuation  Unlike P E ratio  it takes debt on a company s balance sheet into account  Due to this reason  EV EBITDA is typically used to value possible acquisition targets  as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume  Stocks with low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another key drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is less amenable to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels However  EV EBITDA is also not without its limitations and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  The ratio varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Hence  instead of solely relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired outcome For the

141636,363151,PFG,Principal Financial  PFG  Is Up 0 53  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Principal Financial  PFG   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Principal Financial currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if PFG is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this financial services company holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For PFG  shares are up 0 53  over the past week while the Zacks Financial   Investment Management industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 3 43  compares favorably with the industry s 1 22  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Principal Financial have increased 7 03  over the past quarter  and have gained 9 46  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 3 57  and 8 42   respectively 
Investors should also take note of PFG s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  PFG is averaging 1 078 162 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with PFG 
Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost PFG s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 69 to  5 70 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that PFG is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Principal Financial on your short list ",2019-07-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/principal-financial-pfg-is-up-053-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200441991,200441991
141637,363152,PFG,Tap These 5 Bargain Stocks With Exciting EV EBITDA Ratios ,opinion,The price to earnings  P E  ratio is widely considered by investors as a yardstick for evaluating the fair market value of a stock  Many value investors prefer to take the P E route in their pursuit for stocks that are trading at a bargain  However  even this universally used valuation multiple is not without its flaws What Makes EV EBITDA a Better Alternative Although P E is preferred by many investors while uncovering bargain stocks  another valuation metric called EV EBITDA does a better job  The ratio is sometimes viewed as a superior substitute as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings potential  EV EBITDA has a more comprehensive approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  In contrast  P E considers only a firm s equity  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents The other component of the multiple  EBITDA gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it eliminates the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another shortcoming of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  the ratio allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels Then again  EV EBITDA has its shortcomings too  It varies across industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure requirements Thus  a strategy only based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired results  But you can club it with other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen bargain stocks  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential Here are five of the 14 stocks

141638,363153,PFG,7 Low Price to Sales Stocks To Enhance Portfolio Returns,opinion,A stock s price to sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the price to sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with a price to sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower price to sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price to sales ratio When considering valuation metrics  price to earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice  This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy  However  price to sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits While a loss making company with a negative price to earnings ratio falls out of investor favor  its price to sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to sales is often preferred over price to earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price to sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance  rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price to sales ratio In any case  the price to sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median

5 Bargain Stocks with Exciting EV EBITDA RatiosThe price to earnings  P E  ratio is widely considered by investors as a yardstick for evaluating the fair market value of a stock  Many value investors prefer to take the P E route in their pursuit for stocks that are trading at a bargain  However  even this universally used valuation multiple is not without its flaws What Makes EV EBITDA a Better Alternative Although P E is preferred by many investors while uncovering bargain stocks  another valuation metric called EV EBITDA does a better job  The ratio is sometimes viewed as a superior substitute as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings potential  EV EBITDA has a more comprehensive approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  In contrast  P E considers only a firm s equity  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents The other component of the multiple  EBITDA gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it eliminates the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another shortcoming of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  the ratio allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels Then again  EV EBITDA has its shortcomings too  It varies across industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure requirements Thus  a strategy only based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired results  But you can club it with other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen bargain stocks For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks

141658,363173,PFG,Why Principal Financial  PFG  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Principal Financial in Focus
Headquartered in Des Moines  Principal Financial  PFG  is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 20 01  so far this year  The financial services company is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 54 per share  with a dividend yield of 4 07   This compares to the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield of 3 22  and the S P 500 s yield of 2 04  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 16 is up 2 9  from last year  In the past five year period  Principal Financial has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 12   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Principal Financial s current payout ratio is 39   This means it paid out 39  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
PFG is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 69 per share  with earnings expected to increase 2 89  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that PFG is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-06-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-principal-financial-pfg-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200428231,200428231

financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Principal Financial Group has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 97  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 85  If we focus on the long  term PE trend  Principal Financial Group s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 11 66 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  However  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 01  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Principal Financial Group has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 9 56  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Principal Financial Group s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Principal Financial Group has a P S ratio of about 1 03  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 23 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Principal Financial Group currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Principal Financial Group a solid choice for value investors For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 28  which is marginally better than the industry average of 8 97  Clearly  PFG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Principal Financial Group might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and Momentum Score of B  This gives PFG a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen four upward revisions compared to none downward revision in the past sixty days  whereas the next year estimate has seen one upward revision compared to none downward in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate increased 1 97  in the past two months  whereas the next year estimate rose 0 49   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Principal Financial Group  Inc  Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock with a long term EPS growth rate of 4 6  and favorable estimate trends has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePrincipal Financial Group is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  the Zacks Rank  2 company flaunts a robust industry rank  among the top 35    which indicates that the broader factors are favorable for the company So  value investors might want to delve deeper in

141661,363176,PFG,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Principal Financial  PFG  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Principal Financial in Focus
Based in Des Moines  Principal Financial  PFG  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 27 17   The financial services company is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 54 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 85   This compares to the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield of 3 12  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 94  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 16 is up 2 9  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Principal Financial has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 12   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Principal Financial s current payout ratio is 39   meaning it paid out 39  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
PFG is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 69 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 2 89  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  PFG presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-principal-financial-pfg-could-be-a-great-choice-200433371,200433371
141662,363177,PFG,Principal Financial  PFG  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Principal Financial  PFG  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 40 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 7  
Revenues are expected to be  3 82 billion  up 20 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 23  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Principal Financial 
For Principal Financial  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 08  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Principal Financial will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Principal Financial would post earnings of  1 32 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 43  delivering a surprise of  8 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

The price to earnings  P E  ratio is the most commonly used tool for evaluating a firm s value due to its simplicity  A widely favored approach by value investors is to chase for stocks that have a low P E ratio  However  even this broadly used valuation multiple is not without its shortcomings 
Why EV EBITDA is a Better Choice 
Although P E enjoys great popularity among value investors  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative  EV EBITDA gives the true picture of a company s valuation and earning potential  Additionally  it has a more comprehensive approach to valuation  
EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   The first constituent of the ratio  EV  is a firm s market capitalization plus the market value of its debt and preferred equity minus cash 
EBITDA  the other element of the ratio  is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows 
Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could imply that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice versa 
EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates 
Moreover  P E can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA positive 
EV EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms with a debt laden balance sheet and have a high degree of depreciation  It also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels 
But EV EBITDA is not without its limitations  The ratio varies across industries  a high growth industry typically has higher multiple and vice versa  and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital requirements 
Thus  instead of solely relying on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired results For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material  An affiliated investment advisory firm may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material About Screen of the Week Zacks com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the   1 site for screening stocks  by Money Magazine  But powerful screening tools is just the start  That is why Zacks created the Screen of the Week to highlight profitable stock picking strategies that investors can actively use  Strong Stocks that Should Be in the NewsMany are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar  They re virtually unknown to the general public  Yet today s 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  were generated by the stock picking system that has more than doubled the market from 1988 through 2016  Its average gain has been a stellar  25  per year    Follow us on Twitter   Join us on Facebook  NASDAQ FB    Zacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities  including a broker dealer and an investment adviser   which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates  Contact  Jim GiaquintoCompany  Zacks comPhone  312 265 9268Email  Visit   Zacks com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources  which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions  Zacks is providing information on this resource to you subject to the Zacks  Terms and Conditions of Service  disclaimer    Past performance is no guarantee of future results  Inherent in any investment is the potential for loss  This material is being provided for informational purposes only and nothing herein constitutes investment  legal  accounting or tax advice  or a recommendation to buy  sell or hold a security  No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor  It should not be assumed that any investments in securities  companies  sectors or markets identified and described were or will be profitable  All information is current as of the date of herein and is subject to change without notice  Any views or opinions expressed may not reflect those of the firm as a whole  Zacks Investment Research does not engage in investment banking  market making or asset management activities of any securities  These returns are from hypothetical portfolios consisting of stocks with Zacks Rank   1 that were rebalanced monthly with zero transaction costs  These are not the returns of actual portfolios of stocks  The S P 500 is an unmanaged index  Visit  for information about the performance numbers displayed in this press release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/zackscom-featured-expert-kevin-matras-highlights-quanta-services-chaparral-energy-dxc-technology-total-and-principal-financial-200409411,200409411

141693,363208,PFG,PFG Vs  HRGLY  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Financial   Investment Management sector might want to consider either Principal Financial  PFG  or Hargreaves Lansdown  LON HRGV  plc  HRGLY   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Principal Financial has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Hargreaves Lansdown plc has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that PFG has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
PFG currently has a forward P E ratio of 10  while HRGLY has a forward P E of 43 85  We also note that PFG has a PEG ratio of 2 17  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  HRGLY currently has a PEG ratio of 3 62 
Another notable valuation metric for PFG is its P B ratio of 1 24  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  HRGLY has a P B of 25 34 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to PFG s Value grade of B and HRGLY s Value grade of D 
PFG has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than HRGLY  so it seems like value investors will conclude that PFG is the superior option right now ",2019-05-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pfg-vs-hrgly-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200415561,200415561
141694,363209,PFG,Is Principal Financial  PFG  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks  Nevertheless  we know that our readers all have their own perspectives  so we are always looking at the latest trends in value  growth  and momentum to find strong picks 
Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One stock to keep an eye on is Principal Financial  PFG   PFG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value  The stock is trading with a P E ratio of 9 85  which compares to its industry s average of 10 51  PFG s Forward P E has been as high as 10 28 and as low as 6 93  with a median of 9 22  all within the past year 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PFG s P B ratio of 1 26  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This company s current P B looks solid when compared to its industry s average P B of 1 81  Within the past 52 weeks  PFG s P B has been as high as 1 46 and as low as 0 99  with a median of 1 26 
Value investors also love the P S ratio  which is calculated by simply dividing a stock s price with the company s sales  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  PFG has a P S ratio of 1 06  This compares to its industry s average P S of 2 71 
Finally  we should also recognize that PFG has a P CF ratio of 7 90  This metric takes into account a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook  PFG s current P CF looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P CF of 12 81  PFG s P CF has been as high as 7 90 and as low as 4 59  with a median of 5 87  all within the past year 
These are only a few of the key metrics included in Principal Financial s strong Value grade  but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now  When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook  PFG looks like an impressive value stock at the moment ",2019-05-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-principal-financial-pfg-stock-undervalued-right-now-200418016,200418016

value of a stock  Many prefer to take the P E route in their quest for stocks that are trading at attractive prices  However  even this widely popular valuation metric is not without its pitfalls Is EV EBITDA a Better Substitute to P E Although P E is hands down the most widely used equity valuation ratio in the market  a relatively less used metric called EV EBITDA is often viewed as a better

Pick These 5 Value Stocks with Alluring EV EBITDA Ratios
The price to earnings  P E  ratio is broadly considered by investors as a yardstick for evaluating the fair market value of a stock  Many prefer to take the P E route in their quest for stocks that are trading at attractive prices  However  even this widely popular valuation metric is not without its pitfalls 
Is EV EBITDA a Better Substitute to P E 
Although P E is hands down the most widely used equity valuation ratio in the market  a relatively less used metric called EV EBITDA is often viewed as a better option as it offers a clearer image of a company s valuation and earnings potential  Unlike P E that solely considers a company s equity portion  EV EBITDA determines its total value 
EV EBITDA  also known as the enterprise multiple  is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  In a nutshell  it is the total value of a company 
The other element of the ratio  EBITDA gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows 
Usually  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could imply that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice versa 
However  unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates 
Moreover  P E can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA positive 
EV EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of companies that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  the ratio allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels 
However  EV EBITDA is not without its flaws and it alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  It varies across industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure requirements 
Therefore  instead of solely relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired outcome

141727,363242,PFG,PFG Vs  BX  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Financial   Investment Management sector have probably already heard of Principal Financial  PFG  and Blackstone Group  NYSE BX   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Principal Financial has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Blackstone Group has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell   This means that PFG s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
PFG currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 62  while BX has a forward P E of 13 80  We also note that PFG has a PEG ratio of 2 31  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  BX currently has a PEG ratio of 3 46 
Another notable valuation metric for PFG is its P B ratio of 1 29  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  BX has a P B of 1 69 
Based on these metrics and many more  PFG holds a Value grade of B  while BX has a Value grade of D 
PFG has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than BX  so it seems like value investors will conclude that PFG is the superior option right now ",2019-04-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pfg-vs-bx-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200404718,200404718

141730,363245,PFG,This Is Why Principal Financial  PFG  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Principal Financial in Focus
Based in Des Moines  Principal Financial  PFG  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 19 42   Currently paying a dividend of  0 54 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 4 09   In comparison  the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield is 2 98   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 92  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 16 is up 2 9  from last year  Principal Financial has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 12   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Principal Financial s payout ratio is 39   which means it paid out 39  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
PFG is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  5 56 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 0 54  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  PFG presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-04-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-principal-financial-pfg-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200405891,200405891

141763,363278,PFG,Is Principal Large Cap Growth I Institutional  PLGIX  A Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now ,opinion,Having trouble finding a Large Cap Growth fund  Principal Large Cap Growth I Institutional  is a potential starting point  PLGIX carries a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1  Strong Buy   which is based on nine forecasting factors like size  cost  and past performance ObjectivePLGIX is part of the Large Cap Growth section  and this segment boasts an array of other possible options  Large Cap Growth mutual funds purchase stakes in numerous large U S  companies that are expected to develop and grow at a faster rate than other large cap stocks  Companies are usually considered to be large cap if their market capitalization is over  10 billion History of Fund ManagerPLGIX finds itself in the Principal Financial Group  NASDAQ PFG  family  based out of Des Moines  IA  Principal Large Cap Growth I Institutional made its debut in November of 2000  and since then  PLGIX has accumulated about  2 21 billion in assets  per the most up to date date available  The fund is currently managed by Randy L  Welch who has been in charge of the fund since March of 2013 PerformanceObviously  what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers  This fund has delivered a 5 year annualized total return of 15 92   and is in the top third among its category peers  Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3 year annualized total return of 13 7   which places it in the top third during this time frame When looking at a fund s performance  it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns  The lower the standard deviation  the less volatility the fund experiences  PLGIX s standard deviation over the past three years is 12 33  compared to the category average of 9 08   Looking at the past 5 years  the fund s standard deviation is 11 41  compared to the category average of 8 95   This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half decade Risk FactorsIt s always important to be aware of the downsides to any future investment  so one should not discount the risks that come with this segment  PLGIX lost 50 94  in the most recent bear market and underperformed comparable funds by 1 92   This might suggest that the fund is a worse choice than its peers during a bear market Investors should not forget about beta  an important way to measure a mutual fund s risk compared to the market as a whole  PLGIX has a 5 year beta of 1 03  which means it is likely to be

141765,363280,PFG,Is Principal Small Cap Growth I Institutional  PGRTX  A Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now ,opinion,"There are plenty of choices in the Small Cap Growth category  but where should you start your research  Well  one fund that may not be worth investigating is Principal Small Cap Growth I Institutional  PGRTX   PGRTX bears a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4  Sell   which is based on nine forecasting factors like size  cost  and past performance 
Objective
The world of Small Cap Growth funds is an area filled with options  such as PGRTX  These funds tend to create their portfolios around stocks that sport large growth opportunities and market capitalization of less than  2 billion  The companies in these portfolios are usually on the smaller side  and are in up and coming industries and markets 
History of Fund Manager
Principal Financial Group  NASDAQ PFG  is based in Des Moines  IA  and is the manager of PGRTX  Principal Small Cap Growth I Institutional made its debut in September of 2002  and since then  PGRTX has accumulated about  152 43 million in assets  per the most up to date date available  Randy L  Welch is the fund s current manager and has held that role since June of 2009 
Performance
Of course  investors look for strong performance in funds  PGRTX has a 5 year annualized total return of 9 81  and is in the top third among its category peers  But if you are looking for a shorter time frame  it is also worth looking at its 3 year annualized total return of 13 5   which places it in the middle third during this time frame 
When looking at a fund s performance  it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns  The lower the standard deviation  the less volatility the fund experiences  Compared to the category average of 9 33   the standard deviation of PGRTX over the past three years is 15 13   The fund s standard deviation over the past 5 years is 15 26  compared to the category average of 9 15   This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half decade 
Risk Factors
One cannot ignore the volatility of this segment  however  as it is always important for investors to remember the downside to any potential investment  PGRTX lost 55 42  in the most recent bear market and outperformed its peer group by 2 29   This means that the fund could possibly be a better choice than its peers during a down market environment 
Investors should note that the fund has a 5 year beta of 1 17  so it is likely going to be more volatile than the market at large  Because alpha represents a portfolio s performance on a risk adjusted basis relative to a benchmark  which is the S P 500 in this case  one should pay attention to this metric as well  The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of  2 53  which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better than benchmark returns 
Holdings
Investigating the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise  This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology  as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach  For this particular fund  the focus is principally on equities that are traded in the United States 
Currently  this mutual fund is holding 97 3  stock in stocks  with an average market capitalization of  4 02 billion  The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors  Technology Other Industrial Cyclical Health Turnover is about 49   so those in charge of the fund make fewer trades than comparable funds Expenses
For investors  taking a closer look at cost related metrics is key  since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing  Competition is heating up in this space  and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart  all things being equal  In terms of fees  PGRTX is a no load fund  It has an expense ratio of 1 02  compared to the category average of 1 31   PGRTX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost 
This fund requires a minimum initial investment of  0  while there is no minimum for each subsequent investment 
Bottom Line
Overall  Principal Small Cap Growth I Institutional   PGRTX   has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank  and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance  worse downside risk  and lower fees  Principal Small Cap Growth I Institutional   PGRTX   looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now

5 Top Ranked Stocks with Impressive Sales Growth to Buy Now 

	Steady sales growth holds the key to survival in an ever changing and highly competitive business environment  But when it comes to picking stocks  investors often ignore sales growth as a reliable metric  This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum 

	Nevertheless  it s worth keeping in mind that when companies incur losses  albeit temporarily  they are valued based on their revenues  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance 
	Further  a company can improve earnings by resorting to expense control measures while maintaining stable revenues  However  sustainable bottom line growth invariably requires higher revenues 
	Hence  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can be an apt metric for stock valuation  The importance of this metric lies in the fact that management has limited scope to manipulate revenues unlike earnings 
	While sales growth provides investors an understanding of product demand and pricing power  it doesn t reflect whether the company is operating efficiently  A huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits 
	So  a consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales can be a more dependable strategy  Significant cash in hand and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments Choosing the Winning Stocks
	In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters 
	But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry   Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5    Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 
	Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening Principal Financial Group Inc   NYSE       provides an expansive range of retirement savings  investment and insurance products and services  This Des Moines  IA based company currently has long term expected EPS growth rate of 9 1  and carries a Zacks Rank  2 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ        based in Tarrytown  NY  is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  invents  develops  manufactures  and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions  It has long term expected earnings per share  EPS  growth rate of 21 1   The company sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see   Zebra Technologies Corporation  NASDAQ        based in Lincolnshire  IL  designs  manufactures  sells  and supports direct thermal and thermal transfer label printers  radio frequency identification printer encoders  dye sublimation card printers  real time locating solutions  related accessories  and support software  The company has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 9  and carries a Zacks Rank  2 United Technologies Corporation  NYSE       provides technology products and services to building systems and aerospace industries  This Farmington  CT based company has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 8 5  and a Zacks Rank  2

141922,363437,PFG,Is Principal Financial  PFG  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Principal Financial Group  Inc    NYSE PFG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Principal Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 88  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 61  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Principal Financial  current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 12 08  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Investment Management industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 27  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Principal Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 07  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Principal Financial stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Principal Financial has a P S ratio of about 1 58  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 20 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Principal Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes PFG a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Principal Financial is just 1 42  a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1 44  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  PFG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Principal Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives PFG a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and one lower  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and one downward revisions in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 0 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Principal Financial Group Inc Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePrincipal Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  despite a decent industry rank  top 24  out of more than 250 industries   a Zacks Rank  3  makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Investment Management sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it

141998,363513,PFG,The Week Ahead  Will A More Aggressive Fed Derail The Stock Rally ,opinion,"The economic calendar is light until the Friday employment report  Most of the punditry are still digesting the more aggressive talk in the recent speeches from Fed participants  With many observers expecting a correction and looking for a catalyst  pundits will be asking 

Will a more aggressive Fed derail the rally in stocks 

Personal Notes

I have a vacation coming in a couple of weeks  I will not write WTWA next weekend  and possibly not the weekend after that  I will still be following the markets and email  I will join in if it seems needed  The Stock Exchange group is supposed to keep working 

Last Week

Last week the news was mostly positive  and stocks responded again 

Theme Recap

In my last WTWA  a discussion about whether stock prices had lost touch with reality  That was a good guess  There was plenty of talk about market valuation  Those bearish also questioned the lack of specifics in the Presidential Address to Congress   which had a greater immediate effect that the annual Buffett letter 

The Story in One Chart

I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this  via Jill Mislinski  She notes yet another record close based on the week s gain of 0 67   We can also see the gap opening after the Presidential Address to Congress 



The rally story is even clearer in this chart  when begins before the election 



Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post for several more charts providing long term perspective  including the size and frequency of drawdowns 

The News

Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 

This week s news was mostly positive 

The Good

Durable goods orders increased 1 8  after last month s decline  Most of the increase was from the volatile transportation sector  but it was still a welcome boost 
Earnings news was positive   emphasizes the favorable trend in estimate revisions  reports that the earnings and revenue beat rates are slightly lower  but outlook is stronger  Here is an interesting chart of surprises by sector 



Investor sentiment turned more bearish  The AAII reports that sentiment is within historic ranges  but off recent highs  This is unusual given past behavior in a rising market  I score it as  good  since most regard it as a contrary indicator 
Mortgage delinquency rate falls below 1   the lowest since June  2008     
ISM Non Manufacturing rose to 57 6  from 56 5   The employment index also moved higher  February was stronger than January 
ISM manufacturing increased to 57 7 beating expectations and showing a solid increase over last month s 56 1  The Chicago regional survey was also very strong 
Rail traffic in February was 4 2  higher than a year ago  Steven Hansen takes the look at the data we have come to expect  including various moving averages and trends  Read the   but this chart captures some key points  especially the improvement over the last two years 



Consumer confidence spiked to 114 8  a post recession high  Briefing com covers this series 



Initial jobless claims rose slightly on the week  but dropped to the lowest level since 1973 on the widely followed four week moving average     
President Trump s speech was very well received  Most preview articles mistakenly emphasized the need for specifics  Commentators right after the speech did the same   did not provide advice on what to go out and trade right after the speech  Instead  I drew upon experience and the current policy environment to highlight the key element   the potential for compromise  This chart shows the dramatic shift in this Trump presentation  more like SOTU speeches than nearly anything else he has done    





The Bad

Construction spending fell 1  
Money supply is drifting to the neutral range   possibly even tilting negative      Despite complaints about Fed policy  this is a possible economic drag 
Pending home sales fell 2 8  and December was revised lower 
Debt Limit will be reached in mid March  Even the extraordinary efforts will be exhausted in September or October  Will this play out any better with a GOP President and Congress   has a good story on this issue 

The Ugly

My concern about hacking and threats to the Internet s weak spots continues   is not about events from last week  but is just as relevant  Perhaps even more so with the Barron s cover story on robots 

The article explains that even rather unsophisticated attacks can work on the 6 4 billion Internet of Things devices in use  Little is being done to protect on this front 

The Silver Bullet

I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  No award this week  Nominations are welcome  Potential award winners can find daily inspiration at several websites 
The Week Ahead

We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 

The Calendar

We have a moderate week for economic data  featuring the employment report on Friday 

The  A  List

Employment situation  F   Despite     100K sampling error and multiple revisions  this is seen as most important data
ADP private employment  W   Good independent alternative to the BLS numbers
Initial jobless claims  Th   Not the same time period as the Friday report 

The  B  List

Trade balance  T   Attracting more interest in the Trump era
Wholesale inventories  W   Desired or undesired  That is always the question 
Factory orders  M   January data  Modest gain expected 
Crude inventories  Th   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 

FedSpeak will be light and earnings season is ending  Employment will be the big story 

Next Week s Theme


The punditry  especially those who explain the stronger stock market as enthusiasm for Trump policies  is even more amazed than a week ago  To them it seemed that the lack of specifics in Tuesday s Trump speech should have provided a dose of reality 

Many will now turn to the most common explanation for strong stocks  the ever popular Fed theory  With several speeches emphasizing that the March FOMC meeting is  in play  for an increase  interest rate markets are adjusting to the probability of three rate hikes in 2017 

Much of the commentary next week will raise the question 

Will a more aggressive Fed spark a stock market correction 

Some might add  finally  

The question actually has two parts 

Will the Fed increase rates at a pace greater than expectations 
Will this lead to a correction 

Friday s employment report will have special significance for those with these fears  It will be the final and most important piece of evidence for the FOMC decision 

Both questions have a bullish and bearish side 

An increased pace of Fed rate hikes was the consensus at week s end      Leading Fed observer  at the important Dudley speech  before Yellen  was not so decisive 
Bears invoke the hoary adage   three steps and a stumble       As you review the evidence  you might consider the starting point for interest rates  as well as the yield curve  More constructively   the frequency  often  and severity  moderate  of corrections 



What does this all mean for investors  As usual  I ll have a few ideas of my own in today s  Final Thought

Final Thoughts


Your investment conclusions are strongly influenced by your preconceptions and current position  Last week I had an especially good summary of the two main themes  If it matters  Warren Buffett went on TV the day after I wrote this  expressing a similar opinion about stock valuations 

Stock values are attractive
Emphasis on earnings expectations and forecasts
Belief in relative valuations   comparing stock expected performance  with bonds  real estate  gold  etc 
Confidence that a recession is not imminent 
Stocks are over valued
Emphasis on trailing earnings
Analysis based partially on 19th century data
Belief that valuation is absolute  A sector s value is independent of the alternatives
Focus on headline risk   uncertainty  world events  etc 


Your choice of world view controls how you interpret fresh news  and your key investment decisions  If you are getting it wrong  you need an epiphany 

The market is rising despite the lack of specifics in the Trump plan and the realization that there will be delays in his proposals   even if he can sell them to Congress  The reason is straightforward 

The economy has been getting better in the post election period  Dr  Ed Yardeni  declares that   He is thinking globally  noting that worldwide improvement cannot be linked to the U S  election 

 the entire array of factors  including what to worry about 

Briefing com s   worth a paid subscription  explores the possible causal relationships  Here is a key chart 



The Fed rate increases will be consistent with a stronger economy  an environment that implies solid growth in earnings   why higher rates are not a threat in the current market 


It s very likely we re still in the early stages of more of the same  Interest rates are going to be rising  probably by more than the market currently expects  because the outlook for the economy is improving and inflation is at the high end of the Fed s target range  yet interest rates are still relatively low because of the market s willingness to pay up for safety and that won t persist for much longer  Stocks are going to be buoyed by improving earnings and the prospect of stronger economic growth  Interest rates will be moving higher because of stronger growth higher rates are not yet a threat to growth  The Fed is still a long way from raising rates by enough to threaten growth  If the FOMC hikes rates in two weeks it won t be a tightening  it will be a sensible reaction to stronger growth and improved confidence 


Worries 

Sure  If the Fed gets behind on inflation and accelerates rate increases  even though the economy is sluggish  it will be an early sign of an impending recession  I am watching this closely  and so should you

142029,363544,PFG,Will Expected Rate Hike Heal Insurers  Cat Loss Wound ,opinion,"The hawkish statement coming from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen at the recent Jackson Hole symposium raised the odds of a rate hike in the near term  Yellen commented on the strength of the economy and in the labor market Not only Yellen  other key Fed officials including her deputy  Vice Chairman Stanley Fisher  also sounded bullish on increasing interest rates The major factors that signal economic growth   consumer outlays and the job market   are both shaping up strongly  Recent data on these fronts have put to rest the concern of economic weakness hovering in the first half of the year  Data from Labor Department revealed that July s nonfarm payroll outperformed the analysts  expectation by 255 000 job additions  following the upwardly revised 292 000 jobs created in June Yellen said   In light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation  I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months   This gives a clear signal that the much awaited rate hike is on its way Also Stanley Fischer said that the U S  central bank was close to hitting its target of 2  inflation and full employment Key officials are hinting at a rate hike action in the September meeting  Moreover  if the August jobs  data reveals 180 000 or more additions  the case for the rate hike will become firmer Among others  one of the sectors expected to gain from an interest rate hike is insurance Glimmer of Hope for Insurers After Heavy Cat LossThe Fed s campaign to boost the economy by keeping interest rates low squeezed profits of insurers  The insurance industry directly stands to gain from high interest rates  Insurers  top line consists primarily of two components   premium earned from customers and net investment income  which is generated from the float  premium collected which would be used in paying out claims in future   invested by insurance companies  Over the past decade  insurers have witnessed a dent in their top line because of low investment income caused by a decline in investment yield from low interest rates  As the Fed raises the key rate  bonds yields will increase across the board  Insurers can then invest their premium and receive higher yields  More investment income will then be generated  which will boost profits In order to fight the low interest rate  companies divested and stopped selling rate sensitive products such as long term care policies  Some of the companies also divested businesses that were rate sensitive Nevertheless  this anticipated rate hike will bring solace to the industry which has suffered high catastrophe loss this year  As per Munich RE  U S  economic losses caused by natural catastrophes  hail storms in Texas  earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador  floods in Europe and wildfires in Fort McMurray in Canada  in the first half of 2016 were   17 billion compared with  12 billion in the same period last year  Of the loss incurred this year   11 billion was insured compared with  8 billion of insured losses in the first half of 2015  Earnings for a number of players in the industry saw a dent from the high cat loss activity in the first half of 2016  Many of the insurers also have come up with the preliminary estimates for cat loss from for the month of July as well  While the cat losses have drained the bottomline earnings for the sector the rise in interest rate will help top line growth in the form of increased investment income

	Chicago  IL   September 06  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include   Principal Financial Group Inc  NYSE PFG       L Brands Inc  NYSE LB      Macy s  Inc       and Magna International Inc     

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

4 Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy in September

	Fed officials have made much hue and cry about the possibility of a rate hike in September  However  weak factory sector data have diminished chances of the same  Manufacturing activity showed a slowdown in August  ahead of the much awaited August jobs data release  Also  we are into that part of the year when returns have been historically low  while stocks remain pretty pricey  The future is also cast into uncertainty  thanks to the upcoming presidential elections 

	Such as stalemate in interest rate hikes along with volatility in the broader markets calls for investing in blue chip dividend stocks  Such stocks have tremendous financial strength and are not affected by market vagaries 

Weak Manufacturing Wanes Odds of Rate Hike

	According to the Institute for Supply Management  its manufacturing index dropped to 49 4 in August from 52 6 last month  Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing activity  In fact  the index fell below that level for the first time since February  Other key gauges on new orders  production and employment were also below the 50  mark  read more     

	The productivity of the American business and workers also fell 0 6  in the second quarter instead of 0 5   according to the revised government figure  U S  companies failed to increase productivity despite generating plenty of jobs 

	In the wake of this scenario  odds of a September rate hike fell to a one in four as a risk averse Fed is more likely to wait for further information before hiking rates  Last Friday  chances of a rate hike had risen to one in three following Fed Chair Janet Yellen s hawkish tone at the Jackson Hole economic symposium 

Treasury Yields Erase Increase

	Diminishing chances of a rate hike led to increase in bond prices since the fixed interest and principal payments stated in the bond will tend to become less attractive  As bond prices rose  yields on such bonds declined  The 10 year Treasury note ended at 1 570  on Sep 1  after climbing above 1 6  for the first time this week  The Treasury market has been choppy for quite some time now and the 10 year Treasury yield has stuck within a range of 1 5  to 1 6  

	The yield on the 2 year Treasury note  which is more sensitive to rate hike expectations  also lost 0 4 basis points to 0 790   In the meantime  amid low and even negative yields in Europe and Japan  the U S  yields need more than just upbeat jobs report to scale higher  Further guidance from Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank may stand in good stead for them  read more    

	With bonds providing little yields  income seeking investors will turn to dividend paying stocks for reliable returns  read more     

September  Historically Awful

	The stock market has just entered the worst month this year  as far as historical data is considered  with both the S P 500 and the Dow usually closing in the negative  September s terrible record is just not limited to two or three years  instead stocks have been persistently posting unimpressive performance  with the month s average turning out to be discouraging in all but one of the dozen decades since the late 1800s 

	Moreover  low trading volumes prevalent in the market indicate a correction going ahead  Add to this the CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX  trading below 20  and we all know that the market is headed for a rough patch since low volatility often precedes a sell off  read more     

	Thanks to this bearish scenario  dividend stocks are presently quite attractive bets  Companies that consistently pay dividends are in a better position to brave market downturns  Also  they are expected to safeguard investors against the impending uncertainty that is likely to aggravate in the light of the U S  presidential elections in November  read more     

4 Hot Blue Chip Dividend Stocks

	Blue chip dividend stocks boast solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals  and are unperturbed by market turbulence  Such stocks are deemed to be much safer and more durable than an average stock  Most of these companies raise their dividends for many years as well and are typically large in size  e g  market caps exceeding  10 billion   Needless to say  the possibility of a rate hike ebbing in the near term has already made them quite tempting 

	We have selected four blue chip dividend stocks that boast a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a dividend yield of over 2   The search was also narrowed down with a  of  A  or  B   Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners 

Principal Financial Group Inc       provides retirement  asset management  and insurance products and services to businesses  individuals  and institutional clients worldwide including the U S  Principal Financial has a VGM score of  B   The company has a dividend yield of 3 3   Principal Financial s 5 year historical dividend growth rate is 23 7   read more     

L Brands Inc    operates as a specialty retailer of women s intimate and other apparel  beauty and personal care products  and accessories  L Brands has a VGM score of  B   The company has a dividend yield of 3 2   L Brands  5 year historical dividend growth rate is 24 5   read more     

Macy s  Inc      together with its subsidiaries  operates stores  websites  and mobile applications in the United States  The company has a VGM score of  A   Macy s has a dividend yield of 4 2   and a 5 year historical dividend growth rate of 30   read more

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks with Amazingly Low EV EBITDA Ratios to Buy Now 

Many investors tend to get fixated on the price to earnings  P E  strategy while seeking stocks that are trading at attractive prices  Without doubt  P E is the most popular multiple used by investors for working out the fair market value of a stock  But even this widely used valuation metric is not devoid of limitations 

Why EV EBITDA is a Better Approach 
	While P E is the most popular valuation metric  a more complicated multiple called EV EBITDA works even better  Often considered a better alternative to P E  it gives the true picture of a company s valuation and its earning potential and has a more complete approach to valuation  While P E just considers a firm s equity portion  EV EBITDA determines its total value 
	Also known as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   The first constituent of the ratio  EV  is a firm s market capitalization plus the market value of its debt and preferred equity minus cash 
	The other constituent  EBITDA  gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows 
	Typically  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is undervalued 
	Unlike the P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes debt on a company s balance sheet into account  Due to this reason  it is typically used to value potential acquisition targets  The ratio shows the amount of debt that the acquirer has to bear  Stocks flaunting a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates 
	Another key downside of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  Moreover  a company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is harder to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front 
	EV EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of companies that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels 
	However  EV EBITDA is also not without its shortcomings and it alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and its future performance  The multiple varies across industries  a high growth industry typically has higher multiple  and is generally not appropriate for comparing stocks in different industries due to their diverse capital requirements 

Thus  instead of solely banking on EV EBITDA  you can club it with other key ratios in your stock investment toolkit such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to uncover bargain stocks Screening Criteria
	Here are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median   A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median   The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 
	Here are five of the nine stocks that passed the screen Amkor Technology  Inc     is a leading provider of semiconductor packaging and test services  Moreover  the company is one of the leading developers of advanced semiconductor packaging and test technology  This Zacks Rank  1 stock has expected year over year earnings growth of 29 4  for 2016 and 40 9  for 2017 Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp     is one of the leading semiconductor foundries in the world and the largest and most advanced foundry in Mainland China  This Zacks Rank  2 company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of around 53 9  over the trailing four quarters Principal Financial Group Inc      is a leading provider of retirement savings  investment and insurance products and services  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 6 4  for 3 to 5 years  You can see   Insight Enterprises Inc     is a global direct marketer of brand name computers  hardware and software  The company markets to small and medium sized businesses  through a combination of a strong outbound telemarketing sales force  electronic commerce  electronic marketing and direct mail catalogs  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has expected year over year earnings growth of 14 9  for 2016 Comfort Systems USA Inc     is a national provider of comprehensive heating  ventilation and air conditioning installation  maintenance  repair and replacement services  This Zacks Rank  2 company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of around 28 2  over the trailing four quarters

	No doubt P E enjoys great popularity among value inventors  But a more complicated and less used metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings potential 
	EV EBITDA is the enterprise value   EV   of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization   EBITDA    EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Essentially  it is the entire value of a company 
	EBITDA  the other component of the ratio  gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows 
	Usually  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could imply that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice versa 
	Also referred to as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA takes a more complete approach to valuation  It takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio ignores  This is the reason why EV EBITDA is typically used to value potential acquisition targets  It shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to bear  Stocks boasting a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates 
	Another flaw of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  Moreover  a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the contrary  EV EBITDA is less susceptible to manipulation and can also be used to value firms that have negative net earnings but are positive at the EBITDA level 
	EV EBITDA also determines the total value of a company while P E solely considers its equity portion  EV EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of companies with highly leveraged balance sheets and substantial depreciation and amortization expenses  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt 
	However  EV EBITDA is too not devoid of drawbacks  The ratio varies across industries  a high growth industry typically has higher multiple  and is usually not appropriate for comparing stocks in different industries due to their diverse capital expenditure requirements 

	So  instead of solely banking on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired outcome Screening Criteria
	Here are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median   A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median   This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median   A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median   The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median   This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000   The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5   This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2   No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market    of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 
	Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen Amkor Technology  Inc     is a leading provider of semiconductor packaging and test services  Moreover  the company is one of the leading developers of advanced semiconductor packaging and test technology  This Zacks Rank  1 stock has expected year over year earnings growth of 29 4  for 2016 and 40 9  for 2017 Comfort Systems USA Inc     is a national provider of comprehensive heating  ventilation and air conditioning installation  maintenance  repair and replacement services  This Zacks Rank  2 company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of around 28 2  over the trailing four quarters Celestica Inc     is one of the largest electronics manufacturing services company in the world  serving the computer  and communications sectors  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has expected year over year earnings growth of 26 5  for 2016 and 3 5  for 2017 OFG Bancorp    is a financial holding company that conducts its business activities through its subsidiaries  primarily in Puerto Rico  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has expected year over year earnings growth of a whopping 379 7  for 2016 Principal Financial Group Inc     is a leading provider of retirement savings  investment and insurance products and services  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 6 5  for 3 to 5 years

142098,363613,PFG,Are The Bears Coming Out Of Hibernation  ,opinion,"The traders of the CME Group have always been a lively bunch  When the markets are moving they are too  but after the credit crisis  MF Global and Principal Financial Group Inc  NYSE PFG  there is another crisis brewing this summer 
There is no comparison to what s going on in the S P right now  In the past I made references to the similarities to the runs up before the 1987 crash and the 1999 2000 tech bubble  but the current rally does not resemble either 

In fact  I don t think there has ever been a time that the stock market has gone up so much with so little pullback  One aspect of the push higher over the last few weeks has been the low volume  but the daily trading ranges are shrinking too  Yesterday  despite closing down only 9 8 handles the ESU14 sold off 20 25 handles from high to low  and when it did  the bears came out of hibernation 
1  Drops
Yesterday the Dow saw its largest drop in a month  down  0 70   The Dow was up 32 5 points at its high and down 119 points on the close 
The S P fell 12 63 points  or  0 60   The S P futures made an all time new high of 1960 00 midmorning and then reversed lower  The S P has now gone 47 sessions without a 1  up or down move  the longest streak since 1995 
According to MKM Partners  in the last 20 years there has only been one time that the S P has traded in a narrower range than it did on last Friday s June quadruple witching  Last Friday s was the 2nd lowest at 0 24  and the lowest was set back on Dec  30  2013  The NASDAQ Composite lost 18 32 points or  0 40  down to 43 50 36 and the Russell 2000 closed down 1  for the second session in a row 
Despite the drop and all the clamoring about another selloff  it has been our feeling that after so many days up in the last 3 weeks  the march to the end of Q2 would not go without a little downside  That said  we think some stocks will be marked up as we head into T 3 and the end of the quarter rebalance 
The Asian and European markets closed lower across the board  Today s economic schedule starts with MBA purchase applications  durable goods orders  GDP  corporate profits  PMI services flash  EIA petroleum status report  5 year note auction and earnings from Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY   General Mills  NYSE GIS   Monsanto  NYSE MON   and Barnes   Noble  NYSE BKS  
Asia and Europe Down Across the Board
Our view  The E mini S P 500 futures  CME ESU14  took out Sunday night s new high by 1 tick  After making the high the ESU chopped around the 1958 00 1958 50 level and eventually sold off through 1957 down and then down to support at the 1953 00 area  After breaking through the 1950 level it was all sell stops and sell programs down to the low of the day 
As of today there are 4 trading days left in the quarter  As we go into today and Friday you can t forget about T 3 
Our view was right on yesterday  buy the lower open and sell the rally  Today s view is to buy the early weakness and sell the rallies in the first part of the day but to start looking for the quarter end bounce 
Turn Around Tuesday Gets A Spanking
