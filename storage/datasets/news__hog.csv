call  Joining me this morning are President and CEO Matt Levatich  and CFO John Olin  Matt  let s get started Matt Levatich    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Shannon  and good morning  everybody  We re pleased that our fourth quarter and full year performance was in line with our expectations and indicates increased business stability  driven by the tremendous efforts of our employees and dealers to inspire riding and navigate the challenges of our dynamic business environment  During 2019  we significantly advanced our More Roads plan  investing  building capabilities and achieving milestones  keeping us on track to return to significant growth in 2021  we have a lot to be proud of and much to look forward to  More Roads is an important aspect of the total company transformation journey that has been under way for the better part of a decade  We began this transformation with a focus on manufacturing  that includes our recent multiyear manufacturing optimization initiative anchored by the consolidation of our motorcycle assembly plant in Kansas City into our expanded plant in York  The work on this initiative is nearly complete  and we expect annual ongoing savings of approximately  70 million in 2021  John will delve into this more later  We ve also transformed product development  allowing us to deliver an innovation led approach with a 30  faster time to market  dramatically increasing our capacity and capability to broaden our product portfolio to reach and inspire more people  This includes electric products  motorcycles in new segments and sizes and even e bicycles  Our front foot approach to innovation is also helping to strengthen our leadership in the Touring and Cruisers segments  leading to a historically high 72 4  market share of those segments in the U S   up 2 5 percentage points over 2018  We ve delivered industry first innovations like touring traction control with advanced ABS and H D Connect  seamlessly linking rider and motorcycle  We re also leading the electrification of motorcycles with class leading products developed in conjunction with our new team and our EV development center  LiveWire labs in Silicon Valley  Our innovation and growth pursuits under More Roads have also stimulated smart targeted acquisitions like StaCyc  and new collaborations like QJ in China  All of this transformation investment and effort has allowed us to emerge with more flexible  responsive and efficient product processes from design to build  processes we continue to improve and evolve with the changing needs of our customers  We are now well into the final transformation phase  a comprehensive overhaul of our marketing and go to market capabilities to become a customer creation company  driving demand and delivering growth by shaping our place in markets around the globe  We are becoming a company that excels and exists to not only build great bikes  but to build riders  This focuses us beyond simply what someone is riding to why people ride  and how we can use our insights to deliver targeted experiences and increase commitment to riding  We re shifting our mindset and intentionally guiding and nurturing our culture to crave agility with deeper skills and capabilities that are oriented toward customer creation  We ve challenged the structure across the company  adding new talent and organizing resources to swiftly move in these new directions  We plan to continue new growth pursuits  including new business models  targeted acquisitions and new collaborations  Our More Roads milestones for this year include some very heavy lifting in new product delivery  We ll again raise the bar and reach impact and access when we launch our first new middleweight motorcycles  the Bronx Streetfighter  and our Pan America Adventure Touring models  We also plan to launch a new small displacement motorcycle in China and expand outside of motorcycles with the launch of Harley Davidson e bicycles  Our efforts are amplifying the incredible power of our brand and leveraging and expanding our expertise to deliver more for our customers  Our distribution model also includes more regional distribution centers  more access points and an even stronger global dealer network  Evidence of the transformation is also appearing in how we measure performance  Our 2020 guidance replaces heavyweight unit shipments with revenue as a primary performance measure  Revenue better reflects our comprehensive efforts to amplify our brand and foster a customer creation culture  one that builds committed riders  Revenue growth  driven by an expanded product portfolio  a fresh apparel approach and a pipeline of innovative new services that inspire  develop and engage people to ride  We talked about this shift last quarter when we adjusted our long term international growth objective from measuring percent of motorcycle volume to measuring percent of HDMC revenue  At that time  we also sharpened and intensified our U S  growth objective for 2027  challenging ourselves to expand the total pool of U S  riders by adding more riders and retaining more riders each year  During 2019  we saw progress in the right direction  We finished 2019 with 3 1 million Harley Davidson riders in the U S   55 000 more total riders than in 2018  During the year  527 000 riders joined the Harley Davidson brand  that s almost 25 000 more than joined Harley Davidson in 2018  The number of people who joined Harley Davidson in 2019 demonstrates brand power and our improving capabilities  However  we know more is needed to reach our objective  which reinforces the criticality of our expanded focus and efforts to make riding matter more to more people  Rider migration insights we have tell us  we need to bring people in  build their confidence and capability  and keep them riding through the critical first years of their riding journey  We are testing and developing specific programs and actions right now that nurture new riders and inspire and develop all riders to continue riding with us  We know we must continue improving and growing the number of joiners and improve retention rates to end 2027 with four million riders in the United States  And this is the right challenge at the right time to drive continued strengthening of our customer creation capabilities as the final chapter of our decade long transformation as a company  We set out to accomplish a lot in 2019 and we did what we said we would do demonstrating our accelerated efforts to achieve More Roads growth and our long term objectives  To sum it up  in 2019  we asserted our leadership in the electrification of motorcycles with the launch of LiveWire  our first electric motorcycle  and IRONe for kids  Our commitment to leading in the electrification of motorcycles includes broad EV portfolio development  driven by the talent and capability of our EV product development team that expanded significantly in 2019  We launched high impact new models and delivered advanced technology to our class leading model year 2020 motorcycles to make the ride even better  We also expanded our Thailand plant to serve the ASEAN markets  increasing customer access with more competitive retail prices  Our global e commerce and digital capabilities were improved and expanded  broadening exposure and access to our products  In 2019  75  of people who purchased Harley products on Amazon were new to Harley Davidson  Finally  we advanced good to great dealers  making progress toward our customer experience and conversion targets  The dealers who participated in our U S  dealer operations consulting engagements on average saw nearly a 6  increase in motorcycle retail sales over dealers not yet in the program  Outside the U S   we began implementing stronger dealer initiatives in the second half of the year  which helped retail sales in developed markets improved markedly  finishing up year over year in the second half  We re on track with the expectations we outlined at the start of the More Roads plan  making the investments that will set us up for the growth targets we expect to achieve in 2021 and beyond  Two years in  our new products  stronger dealers broader access and amplified brand efforts are building and demonstrating key skills and capabilities  And while competition and challenges are robust  we have risen to the task along the way  competing on our merits and delivering shareholder value  while we navigate the current environment and advance our strategy  We re driving stability in the business  underscored by our ability to mitigate tariff impact  shift away for value depleting sales incentives and leverage HDFS as an important strategic asset to enable business performance  Harley Davidson is 117 years strong  but it is far from the company it was before the downturn  and it is not the same company it was even three years ago  We ve transformed nearly every aspect of how we do our work  And while we have more to do in our More Roads quest to firmly establish customer creation prowess  we remain crystal clear that riding is and has always been what it s all about  We aim to make riding matter more to more people and build committed riders  From where we stand today  our return to growth is not off in the distance  it s right around the corner  and 2020 is our pivotal year  I m looking ahead  and I feel good about the hard work that has laid our foundation for the year that we have ahead of us and the journey that we are on for the long term  Thank you for continuing to drive with us  And now I ll turn it over to John to discuss the financial results of the quarter and the full year and what we see ahead  John John Olin    Chief Financial Officer Thanks  Matt  In the fourth quarter  we were pleased with our earnings and continue tempering in our U S  retail sales declines  During the quarter  and throughout 2019  we made significant progress against our More Roads to Harley Davidson plan  The summary of our Q4 results is on Slide 10  In the fourth quarter  Motorcycle segment operating loss improved  driven by lower year over year SG A and the favorable impact of our manufacturing optimization initiative  partially offset by lower shipments  higher year over year tariffs and unfavorable mix  Financial Services operating income was down 7   Consolidated net income was up versus prior year  Earnings per share for the quarter was  0 09  When excluding restructuring plan costs and the impact of recent EU and China tariffs  adjusted EPS was  0 20  We remain focused and disciplined on inventory management  aggressively managing costs  generating cash from operations and delivering strong shareholder returns over the long term  On Slide 11  worldwide retail sales of new Harley Davidson motorcycles in the fourth quarter were down 1 4  versus prior year  which represents a significant improvement in the rate of decline versus last year s fourth quarter  which was down 6 7   In the U S   Q4 retail sales were down 3 1  versus prior year  which represents an improvement in the rate of decline over recent quarters  Harley Davidson s fourth quarter retail sales benefited from the year over year tempering of the industry s retail sales rate of decline and strong H D market share gains  International retail sales were up 0 5  during the quarter  Emerging markets retail sales continue to increase  while developed market retail sales were down slightly  After a challenging second quarter  we regained momentum in the third and fourth quarters as we continue to execute our stronger dealer programs  invested in amplifying the brand through increased marketing  introduced our model year 2020 bikes and aggressively managed the supply of motorcycles into the dealer network  We expect continued headwinds in 2020 in the U S  and developed international markets  We expect to overcome these market challenges by focusing on building committed riders and executing our More Roads to Harley Davidson plan  We believe that we have a strong plan for the future  and we are executing with great urgency  Now let s take a closer look at the U S  on Slide 12  During the fourth quarter  Harley Davidson s retail sales were down 3 1  versus prior year behind improving retail sales performance and strong H D market share gains  We were pleased to see the continued tempering of our retail sales rate as the fourth quarter represented the lowest rate of decline in the U S  over the last 12 quarters  Q4 retail sales for the industry were down 5 6   This rate of decline was significantly better than 2018 s fourth quarter decline  but was sequentially higher than Q3 of 2019  On a full year basis  the rate of industry decline has improved significantly from down 8 7  in 2018 to down 4 1  in 2019  On a full year basis  Harley Davidson s retail sales decline of 5 2  was improved over 2018 s decline of 10 2   We believe that this year over year improvement in the rate of decline was driven by improved industry performance  our focus on stronger dealers and increased marketing investment  During the quarter  Harley Davidson s market share of new bike registrations was 50 4   up 1 0 percentage points  despite the continued unfavorable mix shift to segments in which we do not currently compete  but will begin competing in by the end of this year as we execute our More Roads plan  In our segments  Touring and Cruiser  our Q4 market share was very strong  up 3 9 percentage points  We tightly managed the shipments of new bikes into the dealer network in the quarter  This resulted in quarter end U S  retail inventory decreasing approximately 1 500 motorcycles versus prior year  We believe this market discipline is important in maintaining customer and dealer value and will  ultimately  result in stronger retail sales of new motorcycles  On Slide 13  fourth quarter international retail sales were up 0 5  behind growth in our emerging markets offset by slight declines in our developed markets  Retail sales in emerging markets were up 2 2  during the quarter versus prior year  The sales increases were led by growth in our ASEAN markets and in China  Strong growth in these markets was partially offset by soft sales in India  Retail sales in developed markets were down 0 5  during the quarter  Our developed markets experienced strength in Japan  Southern Europe and Australia  offset by softness in Canada and Northern Europe  Our full year market share in Europe was 8 9   down 1 4 percentage points versus prior year  Our market share was adversely impacted by lapping last year s strong Softail results and by lower sales of our street motorcycles as a result of the Street recall  The detail on our More Roads plan reinforces our confidence in  and commitment to  the great potential that the international markets offer to Harley Davidson  Our plan supports the strength of our brand  products and distribution to drive sustainable growth in international markets  On Slide 14  wholesale motorcycle shipments in Q4 were down 7  and roughly at the midpoint of our guidance  Overall family mix shifted from Touring to Cruiser motorcycles versus last year s fourth quarter  On Slide 15  Q4 revenue for the Motorcycles segment was down 8 5   behind 7  decrease in motorcycle shipments  Average motorcycle revenue per bike was down  504  driven by less rich product mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange  partially offset by higher year over year pricing  On Slide 16  gross margin in Q4 was down as a result of lower shipments  a less rich product mix  unfavorable currency and higher manufacturing expense  Q4 product mix was unfavorable by  9 7 million  driven by a shift in family mix  Q4 gross margin was adversely impacted by  8 0 million of unfavorable currency  driven by a stronger U S  dollar and lapping 2018 hedge gains  In Q4  manufacturing expense was unfavorably impacted by lower absorption on lower production and shipments  along with increased year over year tariffs  largely offset by savings of  15 5 million resulting from the implementation of our new manufacturing optimization initiative  On Slide 17  operating margin as a percent of revenue for Q4 improved compared to last year  driven by favorable SG A and restructuring expenses  partially offset by lower gross margin  SG A was significantly lower than prior year as we lap charges related to recalls  and as we continue to aggressively manage costs and investing  while investing in increased marketing and our More Roads plan  Restructuring charges totaled  0 7 million in the fourth quarter  favorable to prior year by  18 7 million  Profitability and strong cash flow remain a key focus  It is our objective to further leverage and build our capabilities to continue to drive profit  cash flow and top quartile motor company ROIC  Financial Services segment fourth quarter operating income  shown on Slide 18  was  58 9 million  down 7  compared to the prior year  Net interest income was up  4 2 million due to higher year over year receivables and favorable interest rate yields  partially offset by higher interest expense  The provision for retail motorcycle loan losses was  4 0 million  unfavorable in Q4  driven by  2 3 million of higher credit losses and increase in our credit reserves  Operating expenses were up versus prior year due  in part  to higher depreciation as a result of our investment in a new loan management system  which was implemented in January 2019  HDFS  operational results are on Slide 19  Q4 retail originations were down 5 9  versus prior year  driven by lower new bike sales  HDFS  market share remained very strong at 63 7   At the end of the quarter  there was  363 2 million of cash and cash equivalents at HDFS and  1 77 billion of liquidity available through bank credit and conduit facilities  During Q4  HDFS raised EUR 600 million in an MTN  and paid a dividend of  40 million to Harley Davidson  Inc  On Slide 20  both our 30 day plus delinquency and credit loss results were up versus prior year  despite having moved past start up efficiencies resulting from the implementation of our new loan management system  The 30 day delinquency rate for retail motorcycle loans receivable  loan receivables on balance sheet at year end was 4 39  or 27 basis points higher than 2018  The annual retail credit loss rate for receivables on balance sheet was 2   The 2019 full year loss rate increased 24 basis points  primarily due to the LMS impact in the first three quarters of 2019  Q4 s loss rate was up 10 basis points  driven primarily by two factors  first driver relates to our strategic efforts to build riders  which included programs such as First Time Buyer and dealer paid no money down  While some of these loans may increase delinquency and credit loss metrics  they re prudently underwritten  and we expect the increased revenue from these programs to more than offset the higher expected risk  The second driver of Q4 s increased loss rate is softer motorcycle prices at auction  The remaining Harley Davidson  Inc  financial results are summarized on Slide 21  Our year end cash and marketable securities balance was  833 9 million  Full year operating cash flow of  868 3 million was down versus last year  driven by higher working capital and lower net income  Regarding liquidity  the company has and intends to continue to maintain a minimum of 12 months of projected liquidity needs in cash and or committed credit facilities  We believe the charts on Slide 22 demonstrates that over time  we are a leader in ROIC at the motor company and return on equity at HDFS  and we are a clear leader in our ability to generate and return cash to our shareholders  One of the five objectives guiding our business strategy and execution through 2027 is to deliver superior return on invested capital as measured by motor company ROIC in the top quartile of the S P 500  and by best in class returns on equity at HDFS  Slide 23 illustrates our recent history of returning cash to our shareholders  In the fourth quarter of 2019  we paid a dividend of  0 375 per share and repurchased 87 7 million    I m sorry   78 7 million of our stock  Driving superior value for our stakeholders is a top priority  We have a robust and disciplined process for our investment decisions  After investing in our business  we intend to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increasing dividends and share repurchases  Slide 24 is the summary of our multiyear manufacturing optimization  Full year results came in favorable to our expectations  with total realized savings of  32 2 million and an incurred cost of  43 0 million in 2019  As of the end of the fourth quarter  our investment in manufacturing optimization is largely compete    complete  We continue to expect annual ongoing savings of  65 million to  75 million after 2020  Moving on to our 2020 full year guidance on Slide 25  In 2020  we expect Motorcycle segment revenue to be approximately  4 53 billion to  4 66 billion  or down 1  to up 2  versus 2019  As Matt mentioned  in 2020  we are now providing revenue guidance instead of our shipment guidance  We are making this change because revenue is a much more comprehensive view of our business given the breadth of revenue growth drivers included in our More Roads plan that are not captured by motorcycle shipments  These revenue drivers include such things as small displacement motorcycles  electric bicycles  electric two wheelers for kids and expanded focus on broadening access to our general merchandise offerings  To help bridge the changeover to revenue guidance  we expect 601 cc and LiveWire worldwide motorcycle shipments to be down modestly to up slightly in 2020  We expect H D s U S  retail sales to be lower year over year behind lower U S  industry retail sales  but to continue to temper during the year  During 2020  we expect worldwide retail sales to be positively impacted by sharpened focus on increasing committed riders and our investment in stronger dealers  model year  20 and model year  21 motorcycles  including our entry into the dual and sports segments with Pan America and Bronx models in late 2020  and expansion of the international dealer network  However  we expect these positive sales impacts to continue to be met by strong headwinds  including a declining U S  new bike industry  a relative shift in rider preference toward segments in which we do not currently compete  but we ll enter by the end of this year and a marketplace crowded with highly competitive promotions  incentives and discounts  We expect to continue to aggressively manage the supply of retail inventory  However  we do expect year end worldwide retail inventory to increase moderately behind dealer fill of our new middleweight motorcycles and with the replenishment of our European dealer inventory  which was reduced at the end of 2019 in anticipation of low tariff motorcycles shipping from Thailand  In 2020  motorcycle segment operating margin as a percent of revenue is expected to be between 7  and 8   up from 2019 operating margin of 6 3   We expect gross margin to increase in 2020 behind lower year over year EU and China tariffs and strong operational productivity  including approximately  23 million in incremental manufacturing optimization savings  However  we expect these gains in gross margin to be partially offset by unfavorable motorcycle mix  During 2020  we expect the impact of recent EU and China tariffs to be approximately  30 million  which is down significantly from 2019 s tariff impacts of  97 9 million  This includes EU tariffs of approximately  20 million due to the sell through of high tariff inventory and tariffs on our Trikes and CVO models  which we will continue to produce in the United States  In addition  we expect to incur approximately  15 million in Section 301 Tariffs  While we continue to drive costs out of our SG A spend  we do expect it to be higher in 2020 behind increased investment in our More Roads plan as we lapped  34 million of 2019 recall benefits  primarily driven by supplier recall cost recoveries that we do not expect to repeat  In 2020  our investment in our More Roads plan peaks as we finalize product development and plan to launch our new middleweight motorcycles  electric bicycles and a small displacement motorcycle in China  Finally  we do not expect any restructuring costs in 2020  which will compare favorably to the  32 4 million of charges incurred in 2019  At HDFS  we expect modestly higher revenue in 2020 to be largely offset by a higher provision for credit losses and higher interest costs as we roll over low interest rate MTNs  Credit loss are expected to be slightly higher despite lapping last year s higher losses driven by the implementation of the LMS system  We expect 2020 credit losses to be affected  in part  by higher loss experience on certain financing programs  In 2020  we will adopt CECL  the new accounting pronouncement for credit losses  As a result  we expect a one time increase in the allowance for credit losses in the range of  70 million to  110 million  with the offset being a reduction to retained earnings net of taxes  This new accounting standard will not have an impact on the economics or cash flows of the HDFS business  However  we do expect increased earnings volatility as a result of CECL  To help our investors better understand HDFS  changes in provision expense  we will begin providing actual year over year credit losses in addition to changes in reserves  Capital expenditures in 2020 are expected to be between  215 million and  235 million  We expect our full year effective tax rate to be 24  to 25   As we look forward to the first quarter of 2020  we expect Motorcycle segment revenue to be between  1 09 billion and  1 17 billion down 2  to down 9  versus prior year  Motorcycle segment operating margin as a percent of revenue is also expected to be down approximately 2 5 percentage points  First quarter gross margin is expected to be flat  driven by favorable tariff impacts and increased productivity  while we expect to be    which we expect to be offset by unfavorable mix  SG A is expected to be higher as we lap approximately  28 million of 2019 favorability related to recall recoveries  To wrap up  we faced and overcame a number of challenges in 2019  Most notably  we have a plan to mitigate the majority of our recent EU and China tariff impacts and made significant progress on our More Roads plan  As we look to 2020  we are very encouraged by the momentum that we have gained over the last year on retail sales trends  but also recognize the substantial headwinds that we continue to face  Looking longer term  we are incredibly excited about our 2020 More Roads milestones  which will strengthen our existing business and unlock sustainable growth that will propel us in a new direction and deliver significant value through 2022  We are committed to driving long term growth for the company and strong returns for our shareholders  Thank you  And now let s take your questions  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird  Craig  your line is open Craig Kennison Great  Thanks and good morning  Matt  I think you reported that there was 527 000 riders that joined the brand and a net gain of 55 000  So you  I think  lost 472 000  The question is  what is behind the decision by those people to leave  And then on a related note  if you re growing the total number of riders  should we ultimately see growth in P A  Is there a strong correlation there Matt Levatich    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Craig  Thanks  It s the right question  It s a good question  And what we had year over year is a very similar retention rate  So as the new riders joined  the people that left also increased  as you pointed out  for a net increase of 55 000  So what we know from the rider migration database  we have a ton of insights about the profile of the exiters and the reasons why they re leaving and the single biggest driver and where we re focusing our efforts is on that early stage rider  Those people that have raised their hand  took the time  invested the money  learned how to ride  purchased a motorcycle  intend to exit the sport within the first three years because they haven t yet built the confidence necessary to become what we re calling a committed rider  That is the single largest driver of that exit number  and it is  therefore  the singular focus of our efforts around building rider commitment is how do we really nurture those early stage riders  And those programs that I referenced that are under way right now are very specific programmatic things that we re doing to address that single biggest driver of those early stage exiters  And yes  as we see the total participation in the motorcycle increase that we re driving  we should expect to see a return to growth in P A and apparel sales as well Craig Kennison Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia with William Blair  Sharon  your line is open Sharon Zackfia    William Blair and Company    Analyst Hi  Good morning  So I guess  from the outside  it s really hard to gauge the transformation you re going through from the numbers we re seeing  And I know you highlighted some things in your prepared commentary  I guess  if you go back to  I want to say  it was a few years ago where you unveiled the transformation strategy  can you help us gauge like where you might be ahead of where you had thought you would be at this point where you might be lagging a little bit just so we could kind of level set ahead of what looks like is an expected bigger ramp in 2021 Matt Levatich    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Sharon  Thanks  This is Matt  I appreciate the question  I would say when you look at the net increase of riders in 2018 was to 26 000  I believe  And last year  2019  was 55 000  So we are improving  but    and I mentioned this in my remarks  we need to accelerate our efforts  And that s what s behind this targeted effort that I mentioned in answering Craig s question  So we set out 10 year objectives and that objective specifically is to increase the number of riders in the U S  to four million  It s at 3 1 million now  so clearly  we have to pick up the pace to close that gap  And we have very specific programs in place that we re piloting right now to do that  And we feel good about it  And part of what s challenging about this transformation is it s really challenging the culture of the company  including even in the dealer network  When for 100 plus years  we ve woken up every morning and told ourselves  our job is to make great motorcycles  and we did a great job at that  It is quite a different challenge to wake up in the morning and say we now need to build riders  That requires different skills  different capabilities and different mindsets and a different cultural attitude and culture  our culture is very powerful  it s important  and to shift that culture  we re very    taking very deliberate steps with talent  with organizational structures and conscious efforts to just reinforce to everybody associated with the brand that our job is beyond just building great bikes  it s really becoming very skilled at building riders and customer creation  as I had mentioned  And it s simply to say that of all the transformations that we ve done  and they ve been very significant and very difficult  whether we re talking manufacturing or product development  this one is the most significant because we re thinking differently about what we re here to do and that requires all of us to show up differently in the company and even including in the dealer network  So we re into it and we have a lot more work to go  you can see that in the numbers  we need to accelerate our pace and we re adding things to the mix to do that OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities  Tim  your line is open Tim Conder    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst Thank you  Matt  if I would  just maybe do    can you delve into a little bit of the specific programs maybe that you started in 2019 and then maybe some new ones that you may be doing in 2020 here to help further reduce that churn rate  which again  you re making the net progress  which is good  But again  as you said  that s the key focus within the first three years of ridership  And then just a follow up for John  on HDFS  Just  John  would you anticipate now given that we re past the anniversary of the system changeover  those delinquencies to kind of level off here  even though you said that your maybe that s popped up a little in Q4 due to some of the new programs  Thank you Matt Levatich    President and Chief Executive Officer OK  I ll start  Just I would say broadly  there s four target areas that we have based on the rider retention and ridership insights  So    and we have pilots of various types in place in Q1  Last year  we did some sort of intermediate steps short of riding academy to give people the opportunity to just have a simple sort of two hour overview so that they could get in first gear  get their foot up on the pegs and right across the parking lot and just begin to feel beyond the jump start that we ve been doing  what it s actually like to ride to just nurture them into the whole process of deeper learning  So that is ongoing  and we ve added to the mix notionally or conceptually anyway  specific programs around riders  recruiting riders  so leveraging the passion of existing riders to help build the next generation of riders  Rider recruiting riders  riders coaching riders  which is to help those people in those early stage gain the confidence and the skills and capabilities that they need to fully enjoy riding  And in addition to offer riders of various experience levels  opportunity to increase their experience on their turf and on their terms  not  if you will  locked into specific programs  The third is riding anywhere anytime  And this is addressing some of the barriers that people have that are practical around  I don t have a bike  or  I don t have the gear   or  I don t have someone to ride with   I don t know     I can t find the time to do it   So we re piloting different things to see if we can unlock some of those barriers  And the fourth one is really into solidifying rider commitment  and we know from our research that riding epic journeys as simple as your first overnight ride tends to really solidify the power of riding as sort of a transformational personal experience  And so that riding epic journeys idea is about how do we help people  again  get deeper into the passion that we all have for riding  So that s the programmatic themes or concepts  if you will  that we have specific in market tests that were under way right now that we ll begin reporting on as we go through the year John Olin    Chief Financial Officer And Tim  your second question  this is John  Your second question was  do we expect credit losses to level off in 2020  And the answer is broadly yes  In our prepared remarks  we do expect a slight increase in credit losses  but nothing what we saw this year  but a slight increase  and that will be offset by increased revenue at HDFS  Tim Conder    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst OK  Thank   OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley  Adam  oyur line is open Adam Jonas    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Thanks  everyone  I want    first want to say I really appreciate and respect how you articulate the challenges  It really is kind of daunting  things like e bikes and building riders  the cultural change for the 117 year old company  it s really profound  You clearly demonstrate a very high awareness and they re trying a bunch of really valiant efforts here  I guess  indiscernible  we re having this conversation  though  at a time of arguably the greatest U S  economic expansion  one of the greatest economic expansions and greatest equity bull markets in history  So it ll be one thing if we were having these problems like in a downturn  but it s just the economy is really humming along  right  So I guess  if in the event  over the next year  which you described it as a pivot year  I think  people on this call agree  If these efforts don t really show the fruit that you re hoping here  and then there s no guarantee of success  would your management team and your board of directors consider strategic alternatives  including a potential sale of the company to help preserve this incredible franchise and brand and to maximize shareholder value  Thank you Matt Levatich    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Adam  I would say that the board is always mindful of maximizing shareholder value and assessing all the decision and obviously  the strategy of the company  So we re obviously very    as a board  very tied into the operations performance and strategy of the company  and we ll continue to evaluate it  We have a lot of growth platforms beyond just increasing ridership in the United States  And so you d need to look no further than the investment in the middleweight platform and the potential that  that has  as we gain access to the significant majority of the heavyweight marketplace outside the United States  So we ve been laying the groundwork with dealer distribution points  stronger dealer initiatives  the plant in Thailand  laying the groundwork for a very strong and potent impact of that middleweight platform investment  And so independent of those U S  ridership investments  we have growth trajectories that are part of our strategy  EV is another one  Not just to the ease of ridership on an EV product is remarkable  but also investing in making sure that we are positioned as the leader of the electrification of two wheels because that is clearly the direction that automotive products are going over time  and they make for phenomenal products  So all these things are part of the strategy  I would say that it is important for this organization to challenge ourselves in the way that we are to become a customer creation company here in the United States  Anything short of that  and it may have proved that  that is a very difficult  durable problem to solve  but we are all about it because it s important that we be about it  that we change the way we show up as a company and get skilled in the ways needed to do that  The challenge today is significant  not just people are joining the sport of motorcycling  And people are leaving for different reasons  as I alluded to earlier  But we    it s not    we re not talking about competition in the way we used to talk about competition  Competition is about competition for people s scarce time  people s scarce funding and commitment  We use that word a lot  commitment is becoming scarcer in the decisions people make as far as investing their time  And you can see that in all kinds of other industries that require a lot of time to become really embedded in doing something  and that s what our efforts are about  We think those efforts are very important skill and capability building for the company anyway  even if this challenge proves more durable than we are setting out to achieve  And in the meantime  we have lots of other growth platforms that we re investing in as well Adam Jonas    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Thank you OperatorThank you  Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar  Jaime  your line is open Jaime Katz    Morningstar    Analyst Hi  Good morning  I hope you can offer some clarification on the late 2020 launch of some of these other displacement bikes  I m curious if that will be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter  the year could look very different depending on when you guys are anticipating launching them  And then also  if you could clarify what you might have as adjusted operating margins    motorcycle operating margins for your outlook  I know you ve said 7  to 8   But I think  maybe excluding those tariffs  again  that will be closer to 9   Thanks John Olin    Chief Financial Officer Thanks  Jamie  This is John  With regards to the launch  we    I think you re referring two of the middleweight motorcycle that will bring us into the segments that we don t currently compete in  in particular  the dual segment with Pan America and the sports segment with our Bronx motorcycle  So that will be coming out toward the end of the year  and we would expect some shipments  largely in the United States for that and some retail sales in the U S  and not so much on the retail side of our European markets at that point  given the time for shipment  The second question is on operating margin  Our guidance is for 7  to 8   And I believe you had mentioned 9    given the fact that we have tariffs  So when we look at the overall guidance of eight to    7  to 8   that includes tariff and manufacturing optimization favorability and    but there s a couple of offsets to that  And I think that s why you may be at a little bit higher number  So let s talk through that for a second  On tariffs  again  to be very clear  we had  98 million embedded in our 2019 actuals  And we expect  going forward  that to be  35 million  I believe  on the prepared remarks  I said  30 million on the piece of paper  it said  35 million  and it  35 million  So Jamie  that is  63 million of year over year favorability as we start to come off the tariffs because of the actions that we ve taken  The second piece is the productivity side of it  which includes our manufacturing optimization  If we kind of dissect that  there s three components of that  There s a restructuring component that won t repeat next year  that s  33 million of favorability  There s a temporary inefficiency piece that s embedded in our 2019 performance  that s  10 million  that will be favorable next year because we won t have those inefficiencies as we move forward  And then finally  the reason that we did it is to gain savings moving forward  We had  32 million of savings in 2019  and we expect an additional  23 million  So those three components  Jamie  add up to  66 million  So you add those two together  we do have tailwinds of about  129 million as we move into 2020  which is clearly over    that represents a little over 2 5 percentage points  and that s over where our guidance is  So I think your question is  why is it 7  to 8    and there are two things that are going to pull us down from the 9  that you had mentioned  One is this unfavorable mix  We saw unfavorable mix in 2019 and and largely driven by touring becoming a smaller part of our overall mix  And this is something that we ve been talking about for a couple of years now  and this is the shift of consumer preference to motorcycles outside of the ones that we make and  clearly  the driving force behind our investment in More Roads  We expect that trend to continue into 2020  and so there ll be a headwind on mix that may not be in your models  The other piece of it is on SG A  So there s two component pieces of SG A that are going to be higher  One is  again  lapping  call it  a onetime or a non repeating item with regards to the supplier recoveries and recalls  That s  34 million headwind as we move into 2020  And then the second piece is  is that the spending on our More Roads and product development  in the 5 year period that we call our More Roads plan  the peak investment period is 2020  And the reason for that is very straightforward as we re coming out with a lot of new and different products  which requires a lot of engineering investment and product development spending is typically the highest before a product is launched  And then the second piece is our More Roads investment to launch those products and the go to market spending to make sure everyone understands those products and the consumer benefits  So we will hit a peak on that spending and SG A will be up a little bit more than what we re seeing in the investment analysts models  So with those two  we do expect operating margin to be between 7  and 8   all inclusive OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James  Joe  your line is open Joe Altobello    Raymond James    Analyst Thanks  Hey  guys  good morning  John  I want to go back to a comment you made earlier about softer use motorcycle prices at auction in the quarter  And maybe give us a sense for where that s been trending of late  It sounds like the gap between new and used pricing has widened a bit  and how you re thinking about that heading into 2020  Thanks John Olin    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Joe  So when we look at overall pricing  we ve typically talked in three levels  what s happening at auction  what s happening with pricing services that provide data to consumers and dealers  and then finally  what s happening in our dealer network  So Joe  you asked about the first one  which is at auction  We ve now seen  after nine quarters of improvement  we had a flat quarter in Q2  and two quarters that we ve been down slightly in terms of auction prices in Q3 and Q4  As we tag on to that  the pricing services had about eight quarters of increased pricing direction  But in the last quarter  we had them split  We had one service that was projecting higher prices and then the other lower  And then the third level of how we look at used bike prices is what s actually transacting in our dealer network  And with that  we ve had 10 consecutive quarters of used bike prices rising  which is very good news  And again  this quarter    in the fourth quarter  they rose  So we ve got a little bit of mix here  We have got a close eye on what s happening at auction because that typically ripples through to the dealer network  But at this point  we are seeing improving used bike prices in our dealer network OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets  Gerrick  your line is open Gerrick Johnson    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst Hey  Good morning  I want to talk about the departure of Neil Grimmer  He was a highlight at the analyst day  I thought he had a great presentation  Wondering who s replacing him  And are there changes to the brand development strategy  Thank you Matt Levatich    President and Chief Executive Officer Gerrick  I ll take that  Yes  I    the same reasons for bringing Neil in exists today  and I m actively recruiting for a new brand President and the work that was done while he was here and since is inherent in the strategy that we have for building committed riders  So we are hard at work on that direction  and we ve got a great team that is in place doing that work  and in the meantime  I m leading that team and making sure that their work is fully integrated as we go to market here in the United States and around the world  So steady as she goes  We need leadership of that nature for the work that we need to do to become really skilled at customer creation  And as soon as we get that talent  we ll be delighted to get them in front of our investors OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research  David  your line is open David MacGregor    Longbow Research    Analyst Good morning  Thanks for taking the question  Just a question on the international business  and you d indicated that the sales    retail sales in the developed markets were down slightly  I guess the question is  are you seeing something change in terms of credit availability from the legacy lenders in those markets that would have contributed to a growth headwind there  Thanks John Olin    Chief Financial Officer Thanks  David  This is John  We are not seeing any change in credit availability in our developed markets or international markets  Remember  HDFS plays a very critical role in our access to credit in those markets  and they re certainly well schooled in working with third party providers  As you know  we only had landed underwrite in Canada and the United States  But they are working with us side by side  and we re not seeing any change in credit availability of those developed markets  And again  with that  we re very pleased with what we ve seen in the back half of this year on our sales in international markets  After our first half of being down about 6 6  we ve seen growth in the back half  So thanks  David David MacGregor    Longbow Research    Analyst And just as a follow up question  John  I guess  you ran a number of promotions in the quarter  the extended warranty promotion  a few other things  How do you feel riders responded to those promotions  And what does that tell you about how you guide your promotional activity going forward John Olin    Chief Financial Officer Thanks  David  Actually  we had very little promotions in the fourth quarter this year  We didn t have a whole lot last year either  The extended warranty program is one of those  but that s been more of a perennial program  We ve offered that for for several years  And that just is an opportunity for somebody that comes in and the dead of winter  to give them a couple more months of warranty so that they don t use that up when I m sitting in their garage or in storage  So that has not been a core driver of promotional activity  but again  consistent over the last several years  Overall  as you know  from the first quarter of this year  we ve been tempering our promotional activity and incentives  We did do a finance offer in the third quarter  much smaller than the one that we had in the third quarter of 2018  But in the fourth quarter of this year  we didn t have any notable promotions or dollars off promotions  We had some in 2018 fourth quarter  We had a private offer out there  no real financing offers in the fourth quarter  So    and this is the way we re moving forward  We ve redirected those funds to building and amplifying the brand and have been very pleased with the results that we ve seen OperatorYour next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Wedbush  James  your line is open James Hardiman    Wedbush Securities    Analyst Good morning  Thanks for filling me in  A lot of my questions were answered  but I wanted to circle back  John  to your    I think it was Jamie s question on margin  And I think a lot of the detail you gave was really helpful with the bridge  But two questions on that front  I guess  first   34 million in  I guess  you call them warranty recovery benefits  I don t remember those being talked about in the past  but maybe give us    or help us understand the timing of those in 2019  Presumably  we would want to then pull those benefits out of our numbers as we roll forward into 2020  It sounds like some of that even happened in the first quarter  So help us with the timing there  Number one  And then the EU waiver  obviously  the timing there was a big negative in 2019  and I seem to recall it was going to be a nice positive here in 2020  When does that hit  And how much does that benefit shipments and margins Matt Levatich    President and Chief Executive Officer OK  Thanks  James  First question is with regards to the timing of supplier    largely supplier recoveries  If you remember back in Q4 of 2018  we had two recalls  a total of  55 million  In the first quarter of 2019  we received a supplier recovery of  28 million  And that would have been listed in K and was mentioned in the call at that time  Over the year  largely in the second quarter  James  we also had a release of other recall reserves of about  6 million  So those two  we do not expect to repeat in 2020  but will be a headwind  and again  they total  34 million  And yes  24     28 million of it  and we talked about the first quarter  is going to hit and be a headwind in the first quarter of 2020  The second piece is  with regards to the EU  So we were looking for a decision from the EU that came later than we had anticipated  And with that  in the second quarter  we called down some of our shipment volumes because we were going to take inventories down in    at the end of the year in anticipation of lower tariff inventory coming in from the plant in Thailand  That s not the only reason we took it down  there s some softness in international markets as well  So that has come  And the company did a fantastic job  and our team in Europe did a fantastic job of working down inventories  Overall  international inventory was down 3 000 units  We expect that about 2 000 out of Europe  and we got a little bit more than that  And so we will look to replenish inventories in 2020  and that s part of the revenue drivers that we have of being down 1  to up 2  as we will replenish that inventory with lower tariff bikes coming from Thailand  And so that is a shift of revenue  not necessarily a margin  Also  we did have increased cost from that delayed decision and that cost will be lapped  I think that was in the  5 million range  and so there ll be a benefit in 2020  which is incorporated in our operating margin guidance of 7  to 8  OperatorYour final question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi  Greg  your line is open Greg Badishkanian    Citi    Analyst Great  Thank you  So LiveWire deliveries were slower than expected  just given some of the manufacturing issues from a while ago  Can you talk about the    maybe the sales momentum of that line  And continued enthusiasm and the level of enthusiasm by consumers as well as dealers Matt Levatich    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  Thanks for the question  This is Matt  I    well  a couple of things  So we are back at the planned rate  and it took us time to get to that rate as we worked these early supply chains  and we re extremely diligent and cautious about making sure that every motorcycle that gets out in the market is perfect in the eyes of the customer  The early feedback has been fantastic  I would say  from an underlying demand perspective  it s hard to tell for two reasons  one  we re filling pre orders still  and two  it s the winter  So we ll really know a lot more about the underlying demand for LiveWire when there s  indiscernible  in our LiveWire launch as we established a one to one white glove process where various folks within the company  within engineering  customer service are very knowledgeable about the product  had one to one relationships with early buyers  And answering their questions  gauging their enthusiasm and interest  and that s part of the feedback that we re getting from early owners and the feedback is just phenomenal  So we re extremely pleased with the reaction from the press and the reaction from the early owners  We re working through the pre orders for a planned rate  We re building out inventory in the dealer channel  We re building out availability outside the United States as well  We ve got Phase 2 dealers coming on in the U S  this year  So there s a lot to look forward to with LiveWire  And we ll know a lot more when spring season hits and there s availability to fulfill sort of instantaneous demand OperatorThis

165729,387245,HOG,Harley Davidson Takes Another Hit,news,"Shares of Harley Davidson  NYSE HOG  closed Tuesday around 3  lower after the American motorcycle maker reported a continued slump in sales in the fourth quarter  There were  however  some signs of improvement during the period  providing a measure of hope 
Still  the story is one of stagnation at best  
Results
Overall sales declined by 1 4  year over year in Q4  The sources of the declines were the United States domestic market  which decreased 3 1   Canada  which declined 14 1   and the EMEA  which declined by 2 3   With strength in Asia  overall international sales improved by a low 0 5  year over year 
These sales results continued the trend that has plagued the coveted bikemaker in recent years  Overseas sales strengthened  while domestic demand continues to weaken  For the full year 2019  U S  sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles declined 5 2   The only market of growth was Asia Pacific  Total worldwide sales for 2019 declined 4 3  
Total revenue from motorcycles declined by 9 7  in the fourth quarter to  666 3 million  Parts and accessories revenue fell a comparable 9 1  to  129 3 million  General merchandising  the smallest piece of the business  brought in  57 2 million in revenue  Not only did overall revenue from the motorcycle related products segment of the business decline  but gross margins declined by 2 3 basis points to 25 2   Operating losses for the segment were  46 5 million  This was a 22  improvement from 2018  but still marked negative operating margins of 5 3   Full year operating margins for this segment of the business were 8 5   That s a 2 2 basis point decline from 2018 

Financial services revenue gained 4 2  to  198 2 million  but operating income suffered a 7  decline to  58 9 million 
Total shipments declined 7  in the fourth quarter  and 6 4  for the year 
On the bright side of all this  Harley Davidson noted that the sales declines have been leveling off  U S  retail sales had their slowest year over year decline in 12 quarters  according to the Q4 earnings release  It will take more time to see whether this leveling continues 
Electric won t do it
Looking ahead  Harley Davidson faces the challenge of easing into the interests of newer riders  while being careful not to alienate its loyal consumer base  Part of the problem here is that consumer tastes have shifted  and the generation that enjoyed most Harley bikes is aging  The problem is not limited to Harley  Polaris has been struggling to maintain momentum for its Indian Motorcycle brand  
Attempting to cash in on the EV craze  Harley has produced an electric motorcycle called the Livewire  It has a smaller  more nimble design than the traditional big hog Harley  While millennials and progressives certainly seem to have an appetite for this segment  the bike is fairly unaffordable for the average consumer  With a starting price of  29 799  the bike costs more than a lot of cars  Furthermore  does the consumer base that likes motorcycles really want a quiet bike that you have to plug in  While I m sure these will sell to those seeking the novelty and  green  image  I don t see it as a large scale seller 
The stock
Harley s 2020 outlook includes  4 53 billion  4 66 billion in revenue from the motorcycle segment of the business  First quarter results are expected to conservatively produce  1 09 billion in revenue  The company didn t provide figures on earnings estimates 
Through the last few years  Harley Davidson has countered lower overall net income with an aggressive share buyback program  This in turn allowed for softer variations in earnings per share  Buybacks haven t necessarily been the worst deal for Harley  as its shares carry a pretty low valuation  There were 8 2 million shares left on the company s repurchase authorization as of the end of the year  So the amount of time for this to keep working is limited 
The thing about Harley Davidson is that it s a cash cow  finishing the year with  833 9 million on the balance sheet  There s a lot of insulation here  The company is still a profitable enterprise  and there s a lot of time for the firm to try to find ways to improve the situation  That said  we haven t seen very much yet that implies Harley has found that answer  I reiterate my feelings that the current emphasis on the new electric bike is not the solution  If it were far less expensive  it would make sense  But how many buyers are going to purchase an electric bike that costs the same as a car 
Carrying a trailing P E of 12 6 and a 4 4  dividend  Harley Davidson might seem like a value bargain  If you re looking for stocks with growth  this is not one of them  Investors should keep savvy to the sales situation  This is a company trying to find its place in a different world ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pod50,2070380
165730,387246,HOG,Harley Davidson Falls As It Couldn t Match Wall Street s Optimism,news,"Harley Davidson  NYSE HOG  posted its best results in three years in the fourth quarter  Not that they were very good  as sales continued to decline  but there were enough highlights it could point to to make it look like the motorcycle maker s business is stabilizing 
Unfortunately  it looks like the future will see Harley Davidson as a much smaller company  but at least it seems to still have a future 
U S  riders still rejecting hogs
Harley said U S  motorcycle sales fell 3 1   the smallest decline it s seen in 12 quarters  on a 6  decline in shipments  indicating the bike maker is interested in getting dealer inventory right  But make no mistake  the bar Harley jumped over was set very low as sales in the year ago  2018  fourth quarter had tumbled more than 10   a figure that itself was going up against an easy comparison from 2017  when quarterly sales fell 11   

That Harley s sales were down  only  3  isn t quite the achievement it might otherwise seem  even though it gained about 1  in market share in the quarter  to 50 4   Share for the year is about the same as where it was at the end of 2018  at 49 1  
The fourth quarter is also Harley s slowest season  so it needs to prove in the coming quarters that sales really are improving 
Because of previous production problems with its LiveWire electric motorcycle  Harley is still trying to fulfill pre orders on the bike  Harley says reception by customers has been great  but no real details on sales are available  
That s not necessarily unexpected  but it may hint at the actual number being a bit underwhelming 

Sun rising on Asian markets
Worldwide sales were only down 1 4  as Harley saw strong 6  growth in the Asia Pacific region  which has now surpassed Europe as its largest foreign market  Sales fell in every other region  but because of the positive number from the Asia Pacific region  Harley was able to post a 0 5  increase in overall international sales 
While sales from Japan  Australia  New Zealand  and Korea saw robust 5  sales gains in the quarter  it was the  other  segment for the region that had the best growth  with sales rising 7  year over year 
That bodes well for Harley Davidson as it has partnered with one of China s most popular motorcycle makers  Qianjiang Motorcycle  to produce a small bore 338 cubic centimeter bike for the Chinese market under the Harley banner  China sells some 2 million bikes in the 150 cc to 400 cc range  Harley is targeting 50  of its revenue to come from outside of the U S  by 2027 
Unfounded optimism on Wall Street contributed to the miss
Harley Davidson took it on the chin after reporting its results because Wall Street had an idea that the bike maker was going to be in an even better place at the end of 2019 than it actually was  even though there was no good reason for analysts to feel so ebullient 
Sales have not been good  there was no indication they would be better  and Harley has done little to improve the situation  Its bikes are too big and too expensive for the U S  market  which still accounts for 58  of total sales 
Analysts had only expected revenue to fall by 3   not the 8 7  decline Harley actually posted  Earnings came in at  0 09 per share on a GAAP basis compared to break even last year  and at  0 20 per share adjusting for restructuring and tariff costs compared to  0 17 per share last year 
Harley isn t looking for growth in 2020 as consumers aren t yet ready to embrace the bike maker  so analysts might temper their expectations next time  but Harley has said it is looking to  drive significant revenue growth  beginning in 2021  That still seems pretty far fetched  but if this quarter s performance is an indication that the bottom is in sight  it may just begin to achieve it  Just don t hold your breath ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pohk5,2070754
165734,387250,HOG,Jeep s New E Bike Shows Risk in Harley Davidson s Big EV Bet,news,"That electric bicycle you briefly saw Bill Murray riding on with a groundhog during the Jeep Super Bowl commercial last weekend is real  and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  NYSE FCAU  will begin selling them this June  
While the e bike has already begun to generate some industry buzz  it also should be a warning to Harley Davidson  NYSE HOG   because it reveals a flaw in Harley s plan to go all in on electric vehicles  EVs  

Muscling into the market
According to electric vehicle industry site Electrek  the e bike is so massively powerful that it should fully live up to its billing as the  most capable off road electric mountain bike there is   
Although Jeep says it comes with a 750 watt electric motor  that apparently undersells the power it offers  It seems the motor is actually one built by Chinese motor manufacturer Bafang called the M620  which is a powerhouse that actually puts out at least 1 600 watts of peak power when equipped with a standard 52 volt battery and generates 160 Newton meters of torque 
While that kind of geek speak is above my pay grade  I m sufficiently impressed that Electrek believes  that s an insane amount of torque    a level that most gas motorcycles don t reach   emphasis in original 


Even if  as other sites believe  the Jeep e bike s production motor is closer to the specs provided simply for rider safety  it still challenges Harley Davidson s belief that its LiveWire electric motorcycle can effectively serve as a  halo  product to sell the other EVs it plans to produce 
Shining a light on strategy
Harley has justified the  30 000 price tag of the LiveWire  which in comparison produces some 116 Newton meters of torque  by saying it shows what the bike maker can do when it puts its energy and financial resources toward building the market s premier electric motorcycle 
Although it agrees it might not sell many LiveWires  Harley says the bike will bring customers into its dealer showrooms who will then buy the electric scooters and bicycles it will produce 
The problem is that Harley never seemed to factor in competition beyond existing electric bike manufacturers  Now it has other  bigger competitors entering the market who are ready to hit the ground running 
Competition is revving up
Fiat Chrysler s Jeep is just one automobile manufacturer that s producing electric bicycles  Last year General Motors  NYSE GM  began selling two e bikes  the Meld and the Merge  under its ARIV brand  pronounced  arrive    though initially they are only for sale in Belgium  Germany  and the Netherlands  Ford  NYSE F  was actually one of the earliest automakers to get into the e bike market  introducing its Supercruiser in 2013  but it s no longer in production 
Harley Davidson also has little street credibility with the consumers who are most likely to buy electric bikes  Because its legacy is in combustion engines  convincing buyers it is now committed to an electric future rather than just trying to ride the latest trend may be difficult  While that arguably applies to the carmakers  too  they ve established themselves in the EV market  though not Fiat Chrysler  which has yet to produce an electric car of its own  
Short circuiting sales
Harley s quarterly earnings indicated sales for the LiveWire were lower than anticipated  in part due to manufacturing problems it discovered as the motorcycles were rolling off the assembly line 
Out of an abundance of caution  it chose to hold up production to fix them  but the delay meant Harley had missed the seasonal buying window by the time they hit dealer showrooms  Of course  the exorbitant price tag has already narrowed the field of potential buyers considerably 
Also  leaked internal documents seen by Electrek cast further doubt on Harley s e bike ambitions  They suggest Harley will only be pursuing a Class 1 pedal assist e bicycle because they represent 88  of the global e bike market 
While there was some  15 billion in e bike sales globally in 2018  and the market is expected to grow at a better than 6  annual rate through 2024  Harley is also rumored to be pricing its e bikes in the  2 000 to  5 000 range  far above the  600 to  800 range competing e bikes go for 
Like the LiveWire  the motorcycle maker may price itself out of the market and find the competitive hurdles of the electric vehicle market much too high to surmount ",2020-02-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psrwl,2079844

Shares of Harley Davidson  NYSE HOG   dropped 7  lower early Tuesday morning  before recovering some losses  as the markets digested the motorcycle maker s disappointing fourth quarter results

Harley Davidson s revenue declined 8 5  to  874 1 million in the fourth quarter  compared to the prior year  which failed to meet analysts  estimates of  922 million  Adjusted earnings checked in at  0 20 per share  which topped the prior year s  0 17 per share result but still failed to meet analysts  estimates of  0 24 per share  Harley Davidson s shipments fell 7  to 40 454 units during the fourth quarter  slightly missing consensus estimates of 41 700 units   Our performance in Q4 and the full year was in line with our expectations and indicative of increased business stability driven by the tremendous efforts of our employees and dealers   said Matt Levatich  president and chief executive officer of Harley Davidson  in a press release

165774,387290,HOG,Harley Davidson Earnings Rides Or Dies By Its Alternative Data,opinion,"Harley Davidson  NYSE HOG  had its third quarter earnings call this week  and there are lots of reasons to be suspicious of its long term prospects  Retail sales are in decline  there are steel tariffs to consider  and ridership might not be growing  We blame millennials  Harley Davidson is getting more into advertising as a result and is spending more money  which is likely the main reason for the stock price going down    especially the bits about foreign markets and manufacturing  but as always  we will focus on the alternative data 
Which is   fantastic  




Harley Davidson  since summer 2016  has essentially added a thousand new employees every year or so  and despite the stock price going down  they keep hiring  Will there be a reckoning between these two trends  









From the start of the year  the job listings count has been higher than any other time for the company  It s an aggressive move  to keep so many employees and continue adding more  shelling out a lot of money to employ so many to make a lot of inventory  all to not sell as many motorcycles  
It took two years  from 2015 to 2017  to add 100K more Twitter followers for Harley Davidson  It ll take even longer to add another 100K from 2017 to 2021 since there s a slight plateau happening  The numbers are going up  but it s slowing ever so slightly 









Facebook  NASDAQ FB  likes have also reached a plateau  which starts to beg the question  is Harley Davidson a brand people still care about like they did decades ago  Easy Rider and Peter Fonda was like  the high watermark for hogs  Those days are no longer here  That s reflected in the  Talking About  count as well  which hit an unusual high in February 2017

number by an average positive earnings surprise of 11  Consistently beating the number is something that investors love to see Estimates Move Higher60 days ago  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter was at  0 26  but that number has jumped to  0 32 We have also seen the estimates for the full year and next year moving higher ValuationAt 24x forward earnings  the multiple is right in line with where the industry has been trading   A 3 2x price to book multiple is a little low  but that is good for value oriented investors who like to see stocks at a P B of less than 3x I see a slight move lower in margins lately  so if FORM can turn that around then this stock could be off to the races Chip Stocks This earnings season has been a good one for chip stocks   This name is reporting on Wednesday  Feb 5 after the close  The chart looks solid and the recent pullback gives an even better reason to take a deeper look at being long this stock into the earnings report  Harley Davidson Increcently fell to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  after the company missed earnings  Let s take a look at the report and what else happened afterward in this Bear of the Day article DescriptionHarley Davidson  Inc  manufactures and sells custom  cruiser  and touring motorcycles  The company was founded in 1903 and is based in Milwaukee  Wisconsin Recent EarningsSometimes the estimates that are availbe are not complete   In the case of HOG  the Zacks data is a little light   I see the Wall Street consensus for the more recent quarter at  0 22 and the company reporting  0 20   That is a miss of two cents as revenues fell 8 4  on an annual basis to  874M and below the  928M estimate Estimate MovementsSince the miss  the Zacks Consensus Estiamte has been falling   The number for the current quarter was at  1 00 90 days ago  but is now just  0 66 The full year number is more important to the Zacks Rank and that has slipped as well   The 2020 fiscal number moved from  3 47 to  3 09 and the fiscal year for 2021 has dropped to  3 31 from  3 55 60 days ago This is the primary reason the Zacks Rank has fallen to the lowest level Since The Earnings ReportThe other day I see that KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded HOG to Sector Weight from Underweight   They believe that sentiment may have bottomed   They went on to mention that the guidance offered by management still seems a little aggressive which is keeping the risk   reward in unfavorable territory   That all said  investors like to see an upgrade in a stock like this and hopefully it will be a sign of good things to come Additional content Can Tesla s Relentless Rally Continue Look what happens when Tesla finally starts keeping its promises  its stock goes on a relentless rally with seemingly no end  Since the beginning of June  TSLA has surged 260   which is nothing less than incredible for a public company of this size  TSLA met its seemingly unreachable vehicle delivery goals  up 50  from 2018  and was ahead of schedule with its Shanghai factory  The company just beat big on top and bottom line metrics for Q4 earnings  sending TSLA to levels few could have predicted This euphoria can t last forever but that doesn t mean it s over  Investor  analysts  and traders alike have been trying to find a way to value this enigma of a stock that not only has no close comparables but is wildly unpredictable Tesla hit a record number of deliveries as well as positive operating and free cash flows for the past 3 quarters in a row  This electric vehicle giant has also begun to turn a quarterly profit with the anticipation of having its first annual profit in 2020  The anticipated Model Y commercial production is several quarters ahead of schedule and is being released less than a year after its prototype  This quick turnaround proves the company s ability to leverage its platform effectively to stay ahead of quickly evolving trends Now that Tesla has begun to keep its promises  it will be an expectation from shareholders moving forward  Any wildly outlandish claims made by its eccentric CEO Elon Musk are going to be taken seriously  He tweeted back in August of 2018 that he would take the company private at  420  a modest 23  premium at the time   but no one took him seriously  Today TSLA is trading at more than 50  premium to that  420 level Will Elon and his EV giant be able to maintain its current growth trajectory  I think the answer is yes and more  Tesla s Shanghai Gigafactory gives the company direct access to the largest EV market in the world  Now Tesla is planning its construction of a European factory outside of Berlin  which will further establish this enterprise s world domination of the automotive market The only concern that I have with this stock is its excessive amount of volatility  Like I said  the stock has run up 260  in 8 months  and this means that a pullback is not out of the question  None the less analysts  are raising their price targets on TSLA with one analyst betting this stock will make it to  6 000 in the next 5 years Take Away Tesla was one of the most bet against stocks in the market  but I think it s time for the short sellers to throw in the towel  Tesla is finally keeping its promises  and the markets are loving it Deep down  everyone wants this electric vehicle giant to succeed because it represents a greener  more efficient world Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current

165776,387292,HOG,Trump Expected to Delay Tariffs on Imported European Vehicles,news," Bloomberg     The Trump administration may punt on a decision on whether to slap tariffs on European automobiles as efforts of German automakers to highlight their new investments have helped in the talks  people familiar with the White House deliberations said 
In May  President Donald Trump gave himself a deadline of mid November to decide whether to impose levies on cars and auto parts from the European Union  The EU threatened to retaliate with tariffs on  39 billion of American goods if the president carried out his threat 
Trump is expected to extend this week s deadline again  according to people familiar with the plans  but the president has not yet made a final decision 
The White House declined to comment on Monday 
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross  in an interview with Bloomberg TV earlier this month  signaled that a postponement was likely 
 Our hope is that the negotiations we ve been having with individual companies about their capital investment plans will bear enough fruit that it may not be necessary to put the 232 fully into effect  may not even be necessary to put it partly in effect   said Ross  referring to the national security investigation under Section 232 of a 1962 trade law 
Trump won t impose the tariffs  European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker told German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung last week  A 25  U S  levy on foreign cars would add 10 000 euros   11 000  to the sticker price of EU vehicles imported into the country  according to the Brussels based European Commission  the bloc s executive arm 
Last year  Trump infuriated European leaders by declaring American imports of steel and aluminum a security threat and imposing levies of 25  and 10   respectively  on shipments from around the world  including the EU  That prompted the bloc to retaliate with tariffs on American goods such as Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG  motorcycles  Levi Strauss  NYSE LEVI  jeans and bourbon whiskey 
U S  tariffs on European cars and auto parts would mark a significant escalation of transatlantic tensions because the value of EU automotive exports to the American market is about 10 times greater than that of the bloc s steel and aluminum exports combined  As a result  European retaliatory duties would target a bigger amount of U S  exports to Europe 
The Trump administration has reached separate agreements with other foreign auto producing nations like Mexico  Canada and Japan to prevent the U S  from imposing tariffs on their imported vehicles ",2019-11-12,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/trump-expected-to-delay-tariffs-on-imported-european-vehicles-2018484,2018484

EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said that because a U S  deadline for the tariffs came and went last week without any action  President Donald Trump would abide by an agreement reached with European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker last year that would forestall the levies 
 There were no tariffs imposed at the deadline last week  We haven t seen any formal declaration for the decision on this  neither an informal one   she said at a Centre for European Policy Studies conference in Brussels on Wednesday   We assume that President Trump will stick to the agreement he made with President Juncker

Trump and Juncker reached a political agreement in July 2018 to negotiate a slash in industrial tariffs between the two regions and suspend a U S  threat to impose tariffs on European auto exports  Scant progress has been made in discussions  with the U S  focusing more of its attention on the trade war with China

165778,387294,HOG,Harley Davidson Won t Be Getting an Earnings Lift From Livewire,news,"Harley Davidson  NYSE HOG  surprised everyone in the third quarter by posting better than expected sales numbers  Motorcycle sales were still down in the U S   and the performance was worse than the industry as a whole  though not as bad as rival Polaris Industries   so it wasn t a record to really cheer 
Still  it has given some investors hope that Harley has hit bottom    or is very near the bottom    and the fourth quarter will be telling in that regard  With fourth quarter results due out Jan  28  we ll know soon enough  but here s what investors can likely expect 

The winter of its discontent
The fourth quarter is typically Harley Davidson s slowest quarter for sales    not surprising  given that motorcycle buyers typically put away thoughts of new bikes until the spring  This year s numbers shouldn t be any different  though the bike maker has in more recent periods used the quarter to boost its shipment numbers to push its guidance over the finish line 
Last year  though  Harley s outlook was appropriately dour enough that it didn t have to resort to any last minute shenanigans  but sales remain at their lowest point in at least a decade  Not even during the depths of the recession has the bike maker reported so few sales  and there s nothing to suggest that the trend will be reversing 
Every quarter save one over the last four years  Harley has posted lower sales  meaning the bar it has to get over this quarter is extremely low  just over 20 800 bikes sold  So in theory  if it is going to finally post a gain  this could be the quarter it happens  But even with the LiveWire electric motorcycle on sale  it s probably not going to happen 
Here s why the fourth quarter will be a disappointment 

Tariffs making Harleys more expensive
Production delays with the LiveWire
New bikes won t be available until later this year
Bikes still carry a hefty price tag

The ravages of the trade war
Although Harley Davidson moved production of some of its motorcycles to its new plant in Thailand and got approval from the European Union for favorable tariff treatment on its Softail and Sportsters  it won t be until the second quarter of 2020 that it will have worked through the existing higher cost inventory  and the production it expected to begin last October will be available 
On the sales front  that means Harleys are still going to be more expensive to foreign buyers  which may result in sales falling again  International sales had fallen for three straight quarters  before briefly perking up in the third  Expect them to fall once more 
EV challenges
The LiveWire electric motorcycle began with a bit of a hiccup  as a problem found in a single bike caused Harley to shut the entire production line down for a week  While that was done out of an abundance of caution  it caused the bikes to be shipped late to dealers  They were only going to be getting very few anyway  and the resulting buzz was marred by Harley s less than fully transparent response to the issue  When the LiveWires finally showed up  the window for fall buying had mostly closed 
Harley isn t expecting to sell many to begin with  and certainly not with a  30 000 price tag   It views the electric motorcycle as its  halo  model to show what a bike company can do when it throws all the bells and whistles into a production model 
Still  a Zero Motorcycle costs about a third less  and models from other manufacturers are expected to be dramatically cheaper still  There won t be many Harley bikers looking at a LiveWire regardless 
The excitement is in future quarters
The real potential for Harley begins later this year when its Streetfighter and Adventure Touring motorcycles are released  It also has some small electrics in the works  but as with everything Harley  pricing will be key 
It looks like it s tapping into the right markets    but pricing itself out of them thinking the Harley mystique and cachet will carry over into sectors in which it has no credibility yet with riders would be a mistake 
Still a value stock
Harley Davidson s stock is down 5  so far in 2020  and it trades at a very cheap valuation  But the reason its shares go for just 10 times estimated earnings is because there are valid questions about whether this iconic American brand can recover  
However  the bike maker does still generate a lot of cash  and because it trades at just 11 times the free cash flow it produces  an investor might just want to take a stab at it and enjoy the dividend that is currently yielding 4 3  annually  It may be worth it to see if this management team has learned from past mistakes and will gain traction again ",2020-01-26,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pn16e,2067946

 Reuters    Harley Davidson Inc  N HOG  said on Tuesday it would invest as much as  1 6 billion over the next four years to turn around its business  raising concerns about its earnings and sending its shares lower 
In a presentation to investors  the company said its capital spending would range between  200 million and  250 million a year through 2022  including  225 million to  275 million to develop electric  middle and lightweight bikes 
Additionally  it would make an  operating investment  of  450 million to  550 million

Pierer said he had expected concerns such as the Yellow Vest protests in France  Italy s debt burden  and Britain s departure from the European Union to cut into sales  But the industry s growth in the region topped 21  in the first quarter  with KTM slightly outpacing rivals at about 22   he said at the company s headquarters in Mattighofen  Austria  The company says the data reflect robust consumer confidence  as most of its European sales are of bikes ridden for weekend fun rather than commuting

165863,387379,HOG,Zacks Investment Ideas Feature Highlights  Harley Davidson And Polaris Industries,opinion,For Immediate Release Chicago  IL   January 31  2019   Today  Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features  Harley Davidson   NYSE HOG   and Polaris Industries   NYSE PII   Does a Big Earnings Miss Mean Trouble for Harley Davidson Shares of American motorcycle manufacturer Harley Davidson traded sharply lower on Tuesday after a disappointing Q4 earnings report  The company operated at a break even for the quarter  well short of expectations for net earnings of  0 17 share It s been a difficult multi year period for the iconic manufacturer  but it s definitely not the first time Harley Davidson has faced challenging conditions  As the oldest continually operating US producer of motorcycles  the company has survived two world wars  the great depression  one of only two motorcycle companies to do so   and the financial crisis of 2008 2009 The company s ability to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape in the transportation industry and its  More Roads  strategic plan for the next four years will be crucial to the continued survival of the world s most recognizable motorcycle brand The most recent problems for Harley Davidson include costs associated with tariffs  expensive recalls and a general demographic shift pushing consumers away from Harley s large  and expensive  cruiser style motorcycles The tariff issue started in the summer of 2018 and turned into a   In response to the news that Harley would manufacture more motorcycles overseas to avoid the retaliatory tariffs enacted by US trading partners  Harley owners organized a boycott of the brand that received public support   via Twitter   from President Trump Tariff costs were  13 4M in the fourth quarter  When added to  19 4M in restructuring expense and inflated selling and administrative expenses that included almost  55M in recall costs  that left an operating loss of  59M on motorcycles and equipment  Operating income from the financial services division kept the net from being a red number While those issues may prove to be temporary  the demographic shift is potentially more problematic in the long run Aging Customer BaseSince the 1960 s  the Harley Davidson brand has been synonymous with big  powerful and loud motorcycles that featured classic American styling and a vast number of options for customization  Even as foreign competitors entered the US market with smaller  lighter and more efficient motorcycles  Harley fostered a rabidly loyal following that allowed it to sell its bikes at high prices and strong margins That strong brand recognition also allowed the company to grow the sales of branded and licensed apparel and other merchandise to over  200M year Other brands have tried to copy the Harley style with mixed success  notably Polaris Industries with its revival of the Indian brand and the  now shuttered  Victory line  Asian brands Honda  Yamaha and Kawasaki also offer less expensive cruiser bikes  but the Harley mystique has been largely unaffected Until now Harley s US sales have disproportionately depended on middle aged  40 60  American men  Younger riders  women and buyers in world markets often don t want a motorcycle that s as big   and expensive   as a Harley  Riders older than 60 tend to reduce the number of miles they put in on a motorcycle and don t buy nearly as many new bikes  If fact  the market for used motorcycles can also depress Harley s sales as older riders increasingly sell their bikes at prices that are more attractive to buyers Because of the sheer size of the baby boom generation  Harley found millions of its target audience with checkbooks in hand in the early 2000s  but the aging of that population has been measurably affecting sales for the past few years  Knowing that Gen Y and the Millennials simply don t have the numbers to make up the shortfall  Harley has targeted previously underserved groups   riders from 18 35 years old  women  minorities and European and Asian customers   but with mixed success Electric Future While new offerings like smaller displacement cycles and lower seat heights have made Harley Davidson motorcycles more appealing to new audiences  the company is betting on launching 100 new high impact motorcycle models over the next 9 years  Figuring prominently in that effort is their recently announced  LiveWire  electric cycle Electric motorcycles are especially appealing to younger riders and potential riders because of their ease of use  no shifting gears   lower maintenance costs and considerably less noise and air pollution relative to traditional gasoline powered cycles After at least 4 years of development  the LiveWire will be available for purchase at Harley Davidson dealerships starting later in 2019  The flagship electric cycle is a high performance motorcycle with an equally high price   just a few dollars short of  30 000  That price puts the LiveWire at the high end of base retail price for Harley s offerings Similar electric bikes from competitor Zero Motorcycles cost considerably less  with the most expensive models priced under  20 000   even with maximum range upgrades Electric cycle maker Lightning had made headlines by producing the world s fastest motorcycle that also happens to be electric powered  Its LS 218 can reach a top speed of   you guessed it   218 miles per hour  The LS 218 sells for  38 888 Harley has hinted at plans for a smaller  lighter electric motorcycle and a scooter like electric vehicle sometime in 2021 22  Exact specifications have not yet been released The plan is to showcase the new technology in the LiveWire and then offer more accessible versions in the future  It s a bold move  The company is simultaneously going after new clientele with new products and new technology  They re betting on powerful brand recognition and an extensive dealer network to vault them past more nimble competition It s a difficult balancing act It s hard to bet against a company that has survived challenging conditions so many times in the past  but it s also easy to see Harley Davidson fading into relative obscurity amid high tech competition The Zacks Rank is a quantitative measure rather than a value judgement  but Harley s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  seems especially appropriate here  It s simply

165870,387386,HOG,EU Renews Warning to Trump of Potential  23 Billion Tariffs on U S  Goods,news," Bloomberg     The European Union is prepared to hit 20 billion euros   22 7 billion  of U S  goods with tariffs should President Donald Trump follow through on a threat to impose duties on EU cars and auto parts  said a senior trade official for the bloc 
The assertion by Jean Luc Demarty  director general for trade in the European Commission  the EU s executive arm  highlights the risk of a sudden escalation in trans Atlantic commercial tensions following a truce struck six months ago 
 We shall continue to face a U S  administration that is content to threaten trade measures even against close allies and partners and  in general  to disrupt the status quo in pursuit of its goals   Demarty told a European Parliament committee on Wednesday in Brussels   We should stay calm  
Europe is bracing for more possible U S  curbs on imports while seeking to show progress in enacting a political accord reached at the White House in July to  work together toward zero tariffs  zero non tariff barriers  and zero subsidies on non auto industrial goods   Last week  the commission unveiled a blueprint for a free trade deal with the U S  that would cut tariffs on a wide range of industrial goods including cars 
The July 25 pact between Trump and commission President Jean Claude Juncker put on hold the threat of U S  tariffs on EU cars and auto parts that would be based on the same national security grounds invoked for controversial American levies on foreign steel and aluminum  A U S  probe of automotive imports is due to be completed in February 
The metal duties as high as 25 percent prompted tit for tat retaliation by the EU last year on 2 8 billion euros of imports of a range of U S  products including Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   motorcycles  Levi Strauss   Co  jeans and bourbon whiskey  with the bloc reserving the right to target a further 3 6 billion euros of American goods by late March 2021 
U S  tariffs on European cars and auto parts would mark a significant escalation of trans Atlantic tensions because the value of EU automotive exports to the American market is about 10 times greater than that of the bloc s steel and aluminum exports combined  As a result  European retaliatory duties would target a bigger amount of U S  exports to Europe 
A 25 percent U S  levy on foreign cars would add 10 000 euros to the sticker price of European vehicles imported into the country  according to the commission 
 We should be ready to respond appropriately and effectively to any new trade restrictions that the U S  administration may create for us   Demarty said   We have prepared a draft list of imports from the U S  to the value of 20 billion euros on which re balancing action could be taken  
He said the 28 nation EU should reject any plan by the Trump administration for either tariffs or quotas on European automotive goods based on national security grounds  Last year  the bloc rejected a U S  demand for caps on European metal exports to the American market 
 If the administration issues a report in the next few weeks proposing import duties or quotas on European cars and car parts  we should be clear that we are not interested in any managed trade solution and that we will react if we are hit   Demarty said ",2019-01-23,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/eu-renews-warning-to-trump-of-potential-23-billion-tariffs-on-us-goods-1754529,1754529

165900,387416,HOG,Motorcycle companies in India s  Detroit  hit by strike over wages,news,"By Sudarshan Varadhan and Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI  Reuters    Hundreds of workers at motorbike companies including Yamaha Corp  T 7951  and  Eicher Motors   NS EICH  are on strike in the southern Indian city of Chennai  demanding better wages and a right to form unions to defend their interests 
Employees said the companies had employed a large number of contract workers to get around rigid Indian labor laws that make it difficult to hire and fire full time staff and have refused to bring them on company payrolls even after years of contract work 
The unrest is the latest to hit the state of Tamil Nadu  dubbed the Detroit of South Asia because big automakers such as BMW  DE BMWG    Daimler   DE DAIGn   Hyundai  KS 011760   Ford  N F   Nissan  T 7201  and  Renault   PA RENA  have factories in the state 
 Our main demands concern low wages  contract employees not being made permanent and workers being denied basic respect   said S Kannan  Kanchipuram district president at the Centre of Indian Trade Unions  one of the leaders involved in organizing the strike at Yamaha 
Kannan said that talks to resolve the strike had made no progress 
A spokesman at Yamaha  which sells in India as well as overseas  said that production is running below capacity 
Yamaha has a 4 percent share of India s two wheeler market  It sold about 793 000 motorcycles in the past financial year and exported about 252 000 
Wages are low in India  making it an attractive manufacturing and export hub for companies  but workers feeling the effects of rising inflation have been agitating in recent years for higher pay 
 The issue is not widespread  It is in pockets  but it is a cause of concern  especially since it is an industrial belt   said an executive at a global automaker 
In May protests turned violent at metals conglomerate Vedanta s copper smelter about 400 miles from Chennai over alleged environmental violations that the company said underlined the risks global businesses face in India 
The government has tried to overhaul labor laws  hoping to create millions of new jobs and boost economic growth by making it easier to hire and fire  but has faced resistance 
Workers at Eicher Motors  which owns the Royal Enfield motorcycle company  are protesting one such scheme  the National Employability Enhancement Mission  NEEM   said R Sampath  vice president of the Royal Enfield Employees Union 
 The scheme stops contract workers from becoming permanent employees  allows management to keep wages low and fire people with one month s notice   said Sampath  adding that contract workers do not receive other employee benefits 
Royal Enfield  which has about a 4 percent share of the two wheeler market and sold more than 800 000 motorcycles in India over the past financial year  is  hopeful of arriving at a mutually beneficial solution   it said in a statement  
 We have forums that address matters related to the wellbeing of workmen and are working to understand the issue that compelled a few workmen to refrain from reporting for work today   the company said

165901,387417,HOG,Trump trade war delivers farm boom in Brazil  gloom in Iowa,news,"By Jake Spring and Tom Polansek LU S EDUARDO  Brazil BOONE  Iowa  Reuters    The Bella Vita luxury condominium tower rises 20 stories over the boomtown of Lu s Eduardo Magalh es in northeastern Brazil  Its private movie theater and helipad are symbols of how far this dusty farming community has come since it was founded just 18 years ago  Local soybean producers shell out upwards of a half million U S  dollars to live in the complex  Nearby farm equipment sellers  car dealerships and construction supply stores are bustling too  Meanwhile  nearly 5 000 miles to the north in Boone  Iowa  farmers are hunkering down  At a recent agriculture trade show here  Iowa corn and soybean grower Steve Sheppard reflected the cautious mood   I m not buying any machinery  I m not spending any money   Sheppard said  Two countries  Same business  Two very different fates  The reason  China  A growing trade war between the United States and China is re ordering the global grains business  In response to Trump administration tariffs on Chinese goods  Beijing this year imposed levies on U S  agricultural products  Among them was a 25 percent tariff on soybeans  the single most valuable U S  farm export  U S  growers sold  12 billion worth to China last year alone  The fallout has been quick  China  the world s largest importer of soybeans  has scaled back purchases of U S  grain to feed its massive hog herd   It is turning instead to Brazil  which has ridden the wave of Chinese demand for two decades to become a global agricultural powerhouse  Brazilian soybean exports to the Asian country jumped 22 percent by value between January and September  compared to the same period a year ago  Brazilian producers are not only selling more grain  their soy is fetching  2 83 more per bushel than beans from the United States  up from a premium of just  0 60 a year ago  thanks to stepped up Chinese purchases   Prices for U S  soybeans  meanwhile  recently sunk to decade lows that farmers say are below the cost of production  The slump has made the agricultural sector a drag on an otherwise healthy U S  economy  The Trump administration said in July it would spend up to  12 billion in taxpayer funds to help U S  farmers offset trade related losses  although the aid package could shrink  Many American farmers  overwhelmingly conservative voters who helped propel Donald Trump to the presidency  are standing by their man  They believe he will eventually negotiate a better trade deal with China  whose appetite for soybeans is so vast that it cannot completely wean itself off U S  grain   But for the time being  Trump trade policies are handing precious market share  money and momentum to Brazil  the United States  most formidable agricultural competitor  Some fear the lost ground will be hard to reclaim   Bad news on tariffs in the U S  is good news for them   Robert Crain  general manager for the Americas for equipment dealer AGCO Corp  said about Brazilian farmers in an interview at the Iowa show   For a graphic on the diverging fortunes of farmers in the United States and Brazil  see     BOON TO BRAZIL Like their U S  counterparts  Brazil s farmers produce much more grain than is needed at home  Foreign customers are responsible for the country s agricultural boom  Nearly 80 percent of Brazil s soy exports now head to China  The city of Lu s Eduardo Magalh es is a testament to the importance of this international trade  Located in the state of Bahia  with farms stretching in every direction  the formerly unincorporated rural area in less than two decades has swelled to 85 000 people  That is bigger than Sioux City  Iowa s fourth largest city  Major employers in Lu s Eduardo  as most locals call the city  include fertilizer factories  seed producers and processors of soy and cotton  The area  relies 100 percent on agriculture   said Carminha Maria Missio  a farmer and president of the local growers union  While Brazil s overall economy is stuck in a ditch  the nation s farm sector rolled to 13 percent growth last year  The John Deere dealership in Lu s Eduardo saw its sales rise 15 percent in 2017 and is expecting double digit growth again this year  managing partner Chico Flores Oliveira said  The local real estate market is surging too  Another new luxury condo tower is slated to open next year  Single family homes are sprouting throughout the city  Prices for prime farmland are up 37 percent since 2012  according to consultancy Informa Economics IEG FNP   Brazil s total soy area is expected to expand to a record 36 28 million hectares this season due to robust Chinese demand  according to a Reuters poll of analysts  Farmers here also are bullish on this month s presidential election in Brazil  Far right candidate Jair Bolsonaro  who is leading in the polls  favors rolling back fines for farmers who deforest illegally or break other environmental laws  Like Trump  Bolsonaro  is wary of China  But producers here trust him not to blow it on trade    Rural producers support Bolsonaro emphatically   said Congresswoman Tereza Cristina  head of the powerful agriculture voting bloc in Brazil s Congress   We have access to him   and I am certain that he is smart and sensible   U S  FARM BELT PINCHED The outlook is much gloomier in Iowa  the long established heart of U S  agriculture   It is the nation s top corn producing state and the No  2 producer of soybeans  But its access to some global markets has suffered under Trump   The president walked away from the Trans Pacific Partnership  a trade agreement that would have opened valuable markets such as Japan to more American ag products  His renegotiation of the NAFTA accord had Mexico  the largest importer of U S  corn  exploring other suppliers  including Brazil  Now the Chinese are pulling back  Boone lays smack in the state s center  surrounded by miles of row crops  hogs and poultry  Farmland values here fell 12 percent from 2012 to 2017  according to Iowa State University  Worries about the U S  China trade war loomed over the recent Farm Progress show  which comes to town every other year  Equipment dealer Lee Randall jotted down prices at an auction of used tractors and implements at the show  Prices have dropped on trade tensions and low crop prices  he said  shaking his head as a green and yellow Deere   Co combine sold for  118 000 and another fetched  82 000    Five years ago you could have added 30 percent to every one of these pieces   said Randall  whose business  Randall Brothers  is based in Ohio   Nearby  Brett Begemann  chief operating officer for Bayer  DE BAYGN  Crop Science said farmers

165902,387418,HOG,Ford Says Trump Tariffs Make U S  Steel Costliest in the World,news," Bloomberg     Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co  said Donald Trump s tariffs have made steel more expensive in the U S  than any other market  escalating the company s criticism of the president s trade war 
 U S  steel costs are more than anywhere else in the world   Joe Hinrichs  Ford s president of global operations  said Monday at an event marking the start of Ranger pickup production at a factory west of Detroit  He added that Ford is talking to the administration about the tariffs   We tell them that we need to have competitive costs in our market in order to compete around the world  
Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett last month called on President Donald Trump s administration to resolve trade disputes quickly  warning that they would otherwise do more damage to the second largest American automaker  He said the company sustained a roughly  1 billion hit to profit despite the fact that it sources most of its metals from the U S 
Domestic hot rolled coil    the benchmark price for American made steel    has gained 28 percent in 2018 as the Trump administration implemented tariffs on imports  The levies helped push the price to about  920 a metric ton earlier this year  the highest in a decade 
 Babies 
Trump has portrayed his levies as key to getting other countries to cow to his trade demands  When celebrating a trade deal with Canada and Mexico to replace Nafta earlier this month  he referred to those who have complained about tariffs as  babies   The president also accused motorcycle manufacturer Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   of using them as an excuse to move jobs overseas 
It s been a rocky road for relations between Ford and Trump  He repeatedly attacked the company on the campaign trail in 2016 for announcing its intention to move small car production to Mexico  The automaker earned the president elect s praise for nixing that plan weeks before his inauguration 
Trump has since answered a call by Ford and other carmakers for the U S  to re examine fuel economy standards set by the Obama administration  The company received this relief with some trepidation  clarifying that it wasn t asking for a rollback to rules and didn t want the federal government to battle states led by California over their tougher standards 
China Challenges
Trump s steel and aluminum tariffs aren t the only way in which his trade policies have had an impact on Ford  In August  the automaker scrapped a plan to sell a new model called the Focus Active in North America  Ford cited the U S  slapping an additional 25 percent levy on vehicles imported from China  where the crossover will be built 
President Xi Jinping has gone tit for tat with Trump  matching his 40 percent tariff on imported vehicles  That s led Ford to reduce American exports to China  particularly of Lincoln models that it s trying to sell in the world s biggest auto market 
While Ford only imports a small number of vehicles into China  it s been struggling mightily in the market  Sales there have declined in 14 of the last 15 months and plunged 43 percent in September  as trade tensions combine with a stale lineup and dearth of sport utility vehicles to drag on demand 
 We encourage all counties    but especially the U S  and China    to work together   Hinrichs said   We think it s in the global economy s interest to do so

165910,387426,HOG,Trade War  Trump Will Flex Muscle Until US Elections ,opinion,"The world is about to enter into a real trade war  In our view  only significant protests among Trump voters or a quick surrender of US trade partners can prevent this  There are few signs this will happen anytime soon 

Trade  the war is on
Things have changed  In our analysis at the end of March  there was a real possibility that various trade partners would be permanently exempted from higher US tariffs and that others would give in to Trump s demands under the threat of elevated tariffs  thereby avoiding a broad trade war  At first  this seemed to be the case  South Korea  Brazil  Argentina and especially China made considerable concessions 
But in the run up to the G7 summit  Trump decided that his allies in Europe and his NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada would no longer be exempt from steel and aluminium tariffs  He also decided that the concessions offered by the Chinese were not enough to put the trade conflict between the US and China on hold  Trump ruled that a 25  tariff on  50 billion worth of imports from China  as a punishment for alleged theft of US intellectual property  would be implemented on 6 July  As a consequence  China  the EU  Canada and Mexico are hitting back 
And we fear there is more to come  China has threatened to impose its own tariffs on US products on Friday  which the US has warned will lead to tariffs on an additional  200 billion of Chinese export goods at a rate of 10   Trump has already warned that if the Chinese retaliate again  another package of goods worth  200 billion will be subject to higher tariffs as well 
In addition  the EU could see its car exports to the US hampered due to an import tax of 20  if the US Commerce Department s investigation concludes that imports of cars are a threat to national security  This measure could well be applied to other countries given that the current investigation encompasses imported cars from all countries  not just the EU   According to the Financial Times  the EU is considering a special deal with the US on cars  but many hurdles need to be overcome for this to become reality 
Trump overplays his hand
It is impossible to know how the trade war will evolve precisely from Friday onwards  so we consider three scenarios  One of the most important points to make here is that if President Trump steps up his protectionist measures afterwards  the US economy will join the rest of the world in suffering negative GDP effects  see figure 1   This is due to the fact that the positive effects of import substitution will no longer outweigh the negative effects that retaliation will have on US exports 

In the extreme third scenario  where the US charges an import tariff of 20  on imports from all countries and these countries do the same regarding their imports from the US  the American economy suffers a cumulative GDP loss that s three times as big as the rest of the world s within just 24 months  This is a consequence of the fact that US exporters would face a 20  tariff at the borders of all destination countries  while the rest of the world only face this tariff at the American border and trade among each other at prevailing tariffs 
The US economy and its trade balance would have been much better off if Trump had accepted the concessions that China offered during the negotiations  In particular  the offer to increase imports from the US by  70 billion would have been a much better result  The tariffs on Chinese imports in  for example scenario 3  are probably not even high enough to reduce imports by more than  70 billion and because American exports to China will decline due to Chinese retaliation  the net result in the bilateral trade balance will not even come close to  70 billion 
The scenarios also show that China will be hurt more than the EU because the US exports more to the EU than to China  So in the EU  retaliation leads to more GDP growth caused by import substitution than in China 
The table also shows that world trade will suffer more than world GDP  An all out trade war would drive down world trade growth by 2 6 percentage points in two years while the effect on world GDP would be  0 8 percentage points 
The most worrying aspect within this dispute is that Trump views his trade restricting measures as necessary to level the playing field for trade and he considers a response to retaliatory measures as unavoidable  This could mean a trade war escalates quickly 
When will this end 
When will Trump stop firing at his trade partners  To answer that question we need to know what his overall objective is  How many concessions from trade partners are needed for Trump to stop his war on trade  We don t know but Trump s attitude towards China indicates that he is aiming very high  He wants the bilateral trade deficit with China to be cut by more than half in two years  And the president seems reluctant to compromise  as seen by his refusal to accept China s offer to increase imports from the US by  70 billion 
Trump s ambition reduces the chance that further negotiations with China will lead to a result any time soon  And his recent remark that the EU may be  as bad as China  when it comes to trading fairly with the US  signals a lack of flexibility in the emerging negotiations with the EU on bilateral trade in cars 
In our view  there are only two events that could bring this trade war to an end  First  trade partners give in to Trump s demands  Secondly  internal resistance in the US against trade policy becomes too much  especially if Trump voters start to protest on a large scale  see figure 2  

Right now  there is little reason to be optimistic about any of this happening soon  First of all  we don t see a lot of domestic resistance from Trump voters against his policy  Ratings on Trump s economic policies are actually improving  Recent events also teach us that Trump is unmoved by objections from business leaders  He criticized Harley Davidson for shifting some operations out of the US while the American steel association s plea to exempt Canada from tariffs fell on deaf ears  Maybe Congress can stop Trump  but that remains to be seen 
Second  US trade partners could decide to give in to Trump s demands  but the concessions from China thus far are already quite generous and it seems unlikely that they ll meet Trump s demand to lower the trade deficit by  200 billion  And the EU  Well thus far  the bloc has been playing hardball with the US  The EU seems to be standing pretty firm in its defence of WTO rules 
Canada and Mexico are most dependent on demand from the US for their exports  making them the first likely candidates to acquiesce  But equally  it wouldn t make sense for an offshore El Dorado like Mexico to accept Trump s request for a sunset clause  which would scare away investors 
The world has to be prepared for an escalation of the trade conflict in the months to come  For now  Trump s voters back his stance on trade  suggesting he s unlikely to back down  particularly ahead of the mid term elections  where the Republicans will be fighting to hold onto a majority in the Senate  By the end of the year  the effect of the trade war on the US economy will become more visible  which might spark a rethink of his trade policy

165911,387427,HOG,Technically Speaking For The Week Of July 9 13,opinion,"Summary
Trade war tensions continue to escalate 
Commodity prices have dropped sharply 
The markets are in good technical shape 
The trade war drama goes on     and on     and on  The big news this week was the potential levying of an additional  200 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods  Some reports indicated that the administration was considering levying tariffs on all Chinese imports  which would total  500 billion  We re already starting to see news that companies are shifting operations as a result of the tariffs  Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG  was the first  BMW  OTC BMWYY  followed mid week  According to the NY Times  the average cost of the tariffs is  so far  a very small  60 person  But expect that number to eventually start rising 
The trade war is having an unexpected side effect  commodity prices are dropping sharply 


Above is a three month performance chart of ETFs that track grains  industrial metals  precious metals  copper and soft agricultural products  The best performer is the precious metals ETF  it s only down 7   Grains were the hardest hit  they re off almost 18   The good news here is this will help to contain inflationary pressure  which  according to the latest CPI report  was 2 9  overall and 2 3  core 
And speaking of commodity prices  oil prices took a big hit mid week thanks to news that Libya was ramping up production 


Oil prices are still far below levels that were a partial cause of the 2007 2009 recession  But the decline is still beneficial 
Turning to the market backdrop  GDP and earnings   we have a mixed prediction for 2Q GDP  The NY Fed s  Nowcast  is at 2 77  



While the Atlanta Fed s is 3 9  

And the second quarter earnings season is looking strong 

Total Q2 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  19 1  from the same period last year on  8 2  higher revenues  with double digit earnings growth for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors  including Finance and Technology  This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double digit earnings growth for the index  a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well 

Next up  let s look at the indexes  overall performance 

Overall  this was a good week  With the exception of the Russell 2000  all the indexes were up  The Dow and NASDAQ advanced slightly over 2   while the SPY increased about 1 5   The Treasury market was stable 
The three primary daily charts are all positive 

The QQQ has the best chart  It is in the middle of a rally that connects the lows of early April  late April  and late June  All the EMAs are advancing and prices are using the shorter EMAs for technical support  The MACD recently gave a buy signal and prices are at a one year high 

The SPYs are also in the middle of a three four month rally  Prices have broken through resistance in the upper 270s and are now targeting the highs established right after the first of the year 

The IWM have fallen back after attempting to hit a new high in the upper 160s 
Overall  the technical side of things is positive  EMAs are advancing and momentum is rising  Combine that with the potential support of a strong earnings season  and we could see this rally continue into the summer

165912,387428,HOG,Harley Davidson Breaks Below 41 10,opinion,"Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG tumbled on Monday after US President Trump backed a boycott of the company if it decides to move production overseas  Tensions between the President and the company have started following the EU s decision to respond to the steel and aluminum tariffs  by pledging to raise tariffs on US imports including Harley Davidson motorcycles  with the company announcing plans to shift production to overseas facilities 
From a technical standpoint  Monday s slide brought the price below the upside support line drawn from the low of the 3rd of May  and although the stock rebounded on Tuesday  the recovery stayed limited near that line  On Wednesday  Harley slid again  breaking below the 41 10 support barrier 
In our view  this may have opened the way towards the psychological round number of 40 00  also marked by the low of the 1st of June  If that level fails to stop the price from dropping further  then we may see downside extensions towards the 39 25 zone  defined by the low of the 3rd of May 
Taking a look at our short term oscillators  we see that the RSI hit support near its 30 line and turned up  while the MACD  although below both its zero and trigger lines  shows signs that it could start bottoming  These indicators suggest that a corrective bounce may be on the cards today before  and if  the bears decide to shoot again 
A move back above 41 10 could confirm the case and may open the way towards the crossroads of the aforementioned upside line and the 42 00 resistance level  marked by the inside swing lows of the 1st and 2nd of August  However  even if this is the case  we would still see a decent chance for the bears to jump back in from near the crossroads  We would like to see a clear close above 42 00 before we abandon the bearish case  Such a move could set the stage for upside extensions towards the 43 08 territory  the break of which could open the path for the 43 97 zone  defined by the peak of the 9th of August ",2018-08-16,JFD Team,https://www.investing.com/analysis/harley-davidson-breaks-below-4110-200338968,200338968

165917,387433,HOG,Wisconsin  Minnesota races could serve as barometer of voter intensity,news,"By James Oliphant WASHINGTON  Reuters    Voters had their say in primary races in the upper Midwestern states of Wisconsin and Minnesota on Tuesday  two key battlegrounds in November s congressional elections that could determine control of Congress   Polls in both states closed at 9 p m  ET  0100 GMT Wednesday   and returns were beginning to come in  States such as Wisconsin helped drive Donald Trump s surprising presidential win two years ago  and voter turnout there and in neighboring Minnesota could serve as a barometer of opposition strength headed into the midterm elections  Both states have shown signs of drifting rightward in recent years  Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate to win Wisconsin in 32 years  and he narrowly lost to Democrat Hillary Clinton in Minnesota   Trump s consistently low approval ratings and his trade policies  however  may have given Democrats renewed life   Foreign tariffs on U S  agricultural goods in retaliation for Trump s policies have become a central issue in the region  while Trump s feud with iconic Wisconsin motorcycle maker Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG  has placed Republicans there in an awkward position  That company s stock has lost 19 percent so far this year  Wisconsin voters signaled their unrest by turning out in large numbers and electing Democrats in a series of special state elections earlier this year  including a pair of wins in districts that had supported Trump in 2016 by wide margins  Democratic turnout has surged in congressional primary contests across the nation this year compared with the last midterm elections in 2014   In November  all 435 U S  House members and one third of the Senate are running for re election  Democrats need to add a net total of two Senate seats to seize control of that chamber from Republicans  In the House  Democrats need to win 23 seats to assume control  which would derail or stall much of Trump s policy agenda and increase congressional oversight and investigation of the administration   To that end  Democrats hope the number of party voters who participated in Wisconsin primaries on Tuesday approaches the 1 million who voted in the primary in 2016  a presidential year  compared with 300 000 votes for the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in 2014   More than 104 000 people had returned absentee ballots in the state through Tuesday  according to the state elections commission s Twitter account  That is roughly a 20 percent increase from the primaries held two years ago  Democrats would love to capture the Milwaukee suburban House district of Republican U S  House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan  who is leaving office  Ryan supports former aide Bryan Steil to replace him  but Steil must fend off a primary challenge from avowed white supremacist Paul Nehlen   Among Democrats  ironworker Randy Bryce was facing Cathy Myers  a local school board member   Democrats also chose a nominee to battle Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker  a former presidential candidate seeking a third term  That race will be another indicator of whether state voters have soured on Republican leadership    For Walker  it s going to be a tougher run for him than in 2010 and 2014   said Kenneth Mayer  professor of political science and an affiliate of the Elections Research Center at University of Wisconsin Madison   Wisconsin Republicans chose between Kevin Nicholson and Leah Vukmir to take on incumbent Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin in November   While Trump has endorsed neither candidate  Nicholson was originally backed by former Trump political adviser Steve Bannon and conservative Senator Ted Cruz of Texas  Vukmir has support from party establishment figures such as Walker and Ryan  Congressional analysts say Baldwin remains favored to keep her seat in November  TRADE FACTORS INTO MINNESOTA RACES In Minnesota  notable primaries in two House districts could help determine control of Congress  representing regions affected by Trump s trade policies   A bevy of Democrats were running in an open seat race in the northeastern part of the state known as the Iron Range  so called because of mining there  That region has seen some benefit from the administration s steel and aluminum tariffs   Trump has already campaigned in the district on behalf of the Republican favorite  Pete Stauber   In the south  two Republicans  Jim Hagedorn and Carla Nelson  squared off in a House district that Republicans hope to seize after the Democratic incumbent  Tim Walz  ran for governor  Farmers there have complained about harm from retaliatory tariffs from China and other countries   Minnesota s governor race featured former Republican governor and 2012 presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty  who is trying to get his old job back  He was running against Jeff Johnson  who lost to departing Democratic Governor Mark Dayton four years ago   Three Democrats were competing to succeed Dayton  including Walz  Erin Murphy  former majority leader of the state s lower house  and State Attorney General Lori Swanson   There s a sense among some that Walz may be more electable in the general and that may swing some more voters toward him   said Kathryn  Pearson   LON PSON   associate professor of political science at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis  Beyond the Upper Midwest  Connecticut and Vermont also held primaries on Tuesday   In Vermont  Christine Hallquist was poised to become the first openly transgender person to win a major U S  party nomination for statewide office after the Associated Press projected that she would win the Democratic governor s primary  
Senator Bernie Sanders  the former presidential candidate  easily won that state s Democratic Senate primary  But Sanders  as he has done before  is expected to decline the nomination and run as an independent ",2018-08-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/wisconsin-minnesota-primaries-to-gauge-strength-of-opposition-to-trump-1572975,1572975
165918,387434,HOG,Trump Tariffs Are Roadblock for Companies Hoping to Grow in U S ,news," Bloomberg     The maker of Sylvania light bulbs wants to expand its U S  manufacturing and add American jobs  just as Donald Trump advocates  But the president s tariffs are getting in the way 
LEDVANCE LLC said proposed duties on imported LED components are putting at risk efforts to shift production from China to plants in Kentucky and Pennsylvania  states where a  10 million upgrade last year means bulbs can be made four times faster and shipped more quickly to Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc  and other customers that want U S  made goods 
The company is among hundreds of U S  firms asking for relief from tariffs  which are meant to address a trade deficit with China and allegations of intellectual property theft  The White House says the economy is strong enough to absorb the impact of tariffs  and the long term payoff will make the short term pain of higher duties worthwhile 
Many businesses say the tariffs will increase their costs  forcing them to raise prices for consumers and even consider moving manufacturing offshore 
 The administration wants U S  production  they want U S  manufacturing  and in this particular case  they re driving the exact opposite effect   said Jennifer Dolin  regulatory affairs manager for Wilmington  Massachusetts based LEDVANCE 
 200 Billion
Trump has imposed tariffs on  50 billion in Chinese imports and identified an additional  200 billion in goods targeted for duties of as much as 25 percent  ranging from chemicals and seafood to vacuums and bicycles  Those duties could take effect after a comment period ends Sept  6 
Dolin and about 350 individuals from U S  companies  trade associations and other entities testified this month in six days of hearings on the duties  with most asking that products be spared  But there s little evidence that tensions between Washington and Beijing will ease up and allow the White House to scrap tariffs 
Speaking to reporters during his announcement Monday of a preliminary agreement with Mexico to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement  Trump said he is rejecting overtures from China to negotiate as he tries for a less  one sided  trade policy   It s just not the right time to talk right now   he said 
Reverse Ratio
LEDVANCE  which was sold last year to a Chinese investment consortium and has operations in more than 140 countries  makes Sylvania incandescent  halogen  fluorescent and LED light bulbs  The company produces about 30 percent of its LED bulbs in the U S  and 70 percent in China  But after upgrading plants in St  Marys  Pennsylvania  and Versailles  Kentucky  it planned to reverse that ratio and more than double production in the fiscal year starting Oct  1  Dolin said 
The company converted traditional production lines in the U S  to make LED bulbs  preserving the jobs of 200 workers and adding 20 new posts  The two facilities and supporting distribution centers employ about 650  she said 
Components imported from China to make LED bulbs are among the  200 billion in goods targeted for duties  and those parts are mostly made in China with limited other options to obtain them  Dolin said  While the duties would add costs to U S  production  there are no additional tariffs on finished bulbs imported from China  she said 
Increasing Costs
LEDVANCE is asking the administration to either remove the tariffs on the components  impose duties on imported bulbs  or both  The company s U S  factories could ramp up production if tariffs on imported bulbs boost demand for its American made products  Dolin testified last week in Washington 
The company doesn t think the administration intends to disadvantage U S  manufacturing and just wants  a level playing field so that U S  production is not more expensive than buying straight from China   she said 
Some company executives also say Trump s tariffs are increasing the cost of manufacturing in the U S  But they re reluctant to speak publicly because of the backlash firms such as Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   have received for moving some production overseas 
Trump has fired off angry tweets about the motorcycle manufacturer and even backed a boycott after the company announced in June it s shifting some production to sidestep tariffs from the European Union in retaliation for Trump s separate duties on steel and aluminum imports 
1 000 Jobs
Trump s tariffs also could affect plans announced by China based Wanhua Group to build a  1 2 billion chemical complex in Louisiana that the company estimates would create more than 1 000 jobs directly and indirectly in Louisiana  Texas and Pennsylvania 
The list of  200 billion in goods targeted for tariffs includes aniline  which the company plans to import from China to make methylenediphenyl diisocyanate  or MDI  James Newport  general manufacturing site manager for Wanhua Chemical US Operations LLC  testified last week  It s a chemical used primarily for foam insulation for residential and commercial construction  he said 
Newport declined to discuss the status of the project  announced last year and expected to open by 2021  as well as what impact the tariffs may have  But the company has asked to have chemical feedstock products removed from the tariff list and said its investment plans achieve Trump s goals of bringing manufacturing to the U S  and addressing the trade gap with China 
 What we re doing in our company is exactly what the administration is encouraging to happen   Newport testified ",2018-08-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump-tariffs-are-roadblock-for-companies-hoping-to-grow-in-us-1591965,1591965

165934,387450,HOG,Shares Of Harley Davidson  HOG  Slip 5 5  On EU Tariff Retaliation ,opinion,"Shares of Harley Davidson Inc    NYSE HOG   fell 5 5  by Monday afternoon with news that the firm will be moving a portion of its European consumer production out of the United States to its international facilities  This news comes after the European Union imposed  3 2 billion in tariffs on the US on Friday  on goods including motorcycles  denim  and cigarettes  amongst others 
The Big Picture
As our team   HOG foresees costs from these tariffs amounting to  100 million annually  and between  30 to  45 million for the rest of this year  The EU raised its 6  motorcycle tariff to 31   which according to the firm makes each bike  2 200 more expensive to export 
The firm also announced that it will not raise prices to cover costs  instead making this production shift to help soften the burden  HOG expects the increase in production in international plants to require incremental investment and to take between 9 to 18 months to be fully complete 
More details about the financial implications of this move  as well as plans to mitigate the effects of the tariff  will be released during the firm s Q2 earnings conference call in late July 
Money Talks 
Europe is a key segment for HOG  representing the second largest portion of the firm s total revenue  second only to the US  This news is the latest in a string of bad news for HOG  In its Q1 earnings report  HOG announced a 7 2  decrease in worldwide retail sales of motorcycles  guided primarily by weakening demand in the US  The firm believes the trend will continue  expecting to ship between 231 000 236 000 units of motorcycles in fiscal 2018  down from the 241 498 units in the previous year 
These trends are reflected in the stock s performance  which has seen a 16  loss in value over the last six months compared to the industry average of a 3  loss  Furthermore  the firm has seen a consistent downward trend in gross margin in recent quarters  falling 2 6  to 38 7  since Q4 2015  a reflection of rising costs and industry pains 
Outlook
Although recent news has been less than stellar  not all is bleak for the firm  The firm is making long term investments to expand its product portfolio  aiming to launch 100 new motorcycles by 2027  The firm also plans to release electric motorcycles by as soon as 2019 
Furthermore  HOG is increasing its international exposure  expecting an increase of 50  of yearly volume by 2027 and adding 150 200 new dealerships internationally by 2020  These initiatives will help reduce the effect of consumer trends in the US 
HOG currently sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and holds an  A  grade for Value in our Style Scores system  While the firm is projected to see a 2 6  decrease in EPS this fiscal year to  3 38  it is also projected to see a 17 1  increase next fiscal year to  3 96 based on recent earnings estimate revisions  Overall  the stock is one that investors should remain vigilant in monitoring moving forward

STOCKS  Trade concerns triggered another selloff in US stocks on Monday  The Nasdaq Composite led the way lower   2 09    while the S P 500   1 37   and the Dow Jones   1 33   followed in its footsteps  US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin hinted that the upcoming investment restrictions against China may be applied to other countries as well  while Harley Davidson   5 97   said it would move some production overseas to avoid retaliatory EU tariffs  Asian equities  on the other hand  were mixed  Japan s Nikkei 225 and Topix indices rose by 0 02  and 0 16  respectively  In Hong Kong  the Hang Seng was practically unchanged   0 01    while in China  the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 fell 0 83   In Europe  futures tracking all the major benchmarks are pointing to a positive open today  The same applies for US equity futures  the Dow  S P  and Nasdaq 100 are expected to open a little higher 
COMMODITIES  Oil prices are higher on Tuesday  recovering some of the losses from the previous session  Crude Oil WTI and Brent Crude are higher by 0 3  and 0 2  respectively today  buoyed by supply disruptions in Canada and Libya  On the other hand  though  the escalating trade conflict between the US and China was casting a shadow on the robust forecasts for oil demand over the coming years  dragging prices lower yesterday  In precious metals  gold is down by nearly 0 1   currently trading just above  1 264  The yellow metal continued to decline yesterday even despite the risk off sentiment seen in other assets and a pullback in the US dollar  two factors that typically support gold  Major movers  Risk aversion dominates as trade fears linger

Concerns regarding global trade remained the dominant market theme on Monday  diverting flows away from riskier assets such as stocks and into perceived safe havens  like the Japanese yen and US bonds  Major US stock indices closed the day notably lower  while dollar yen touched a fresh two week low of 109 35 and longer term US Treasury yields declined somewhat 
The moves followed some conflicting signals from the White House  First came US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin  who ignited the first wave of risk aversion after saying via a tweet that any investment restrictions into the US will not be specific to China  but would apply to all countries  trying to steal our technology   However  White House trade advisor Navarro soon told CNBC that there are  no plans to impose investment restrictions on any countries  and that  all we re doing is trying to defend our technology when it may be threatened   He also characterized the negative market reaction as a  large overreaction   Navarro s remarks triggered a rebound in risk sentiment  helping dollar yen and US stock indices to spike higher on the news  though his optimism was not enough to calm investors as the recovery quickly faded and markets resumed their slide 
The negative sentiment was likely amplified by reports that trade fears are already starting to disrupt supply chains  after Harley Davidson said it would move production for European customers overseas to evade retaliatory tariffs from the EU  Moving forward  trade developments could continue to dictate market action in the coming days  The next major announcement is likely to come on June 30  when the US is due to announce the specifics of its investment restrictions against China  Of utmost importance will be the extent and scope of these restrictions  as well as the magnitude and severity of any Chinese response 
Sterling dollar was down by nearly 0 1   while euro sterling was up by roughly the same percentage  ahead of a crucial EU summit on Brexit that commences Thursday 
Elsewhere  the antipodean currencies reacted as one would expect amid boiling trade tensions  by moving lower  Kiwi dollar is down by 0 2  and Aussie dollar by 0 05   both extending losses from yesterday  Day ahead  Trade and politics in focus  CaseShiller house price data and consumer confidence figures due out of the US
Tuesday s economic calendar does not feature much in terms of releases  with some data on house prices and consumer confidence being due out of the US  It appears that developments on the trade front  as well as political deliberations in Germany  have greater potential to move the markets rather than any of today s releases 
The CaseShiller indices gauging house prices in the US during the month of April will be made public at 1300 GMT  while the Conference Board will be releasing data on June s consumer confidence at 1400 GMT  Consumer sentiment as measured by the relevant index is anticipated to stand at 128 0  remaining unchanged relative to May s print 
Trade tensions continue to rank high in terms of investor focus  with market participants turning their attention to the Trump administration s trade and investment restrictions  as well as any retaliatory actions by trading partners of the US that could further escalate the situation  triggering a flight to safety at the expense of riskier assets such as stocks  Among others  a US Treasury release relating to technology investment restrictions will be closely watched 
Meanwhile  German Chancellor Angela Merkel will be holding talks with the leaders of the other parties in her coalition government  touching on euro area reforms and immigration policy  the latter is seen as posing threats to her government 
Among policymakers making appearances on Tuesday are Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan  1745 GMT   non voting FOMC member in 2018   Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic  1715 GMT   voting FOMC member in 2018  and ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos  1200 GMT   In energy markets  weekly API data on crude oil stocks are due at 2030 GMT  Technical Analysis  USD JPY bearish bias eases
USD JPY has gained some ground after reaching a two week low of 109 36 during Monday s trading  The bias remains to the downside as indicated by the negatively aligned Tenkan  and Kijun sen lines  though bearish momentum appears to have eased   this is also signaled by the flat Kijun sen 
Intensifying trade tensions are likely to see the yen attracting safe haven flows  thus weighing on USD JPY  Yesterday s two week low of 109 36 may provide support to declines  with the near four week low of 109 19 from June 8 lying not far below  Sharper declines will turn the attention to the region around 108 75 which experienced some congestion between late May and early June 
Easing tensions on the other hand are likely to boost USD JPY  Immediate resistance seems to be taking place around the current level of the Tenkan sen at 109 70  with the focus next turning to the zone around the 110 round figure  which includes the current levels of the 50  and 100  period moving average lines  at 110  12 and 110 03 respectively   as well as the Kijun sen  110 06   and the Ichimoku cloud bottom  110 04  and top  110 14

Traditional Markets
So far  the protectionist policies of Donald Trump have yet to hurt the international markets too badly  although this week has certainly been an exception to that 
Trump s announcement that he is considering a limit on Chinese investment in the USA tech firms  as highlighted in yesterday s market update  seems to have caused some tension within his own cabinet 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has apparently downplayed the possibility of these investment controls but Trump s Trade Advisor Peter Navarro was quick to rebuff by saying that America needs to be tough on China 
Tech stocks in the United States have been the worst hit as the Nasdaq declined more than 2   Asian and European stocks are also feeling the losses so far today 

Riding the Hog
In war  there are no winners  Even though Donald Trump has made some progress in showing how  unfair  trade has been so far  yesterday he took a big blow when this headline hit the news cycle   

The European Union has reportedly raised the tariffs on America s iconic bike maker from 6  to 30  in response to Trump s new policies  which is causing the motorcycle maker to take their show on the road 
Shares in Harley Davidson  NYSE HOG  where hit hard yesterday 

Trump supporters were quick to point out that the company was already in the midst of restructuring their production methods and that the timing here is simply a matter of convenience 
Still  the Financial Times reports that   

Crypto Eyes on Argentina   Iran
Economic protests have popped up today in both Argentina and Iran  which is notable given that these are two countries that we have been watching closely as possible hotbeds for increased adoption of Bitcoin 
As if by some twist of fate  I happened to spot another traveler on Reddit today  who happens to be in Argentina at the moment and was able to use Bitcoin Cash in order to withdraw some local currency following an issue with his bank   

Bitcoin was created in 2009 to provide an alternative to the fiat monetary system  Especially in places where mass inflation is a prevalent issue  a new form of digital asset is very useful for providing a stable currency outside the control of governments and banks 
Here we can see a graph of Bitcoin against both the Argentinian Peso and the Iranian Rial over the last year 

For those  asking me  when will Bitcoin go back up again   I really can t say  It s still not clear whether the demand from these countries is enough to sustain the support at  6 000 alone 
Certainly  if Japan and South Korea step in on the buy side it would drive prices upwards as would new institutional flows into this market  But as long as the price is traveling South  it s difficult to see any of these players stepping in too heavily 
What is clear is that once the momentum does build again on the buy side  there are a lot more interested parties waiting on the sidelines now 
Wishing you an amazing day ahead

165939,387455,HOG,AUD JPY  How FX Traders Will Know A Trade War Has Begun,opinion,"Another day  another round of trade war tweets drawing the attention of traders 
To extend the trade war analogy  Tuesday morning s causality was due to friendly fire  In a series of tweets  US President Trump criticized the iconic American manufacturer Harley Davidson  NYSE HOG   which has shifted some of its production overseas as a result of increased duties 
The motorcycle company is caught between a rock and a hard place  As a global manufacturer  Harley Davidson was already feeling the squeeze from the recently imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum  Now  with other nations viewing it as a swing state target to strike at Trump s political support  the company faces tariffs on its overseas sales  To make matters worse  the company s target market is aging and it has struggled to make inroads with younger consumers 
Watch This Pair
Regardless of what happens with HOG  it appears that traders still haven t reached a tipping point when it comes to trade fears  Switching gears to the FX market  one of the best proxies for global trade concerns  and risk appetite in general  is AUD JPY  Because the Australian economy relies heavily on exporting raw materials  primarily metals   it would be one of the big losers of an escalated  prolonged trade war  Meanwhile  the yen remains one of the premier safe haven currencies that traders buy when they feel worried about global economic growth 
Looking at the chart  AUD JPY remains trapped within the same 400 pip range that has contained rates for the past four months  The pair continues to see strong support near 80 50  with resistance capping the unit any time it makes a run at 84 50 
If and when the market becomes truly concerned with the budding trade wars having a material impact on global economic growth  we would expect AUD JPY to slice through 80 50 support  opening the door for a continuation down toward the Q3 2016 support zone near 76 00  Alternatively  if the trade tensions show signs of fading  AUD JPY could break 84 50 resistance and make a run toward the year to date highs up around 89 00 heading into the fall

165944,387460,HOG,Trump hails growth as one offs and consumers boost economy,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years in the second quarter as consumers boosted spending and farmers rushed shipments of soybeans to China to beat retaliatory trade tariffs before they took effect in early July  President Donald Trump  who ahead of Friday s release of the gross domestic product report had promoted the notion that second quarter growth would be robust  declared victory   We have accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions   Trump told reporters   These numbers are very  very sustainable    Gross domestic product increased at a 4 1 percent annualized rate also as government spending picked up  the Commerce Department said in its snapshot of second quarter GDP  While that was the strongest performance since the third quarter of 2014  it was not the best since the recession ended in mid 2009  January March quarter GDP growth was revised up to a 2 2 percent pace from the previously reported 2 0 percent rate to account for updated information and methodology improvements  Compared to the second quarter of 2017  the economy grew 2 8 percent  Output expanded 3 1 percent in the first half of 2018  putting the economy on track to hit the Trump administration s target of 3 percent annual growth  A measure of domestic demand surged at a 4 3 percent rate in the second quarter   Contrary to Trump s assertions  the economy enjoyed periods of robust growth during the Obama administration  GDP growth recorded a 5 1 percent pace in the second quarter of 2014 and the economy experienced four quarters of output above a 4 0 percent rate  Economists also cautioned against putting much weight on the surge in second quarter growth as one off factors  including a  1 5 trillion tax cut package  were behind the growth spurt  The soybean boost is likely to reverse in the coming quarters and the fiscal stimulus is seen fading in 2019    Pop the champagne today  but don t get used to it  growth going forward has a lot of headwinds   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York   Unless you cut taxes again  there won t be additional tax cut monies to line company and consumer pocket books   The United States slapped 25 percent duties on  34 billion worth of Chinese goods effective July 6  provoking a similar response from Beijing  which targeted soybeans and other agricultural products as well as U S  made cars   Trump has also imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports  leading to retaliation by the United States  main trade partners  including Canada  the European Union  Mexico and China   Strong growth in the April June quarter likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates two more times this year  The U S  central bank increased borrowing costs in June for the second time this year and forecast two more rate hikes for 2018  The GDP report showed the Fed s preferred inflation gauge  the personal consumption expenditures  PCE  price index excluding food and energy  increased at a 2 0 percent rate in the second quarter  The core PCE price index rose at a 2 2 percent pace in the January March period  The dollar was little changed versus a basket of currencies  U S  Treasury yields fell and stocks on Wall Street were down  GROWTH SEEN SLOWING  While trade war fears helped to boost output last quarter  import duties are seen undercutting economic growth  with higher prices for goods discouraging consumer spending and businesses shelving investment plans  Economists in a Reuters poll earlier this week predicted that growth will slow notably from here   The spring quarter could be the high water mark for growth   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania   That said  there is every reason to expect that growth in the second half of the year will still be in the 3 percent range    Growth in consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  increased at a 4 0 percent rate in the second quarter  That was the fastest in 3 1 2 years and followed the January March period s stall speed pace of 0 5 percent   Households bought motor vehicles and spent more on health care  utilities  food and accommodation in the last quarter   Consumer spending is also being driven by a robust labor market  which created an average of 215 000 jobs per month in the first half of this year  The front loading of deliveries of soybeans and other goods boosted exports in the second quarter  which grew at their quickest pace in 4 1 2 years  sharply narrowing the trade deficit  Trade added 1 06 percentage points GDP growth in the second quarter after being neutral in the January March period  The rush to offload soybeans  however  depleted farm inventories  Inventories declined at a  27 9 billion rate after rising at a  30 3 billion pace in the first quarter  They subtracted 1 0 percentage point from GDP growth  Business spending on equipment slowed and a further moderation is likely  with trade wars casting a pall on the business spending outlook  General Motors Co  NYSE GM   Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Wednesday cut their full year profit forecasts  citing higher steel and aluminum costs   Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG  has warned that more expensive steel and aluminum and a 25 percent retaliatory duty imposed by the European Union on shipments from the United States could cost

165967,387483,HOG,What To Watch As Trump s Deadline For Tariffs On EU Metals Looms,opinion,"Europe s exemption from U S  metal tariffs ends Friday
EU insists on  unconditional exemption  as it preps retaliation
Quotas on European exports could be the only  solution 

Although U S  President Donald Trump granted a 30 day extension to the European Union s exemption from metal tariffs on April 30  that June 1 deadline this coming Friday is fast approaching  The lack of details on any possible deal has proved vexing for EU politicians and left markets mired in uncertainty over the final outcome  Indeed  it appears there s been little progress toward any sort of agreement 
Talks Down To The Wire  EU Preps Retaliatory Moves
Back in March  Trump implemented tariffs of 25  on steel imports and 10  on aluminum  but gave temporary exemptions to the EU for an additional month  European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has been holding discussions with U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in an attempt to avoid an all out trade war between the two continents 
While the EU has repeatedly called for an unconditional exemption from the metal tariffs which it alleges are illegal under World Trade Organization rules  Malmstrom has expressed skepticism over a U S  waiver for Europe 
Conversations are expected to take place on the sidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  forum in Paris this Wednesday  Ironically  perhaps  the conference theme is  What Brings Us Together  
There will also likely be additional discussion beginning Thursday at a roundup of G7 finance ministers  development ministers and central bank governors taking place in Canada 
But the lack of any sort of progress has raised hackles  at least among European Union politicians  The Union has threatened that  barring a permanent waiver from U S  import duties  it would retaliate by implementing 25  tariffs on about  2 8 billion   3 26 billion  of American imports beginning June 20  The duties imposed would primarily target states that supported Trump in the presidential elections and include Harley Davidson  NYSE HOG  motorcycles  Levi s jeans and or Kentucky bourbon 
That would compare to  5 3 billion   6 17 billion  of steel and  1 1 billion   1 3 billion  of aluminum that the EU exported to the U S  in 2017  according to data compiled by Bloomberg 
Outcome Lacks Clarity  Quotas Predicted
Despite several conversations with Ross  Malmstrom admitted last week that  we have no clarity yet   Ross had indicated that the U S  would only waive metal tariffs for those countries that agreed to quotas on their exports  thereby supporting demand for U S  metals in the domestic marketplace  South Korea and Argentina have already agreed to such quotas in exchange for exemptions 
Malmstrom has said that U S  measures could potentially cap EU exports at 90  of their 2017 levels in exchange for waivers  implying lower European output  EU Commission President Jean Claude Juncker  speaking at the EU summit press conference in Sofia  Bulgaria on May 17 was inflexible in his stance toward any form of compromise    I have to be very clear  and I am repeating myself by saying it  we want an unlimited exemption from the proposed tariffs  
European leaders reportedly produced a proposal at that meeting to include talks to deepen energy cooperation in the field of liquefied natural gas likely meant to play to Trump s desire for the U S  to become an energy powerhouse  voluntary regulatory cooperation and an agreement to improve reciprocal market access by slashing tariffs  especially for industrial products such as cars 
However  nearly two weeks later and with the June 1 deadline on the horizon  the proposal appears to have been ignored by the Trump administration  Adding an additional insult  just last week Trump was reported to have launched an investigation into the possibility of imposing tariffs of up to 25  on imported vehicles  making the future of unrestricted European trade with the U S  even murkier 
Though it s not apparent whether Trump s aggressive rhetoric and hard deadline are his bottom line or simply part of a bargaining tactic meant to secure less extreme concessions  as the clock runs down  one thing seems increasingly probable the current trade relationship between the U S  and the EU will likely undergo a change no matter what finally transpires  As Malmstrom told the EU Parliament on Tuesday   Realistically  if the U S  decides to refrain from applying duties I expect them nonetheless to want to impose some sort of cap on EU exports  ",2018-05-30,Jason Martin/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-to-watch-as-trumps-deadline-for-eu-metals-tariffs-looms-200320393,200320393

  FOREX  The US dollar index is a little more than 0 1  higher on Friday  ahead of the release of the always important US employment report at 1230 GMT  Elsewhere  the Canadian dollar dived yesterday following discouraging news on the trade front  while the euro continued to regain ground as Italy s political impasse came to an end 
  STOCKS  Wall Street closed lower on Thursday  as an escalation of trade tensions suppressed risk appetite  The Dow Jones fell by 1 02   while the S P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite shed 0 69  and 0 27  respectively  That said  futures tracking the Dow  S P  and NASDAQ 100 are all currently pointing to a notably higher open today  which may be owed to news that a government was finally formed in Italy  ending a prolonged political vacuum  In Asia  Japan s Nikkei 225 declined 0 14  but the TOPIX rose by 0 1   while in Hong Kong  the Hang Seng climbed by 0 21   Europe was a much more optimistic story  with futures tracking all the major indices being well into the positive territory  In particularly  the Italian FTSE MIB and the Spanish IBEX 35 are expected to open higher  with futures tracking them being up by 2 6  and 1 07  respectively  as political risks in both nations appeared to be easing 
  COMMODITIES  Oil prices are practically unchanged on Friday  after posting hefty losses in the previous session  Both WTI and Brent crude slumped as the announcement of tariffs by the US clouded the outlook for global trade  something that could hurt oil demand moving forward  Even a larger than anticipated drawdown in the weekly EIA crude inventory data was not enough to support prices for more than a few minutes  In precious metals  gold prices are also nearly flat today around  1 300 per ounce  The yellow metal finished the day lower yesterday despite trade risks coming back to the forefront  it started sliding after it found fresh sell orders near its 200 day moving average once again  That zone has been acting as a reliable resistance barrier recently  and as long as the price action remains below it  the metal s technical outlook stays negative  Major movers  Global trade risks heighten as European political risks fade
The  trade war  narrative got yet another chapter yesterday  after the US announced it will proceed with slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU  Canada  and Mexico  The EU said it would announce its own counter tariffs within hours  which will be aimed at signature US products such as bourbon and Harley Davidson  NYSE HOG  motorbikes  These are predominantly made in Republican states  thus targeting Trump s voter base  Mexico and Canada replied in similar fashion to the EU  drawing a warning from President Trump that the US will agree to a fair NAFTA deal  or  no deal at all   Both the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso slumped  while the US dollar remained largely unfazed 
While the situation has clearly escalated  and tit for tat tariffs will be announced soon by nations who have long been traditional US allies  the market response was surprisingly calm  Sure  US stock markets ended the day lower and haven currencies like the yen gained a little ground against the dollar  but the magnitude of these moves was nothing like one would expect in case investors were pricing in a material deterioration in global trade  This suggests investors still view these moves as  hardball  negotiating tactics from the US aimed at drawing out concessions  and believe the situation will eventually be resolved through talks instead of evolving into a full fleshed trade war 
Moving forward  things could get worse before they get better  The US is currently investigating whether it should introduce tariffs on car imports  something that would disproportionally single out car making nations like Germany  and set the stage for more retaliatory measures by the EU 
In Europe  political risks appear to be fading at a very rapid pace  A coalition government has been agreed in Italy after several months of uncertainty  The two anti establishment parties agreed on a new economy minister  after their previous pick was rejected by the Italian President for being euro skeptic  he will now serve as foreign minister   Italian bond yields fell sharply  while the euro continued to recover ground and looks ready to close the week in positive territory against the dollar 
In Spain  even though PM Mariano Rajoy will probably lose a no confidence vote today  a political deadlock will likely be avoided as the leader of the socialist party  Pedro Sanchez  appears to have enough votes to become the new PM  Day ahead  US employment report firmly in focus  trade developments also eyed
The US jobs report dominates the attention out of today s releases  while any updates on global trade will also be eyed after the Trump administration s decision to proceed with the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum from countries that are considered traditional US allies 
The Markit s final release of eurozone manufacturing PMI for May due at 0800 GMT is anticipated to confirm the reading at 55 5  While comfortably above the 50 level  thus denoting expansion  this would also constitute the lowest print since February last year  economic momentum is easing in the euro area 
Politics remain at play in Europe and can affect positioning on the euro  In Italy  the two anti establishment parties 5 Star Movement and League have come to an agreement on forming a government after all  Meanwhile in Spain  Mariano Rajoy is expected to be ousted from the position of prime minister in a no confidence vote today in parliament  However  the situation in the country is more of an internal one  rather than pose risks for the rest of Europe   anti establishment forces are not expected to take power as is the case in Italy 
Manufacturing PMI data for May will also be made public out of the UK  at 0830 GMT  This will be the first and only release   as opposed to the eurozone that also sees the release of preliminary estimates   and therefore it might prove more market moving that the respective eurozone release earlier in the day  The relevant index is projected to further deteriorate  specifically to come in at 53 5  from 53 9 in April   its lowest since late 2006  A data miss could further push back in time market participants  expectations for a Bank of England rate hike  consequently exerting selling pressure on sterling 
At 1230 GMT  the focus will turn to the nonfarm payrolls report for May out of the US  which also happens to be the last employment report before the Federal Reserve completes a meeting on monetary policy on June 13  Nonfarm payrolls are forecast to have increased by 188k  vs 164k in April   while the unemployment rate is expected to remain at 3 9   its lowest since 2000  Most interest though is yet again likely to fall on wage growth which is seen as having the capacity to stoke inflationary pressures  In this respect  average earnings are anticipated to grow at a faster pace in May compared to April on both an annual  2 7  vs 2 6   and monthly  0 2  vs 0 1   basis 
Other US data hitting the markets throughout the rest of the day include Markit s final manufacturing PMI for May  1345 GMT   April s construction spending figures  1400 GMT   the ISM s manufacturing PMI for May  1400 GMT   and May s total vehicle sales  1930 GMT  
The trade war narrative is back after the US decided to proceed with tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada  Mexico and the EU  bringing to an end the two month exemption period it had granted previously  Some of the parties involved have already retaliated and should the situation escalate  then shock waves might reverberate across international financial markets  It should also be kept in mind that developments are expected to have implications not just for currency markets  but also equity  fixed income and commodities  Also trade related  US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross will be visiting Beijing on Saturday for more discussions with Vice Premier Liu He  The US and China have also gotten more confrontational ahead of the meeting 
In energy markets  the US Baker Hughes oil rig count is due at 1700 GMT  Also of interest to oil traders  is a planned meeting in Kuwait City on Saturday where Saudi Arabia  Kuwait and the U A E  will be discussing supply 
In terms of policymakers  appearances  Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves will be talking about current monetary policy issues at 1000 GMT  while Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari   non voting FOMC member in 2018   will be participating in a panel discussion at 1255 GMT  However  the topic of discussion is such that renders any market sensitive comments unlikely  Lastly  Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane will be giving a lecture at 1310 GMT  Technical Analysis  USD JPY looks bullish in the short term after bounce from 6 week low
USD JPY has advanced after hitting a six week low of 108 10 on Tuesday  The RSI continues to rise  having crossed above the 50 neutral perceived level  in favor of a positive picture in the short term 
An upbeat jobs report out of the US  especially on the wage growth front  is expected to boost the pair  Resistance seems to be taking place at the moment around the upper Bollinger band at 109 14  this level itself was violated but the area around it seems to still act as a barrier   The regions around the 50 period moving average at 109 43 and the 100 period MA at 109 79   including the 110 round figure   could act as additional barriers to stronger bullish movement 
Disappointing data out of the US  on the other hand  are likely to push USD JPY lower  Potential support to declines might come around the middle Bollinger line at 108 81   this is a 20 period MA line    the lower Bollinger band at 108 48  and the six week low of 108 10 from earlier in the week 
Other US releases  as well as any safe haven flows on the back of trade uncertainty  can also move the pair ",2018-06-01,XM Group,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trade-tensions-escalate-as-political-risks-fade-us-nfp-the-datahighlight-200321253,200321253
165969,387485,HOG,Trade Continues To Weigh On A Confident Market  While Cycles Point To Correction ,opinion,"Summary 

The stock market fell last week  with the S P 500  SPX  down 26 points to 2754  a decline of 0 9  
Trade jitters continued to press on stocks  primarily the Dow   but led by the Russell 2000  stocks started lower and then pushed higher on most days 
Our projection this week is for stocks to attempt a rally to 2775  but then fail to 2742  

While the S P 500 finished the week lower  stocks started nearly every day lower and then rallied during the regular trading session  This week also brought the continued divergence between the major stock indexes  The large companies in the Dow Jones fell 2  on the week while the small firms in the Russell gained 0 8   This was due in part to an expectation that protectionist trade policies may expose the Dow s multinational companies to greater risks 
On Monday  the S P 500 fell 0 3  to 2773  Markets opened lower after China announced retaliatory measures in response to President Trump s threat to impose 25  tariffs on  50 billion worth of Chinese goods  However  led by small caps  stocks rallied for most of the regular trading session  which cut losses significantly 
On Monday evening  Trump threatened another  200 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods  which pushed stock futures lower  The Senate then passed a bill that would reimpose the sanctions on Chinese technology giant ZTE  This may have added to the downward pressure as Trump was using the ZTE sanction as a bargaining chip in the trade negotiations 
On Tuesday  the S P 500 fell 0 4  to 2762  With stocks opening lower  they again rallied led by the Russell  which finished the day in positive territory  The Dow also attempted to rally but finished the day 1  lower  Meanwhile  May building permits missed expectations at 1 3 million compared to estimates of 1 35 million and the April figure of 1 36 million 
On Wednesday  the S P rose 5 points  after the European Union announced  3 2 billion in retaliatory trade measures  These will include not only automobiles but also bourbon and Harley Davidson  NYSE HOG  motorcycles  Similar to the Chinese tariffs  the Europeans targeted states that voted for Trump in the 2016 election 
On Thursday  the S P 500 fell 0 6  to 2750  Daimler warned that it expected the evolving trade war to affect its bottom line  which pushed the auto sector lower  As well  the Philadelphia Federal Reserve announced the June reading for its manufacturing index at 19 9  below estimates of 28 9 and the May figure of 34 4 
On Friday  the stock market rose 4 points to 2754  after OPEC came to an agreement that it would increase oil production by 1 million barrels per day  Remarkably  oil futures rose over 5  on the day  This could imply that investors expected a larger increase  Yet one member country commented that the actual increase could be less due to a weakened ability to increase output on the part of Iran and Venezuela 
Given last week s active news cycle  volatility remained relatively subdued  with the VIX ranging between 12 25 and 14 74  This was due in part to the fact that stocks rallied every session except for Thursday  Should this give us greater confidence in the strength of the market  Or does this imply that worsening conditions could lead to a broader sell off 
Our Projection for the S P 500 This Week
According to the askSlim Stock Index Report for this week  our analysis is that the S P 500 will attempt to rally to 2775  but then fail and fall to the 2742 area  A break below 2742 would increase downside risks significantly  In the following weeks  we expect more downside  namely decline of 75 125 points  Our analysis is depicted on the chart above  with the brackets on the bottom representing the market cycles

166001,387517,HOG,Trump says security panel can protect U S  technology from China,news,"By Steve Holland and David Lawder WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump on Tuesday endorsed U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin s measured approach to restricting Chinese investments in U S  technology companies  saying a strengthened merger security review committee could protect sensitive American technologies  Trump  in remarks to reporters at the White House  said the approach would target all countries  not just China  echoing comments from Mnuchin on Monday amid a fierce internal debate over the scope of investment restrictions due to be unveiled on Friday   It s not just Chinese  investment  Trump told reporters when asked about the administration s plans  Mnuchin and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro sent mixed signals on Monday about the Chinese investment restrictions  ordered by Trump on May 29  Mnuchin said they would apply to  all countries that are trying to steal our technology   while Navarro said they would be focused specifically on China  The restrictions are being developed to help put pressure on China to address the administration s complaints that it has misappropriated U S  intellectual property through joint venture requirements  unfair licensing policies and state backed acquisitions of U S  technology firms  Mnuchin would prefer to use new tools associated with pending legislation to enhance security reviews of transactions by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States  CFIUS   some administration officials have said  A government official told Reuters on Sunday that Treasury had been working on a proposal to ban acquisitions of U S  firms with  industrially significant technology  by companies with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership  Asked about the pending restrictions at a White House meeting with Republican lawmakers on Tuesday  Trump said   We have the greatest technology in the world  People copy it  And they steal it  but we have the great scientists  we have the great brains and we have to protect that and we re going to protect it and that s what we re doing   And that can be done through CFIUS  We have a lot of things we can do it through and we re working that out   he said  Prior to the meeting  Mnuchin was seen by reporters in the West Wing of the White House  A Treasury spokesman did not respond to a Reuters request for comment  The U S  House of Representatives passed legislation on Tuesday to strengthen the authority of CFIUS by a 400 2 vote  with many similarities to a Senate passed bill  Both versions would expand CFIUS reviews to minority stakes in U S  companies and investments that may reveal information on critical infrastructure to foreign governments  TRADE TENSIONS MAY SHIFT FED POLICY Trump s intensifying list of trade disputes with China  the European Union  Canada and Mexico showed signs of influencing Federal Reserve policy on Tuesday  Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said in Birmingham  Alabama  that increased tensions could cause him to oppose a fourth rate increase this year  Trump said earlier on Twitter that his administration was  finishing up  its study of tariffs on U S  car imports  suggesting that he would take action soon  The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers  a trade group  said it would file written comments in the study warning that a 25 percent tariff on imported passenger vehicles would cost American consumers  45 billion annually  or  5 800 per vehicle  Tariffs of 25 percent on an initial  34 billion worth of Chinese imports are due to take effect on July 6  with a further  16 billion undergoing a vetting process for activation later this summer  Should China follow through on its vow to retaliate in equal measure with tariffs on U S  soybeans  cars and other goods  Trump has threatened to impose 10 percent tariffs on a further  400 billion worth of Chinese goods  A Reuters analysis of the tariff lists found that most of the Chinese products targeted thus far are classified as intermediate or capital goods   avoiding a direct tax on voters   but many consumer goods have been caught up in the net  and will be targeted in future rounds

166003,387519,HOG,U S  business spending on equipment cooling  trade gap narrowing,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    New orders for U S  made capital goods and shipments unexpectedly fell in May  but upward revisions to data for the prior month pointed to moderate growth in business spending on equipment in the second quarter  Other reports on Wednesday showed a sharp narrowing in the goods trade deficit last month  the latest indication that the economy was accelerating this quarter after losing some steam at the start of the year  There are  however  fears that escalating tensions between the United States and its major trade partners  including China  Mexico  Canada and the European Union  could hurt business sentiment  disrupt supply chains and undercut economic growth   Factory managers are worried about the prospects of a full blown trade war   said Ilir Hysa  a senior economist at Moody s Analytics in West Chester  Pennsylvania   That said  the sentiment reflected in the manufacturing surveys is not rattled  But trade policy tensions are clearly a major hurdle   The Commerce Department said orders for non defense capital goods excluding aircraft  a closely watched proxy for business spending plans  slipped 0 2 percent last month  April data was revised to show the so called core capital goods orders surging 2 3 percent instead of the previously reported 1 0 percent rise  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders gaining 0 5 percent last month  Orders increased 6 8 percent on a year on year basis  Shipments of these goods dipped 0 1 percent last month after an upwardly revised 1 0 percent increase in April  Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government s gross domestic product measurement  They were previously reported to have gained 0 9 percent in April  The drop in core capital goods shipments last month did little to dampen expectations of robust GDP growth in the second quarter  Business spending on equipment increased at a 5 5 percent annualized rate in the first quarter and most economists expected a similar pace of growth in the April June period  In other data  the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit declined 3 7 percent to  64 8 billion in May as an increase in exports outpaced a rise in imports  The department also said wholesale inventories increased 0 5 percent in May and stocks at retailers gained 0 4 percent   The smaller goods trade deficit was seen offsetting an anticipated drag from inventory investment  Reports on the labor market and consumer spending have suggested that economic growth surged in the second quarter  Gross domestic product estimates for the April June period are as high as a 5 3 percent rate  The economy grew at a 2 2 percent pace in the first quarter  HOUSING LAGGING But housing continues to lag the strong economy  with reports on Wednesday showing contracts to buy previously owned homes falling again in May and applications for loans to purchase a home declining sharply last week  The housing market is being hobbled by land and labor shortages  leading to a dearth of houses available for sale  The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies and prices for U S  Treasuries rose  Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher  The slowdown in business spending on equipment is despite the Trump administration s  1 5 trillion income tax cut package  which came into effect in January  Some economists blamed the strengthening U S  dollar and warned that the government s protectionist trade policy could restrain business investment   President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to protect domestic industries from what he says is unfair foreign competition  Trump has also said he would press ahead with hefty tariffs on  50 billion of Chinese imports and threatened to impose a 20 percent duty on all imports of European Union assembled cars   China  Mexico  Canada and the European Union have retaliated in kind  Harley Davidson Inc  N HOG  said on Monday it would move production of motorcycles exported to the European Union from the United States to its international facilities and forecast the trading bloc s retaliatory tariffs would cost the company  90 million to  100 million a year   Increasing trade protectionism could raise uncertainty and lower confidence  undermining the otherwise positive conditions   said Greg Daco  chief U S  economist at Oxford Economics in New York  The decline in orders last month was almost broad  Orders for electrical equipment  appliances and components tumbled 1 5 percent  the biggest drop in six months  Orders for computers and electronic products fell 0 1 percent while those for fabricated metals decreased 1 2 percent   There were also declines in orders for primary metals  But orders for machinery rose 0 3 percent  extending April s 1 7 percent increase  Overall orders for durable goods  items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more  dropped 0 6 percent in May as demand for transportation equipment fell 1 0 percent  That followed a 1 0 percent decrease in durable goods orders in April

The Richmond Fed manufacturing index data for June due 10 00 am ET is expected to decrease to 15 from a reading of 16 the prior month 
Potential clues on U S  monetary policy will likely also garner attention with a speech by Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President  Raphael Bostic  at 1 00 p m  ET and Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kapan slated for 1 45 p m  ET 
The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies on Monday amid fears the United States is reportedly drawing up fresh tariffs  White House trade adviser Peter Navarro attempted to ease investor jitters  insisting that  things are bullish here in America  
2  Draw in Crude Supplies to Continue

Crude oil futures fell 50 cents to settle at  68 08 a barrel as traders continued to assess OPEC s decision to lift output  while a supply outage inCanada kept losses in check 
3  Harley Davidson to Bounce Back From Ride Lower 
Shares of Harley Davidson were showing fighting spirit in after hours trade following a sharp fall Monday after the company confirmed its motorcycles exported from the U S  to the European Union would be subject to higher tariffs 
Harley Davidson stated that European Union tariffs on its motorcycles exported from the U S  have increased from 6  to 31   This comes as the EU tariffs on a list of U S  goods and iconic brands including Harley Davidson s motorbikes were implemented on June 22 
The higher tariffs are expected to average an incremental  2 200 per motorcycle exported from the U S  to the EU 
Management said they decided against raising MSRP s or wholesale prices to cover the costs of the EU s retaliatory tariffs as it would have both an immediate and lasting impact on the sustainability of its dealers  business 
Absorbing the tariffs would set the motorbike manufacturer back about  30M to  45M in the remainder of 2018  and  90M to  100M on an annual basis 
Harley said it will shift production of motorcycles bound for the EU to international manufacturing facilities in a bid to sidestep the tariffs  The transition  however  is expected to take between 9 and 18 months

166029,387545,HOG,Harley Davidson to move some production out of U S  to avoid EU tariffs,news,By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Sanjana Shivdas  Reuters    Harley Davidson Inc  N HOG  said on Monday it would move U S  production of motorcycles for European Union customers overseas to avoid retaliatory tariffs that could cost the company up to  100 million per year   Harley shares plunged as much as 7 percent and analysts cut their profit forecasts on concerns about how quickly the company would be able to adapt to the 25 percent import duties the European Union began charging on June 22  U S  President Donald Trump has held up Harley as an example of a manufacturer that would benefit from his policies  But the proposed production shift appeared to mark an unintended consequence of U S  tariffs imposed on European steel and aluminum earlier this month   We think Harley s decision to protect EU demand is wise for the long term health of the market   Baird Equity Research said in a note   But we expect the near term impact to weigh on estimates and sentiment until a clearer path to mitigation is outlined   In a regulatory filing  the Milwaukee  Wisconsin based company said the retaliatory duties would result in an incremental cost of about  2 200 per average motorcycle exported from the United States to the European Union  but did not provide more details on current motorcycle costs  Harley s entry level bike in France currently costs 7 490 euros   8 766    The company said it would not raise retail or wholesale prices for its dealers  and expects the tariffs to result in incremental costs of  30 million to  45 million for the rest of 2018 and  80 million to  100 million on a full year basis  Trump vowed to make the iconic motorcycle maker great again when he took office last year  But since then the company has been counting the costs of his trade policies   In late April  Harley said Trump s metal tariffs would inflate its costs by  15 million to  20 million this year on top of already rising raw material prices that it expected at the start of the year  White House trade and manufacturing adviser Peter Navarro said on Monday the administration wants Harley to make more motorcycles in the United States    Remember  they came to us  for example  pointing out that India had a 100 percent tariff on Harley Davidsons  That s certainly not fair   Navarro told CNBC   We want Harleys made here  more made here  and that s going to happen under the president s trade policies   In response to Navarro s comments  a Harley spokesman said the company made its position clear in Monday s filing  EUROPEAN BUSINESS  Struggling to overcome a slump in U S  demand  Harley has been aiming to boost sales of its iconic motorcycles overseas to 50 percent of total annual volume from about 43 percent currently  In January  the company announced the closure of a plant in Kansas City  Missouri as part of a consolidation plan after its motorcycle shipments fell to their lowest level in six years  In 2017  Harley sold nearly 40 000 new motorcycles in Europe which accounted for more than 16 percent of the company s sales last year  The revenues from EU countries were second only to the United States   Harley said ramping up production at overseas international plants could take at least nine to 18 months  It has three assembly plants outside the United States   one each in Brazil  India and Thailand  The company decided to build the Thailand plant in response to Trump s decision to pull out from the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have lowered import tariffs on its bikes in some of the fastest growing motorcycle markets in Asia  The company said it will provide more details of the financial implications of retaliatory EU tariffs and its plans to offset their impact on July 24 when its second quarter earnings are due   Analysts at Baird Equity Research cut its 2018 profit estimates for Harley Davidson to  3 70 per share from  3 90 and now expect 2019 profit of  3 85  down from  4 20  CFRA Research lowered its 12 month price target for the stock to  47 from  49  Harley Davidson s shares fell as much as 7 percent on Monday  before paring some losses in late trading  Its shares have lost about 9 percent since early March when the trade skirmish between the United States and the EU started  and are down over 18 percent since end December 2017   Mercedes Benz maker  Daimler   DE DAIGn  last week cut its 2018 profit forecast citing growing trade tensions  Its German rival BMW  DE BMWG  said it was considering  possible strategic options  in view of the rising trade tensions between China and the United States  Trump has also threatened to crackdown on auto imports  Analysts at Moody s reckon a 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles and parts would be negative for most of companies including  Ford Motor Co   N F  and General Motors Co  N GM

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders downplayed the announcement earlier Monday  saying Trump s  trade and economic policies have been a huge benefit to the American economy

166032,387548,HOG,Trump Says Harley Move Abroad Would Be  Beginning of the End ,news," Bloomberg     U S  President Donald Trump accused Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   of using new tariffs on trade as cover for an existing plan to shift some production abroad and threatened the motorcycle manufacturer with a  big tax  on bikes imported to the U S  if it relocates some plants overseas 
The company said in a government filing Monday that it may locate some production outside the U S  in response to European retaliation for the president s tariffs on imported metals 
But Trump took issue with that on Tuesday 
June 26  2018
 Early this year Harley Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand  That was long before Tariffs were announced  Hence  they were just using Tariffs Trade War as an excuse  Shows how unbalanced   unfair trade is  but we will fix it   Trump said Tuesday in a Twitter posting 
The president followed up by warning the company that goods produced overseas and imported back into the U S  could be taxed   Harley must know that they won t be able to sell back into U S  without paying a big tax   Trump said on Twitter Tuesday 
June 26  2018 June 26  2018
Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich said in April that the factory in Thailand was a  Plan B  that Harley employed after the U S  abandoned the 11 country Trans Pacific Partnership free trade agreement Trump withdrew from last year  He d said they didn t relish the investment  which he also said was needed to maintain access to a key market 
The early morning missive from the president marked the second consecutive day Trump took aim at the iconic motorcycle maker  after the company said in an SEC filing on Monday that tariffs enacted by the European Union in response to Trump s penalties on imported steel and aluminum would add as much as  100 million a year to its costs 
 To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long term  Harley Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the U S  to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden   the company said

In a subsequent tweet  Trump said the U S  is managing to get other countries to lower existing tariffs and barriers that he said have been in place for years trough bad deals   We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint  They must play fair or they will pay tariffs   he said in the post 
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders downplayed the announcement earlier Monday  saying Trump s  trade and economic policies have been a huge benefit to the American economy

Jack Daniel s Feels Pinch
Tariffs have also forced the hand of the maker of another iconic American brand  Jack Daniel s 
Brown Forman Corp   which also produces Woodford Reserve and other bourbons  will have to raise prices for its whiskey sold in the European Union following the implementation of a 25 percent tariff  according to spokesman Phil Lynch  The higher prices  which he said would primarily affect Jack Daniel s  would amount to about a 10 percent increase for consumers 
Lynch did not say what effect the expected price increases would have on European sales  noting that  we continue to invest behind the growth of American whiskey in the EU  
Brown Forman fell to its lowest level in almost seven months on Monday 
Harley shares fell 6 percent  the biggest drop in almost five months  to close at  41 57  The stock is down 18 percent this year 
The EU s levies are only the latest blowback Harley has faced from Trump s trade policies  A year after Trump pulled the U S  out of a 12 nation trade deal  the Trans Pacific Partnership  in January 2017  Harley announced it would close its factory in Kansas City  Missouri  and consolidate production in York  Pennsylvania  eliminating about 260 jobs 
Trump hosted Levatich and other Harley executives and union leaders for a White House listening session in February 2017 and hailed the motorcycle manufacturer as  a true American icon  and  one of the greats  
Ryan Weighs In
 Thank you  Harley Davidson  for building things in America   Trump said at the time   I think you re going to even expand  I know your business is now doing very well and there s a lot of spirit right now in the country that you weren t having so much in the last number of months that you have right now  
Harley Davidson s headquarters are in Milwaukee  and on Monday the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan  a Wisconsin Republican who has opposed Trump s move to impose tariffs  said the company s announcement was evidence of the detrimental effect of the president s trade policy

166033,387549,HOG,U S  stock valuations get trickier as trade tensions rise,news,By Lewis Krauskopf and Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK  Reuters    Trade tensions that have simmered in the background for investors are starting to boil over into a more severe problem for the U S  stock market  The latest developments involving a trade dispute pitting the United States against China and other countries are creating such uncertainty that investors are struggling to value stocks at a time strong corporate profits would otherwise bolster stocks as the bull market extends into its 10th year    The uncertainty regarding policy leads to uncertainty regarding profits   said Richard Bernstein  chief executive and chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors in New York   I m not sure how one could say that trade is fully discounted because policy is being set somewhat randomly     Although concerns over a global trade war have loomed over the stock market since March  the issue has barged into the foreground in recent days  as motorcycle maker Harley Davidson Inc  N HOG  and Mercedes Benz maker  Daimler   DE DAIGn  warned of a financial toll from the trade tensions   Investors  meanwhile  are reconsidering whether statements from U S  President Donald Trump and his administration may be more than just an effort to gain leverage in any trade negotiations   As it seems that this is not just a negotiating tactic   this could be reality   that is beginning to unnerve the market   said Eric Kuby  chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management in Chicago  The dilemma of weighing trade concerns was cast into stark relief for investors on Monday when the S P 500 dove 2 percent amid conflicting signals from the Trump administration over proposed restrictions on foreign investment in U S  technology companies   The benchmark index recovered somewhat to close down 1 4 percent  but still marked its biggest single day decline in nearly three months  The S P 500 rebounded modestly on Tuesday  ending up 0 2 percent  INVESTOR NERVOUSNESS Rick Meckler  partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon  New Jersey said the trade dispute was definitely making it harder to value the stocks    Handicapping it is extremely difficult  and contributing to the overall nervousness of investors   he said    It s given me pause about committing new capital and I m in the position of a lot of investors where with these sell offs  my first reaction is to step back rather than to leap in   Meckler said  The S P 500 s current price to earnings ratio  or P E  is 16 7 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months  according to Thomson Reuters Datastream  That makes stocks significantly cheaper than they were in January  when the index traded at 18 6 times estimates  but still more expensive than their long term average of 15 times  Trade has become one of the main uncertainties facing stock investors as they value stocks  along with the path of interest rate increases by the U S  Federal Reserve  said Dan Veru  chief investment officer at Palisade Capital Management LLC in Fort Lee  New Jersey   It is making it harder   Veru said   What sort of P E do you put on a company  That s the struggle right now    To view a graphic on S P 500 P E vs S P 500 price move  click   Recent comments from Harley and Daimler indicate that the impact from tariffs could cloud the second quarter earnings season starting in a few weeks in which S P 500 companies are expected to increases profits by 20 7 percent  fueled by the recent U S  corporate tax cuts    This will be a huge topic   said J  Bryant Evans  investment adviser and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign  Illinois    CEOs are starting to think about how this affects them and what moves they re going to make       Evans said   It s very hard for them to plan anything with this uncertainty  but they have to move forward as if the current trend is going to continue for several more years   There does not seem to be as yet any significant impact from the trade uncertainty on analysts  projections for earnings  Analysts estimate earnings will rise by 22 4 percent for 2018  up from a 19 8 percent increase expected at the start of April  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S  To view a graphic on S P 500 quarterly profit growth  click   But some market strategists are beginning to project fallout from an intensified trade war  Using assumptions including a 10 percent increase in import costs stemming from heightened tariffs  BofA Merrill Lynch projects a 3 4 percent hit to S P 500 earnings per share   Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  economists calculate that escalation of the trade dispute to include  200 billion of imports could reduce economic growth by 0 2 to 0 3 percentage points  which translates to a 1 to 1 5 percent reduction in S P 500 earnings growth  Whether such projections become more relevant could become clear at the end of next week  when U S  tariffs on  34 billion worth of Chinese goods are scheduled to go into effect    The market is starting to price in that the tariffs will start to become real   said Brian Battle  director of trading with Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago   The rhetoric is getting stronger rather than weaker  We ll keep trading off if the trend persists   Some investors continue to doubt that the U S  China tensions will escalate into a full blown trade war and that  given that Trump himself has measured his success by the stock market  the administration will be wary of policies that would seriously undermine stocks   You can still value stocks   said Hugh Johnson  chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany  New York   You have to take a

166064,387580,HOG,G7 finance chiefs kick trade dispute to leaders  summit in Quebec,news,By David Lawder and Leika Kihara WHISTLER  British Columbia  Reuters    Finance leaders of the closest U S  allies vented anger over the Trump administration s metal import tariffs on Saturday  ending a three day meeting with a stern rebuke of Washington and setting up a heated fight at a G7 summit next week in Quebec  In a rare show of division among the normally harmonious club of wealthy nations  the six other G7 member countries issued a statement asking U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to convey their  unanimous concern and disappointment  about the tariffs to President Donald Trump  The 25 percent steel and 10 percent aluminum tariffs were imposed this week on Mexico  Canada and the European Union after temporary exemptions expired   We re concerned that these actions are actually not conducive to helping our economy  they actually are destructive  and that is consistently held across the six countries that expressed their point of view to Secretary Mnuchin   Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said at a news conference after the meeting ended in the Canadian mountain resort town of Whistler  British Columbia  The statement  written by Canada  also called for  decisive action  to resolve the tariff dispute at a G7 leaders  summit starting on Friday in Charlevoix  Quebec  Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said that direct discussions between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Trump may help resolve the issue  though Japan has refused to accept import quotas   I ve been to these meetings for a long time  But this is a very rare case where opposition against the United States was unanimous   Aso told reporters  Speaking separately after the meeting  frequently referred to as the  G6 plus one   Mnuchin told reporters that he was not part of the six country consensus on trade and said Trump was focused on  rebalancing our trade relationships   Mnuchin rejected comments from some G7 officials that the United States was circumventing international trade rules with the tariffs or ceding leadership of a global economic and trading system it largely built after World War Two    I don t think in any way the U S  is abandoning its leadership in the global economy  quite the contrary  I think that we ve had a massive effort on tax reform in the United States which has had a incredible impact on the U S  economy   Mnuchin said  The U S  Treasury chief said he has already relayed some of the G7 comments to Trump and added that the U S  president would address trade issues with other G7 leaders  but declined to speculate on any outcomes  WASHINGTON S MOVE Just before the G7 meeting ended  Trump wrote on Twitter that  the United States must  at long last  be treated fairly on Trade  If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods  and they charge us 25  50 or even 100 percent to sell ours  it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated  That is not Free or Fair Trade  it is Stupid Trade   All six of the other G7 countries   Britain  Canada  France  Germany  Italy and Japan   are now paying the metals tariffs  which are largely aimed at curbing excess production in China  Canada and Mexico  which are embroiled in talks with the United States to update the North American Free Trade Agreement  responded to the move by announcing levies of their own on a variety of U S  exports  The EU is set to retaliate with tariffs on a range of U S  goods  from Harley Davidson  N HOG  motorcycles to jeans and bourbon  French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the United States has only a few days to avoid sparking a trade war with its allies and it was up to Washington to make a move to de escalate the tensions  Speaking after the meeting  Le Maire said the EU was poised to take counter measures against the new U S  tariffs   Some officials at the meeting said the tariffs made it harder for the group to work together to confront China over its trade practices  Mnuchin disagreed  saying there was support for dealing with China s joint venture requirements  technology transfer efforts and other policies  as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross began trade talks in Beijing on Saturday    The G7 ought to collectively tell China to follow global rules   Japan s Aso said   By taking measures that violate G7 and World Trade Organization rules  the United States is actually benefiting China  That s wrong   German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said G7 countries also told Mnuchin about their opposition to new U S  sanctions on Iran  which will affect European companies  Trump announced last month that he was pulling the United States out of an international nuclear agreement with Tehran   There were several issues discussed at the G7 over which there was no agreement   Scholz told reporters   That s really quite unusual in the history of the G7

166065,387581,HOG,EU s Juncker Says He Was Called  Brutal Killer  by Trump,news," Bloomberg     European Commission chief Jean Claude Juncker said he was labeled a  killer  by President Donald Trump at a tumultuous Group of Seven summit in Canada  signaling the increasing personal and policy strains between the U S  and its closest allies 
 Trump told me last week  you are a brutal killer    Juncker  a Luxembourger  said during a speech to the Bavarian Parliament in Munich on Thursday   That s the first time that Luxembourg has grown into such a threat to the U S  I think he meant it as a compliment  but I m not so sure  
The comments illustrate the confusion that Trump is sowing among U S  allies with his protectionist tilt  withdrawal from landmark international agreements to fight climate change and to prevent Iran from developing nuclear arms  and criticism of defense spending by fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization members 
Late last month  when Trump decided to revoke a waiver for the EU from U S  tariffs on foreign aluminum and steel  Juncker said that  whenever I m thinking about Trump  I m lost  
Juncker s remarks on Thursday are also further evidence of the discord that occurred between the U S  and other members of the G 7 group of leading industrialized countries at a June 8 9 summit in Quebec  Trump upended the meeting just as it wound up by disavowing a joint statement the U S  had agreed to and lashing out at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 
While on his way to Singapore for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on nuclear disarmament  Trump complained about comments made by Trudeau and called him  very dishonest   weak   White House trade adviser Peter Navarro chimed in by saying there was a  special place in hell  for Trudeau  who had pushed back against the U S  metals tariffs in his closing press conference at the G 7 summit 
Steel Tariffs
Juncker made the  brutal killer  comment in the context of renewed criticism of his own of those U S  levies  which Trump has justified on national security grounds dismissed by countries around the world  The White House didn t immediately respond to a request to comment on Juncker s remark  The trade problem that we have with the U S  is sad   Juncker said   We can t let the tariffs on steel and aluminum by the American administration go unanswered  
Earlier on Thursday in Brussels  EU governments gave the green light to the planned first phase of European retaliation against the U S  over its metal levies  clearing the way for special duties on American goods as soon as June 20 
Representatives of the bloc s governments agreed to impose a 25 percent duty on 2 8 billion euros   3 3 billion  of EU imports of a range of U S  products including Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   motorcycles  Levi Strauss   Co  jeans and bourbon whiskey  The officials also signed off on a planned 10 percent levy on one other product imported from the U S   playing cards

166066,387582,HOG,Europe Said to Seek WTO Revamp in Face of Trump Trade Challenge,news," Bloomberg     European Union leaders plan to push for improvements in the way the World Trade Organization operates  saying it s important to uphold the global commercial order amid  growing  tensions prompted by U S  President Donald Trump s tariffs 
At a June 28 29 meeting  EU government chiefs will repeat criticism of U S  metal import duties that Trump has justified on national security grounds and express support for the bloc s retaliatory measures  according to a draft statement prepared for the summit  Planned European tit for tat tariffs  known as  re balancing  measures  are due to take effect as soon as this week 
The U S  levies of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum  cannot be justified on the grounds of national security   the 28 leaders will say at the Brussels meeting  according to the text dated June 19 and seen by Bloomberg News 
The stance highlights the EU s desire to prevent Trump s protectionist tilt from undermining the global trade order that the U S  was instrumental in building after the Second World War  It comes as China  the EU s No  2 trade partner after the U S   fights not only Trump s metal tariffs but also his vow to hit a slew of other Chinese goods with import duties 
The Brussels summit will also lend backing to the EU complaint at the WTO against the U S  steel and aluminum levies and to the European Commission s evaluation of possible  safeguard  curbs on the bloc s own metal imports to prevent Europe from being flooded by shipments diverted away from the American market  according to the draft statement 
The group of heads of government or state  known as the European Council   fully supports the re balancing measures  potential safeguard measures to protect our own markets  and the legal proceedings at the WTO   according to the text 
The commission  the EU s executive arm  is due to give final approval any day to an initial retaliatory step centering on a 25 percent duty on 2 8 billion euros   3 2 billion  of EU imports of a range of U S  products including Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   motorcycles  Levi Strauss   Co  jeans and bourbon whiskey  The first stage plan also includes a separate 10 percent levy on U S  playing cards imported into the bloc 
The draft EU summit statement includes a list of areas where the WTO could become more effective and asks the commission to take the lead in proposing improvements 
 In a context of growing trade tensions  the European Council underlines the importance of preserving and deepening the rules based multilateral system   says the text   It invites the commission to propose a comprehensive approach to improving  together with like minded partners  the functioning of the WTO in crucial areas such as more flexible negotiations  new rules that address current gaps  including in the field of subsidies  reduction of trade costs  a new approach to development and effective and transparent enforcement  with a view to ensuring a level playing field  ",2018-06-19,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/europe-said-to-seek-wto-revamp-in-face-of-trump-trade-challenge-1498484,1498484
166067,387583,HOG,Trump Calls China Trade a U S  Security Threat as EU Hits Back,news," Bloomberg     The world economy lurched closer to an all out trade war as the Trump administration accused China of threatening U S  economic interests and as the European Union made good on its threat to hit American goods with retaliatory tariffs 
A scathing report  posted late Tuesday by the White House  blamed Beijing for hijacking intellectual property and pursuing destructive industrial policies  saying the nation s spectacular economic growth  has been achieved in significant part through aggressive acts  policies and practices that fall outside of global norms and rules  
 Given the size of China s economy and the extent of its market distorting policies  China s economic aggression now threatens not only the U S  economy  but also the global economy as a whole   according to the 35 page document 
The White House report came out just before the EU triggered the first phase of retaliation against the U S  over its metal import tariffs  approving a 25 percent duty on 2 8 billion euros   3 2 billion  of U S  products including Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   motorcycles and Levi Strauss   Co  jeans  It opens up a second contentious trade front for Trump  who ordered U S  officials on Monday to consider imposing tariffs on an additional  200 billion in Chinese imports    with another  200 billion to be added if Beijing retaliates 
Economic Fallout
The EU countermeasures will hit U S  consumer  agricultural and steel products in many key Republican constituencies  putting pressure on Trump ahead of crucial midterm elections in November 
 We did not want to be in this position   European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in a statement on Wednesday   However  the unilateral and unjustified decision of the U S  to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on the EU means that we are left with no other choice  
Despite the brewing dispute  U S  futures advanced  tracking gains across Asia and Europe  Every sector rose in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index  which jumped following three days of losses  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0 6 percent as of 7 16 a m  New York time  while futures on the S P 500 Index gained 0 2 percent 
On the other side of the Pacific  economists are starting to run the numbers on what kind of dent to growth such actions will have on China s economy  Bloomberg Economics  Tom Orlik and Fielding Chen write that the impact of decreased exports and lower manufacturing investment could mean a 0 5 percent blow to gross domestic product 
A pull back in Chinese investment in the U S  is already evident  Research from Rhodium Group LLC showed Chinese companies completed acquisitions and greenfield investments worth  1 8 billion in the first half  representing a drop of more than 90 percent from the same period in 2017 and the lowest level in seven years 
U S  Boom
The trade skirmishes are not holding back the U S  economy just yet  which is booming this quarter as tax cuts power consumers and businesses  Still  as risks to that outlook mount  economists are pointing to higher checkout prices on a range of tech  apparel and household goods for U S  consumers should Trump follow through with his latest tariff threats 
Just last week  Trump unveiled plans to implement previously announced tariffs on  50 billion in primarily industrial goods  China has said it will match those levies in kind  and has already responded to earlier duties on metals imports 
The U S  government has long complained that China obtains American intellectual property and technology through underhanded means  and the White House report restated many of those concerns  including about hacking  physical theft of trade secrets and evasion of export control laws 
Physical Theft
The Chinese government says that it is working to improve intellectual property protection  Companies surveyed by the European Union Chamber of Commerce do see some improvement  though a slim majority say protection of intellectual property in China is still inadequate 
 Physical theft through economic espionage by company insiders or others who have trusted access to trade secrets and confidential business information provides China with a significant means to acquire U S  technologies and intellectual property   the White House report charges 
The report  titled  How China s Economic Aggression Threatens the Technologies and Intellectual Property of the United States and the World   does not make any specific policy recommendations  Yet it codifies some of the administration s arguments for a more aggressive stance toward China over trade 
Besides the volleys of tariffs on goods from China  the Trump administration is also considering measures that would restrict Chinese investment in sensitive American technology 
Ownership Restrictions
The report also accuses China of openly protecting domestic industries from competition and imports through tariffs  regulation and restrictions on foreign ownership  It also says China offers financial support to bolster its exports to foreign markets 
It adds that Chinese state owned companies pose an additional threat to overseas firms  given their close ties to the Beijing government 
The government itself dominates many industries and plays an enormous role in investment decisions and strategy  For instance  the report says  until 2014  state supported foreign investment funds were directed toward acquiring natural resources  Now  that focus has shifted to technology 
The U S  imported  505 billion of goods from China last year and exported about  130 billion  leaving a 2017 trade deficit of  376 billion  according to U S  government figures ",2018-06-20,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trump-calls-china-trade-a-us-security-threat-as-eu-hits-back-1500394,1500394

at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Harley Davidson  Inc    NYSE HOG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Harley Davidson has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Harley Davidson s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Harley Davidson has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 39  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Harley Davidson has a P S ratio of about 1 5  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  HOG is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Harley Davidson currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Harley Davidson a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Harley Davidson might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F  This gives HOG a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen eight estimates go lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has nine down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased 14 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dropped 2 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Harley Davidson  Inc  Price and Consensus     The stock has Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicating probabilities for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineHarley Davidson is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a strong industry rank  among Top 16  of more than 250 industries  boosts investor confidence  However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Trades Could

166093,387609,HOG,EU Hunts for Formula to Avert Deeper Trade Conflict With U S ,news," Bloomberg     The European Union scrambled to come up with a strategy to avoid U S  tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum  signaling a readiness to accept American import quotas and to slash some EU duties in return for a permanent waiver 
With an EU exemption from the metal levies due to lapse on June 1  European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom indicated that U S  quotas on steel and aluminum from the bloc would be acceptable as long as they  totally respect the historical flows   Malmstrom also said the EU was willing to discuss cuts in European import levies on industrial goods such as cars 
 I don t think the exemptions will be prolonged   she told reporters on Tuesday in Brussels before a meeting with trade ministers from the 28 nation EU   We have to prepare for different scenarios  
Since U S  President Donald Trump imposed the tariffs on national security grounds in March while offering temporary waivers to some trade partners  the EU has said the levies of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum are illegal under global rules and demanded a  permanent  unconditional  exemption 
WTO Complaint
The bloc has threatened  without a permanent exclusion  both to complain to the World Trade Organization and to impose tit for tat duties on a range of U S  goods  In a possible initial retaliatory step outlined last week  the bloc would apply a 25 percent levy as of June 20 on 2 8 billion euros   3 3 billion  of imports of American products including Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   motorcycles  Levi Strauss   Co  jeans and bourbon whiskey 
Last year  the EU exported 5 3 billion euros of steel and 1 1 billion euros of aluminum to the U S  In terms of volume  the steel exports amounted to 3 4 million metric tons of finished products and 1 5 million tons of semi finished goods and other types including wires and tubes 
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier of Germany  the EU s biggest steel exporter to the U S   said both sides must seek ways to avert a wider trans Atlantic commercial conflict 
 We want to avoid a trade war   Altmaier told reporters in his way into the Brussels meeting   It s important for jobs in Europe and Germany that we reach an agreement that takes into account the interests of both sides  Time is running out  ",2018-05-22,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/eu-hunts-for-formula-to-avert-deeper-trade-conflict-with-us-1457012,1457012
166094,387610,HOG,Europe Must Brace for U S  Curbs on EU Metals  Malmstrom Says,news," Bloomberg     European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom gave her clearest signal yet that the EU will come up short in its bid for a permanent  unconditional waiver from U S  metal tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on national security grounds 
Speaking just days before a temporary waiver for the EU from the duties expires  Malmstrom said the bloc would likely face U S  import quotas on European steel and aluminum should the Trump administration opt against triggering the levies on June 1 
 Realistically  if the U S  decides to refrain from applying duties  I expect them nonetheless to want to impose some sort of cap on EU exports   she told the European Parliament on Tuesday in Strasbourg  France   The question is whether that would be a hard cap    meaning volume limits above which no further EU exports would be possible    or a soft cap  under which further exports would be possible but under duties  
The EU has been seeking to translate political pledges to stand up to Trump s protectionism into policy proposals that both threaten retaliation and offer routes away from any economically damaging trans Atlantic trade war  Since Trump introduced the tariffs on March 23 while temporarily exempting some trade partners including the EU  Germany has sounded a softer tone than have other member countries including France 
Restrictive Quotas
Malmstrom said that a soft U S  cap  would be less damaging  while repeating EU threats to complain to the World Trade Organization and impose a retaliatory tariff on 2 8 billion euros   3 2 billion  of American goods imported into Europe as soon as June 20  She said the details of the upcoming U S  decision will determine the EU s response 
 Our future course of action will depend on the nature and the severity of measures imposed on our exports by the United States and the injury it does to our industry   she said 
 Restrictive quotas  by the U S  would prompt the European Commission  the EU s executive arm in Brussels  to prepare for  immediate  retaliation  Malmstrom said  Among the U S  goods that would be hit are Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   motorcycles  Levi Strauss   Co  jeans and bourbon whiskey 
Malmstrom said a meeting that she is scheduled to have with U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in Paris on Wednesday will be  an important moment  while repeating that Trump will take the ultimate decision on whether to apply the tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum against the EU 
 It is clear that the final decision will be made by President Trump himself   she said  Malmstrom warned against divisions within the 28 nation bloc  saying  it is important at this moment that the European Union stands united  ",2018-05-29,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/europe-must-brace-for-us-curbs-on-eu-metals-malmstrom-says-1466672,1466672
166095,387611,HOG,U S  Allies Hit Back as Trump Revokes Steel Tariff Reprieve,news," Bloomberg     America s closest allies plan to slap billions of dollars in tit for tat tariffs on U S  goods after the Trump administration announced it s imposing steel and aluminum duties on them 
The reaction was swift after Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the U S  starting Friday will levy duties on the imported metals from the European Union  Mexico and Canada  ending their temporary exemptions 
The EU said it would take immediate steps to retaliate  while Mexico vowed to impose duties on everything from U S  flat steel to cheese  Canada s government said it will impose tariffs on as much as C 16 6 billion   12 8 billion  of U S  steel  aluminum and other products from July 1  The allies said their countermeasures are of proportionate value to the U S  actions 
The decision marks the administration s most aggressive trade action yet against major U S  trading partners  which had been fighting for permanent relief  The EU  Canada and Mexico together account for about 40 percent of U S  steel imports 
 This is a bad day for world trade   European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said in Brussels after the announcement   It s totally unacceptable that a country is imposing unilateral measures when it comes to world trade  
The metals tariffs add to mounting worries over a trade war as the Trump administration also considers tariffs on U S  auto imports    which could hit top suppliers from Mexico  Canada  Japan and Germany    and plans to levy duties on  50 billion in Chinese goods 
The rising trade tensions come as Group of Seven finance ministers including U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and central bank governors prepare to meet in the Canadian resort town of Whistler this week  Growing trade tensions have clouded a benign outlook for the global economy  which is on track to grow at its fastest pace since 2011 this year and next  according to the International Monetary Fund 
Secretary Ross said there wasn t enough progress in discussions with the EU over trade concessions and Canada and Mexico on rewriting the North American Free Trade Agreement to give them permanent exemptions from the metals tariffs 
Ross said he s looking forward to  continued negotiations  with Canada  Mexico and the EU to resolve their issues  There s potential  flexibility  in the future because the president has the power to increase or cut tariffs  remove them  or enact quotas  he said 
 We continue to be quite willing and eager to have further discussions with all of those parties   Ross told reporters on Thursday   We are awaiting their reaction  
Stocks in the U S  fell as the administration ignored pleas from business lobbying groups including the U S  Chamber of Commerce to forgo tariffs  The shares of major American steel producers  which have supported the tariffs  rose on Thursday s news   Nucor  Corp  NYSE NUE    the biggest U S  steel producer  were up 0 4 percent at 2 32 p m  in New York 
The EU has indicated it could target  3 3 billion in American products from Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   motorcycles to Levi Strauss   Co  s jeans as well as bourbon  Both the EU and Canada said they intend to proceed with a case at the World Trade Organization against the U S  import restrictions 
Speaking to reporters on Thursday  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau characterized the U S  measures as  punitive  and  unacceptable  
 These tariffs will harm industry and workers on both sides of the Canada U S  border  disrupting linked supply chains that have made North American steel and aluminum more competitive around the world   Trudeau said 
Auto Probe
The steel and aluminum levies and auto import probe could play well with Trump voters in Rust Belt states in the lead up to congressional midterms in November  But the tariffs aren t popular among pro trade lawmakers in Trump s own Republican Party 
 Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are a tax hike on Americans and will have damaging consequences for consumers  manufacturers and workers   said Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah  chairman of the Finance Committee  which oversees trade in the upper chamber 
In imposing the tariffs  President Donald Trump invoked a seldom used section of a 1960s trade law that allows him to erect trade barriers when imports imperil national security  Trump in March imposed 25 percent duties on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum  but he gave temporary reprieve to a handful of allies for further talks to take place 
The action was mainly targeted at China over accusations of flooding the global market with cut rate metals and dragging down prices  The Trump administration has said a global tariff is necessary because China is shipping its steel through other nations 
Positive Effects
The White House said in a statement Thursday that those tariffs have already had  major  positive effects  on steel and aluminum workers 
Ross played down the potential negative impact on the U S  economy from the duties   For the economy overall  it s just a very small fraction of 1 percent   he said in an interview on CNBC 
Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska drew a parallel between Trump s tariffs and trade protectionism during the Great Depression 
 This is dumb   Sasse said in an emailed statement   Europe  Canada  and Mexico are not China  and you don t treat allies the same way you treat opponents  We ve been down this road before    blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression  Make America Great Again shouldn t mean Make America 1929 Again  ",2018-05-31,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-allies-hit-back-as-trump-revokes-steel-tariff-reprieve-1470714,1470714

166118,387634,HOG,Trump Opens Door to Trade War as EU Threatens Iconic U S  Brands,news," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump set the stage for a trade war after slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports  daring other countries to retaliate and leading the European Union to warn that it would target iconic American brands 
Hours after Trump tweeted that  trade wars are good  and easy to win   European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said the bloc is prepared to respond forcefully by targeting imports of Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   motorbikes  Levi Strauss   Co  jeans and bourbon whiskey from the U S 
Juncker s threat heightened the prospects of a global free for all  as the World Trade Organization said the potential of escalating tensions  is real  and the International Monetary Fund warned the restrictions would likely damage the U S  and global economy 
Trump is facing anger from manufacturers and trade partners in Asia and Europe after announcing tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum for  a long period of time   He is expected to sign the formal order next week  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Friday the president has chosen to impose the tariffs on all countries and products  dimming the hopes for nations such as Australia still pressing for an exemption 
Trump in a tweet Friday morning warned of more trade actions ahead  casting them as reciprocal taxes  a term he has used for imposing levies on imports from countries that charge higher duties on U S  goods than the U S  currently charges 
 We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us   800 Billion Trade Deficit have no choice   Trump said in the tweet 
The aggressive stance stoked fears of trade retaliation and roiled investors  After the decision on tariffs initially depressed global markets  U S  stocks pared losses of more than 1 percent Friday  while Treasuries slumped with the dollar as the wave of selling sparked by the threat of a trade war eased 
The planned tariffs  justified on the basis that cut price metal imports hurt both American producers and national security  now raise the prospect of retaliatory curbs on U S  exports and higher prices for domestic users  While the practical impact may yet turn out to be limited  the political environment for global trade has just taken a turn for the worse 
Trump s actions could  could lead to other trading partners taking similar actions and could ultimately weaken the international trade conventions  like WTO rules  more generally   according to a  Goldman Sachs Group   NYSE GS   Inc  research note on Friday 
Trump Roars  China Yawns  U S  Shoots Itself in Foot  Gadfly
The EU is prepared to retaliate against select U S  imports in a way that would maximize political pressure on American leaders  Harley Davidson is based in House Speaker Paul Ryan s home state of Wisconsin  while bourbon whiskey hails from the state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  San Francisco based Levi Strauss is headquartered in House Minority Leader s Nancy Pelosi s district 
The official response in China  the world s largest steel producer and the main target of the tariffs  was muted  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in Beijing Friday that China urges the U S  to follow trade rules 
Industry insiders were less restrained  The U S  measures  overturn the international trade order   Wen Xianjun  vice chairman of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association  said in a statement   Other countries  including China  will take relevant retaliatory measures  
Li Xinchuang  vice chairman of the China Iron and Steel Association  called the move  stupid  
China has already launched a probe into U S  imports of sorghum  and is studying whether to restrict shipments of U S  soybeans    targets that could hurt Trump s support in some farming states  While China accounts for just a fraction of U S  imports of the metals  it s accused of flooding the global market and dragging down prices 
U S  allies  seeing their industries threatened  responded with bafflement and dismay  Some also panned the idea that metal imports pose a threat to national security 
 Steel and aluminum imports from Japan  which is an ally  do not affect U S  national security at all   Japan s Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters in Tokyo Friday   I would like to convey that to the U S  when I have an opportunity

The impact of the step hinges in part on which nations will be affected  said Alex Wolf  senior emerging markets economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Hong Kong  who previously worked at the U S  State Department 
 Until we see the final scope of the tariffs and the response from global trading partners  it s hard to say it s the start of a tit for tat trade war   Wolf said ",2018-03-02,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trump-opens-door-to-trade-war-as-eu-threatens-iconic-us-brands-1322763,1322763
166119,387635,HOG,Trump faces pushback on tariffs but says he will not back down,news,By Susan Cornwell and Ayesha Rascoe WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump faced growing pressure on Monday from political and diplomatic allies as well as U S  companies urging him to pull back from proposed steel and aluminum tariffs  although he said he would stick to his guns  Inside the White House  there still appeared to be confusion about the timing and extent of the planned tariffs  which would hit allies like Canada and Mexico hard  Efforts by Trump and U S  trade negotiators to link the NAFTA trade pact talks to the duties received short shrift from Ottawa and Mexico City  Leading Republicans turned up the pressure on Trump  with House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan leading the charge  Ryan s home state of Wisconsin would be hit by proposed European counter measures on Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG  motorbikes   Representative Kevin Brady  another top House Republican  called on Trump not to hit America s closest allies  Business leaders are pressing for a meeting with Trump to brief him on the negative repercussions of the tariffs on companies that use steel and aluminum  a source familiar with the matter said  A meeting had not yet been set up  the source said  The White House had no comment  The planned tariffs have roiled world stock markets as investors worried about the prospect of an escalating trade war that would derail global economic growth  Stocks across the globe rose on Monday  however  after four days in decline as investors saw the tariff threats as a U S  negotiating tactic and not a done deal and as pressure grew on Trump to back off    We re not backing down   Trump said during a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu   I don t think you re going to have a trade war   he added  without elaborating  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Trump on Monday to tell him the tariffs would be an impediment to talks on updating NAFTA  a Canadian government official said  Canada is the single largest supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States  In the call  Trudeau  forcefully defended  Canadian workers and industries  said the official  describing the conversation as constructive  Earlier comments from Trump had stoked talk of a global trade war as he described them as easy to win and issued a threat to German carmakers  One of those  BMW  runs a plant in the United States that is the largest single autos exporter in the country and has created thousands of jobs  Most responses to Trump s proposed tariffs have been targeted  The European Union said it would hit Harleys  bourbon and jeans  iconic American products  It did not threaten to ramp up the issue  China has been largely mum  urging caution  and both Canada and Mexico have stressed the targeted nature of any response  STRESSES INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE  Trump was expected to finalize the planned tariffs later in the week  although some observers familiar with the process said it could occur next week  The initial announcement by Trump last week came as a surprise  The United States  Mexico and Canada have been holding talks over changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement  a pact that Trump has threatened to abandon  Six months of tense talks have produced little in the way of progress and a move by Washington to link the steel and aluminum tariffs to progress on NAFTA was rebuffed by Canada and Mexico   U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer also attempted to drive a wedge between Canada and Mexico when he suggested the United States would be willing to hold bilateral  rather than trilateral talks  The two countries again stood firm   In Washington  aides scrambled to meet Trump s demand for the paperwork to be completed for a formal announcement  The exact timing was unclear as the tariff documentation had to be drafted and go through a variety of reviews  a process that takes days  an administration official said  There was always a chance that Trump  could amend his initial announcement  to take account of the concerns expressed about it  said a source familiar with the internal debate at the White House  TRUMP S TRADE TRAIL Trump has frequently talked tough on trade  although his actions have not always matched his words  On his first day in office in January 2017  he withdrew from the 14 nation Trans Pacific Partnership agreement  a deal that was dead on arrival in the U S  Congress in any case  He has frequently tweeted and said that he would pull out of NAFTA  which he has called a jobs killer  But a year after taking office  the 1994 deal remains intact  Trump has approved a series of small scale trade actions  of which the steel and aluminum duties would be a part  Taken together with actions on washing machines and solar panels  the proposed move accounts for just 4 1 percent of U S  imports  In terms of global trade  they are just 0 6 percent  investment bank  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  said in a report  The head of the World Trade Organization warned of a real risk of triggering an escalation of global trade barriers and a deep recession  even as financial markets and many economists started to discount the risk of a global crisis   We must make every effort to avoid the fall of the first dominoes  There is still time

 We are not looking to get into trade wars   Mnuchin said Tuesday during a congressional committee hearing when asked about the tariffs  adding that he is  supportive  of imposing the duties 
Read more  Will tariffs spur Cohn s exit 
White House economic adviser Gary Cohn is summoning executives from U S  companies that depend on the metals to meet this week with Trump to make the case that the tariffs will cost more jobs than they save and damage the U S  economy  according to two people familiar with the plan  Trump has told advisers he believes the former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   executive will leave the administration if he imposes the tariffs  said people familiar with the matter 
Republicans in Congress are making an unusual public campaign to thwart the tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum  House Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday urged the president to  be more surgical  in penalizing trade abuses to prevent  any kind of unintended consequences or collateral damage  
The threat of retaliation and escalating tit for tat penalties damaging growth around the world is already rising  The European Union warned it would respond with its own 25 percent tariff to hit  3 5 billion of U S  goods  The EU is targeting iconic U S  brands produced in key Republican constituencies on a range of consumer  agricultural and steel products that will be levied if Trump goes through on his tariff threat  according to a list drawn up by the European Commission 
The Latest  Will Trump Tariffs Help Steel in America s Rust Belt
Trump vowed on Monday to stand fast  telling reporters   We re not backing down   After announcing the steel and aluminum tariffs  the president tweeted on Friday  trade wars are good  and easy to win  
The split in the Republican ranks on trade is coming to a head as the party struggles to hold a previously safe House seat in a special election in steel country  Trump plans to visit the area on Saturday  a few days before the vote in southwestern Pennsylvania  where recent polls show a Democrat slightly ahead in a district Trump carried by 20 percentage points in 2016 
Tariff supporters are pressing Trump to announce the measures during his visit to mobilize GOP voters  but Cohn is pushing back with the meeting of executives to make the case that trade sanctions will damage the economy and hurt the president s own re election campaign in 2020  The White House session with Trump later this week will include representatives of breweries  beverage can manufacturers and automakers  along with the oil industry  said the people  who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a policy disagreement 
Advisers  Come   Go 
It s unclear whether Cohn s campaign or the threat of losing his top economic adviser will be enough to change the president s mind  Trump said in a tweet Tuesday there may be more staff turnover  even as he denied his administration is chaotic 
 People will always come   go  and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision   Trump said in a Twitter posting   I still have some people that I want to change  always seeking perfection   There is no Chaos  only great Energy  
The tariffs could reduce U S  growth by as much as 0 2 percentage point this year  and further risk lies in how trading partners respond   Barclays   LON BARC  Plc economists said  While a tight job market and tax cuts are likely to keep America s expansion humming along  the trade tensions could weigh on growth and boost inflation more than desired by Fed policy makers 
Motorcycles  Bourbon and Jeans
Mnuchin told a House Appropriations subcommittee that Canada  the U S  s biggest supplier of steel  could gain relief from the tariffs along with Mexico if they can reach an agreement with Trump on renegotiating Nafta  The tariffs won t apply to the U S  neighbors if a new trade deal is concluded  he said 
He added that the Nafta renegotiation is an administration  priority   along with shifting trade with China to a  fair and balanced  relationship 
The list of targeted U S  goods    including motorcycles  jeans and bourbon whiskey    sends a political message to Washington about the potential domestic economic costs of making good on the president s threat 
Paul Ryan  Republican speaker of the House of Representatives  comes from the same state    Wisconsin    where motorcycle maker Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   is based  Harley Davidson already is being hit by a deepening slump in American motorcycle demand  which has spurred job cuts and the closing of a plant in Kansas City  Missouri 
Rare Public Break
Earlier this week  Ryan said he was  extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war  and urged Trump to drop his tariff proposal  The comments  delivered through a spokeswoman  were a rare public break with Trump 
Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado said many Republican lawmakers oppose the tariffs and he has  no doubt Congress would be forced to act  to end them if Trump proceeds 
 There is a series of legislative actions that could be taken to reverse the decision  obviously with the president supporting them they would have to be done in a way that would overcome any action that he would take  but we still have time   Gardner said 
However Republican Senator Jeff Flake said he doesn t think enough Republicans would cross the president by passing legislation to reverse the tariffs  even as he called the measure  completely  utterly irrational  
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas and other House Republicans are seeking to blunt the tariffs  impact by adding an  exclusion process  allowing American companies to petition for duty free access for imports that aren t available from U S  sources 
The lawmakers want existing contracts for aluminum and steel to be exempted from tariffs  They also called for a review of the effects of tariffs on the economy  to determine if a different approach would better serve the interests of our American workers  job creators  and consumers  
 Done right the president could impact trade positively   Brady told reporters Tuesday   We want to help him tailor it  
If Trump follows through with the tariffs he proposed  the Senate Finance Committee should consider holding hearings  said John Cornyn of Texas  the No  2 Republican in the chamber 
 The part that concerns me the most is the potential for retaliatory tariffs and a so called trade war and other areas that would affect some of the more vulnerable sectors of our economy  like agriculture   Cornyn said ",2018-03-06,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/mnuchin-tries-to-douse-tradewar-fears-over-trump-tariff-threats-1327631,1327631
166123,387639,HOG,Europe Said to Be Close to Exemption on Trump Metal Tariffs,news," Bloomberg     The European Union believes it s on track to be exempted from imminent U S  tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum  dialing down the risk of a trans Atlantic trade war 
European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom ended two days of talks in Washington with the hope of a U S  pledge to exclude the EU from the import duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum  four EU officials said Thursday on the condition of anonymity  The levies initially were set to take effect on Friday 
 Cecilia Malmstrom had a good  very fruitful visit to Washington   commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Thursday   We have good opportunities now to solve the issue and stabilize  or calm down  the problem  
The upbeat assessment came as the European Commission  the EU s executive arm  briefed ambassadors from the bloc s 28 national governments about the issue in Brussels  EU leaders are scheduled to discuss the results of Malmstrom s visit to Washington at a gathering later Thursday in the Belgian capital 
President Donald Trump earlier this month announced the protectionist measures on national security grounds  signaled Canada  Mexico and Australia would be excluded and gave his top trade negotiator  Robert Lighthizer  scope to work out exemptions for more countries by March 23 
Not exempt is China  which may also face an additional  50 billion of U S  tariffs over intellectual property violations  a person familiar with that matter said  The value of the tariffs was based on U S  estimates of damage caused by intellectual property theft  the person said 
Thursday Announcement
The EU expects the Trump administration to make an announcement later Thursday about an exclusion for the bloc from the metal tariffs  two of the European officials said 
The EU has been scrambling for a waiver while warning that a failure to gain one would lead to a tit for tat response on 2 8 billion euros   3 5 billion  of imports of U S  goods including Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   motorcycles  Levi Strauss   Co  jeans and bourbon whiskey 
The EU also said that  without an exemption  it would file a complaint to the World Trade Organization against the Trump administration and introduce  safeguard  measures to prevent metal shipments from other parts of the world to America from being diverted to the European market and flooding it 
Lighthizer said on Wednesday that the government could delay imposing the metal tariffs on some countries while negotiations take place on a more permanent exclusion and that he s aiming to have waiver deliberations wrapped up by the end of April 
In her last ditch push to win a carve out for the EU  Malmstrom met U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Lighthizer during her visit 
 There are prospects to start some sort of negotiating process   Katainen said   In trade wars there are no winners  only losers  And the losers are normal citizens who will lose their jobs  
The Trump administration is linking a permanent exemption for Europe from the metal duties to the establishment of a high level group on trade relations whose goal will be to reach a  quick and neat  deal on tariffs  including for goods such as cars  according to one of the EU officials 
Malmstrom was told in Washington that this idea doesn t represent a revival of longstanding plans for a broad EU U S  market opening accord that Trump shelved after taking office in January 2017  the official said 
Robert Zoellick  a former U S  trade representative  said earlier this month that the Trump administration has shown little respect for the multilateral order underpinned by the WTO and views international commerce in terms of individual deals involving national muscle flexing

166187,387703,HOG,Executing Exit Strategies In A Timely Manner,opinion,"After executing our covered call writing trades  we immediately prepare for position management opportunities exit strategies  One of these strategies in our arsenal is the Mid Contract Unwind exit strategy  This is used when share value appreciates dramatically resulting in a  cost to close of near zero  In other words  the option originally sold will be trading near parity  intrinsic value only  
Having maxed the original trade  closing at a cost of near zero will allow us to use the cash from the sale of the stock to generate a second income stream in the same contract month with a covered call position using a different underlying security  The better our timing with these exit strategies the greater our level of success 
Real life example  Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG 
On July 1  2016  HOG rallied nearly  9 00 per share on reports of a potential buyout  Here is a look at the gap up in price that day 
HOG Gap UP on July 1  2016
With the stock now trading at  54 25  the  45 00 call option was deep in the money and trading near parity  The cost to close at this time was  9 50 which consisted of  9 25 of intrinsic value and  0 25 of time value  The practical cost to close is  25 00 per contract plus small trading commissions  We get to this  25 00 figure by deducting the increase in share value buying back the option produces 
Prior to closing the short option position  our shares can be worth no more than  45 00 per share  our contract obligation  After buying back the option our shares are now worth market value or  54 25  It we can then take the cash generated by selling the stock to generate a second income stream in the same month with the same cash we have made greater than a maximum profit for the month 
Why act immediately when the opportunity arises 
There are two reasons why we should react reasonably quickly when these opportunities arise 
1  Share price can decline resulting in a higher cost to close 
2  Theta is reducing the time values of the second option positions as expiration approaches 
Two days later
HOG experienced some negative news about the buyout resulting in several analyst downgrades causing share value to decline from  54 00 to  47 66  With the  45 00 not nearly as deep in the money at this point in time  the time value cost to close moved up to  0 89   3 55    2 66   more than triple the amount had we acted sooner 
Options Chain for HOG After Price Decline
The time value cost to close is now  0 89   3 55    2 66  about 3 1 2 times more than it was two days prior to the price decline  We also find ourselves with two days less time value to generate with our second income generating position as  is eroding option premiums 
Discussion
There is more to position management than executing these exit strategies  The timing of the management trades plays a vital role in our success as well as the time value of our option premiums can change as a result of Delta  change in share price  and Theta  passing of calendar days  as demonstrated in this real life example ",2016-12-18,Dr. Alan Ellman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/executing-exit-strategies-in-a-timely-manner-200170057,200170057

After recording negative YoY EPS growth for the last 8 consecutive quarters  XOM is expected to post triple digit growth in 2017  Energy is finally starting to make a comeback  staying above the  50 mark so far this year  Promises from OPEC and non OPEC countries such as Russia to keep production low have given investors hope that prices could continue to improve throughout 2017  with many analysts targeting oil s price range at  60  70 barrel  However OPEC s spotty record of adhering to such production quotas still has many skeptical about whether or not it will be carried out

Three specific metrics grab investors  attention with each passing quarter that Under Armour reports earnings  sales growth  profit margins and international expansion  The athletic shoe maker is currently sporting a 5 year streak of posting at least 20  growth on the top line  This streak is in jeopardy of ending after management guided weak holiday and fiscal 2017 sales during its third quarter report  In an effort to energize growth  Under Armour began investing in newer endeavors such as international expansion  high end clothing and wearable technology  Still  plenty of evidence points to a slowdown in core segments  particularly basketball shoes  Current channel checks show Curry brand shoes fell short of sales targets on Footlocker and Finish Line  NASDAQ FINL  websites  The same held true for men s running footwear and women s brands from competitors like Nike  NYSE NKE  and Adidas  DE ADSGN  who have recently captured greater market share  Under Armour s slump not only impacts the top line  but also stretches margins thin  For top brands like Under Armour and Nike  margins dictate whether the companys performed well during the quarter 
Mastercard  NYSE MA 
The success or failure of credit card companies highlights a number of facets like the state of the spending environment  With holiday spending appearing to have taken a turn for the better  indications look strong for Mastercard s first quarter report  The credit company made significant strides recently and looks to extends its winning streak to four consecutive quarters  A large portion of Tuesday s results is predicated on international markets  namely Europe and Asia  Early signs point to a slight improvement in Europe while Asian markets still appear mixed  Meanwhile  Mastercard s digital strategy  which includes a partnership with PayPal  NASDAQ PYPL   supports the top line through greater processed transactions and volume 
Coach  NYSE COH 
Thriving luxury brands are far and few between in the current retail environment  As a result  brand names like Coach struggle to make sales at face value and must resort to heavy discounting to push products  It hasn t helped that ongoing currency headwinds continue to take a toll on international markets and tourism related sales  Coach remains dedicated to expanding its outlet stores and online platform to offset some of these losses  The ongoing transformation includes the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman  which is believed to provide accretive effects to performance  Nonetheless  the broader downturn in modern luxury sales promises to hamper financial performance  despite a promising slew of improvements

Volkswagen  DE VOWG p   which put Ducati up for sale in April  wants to sell the 91 year old business to fund its strategic review in the wake of the emissions scandal

Ducati is wholly controlled by VW s Audi division  DE NSUG    Audi s Ingolstadt  Germany based headquarters declined comment  as did parent VW 
Eicher  whose shares reached a record high on Thursday  could not immediately be reached for comment

Factors Influencing this Quarter
Harley Davidson is expanding its product portfolio to increase its customer base  The company s large share in the U S  motorcycle market  consistent capital deployment and favorable shipment guidance are positives  Harley Davidson expects shipments in 2016 to be around 269 000 274 000 units  up 1  3  year over year  International sales are anticipated to grow faster than U S  sales this year 
However  Harley Davidson expects stiff competition to hurt retail sales this year as competitors rely on discounting and product introduction to boost sales  Further  the company anticipates headwinds due to macroeconomic challenges in some regions  Harley Davidson also expects a small decline in operating income for the Financial Services segment this year due to increased borrowing costs and unfavorable credit losses  partially offset by higher revenues 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Harley Davidson is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Harley Davidson is currently pegged at  0 65   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of  1 52 stands below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 53 
Zacks Rank  Harley Davidson currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions HARLEY DAVIDSON Price and EPS Surprise   Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

Based in Milwaukee  WI  Harley Davidson is an American motorcycle manufacturer  According to the EPA  the company sold about 340 000 of the tuners  and more than 12 000 motorcycles of various models with the tuners pre installed 
Of the  15 million settlement   12 million will be paid as civil penalty while the other  3 million will be spent on a project to mitigate air pollution by replacing conventional woodstoves with cleaner burning models 
 This settlement is not an admission of liability but instead represents a good faith compromise with the EPA on areas of law we interpret differently  particularly EPA s assertion that it is illegal for anyone to modify a certified vehicle even if it will be used solely for off road closed course competition   said Ed Moreland  Harley Davidson s Government Affairs Director

166307,387823,HOG,Harley Davidson s Flat Tire  Demographics,opinion,Harley Davidson  Inc   HOG  is an American icon  It s also a well managed company and one of those true rarities  a successful turnaround story  This is a company that was facing bankruptcy in the early 1980s yet managed to rebuild itself into the pride of American manufacturing and the subject of countless case studies in MBA programs worldwide  Harley s management was able to pull off that coup by leveraging that intangible quality that is so hard to imitate  brand cachet  For a particular breed of leather wearing motorcycle enthusiast  there is simply nothing on par with a Harley  But all of that said  I wouldn t touch the stock  or at least not at today s prices  At first glance Harley wouldn t appear exceptionally pricey  It trades for 17 times trailing earnings and 2 times sales  This compares to 16 times earnings and 1 5 times sales for the S P 500  A modest premium is appropriate for an iconic company with Harley s branding power  and not to mention its high return on equity of 25 8    right  Well  maybe  But Daimler  DDAIF  a company that knows a thing or two about vehicle branding trades for just 10 times earnings and 0 42 times sales  Yes  I realize it s not an apples to apples comparison and that Harley runs a higher margin operation in a business with fewer direct competitors  All else equal  Harley should trade at a slight premium to a larger automaker like Daimler  But all else is not equal  and Harley has a serious growth problem  And it s not one that will go away with a recovering economy Harley s revenues are still below their pre crisis highs  see chart   Unit sales paint an even bleaker picture  Harley sold 349 196 bikes in 2006  the number in 2012 was just 247 625  That s a unit decrease of nearly 30  To be fair  revenues and unit sales have enjoyed a nice bounce since the pits of the financial crisis  But Harley will never get its old mojo back for one critical reason that is completely outside the control of management  demographics Down the road from my house in Dallas  there is greasy drive in burger joint called Keller s a place I ve been known to frequent a little more often than my doctor might recommend  On any given weekend  you might see a dozen or more bikers parked in the lot  showing off their chrome laden Harleys  And nearly all of them are over the age of 45  Most are over 50 This isn t a coincidence  Harley Davidson is a brand whose sales depend disproportionately for that matter  almost exclusively on middle aged Caucasian males  Riders younger than 40 generally lack the time  interest  or the bankroll to buy a Harley  But by the time they get into their 60s or older  the noise and joint pain have begun to make riding lose its allure  You may still ride in your 60s  but you re doing it less frequently and you probably aren t buying a new bike  The sweet spot is the mid 40s to early 50s  And with the Baby Boomers the largest and wealthiest generation in history now largely aged out of this key demographic bracket  Harley has a serious problem  Generation X my generation is not nearly large enough to pick up the slack  and Generation Y  aka  the Millennials  or  Echo Boomers   are decades away from being in the demographic sweet spot for Harley  The number of American men aged 40 49 is set to decline through the early 2020s and won t reach its old 2010 peak until 2035   reported on this as far back as 2010  and demographic strategist Harry Dent my old boss has used Harley as a case study for decades  Harley Davidson s management is not stupid  They understand the issues they face  and they have gone so far as to address it with a dedicated page on their Investor Relations site    The company has aggressively expanded its marketing efforts to attract younger men  non Caucasian men  and women and has had modest success  Per the demographic site  management writes  In 2012  U S  sales of new Harley Davidson motorcycles to our  outreach  customers   young adults 18 34  women  African Americans and Hispanics   grew overall at more than twice the rate as sales to our traditional U S  customer base of Caucasian men  ages 35 plus   But realistically  there is no replacing the white Boomer male  And this means a very rough decade ahead for Harley Davidson  Stocks in industries in gentle decline are not necessarily bad investments  as tobacco stock investors have no doubt noticed  Under the right set of circumstances strong financial health  large barriers to entry  good dividend growth and share buybacks stocks in no growth industries can make better investments than those in high growth industries  But for this to be the case  the stock has to be priced appropriately  Big Tobacco has had a great decade long run because it started out cheap and hated and paid a monster dividend  Harley Davidson  in contrast  trades at a slight premium to the market and yields only 1 7   Harley Davidson may be a good buy eventually  But given the demographic headwinds it faces  it s not cheap enough for serious consideration at this time  Diclosures  Sizemore

 By Kyle Peterson
 CHICAGO  April 19  Reuters    Harley Davidson Inc reported
a quarterly profit that fell short of Wall Street forecasts and
trimmed its 2011 shipment forecast  and its shares fell 1
percent in premarket trading on Tuesday 
 The motorcycle maker reported a 3 5 percent increase in
quarterly sales of new motorcycles  but trimmed its full year
shipment forecast because of supply chain interruptions
resulting from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan 
 First quarter earnings jumped from a year earlier  driven
largely by a 150 percent rise in income from its financial
services unit 
 Harley Davidson is seeing renewed demand for its
motorcycles as the economy recovers from a downturn  Its shares
fell 1 percent to  39 28 in premarket trading after dropping
more than 5 percent earlier 
  We are pleased by the growth of our dealers  new
motorcycle sales on a worldwide basis  led by strength in
Europe  even as we continue to encounter some headwinds in the
U S  related to the challenging macro economic conditions  
Chief Executive Keith Wandell said in a statement 
 The company said its first quarter income was  119 3
million  or 51 cents per share  compared with income of  68 7
million  or 29 cents per share  in the year ago period 
 Analysts on average had expected the Milwaukee based
company to report a profit of 53 cents per share  according to
Thomson Reuters I B E S 
 Harley Davidson said its first quarter earnings
improvements were driven largely by income from its financial
services  which soared 154 6 percent compared with the first
quarter of 2010 
 Harley Davidson said its financial services segment earned
 67 9 million in the quarter  up from  26 7 million in the
year ago quarter  The increase was due to continued improvement
in credit performance  the company said 
 Harley widened its full year motorcycle shipment forecast
to accommodate a slight supply chain interruption arising from
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan 
 The new forecast is for the company to ship 215 000 to
228 000 Harley Davidson motorcycles to dealers and distributors
in 2011  That outlook is changed from 221 000 to 228 000
motorcycles 
  We continue to assess our supply chains and as a
precaution we have decided to modestly reduce the lower end of
shipment guidance following the events in Japan   Wandell
said 
 The company said it expects to ship 62 000 to 67 000
motorcycles in the second quarter 
  We think Harley will ultimately get a pass on the Japan
issue  so the stock should recover   RBC Capital Markets

166319,387835,HOG,Week in Review Part III  Foreign Affairs,opinion,Israel  In a shocking development  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he had formed a unity government with the main opposition party  Kadima  just a day after strongly hinting he would call an early election in September  as I noted last WIR  The move gives the coalition 94 of the Knesset s 120 members  a massive majority that will allow Netanyahu to push through political reform  curtail the exemption of ultra Orthodox Jews from military service and  perhaps  renew peace talks with the Palestinians  as it pushes the prime minister s government back to the center from the far Right His new partner  Kadima leader Shaul Mofaz  will become vice prime minister and regarding the issue of Iran  while Mofaz has spoken out against a unilateral Israeli strike in the past  he is a former military chief and defense minister and has a history of reversing his position on key matters Now  coupled with defense minister Ehud Barak  Netanyahu is able to beat back those such as former Mossad chief Meir Dagan who have gone public with their criticism of a strike  They call me messianic   said Netanyahu of his critics  vowing that along with his coalition partners  all elected officials  he d make  responsible  decisions on Iran Just this week  Vice President Joe Biden made clear that time was running out for Iran as the next round of negotiations rapidly approaches Benny Avni   New York Post No one should expect an Israeli attack  tomorrow morning   as Barak said recently  To start with  Netanyahu is waiting  without much hope  for the results of an American backed negotiation with the mullahs  But as Biden  scrambling to catch up  acknowledged while addressing Jewish leaders yesterday  Tuesday    The window has not closed in terms of the Israelis if they choose to act on their own militarily   In fact  that window opened wider yesterday  Even if Israel opts to wait until after the U S  election in November  speculation about Netanyahu s next move is bound to rattle markets and influence global decision makers all summer and into the fall  And that s bound to seep into this country s politics  too  Charles Krauthammer   Washington Post On June 5   1967  Israel launched a preemptive strike on the Egyptian air force  then proceeded to lightning victories on three fronts  The Six Day War is legend  but less remembered is that  four days earlier  the nationalist opposition  Menachem Begin s Likud precursor  was for the first time ever brought into the government  creating an emergency national unity coalition  Everyone understood why  You do not undertake a supremely risky preemptive war without the full participation of a broad coalition representing a national consensus  Forty five years later  in the middle of the night of May 7 8  2012  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shocked his country by bringing the main opposition party  Kadima  into a national unity government  Shocking because just hours earlier  the Knesset was expediting a bill to call early elections in September  Why did the high flying Netanyahu call off elections he was sure to win  Because for Israelis today  it is May  67  The dread is not quite as acute  The mood is not despair  just foreboding  Time is running out  but not quite as fast  War is not four days away  but it looms  Israelis today face the greatest threat to their existence   nuclear weapons in the hands of apocalyptic mullahs publicly pledged to Israel s annihilation   since May  67  The world is again telling Israelis to do nothing as it looks for a way out  But if such a way is not found   as in  67   Israelis know that they will once again have to defend themselves  by themselves   The wall to wall coalition demonstrates Israel s political readiness to attack  if necessary   Its military readiness is not in doubt   Those counseling Israeli submission  resignation or just endless patience can no longer dismiss Israel s tough stance as the work of irredeemable right wingers  Not with a government now representing 78  of the country  Netanyahu forfeited September elections that would have given him four more years in power  He chose instead to form a national coalition that guarantees 18 months of stability   18 months during which  if the world does not act  whether by diplomacy or otherwise  to stop Iran  Israel will  And it will not be the work of one man  one party or one ideological faction  As in 1967  it will be the work of a nation  Meanwhile  Israeli intelligence shows Iran and Hizbullah planning attacks on senior officers traveling overseas  this after the series of bombing attacks that Iran and Hizbullah are believed to have carried out in Thailand  Georgia  India and Azerbaijan  All except a bombing in New Delhi were foiled  Hizbullah is believed to be still attempting to avenge the 2008 assassination of its military commander Imad Mughniyeh Iran  So what are the Iranians saying as the May 23 round of talks in Baghdad approaches  A spokesman with the Foreign Ministry said  Some countries say they are concerned that Iran s activities might be diverted towards non peaceful purposes in the future  When they are talking about future speculation  how can they not be concerned about scrapping nuclear weapons at the present time  Some of these countries have nuclear capable submarines they have delivered to the Zionist regime   Ramin Mehmanparast said  alluding to transfers of German built subs to Israel No doubt Iran is feeling the heat as a result of the economic sanctions  but it also seems a bit na ve in believing the European Union s July 1 ban on Iranian crude can be easily negotiated away It also seems that Iran is attempting to eliminate incriminating evidence at its Parchin armed forces installation before a potential visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency that has yet to be allowed into Parchin Iran s top justice official  Ayatollah Larijani  said   The Iranian people will not retreat from the firm steps they have taken on the path to access nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  and the Westerners should put this wishful thinking out of their mind  Syria  Twin bombings that killed 55 people and wounded more than 350 in Damascus on Thursday not only drew wide condemnation across the world  but in all likelihood doomed the peace effort in the country  The carnage was the work of two suicide car bombers who detonated their devices near a main intelligence complex during morning rush hour  It was the deadliest attack in the capital since the uprising against the Bashar al Assad regime began 14 months ago Of course the Syrian government said the attacks were a sign that the Arab state was facing foreign backed terrorism  and regardless of your opinion  on this single incident they are probably right  Syrian television showed a man pointing to the wreckage   Is this freedom  This is the work of the Saudis   he said  It s the Saudis who have advocated arming the rebels  Try al Qaeda types instead The White House  through spokesman Jay Carney  said   There are clearly extremist elements in Syria  as we have said all along  who are trying to take advantage of the chaos in that country  chaos brought about by Assad s brutal assault on his own people  But Mr  Carney failed to explain why his boss has been invisible while thousands have been slaughtered The Kremlin said it would not yield to pressure to change its pro Assad stance  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted as saying   Some of our foreign partners are doing practical things so that the situation in Syria explodes in literal and figurative sense  A leading member of the opposition said   These bombs are not the work of opposition fighters  Egypt  The country held its first ever presidential debate on Thursday and Amr Moussa and Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh  tipped to be the two frontrunners  traded accusations over their political histories  Fotouh is the independent Islamist and former member of the Muslim Brotherhood who just picked up the endorsement of the hardline Salafists  while Moussa is the former foreign minister under ousted President Hosni Mubarak  How can you bring about change after being part of the former regime  Do you think the Egyptian people who revolted to bring this regime down will be eager to elect one of its former symbols   Fotouh said Moussa replied   First  I would like to tell Dr  Abol Fotouh that I was not part of the ousted regime  For the past 10 years  I have been completely disassociated from the regime  I had the courage to oppose the regime from within when I was foreign minister and I decided to quit when things reached a dead end  I knew the consequences of my opposition  but yet I continued to do what I thought was right   he added Moussa then said of Fotouh   I do not recall you voicing strong opinions about the former regime  Your opposition was simply linked to your affiliation to the Muslim Brotherhood  You always opposed within the framework of the Brotherhood and most of the time you were defending your group rather than standing up for the rights of the entire Egyptian people  Fotouh said he was proud of his past affiliation with the Brotherhood  He quit in April 2011 to run for president  saying  I wanted to be a candidate representing all Egyptians and not only one group  Both candidates pledged to review Egypt s 1979 peace treaty with Israel So that s more than you probably wanted to read about the Egyptian presidential debate but at least they held one   Hussein Abdallah   The Daily Star Afghanistan  For the 20th time this year  an attacker wearing an Afghan army uniform opened fire on NATO troops Friday  killing one service member  as I go to post  presumably an American   The Taliban claimed responsibility Separately  an AP GfK poll showed that only 27  of Americans say they support the war  a new low  with 66  opposing it  A year ago  37  favored the war  and in the spring of 2010  the reading was 46  At the same time  53  approve of Obama s handling of Afghanistan  42  disapprove Russia  President Vladimir Putin was sworn in on Monday and received the briefcase enabling him to order a nuclear strike from any location as a gift  just sayin  Putin pledged in a speech before 3 000 invited guests to  strengthen Russian democracy  constitutional rights and freedoms   declaring   I will do all I can to justify the faith of millions of our citizens  I consider it to be the meaning of my whole life and my obligation to serve my fatherland and our people  Russia would become  the center of gravity for the entire Eurasia  Putin also claimed  describing the nation as  reborn  after the crisis of the post Soviet years By the way  I wish I had been invited  even though I ve long predicted Putin won t last the year  You see  the reception  only 1 000 tabbed for this  sports fans  cost  1 million and  according to the London Times  included  sturgeon in champagne sauce  fried crab and tsarist ukha  a traditional fish soup known to be a favorite of Mr  Putin s  The Kremlin s own premium vodka and a remarkable 5 000 bottles of 2008 Abrau Durso Russian sparkling wine were also being served  Mmmm fried crab  I m drooling  Meanwhile  the day before Putin s inauguration  50 000 people took part in a protest and more than 400 were arrested  including anti corruption blogger  Alexey Navalny  A number of protesters were injured by police  as well as about 20 cops  These were the first violent clashes between the two sides since rallies began in December Putin s press secretary Dmitry Peskov allegedly said    The police  were too soft  Protesters who hurt riot police should have their livers smeared on the asphalt  Later  appearing in front of the Duma  which approved his choice of Dmitry Medvedev as prime minister  thus completing the job swap  299 144  Putin was his usual sarcastic  insensitive self David Statter   Wall Street Journal The violence that accompanied the inauguration of Vladimir Putin as Russian president this week is an ominous sign that Mr  Putin s apparent desire to rule for life is leading his country toward a dangerous political confrontation   Dmitry Peskov  Mr  Putin s spokesman  said he regretted that the police had not behaved more harshly  But harsh treatment may do little to shore up Mr  Putin s dwindling support  Rising prosperity had until recently obscured the fact that Mr  Putin and a small group of cronies control an estimated 10  15  of Russia s gross national product   Another problem bred by Mr  Putin s rule is a deteriorating economy  Crude oil and gas account for 75  of Russia s exports  In order for him to win the presidency  Mr  Putin s government authorized  161 billion in additional spending through 2018  increasing pensions and freezing gas prices  As a result  the government needs an oil price of  150 a barrel over the next few years to break even  while a sharp fall in price  for example to  80 a barrel  could lead to an immediate crisis  And you have the rise of nationalist extremism  In the face of all this  Mr  Putin has made attempts to endow himself with new legitimacy  In recent years  he s been filmed riding a Harley Davidson  singing the 1950s hit  Blueberry Hill   and photographed riding a horse bare chested  One of his aides said he believed that Mr  Putin was sent to Russia by God  and the Russian media reported that a small female sect believes that Mr  Putin is the reincarnation of the Apostle Paul  None of this  however  is likely to protect the Putin regime from the challenge it now faces  Russia is a country in which the population has no respect for the political system  their rulers  or the distribution of property   In the best of all worlds Mr  Putin would resign  and free and fair elections  with nonpartisan monitors  would be held  But even that would not be enough  Russia needs a commission similar to the South African Commission on Truth and Reconciliation to review publicly not only the crimes of the Putin era but also crimes committed during the eight year rule of his predecessor  Boris Yeltsin  Only this can provide a basis for democracy   What s at stake is not just the country s prosperity but its existence as a civilized society  I ve said Putin will be done in by a shadowy third force  one of the corrupt hardliners he is now protecting as part of a battle between the hardliners vs  the reformers  as distinct from the opposition   Bottom line for the next few months  a crackdown on the protesters is a certainty                                          Meanwhile  Putin backed out of a meeting with President Obama and the other G8 leaders at Camp David  May 18 19  citing he needed to work on his new cabinet and that he was sending Prime Minister Medvedev in his stead  Analysts were skeptical about the official explanation  viewing it as a deliberate snub of Obama  as well as other G8 leaders  over their criticism of Russian elections in December and March  Plus Putin has major issues with the anti missile defense program I ve also been writing for years that you re nuts if you re planning on attending the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi owing to the terror threat there  This week the Russian government announced it had foiled a plot  supposedly seizing 10 caches of weapons and ammunition in the breakaway republic of Abkhazia  which is just kilometers from Sochi  As noted in the Moscow Times   The terrorists were planning to smuggle the explosives and arms into Sochi  between 2012 and 2014 to use them during the preparations and during the games   according to the National Anti Terrorist Committee and the Federal Security Service   Sochi sits in the North Caucasus region  near the Russia Georgia border  Kathryn Stoner Weiss  Senior Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University  told USA TODAY  This is probably the start of extreme potential problems in the area with the Winter Olympics in Sochi  It s almost the worst part of Russia to put the Games  It s not so much because of Georgia  but the Caucasus in general  Russia is blaming both Chechen rebel leader Umarov and Georgia for the plot  I doubt Georgia is involved and agree with Ms  Stoner Weiss that Russia implicated Georgia for political reasons And Russia suffered a tragic embarrassment with the crash of a demonstration airplane during a 50 minute flight over Indonesia  All 50 on board are presumed dead as the Sukhoi Superjet 100 crashed into the side of a volcano that was probably shrouded in fog at the time The jetliner was the first new model to be produced in Russia since the end of the Soviet Union and is a crushing blow to the national aerospace industry The Superjet s  31 7 million price tag is one third that of comparable short hop jets and Russia was expecting orders of 1 000 over the next two decades  Thus the cause of the crash is critical  For the workers  sake  I hope its pilot error China  It s been flying under the radar  but a dispute over the resource rich South China Sea between China and the Philippines could escalate at a moment s notice  The issue is known as the Scarborough Shoal in English and  along with most of the South China Sea  is claimed by China  but the Philippines feels in their rights to not only fish it  but tap portions for the natural resources  this as China announced the China National Offshore Oil Corp  will start drilling operations in the Shoal   I ll have more in an upcoming  Hot Spots  column  On a different issue  the Global Times  a state owned newspaper  commented on the case of activist Chen Guangcheng  who fled house arrest to seek safety in the U S  embassy  External forces would like to use this to politicize and universalize some of China s social conflicts  They want Chen s case to become deadlocked  drawing in international attention  and becoming an issue as big as what has happened in Libya and Syria  so that they can capitalize on this opportunity to demonize China as a whole  The commentator  Liu Yang  said  Chen didn t realize he was being used and his case being hyped into a national political issue  How can they be so cruel as to use a disabled person in their political games    Agence France Presse Chen is still in a Beijing hospital after China agreed to guarantee his safety and allow him to apply for study in the United States  There are conflicting stories on the treatment of his family North Korea  Multiple experts told the AP that while Pyongyang has enough plutonium for roughly six bombs and has begun enriching uranium to bomb grade levels  the North has yet to demonstrate the ability to weaponize the material But the state run Korean Central News Agency read a statement that  Our military and people will thoroughly safeguard our dignity

166321,387837,HOG,Harley Davidson To Unveil Its First Electric Motorcycle,news,"By    Motorcycle giant Harley Davidson Motor Co   NYSE HOG  is propelling battery powered motorcycles into the mainstream 
The 111 year old manufacturer is slated to unveil its first electric motorcycle next week in New York  marking its initial step into a niche vehicle market that until now has included only a handful of small startups 
 We think that the trends in both  electric vehicle  technology and customer openness to EV products  both automotive and motorcycles  is only going to increase   Matthew Levatich  the company s president  told Associated Press this week   When you think about sustainability and environmental trends  we just see that being an increasing part of the lifestyle and the requirements of riders  
Its emissions free LiveWire motorcycle won t have the familiar roar of its gas powered models  Instead  it will sound like a fighter jet coming in for a landing  an executive told Bloomberg News  The model will undergo extensive research and development in the next several years before it hits the market 
The big brand s move into electric motorcycles  is going to do a lot for this nascent market   Cosmin Laslau  a research analyst in energy storage technologies at Lux Research in Boston  told International Business Times   When somebody has the manufacturing heft behind them to put out high quality products that are backed by a really strong engineering department   then it opens up a host of opportunities  

Still  Laslau said he doesn t think electric motorcycles will be flying off the showroom floor any time soon  for two key reasons  expensive battery packs that drive up sticker prices  and consumers  range anxiety the fear that they ll find themselves stranded on the road with a dead battery and no place to charge  Both hurdles plague the four wheel electric vehicle market  which so far make up just 1 percent of annual vehicle sales worldwide 
Harley said its electric motorcycle battery will go about 130 miles on a single charge  Laslau said the maker could attract more buyers by doubling the range  Smaller  more energy dense battery packs could also help drive down the price premium of electric bikes  That s  the biggest thing that could drive this market   he said 
Only about 5 000 full size  high powered electric motorcycles are expected to sell globally this year  and half will come from one firm alone  the Silicon Valley startup Zero Motorcycles  By comparison  Harley Davidson sold more than 260 000 conventional motorcycles in 2013  AP noted 
Other electric motorcycle makers include startups like Brammo  Mission Motor and Lightning  though Japan s Yamaha Motor has an electric model in development  and Germany s BMW  XETRA BMWG is said to have an electric scooter in production  according to the Los Angeles Times 
Harley s Levatich said the company will address the range anxiety challenge by helping to develop rapid charging technologies and creating universal industry standards  so that all makes and models can use the same plugs  AP said  He added that Harley could also provide charging stations through its dealership network 
Laslau suggested that Harley might take a page from the electric automobile experience  While demand from mass market consumers might be tepid  luxury class cars have so far been a hit  think Tesla    It might be an interesting expansion into new markets where they re trying to target unconventional  motorcycle  buyers   he said ",2014-06-19,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/harley-davidson-to-unveil-its-first-electric-motorcycle-290637,290637
166322,387838,HOG,Polaris  The Lion Of The Recreational Vehicle Industry,opinion,The recreational vehicle industry has seen significant growth over the past few years  Off road vehicle sales have increased 35  YOY in 2010  32  YOY in 2011  and are expected to grow 18  YOY this year  Moreover    as compiled by Tickerspy  is up 49 6  versus the S P 500 since January 2008  However  the industry has not been without its share of negative factors  Last winter was unseasonably warm and had limited snowfall  a phenomenon which resulted in the North American snowmobile industry retail sales  in the first quarter of 2012  This in turn affected the bottom lines of recreational vehicle companies such as Arctic Cat  NASDAQ  ACAT   which missed revenue guidance by  24M  Many recreational vehicle companies  such as Marine Product Corp  NYSE  MPX  and Winnebago Industries  NYSE  WGO  have very low profit margins that will continue to limit future growth  Harley Davidson  NYSE  HOG   the iconic American recreational vehicle company  has been plagued by  and a daunting 159  Debt Equity Ratio    However  there is one company that continues to post huge growth and is best poised to benefit from the growth in the recreational vehicle industry  Polaris Industries  NYSE  PII   Polaris Industries is a company that designs  engineers  manufactures  and markets off road vehicles  snowmobiles  The company stock is off to a fast start for the year  notching up a 27  YTD gain     One of the most appealing aspects of Polaris Industries is its business model  one which ensures that seasonal factors such as unseasonably warm winters will not have a significant impact on its bottom line  Polaris has a wide portfolio of multi passenger  off road ATVs  known as side by sides  that function not only as recreational vehicles  but also have applications in such areas as farming and construction  Moreover  many of Polaris Industry s vehicles can be customized for a variety of applications  In fact  the company is estimated to have as many different models of side by sides than the rest of the industry has combined  Polaris expects that for 2012  well over 70  of its revenue will be generated from products introduced within the last three years  in the first quarter of 2012 alone  Polaris introduced two new Victory models  the RZR XP4 900  and ten new snowmobiles  This diversification has resulted in the production of a wide array of innovative products and limited exposure to seasonal factors that will continue to spur future growth in the company    Polaris Industries continues to aggressively expand  Recently it has been focused on the motorcycle market  one which has become increasingly profitable for the company  In the first quarter of 2012  sales of Polaris on road vehicles  which are mainly comprised of the company s Victory motorcycles  rose approximately 40   Moreover  Polaris a minority investment in Brammo  which produces such products as electric motorcycles  This market is rapidly expanding and with the investment  Polaris gains access to Brammo s  proprietary electric vehicle powertrain technology  as well as exposure to the rapidly growing electric motorcycle market   This minority investment comes on the heels of the company s April 2011 acquisition of Indian Motorcycle Co   one which Polaris expects to revamp and reintroduce into the market in the near future     There has been huge demand for Polaris products on the international stage  international revenue was up 20  YOY in the first quarter of 2012  Even in Europe  which has been negatively impacted by the sovereign debt crisis  Polaris reported a revenue increase of 15  YOY and an increase in its market share lead  In the Asia Pacific region  Polaris reported a 59  YOY increase in revenue due to strong growth in Australia  China and India  Polaris is just developing itself on the international stage  which allows the company significant opportunities to expand  Moreover  Paul Hickey  co founder of Bespoke Investment Group   that although international sales for Polaris are growing  it is still a defensive company with limited exposure to hotspots such as Europe     Finally  it is important to note that Polaris Industries has very strong financials  In fact  it recently delivered its 20th consecutive positive earnings surprise  In the most recent quarter  the first quarter of 2012  Polaris  EPS of  0 85  which beat by  0 08  and revenue of  673M  which beat by  61M  Polaris Industries also pays a solid annual dividend  a development started in 1995 that has been raised every year since  currently it is  1 48 a share  Polaris has a manageable 21  Debt Equity Ratio and has a very high 52 3  ROE  one which shows the high profitability of the company s operations    Overall  Polaris Industries is a very attractive investment and the best play on the recreational vehicle industry going into the future  There continue to be significant opportunities for expansion for Polaris  especially in the motorcycle industry and on an international scale  Investors should definitely consider a potential investment in this company with roaring growth ,2012-06-22,George Liu,https://www.investing.com/analysis/polaris:-the-lion-of-the-recreational-vehicle-industry-127324,127324

that the bike maker has been forced to make in the past and

166350,387866,HOG,ANALYSIS Automaker liquidation may focus on brands  patents,news,"  Auto manufacturing assets tough to sell in liquidation
   Brands may be extendable to other products
   Patents may be sought by foreign companies  industries
 By Emily Chasan
 NEW YORK  April 22  Reuters    If any of the big three U S 
automakers is forced to sell assets in a liquidation  their
brands and patents may attract the most interest  while the
manufacturing assets could be a tough sell 
 Both General Motors Corp  and Chrysler LLC   
currently being kept afloat by billions in taxpayer dollars   
have warned they could file for bankruptcy if they are unable
to reach deals with key stakeholders  A bankruptcy for either
company is expected to save the stronger and more profitable
parts of the companies  such as GM s Chevrolet and Cadillac
divisions and Chrysler s Jeep unit  but some parts could be
destined for fire sales or liquidation as the U S  auto
industry grapples with sharply reduced consumer demand 
 While some potential buyers may be eager to get their hands
on valuable patents and brands  companies that specialize in
corporate liquidations and asset dispositions may not relish
the job of trying to sell off manufacturing facilities 
 In fact  attempts to liquidate automotive assets at
auctions over the last few weeks have been a  disaster  as
uncertainty about the future of the industry scared buyers off 
said Bob Maroney  co president of the commercial and industrial
division of Gordon Brothers Group  one of the largest U S 
liquidation and asset disposition firms 
  There have been some automotive plants closed and they
tend not to liquidate very well because the intangible value of
these facilities dissipates very quickly and a lot of the
equipment inside these facilities has somewhat of a special 
purpose nature to it   Maroney said 
  If someone s going to try to estimate what the value of
the assets are on a pure disposition basis  it s not going to
be a very high number  
 Maroney said the need to take capacity out of the auto
industry in the United States and the shift of auto production
away from Michigan  has left little incentive for foreign
buyers to purchase these assets 
 Also  just in time delivery practices tend to leave the
automakers with little inventory in their plants to remarket
and there are few alternative uses for some of the parts and
machinery that were designed for specific cars 
  A buyer has to say that this is an asset I can use in my
own manufacturing or be a dealer who may be able to deem it to
be a good purchase price and hold it for resale   Maroney
said 
 Otherwise  plants may be sold for other purposes entirely 
A former auto parts manufacturing facility in Allen Park 
Michigan  for example  is set to become a  146 million  750 000
square foot movie production studio 
 EXTENDABLE BRANDS 
 But at another Gordon Brothers unit that specializes in
acquiring brands  Kenneth Frieze says he has already fielded
telephone calls from a large automaker bondholder about what
the value of some of the auto sub brands might be 
  There s a tremendous amount of value to some of these
brands   Frieze said   There are hundreds of millions of
dollars in royalties today that some of these brands are
getting outside of the automotive sector  
 In 2001  Ford Motor Co  actually bought brand
licensing agency Beanstalk Group to try to get more mileage out
of names such as Volvo  Land Rover  Aston Martin and Jaguar  It
sold Beanstalk four years later  but continues to license its
brands  Motorcycle maker Harley Davidson Inc   which
once tried to trademark the  chug  sound of its motorcycles 
has also licensed its brand onto hundreds of other products 
  Jeep and Hummer are brands that are extendable beyond
simply producing an automobile   Frieze said 
 For example  the Jeep brand has been used on AM FM portable
radios and Hummer has been emblazoned on bicycles 
 PATENT VALUES
 A key question in the potential automakers  split off of
their best assets is whether the new company will retain
control of most of the patents  said Gabe Fried  a managing
member and founder of Streambank  a consulting firm that
advises clients on the valuation and disposition of patents and
other intellectual property  IP  
  To enter into the U S  market  one needs to have the
protection of those patents and I think we re going to see a
high level of interest from manufacturers overseas who are
trying to break into the U S  supplier market  It would help
them tremendously   Fried said 
 Some of the most valuable patents could include process
patents  which identify a high quality  low cost way of
manufacturing parts  and raw material patents  which protect
formulas for low cost  light  high performance materials  Fried
said    
  Michigan ranks No  2 in the country in terms of R D
spending  driven by the enormous IP activity of major
automotive manufacturers   said Stacy Fox  managing director
and co founder of RoxStream LLC  a consulting firm that
specializes in IP disposition in the automotive sector 
  There is a wealth of IP within those companies and frankly
only a portion of the value is realized in their own
operations
