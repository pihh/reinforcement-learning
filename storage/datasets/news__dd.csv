Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day and welcome to the DuPont Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call  Today s conference is being recorded And at this time  I would like to turn the conference over to Lori Koch please go ahead Lori Koch    Vice President  Investor RelationsGood morning  everyone and thank you for joining us for DuPont s fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call  We are making this call available to investors and media via webcast  We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call  These slides are posted on the Investor Relations section of DuPont website and through the link to our webcast Joining me on the call today are Marc Doyle  Chief Executive Officer  Jean Desmond  our Chief Financial Officer  and Ed Breen Executive Chair  Please read the forward looking statement disclaimer contained in the slide  During our call  we will make forward looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future  Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty  Our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward looking statements Our third quarter Form 10 Q as updated by our current and periodic reports include detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences  Unless otherwise specified  all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items  We will also refer to non GAAP measures  A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release I ll now turn the call over to Marc Marc Doyle    Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  everyone and thanks for joining us  I ll quickly run through an overview of 2019 and how we executed against our key priorities  I ll then cover our priorities and expectations for 2020  including the actions we are taking in light of our expectations for a slow start to 2020 given further price pressure in our nylon business and unplanned outages  which have already been resolved at our largest S C site  Our teams are intensely focused on addressing these items to return to a more normal growth pattern after Q1 Starting on slide 2  the team delivered sound full year results within a macro environment dominated by the China tariff situation  which significantly challenged two of our key end markets  auto and electronics  resulting in both demand contraction and inventory destocking  As we navigated the market uncertainty  our team continued to stay focused on the levers within our control  including price discipline  and cost actions nicely mitigating the impact of volume declines on earnings our full year net sales of  21 5 billion were down 5  in total and down 2  organically with price up 2  and volume down 4   while full year operating EBITDA of  5 6 billion was down 4   Our strong operating discipline  resulted in gross margin expansion of greater than 50 basis points and operating EBITDA margin expansion of 10 basis points for the year Adjusted EPS of  3 80 per share was down 7  reflecting lower segment income currency headwinds and a higher tax rate  This was partially offset by lower depreciation and a lower share count  due to both share repurchases completed in the first half of the year from the DowDuPont program and  750 million of repurchases we made since our separation on June 1 Slide 3 provides more detail on our top line results for the year  Both the pluses and minuses  Our performance in each of our underlying businesses was consistent with market trends and this slide highlights the themes we have talked about throughout the year  including our strength in 5G  which is reflected in our Interconnect Solutions business  the continued momentum in Water Solutions and the steady growth of our Food   Beverage business We continue to make high return investments in R D  capex and M A in these and other areas to drive further innovation led growth including opportunities to expand our content in next generation smartphones and hybrid and electric vehicles  Offsetting these were lower results in our Semiconductor Technologies business and our T I segment and lower sales in our Health   Biosciences business  primarily from pronounced slowdowns in North America  bioethanol and probiotics markets Moving to adjusted EPS results on slide 4  within our segment results pricing gains synergies and cost savings were more than offset by the impact of softer volumes  lower equity affiliate income and higher year over year planned maintenance costs particularly in the back half of the year in S C  Currency was a  0 16 headwind for the year  Below the line items had a net neutral impact to our adjusted EPS driven by an increase in the tax rate  offset by benefits from lower depreciation and amortization and a lower share count  I ll now cover how we executed against our 2019 priorities on slide 5 As I ve mentioned  the past year was a challenge given macro conditions negatively impacting about 40  of our portfolio  which led to weaker results versus our expectations going into the year  However  we did deliver strong results in key end markets  Such as water  5G  aerospace  medical  plant based meats where the market fundamentals remain sound  Our continued commitment to invest in class cost structure was a key driver of our ability to expand both gross and operating EBITDA margins  we delivered greater than  500 million in annual savings from synergy programs and the restructuring program we launched in the second quarter of 2019  These initiatives did help to improve our operating leverage  but we still have more work to do here We also made significant progress this past year on our portfolio strategy announcing our agreement to merge our Nutrition   Biosciences business with IFF creating the de facto leader in the food and beverage space with the broadest technology and product offerings  Ed will speak further about this transaction later in the call Additionally  we further refined our portfolio through the announcement of the divestment of three businesses during the year  Free cash flow conversion was strong this year and we reported greater than 100  conversion on an underlying basis for the past two quarters  Finally  while I m pleased that our 2019 ROIC of 29  reflects a marked improvement from 2017 when the portfolio was first put together our 2019 performance was not as strong as our prior year results due to weak into working capital performance  lower segment earnings and a higher tax rate  Both working capital and segment earnings are key focus areas for improvement moving forward and critical components of our 2020 priorities  which I ll discuss on the next slide As noted  we know we have more work to do in some of our key value creation drivers  I am disappointed with our operational leverage as we exited the year and the slow start to 2020 and I ll provide more detail on the actions we re taking to return to growth  which is more in line with our expectations in a moment  Growth through innovation is a key component of our strategy and we will continue to drive competitive advantage and sustainable top line expansion through our application development engine and deep customer relationships  Through our differentiated investment we aim to increase demand by advancing several key technical milestones in our major R D platform such as 5G microbiome and auto electrification  To ensure we can meet additional demand generated by these programs  we will continue to implement key capacity expansions R D initiatives and investments in innovation will also contribute to our 2030 sustainability initiatives and we look forward to reporting progress toward these goals  Our operating model enabled us to be agile and proactively respond to the dynamic market environment in 2019  This will be just as if not more important in 2020 particular focus areas this year are continuing to advance productivity initiatives using digital tools and process simplification and rightsizing the organization  With a high performing operating model  focus on innovation and defined targets for working capital improvement  we expect to enable further improvement in both ROIC and free cash flow conversion  Active portfolio management remains a key component of our strategy  Ed will address this in more depth during his remarks Slide 7 details the actions under way  as well as those actions we expect to put in place in response to both the macro environment and our operating challenges  We expect that the completion of the DowDuPont synergies and the 2019 restructuring plan  we ll provide approximately  215 million of gross cost savings in 2020 these programs are well defined and the teams are executing the actions needed to deliver these savings  We are also planning further cost reductions this year to enable us to better maintain our operating leverage as we committed  These actions will also start to address the stranded costs we expect following completion of the N B transaction  We anticipate approximately  90 million of savings from these initiatives  In addition  we have launched a project to consolidate our asset footprint  which we expect to generate a total of greater than  150 million of savings over a three year period with the first impact beginning in 2021  I will share more information on these items as they continue to take shape Before I turn the call over to Jean to discuss the fourth quarter  I ll cover our first quarter and full year guidance  starting with organic growth on slide 8  For the full year  we expect sales of  21 5 billion to  22 billion  which is up slightly on an organic growth basis  We anticipate a return to more normal growth in all our core segments except T I  which is being impacted by continued weakness in the automotive market  And nylon industry headwinds  which I ll cover when reviewing EPS expectations  T I is expected to deliver 2  to 5  organic growth  as memory markets returned to a more normal growth profile in the back half of the year  Next generation smartphones with higher content of our materials continue to penetrate the market and we already started to see these volumes in the second half of last year  N B is expected to grow 3  to 4  organically with strong volumes across all three businesses led by a return to growth in our probiotics business from the actions we re taking to win new business in North America as well as the strong Chinese market continued acceleration of our offerings into the alternative meat market and strength in food enzymes S C is also expected to grow 2  to 3  organically from continued strong demand in Water Solutions  further pricing gains and resolution of the raw material supply shortages that limited production in the back half of last year in Safety Solutions  Non core is expected to decline 3  to 5  organically from lower demand for trichlorosilane to the Hemlock Semiconductor joint venture and for SORONA in carpet and apparel applications Moving to full year adjusted EPS expectations on slide 9  This year  we expect adjusted EPS of  3 70 to  3 90 per share  as higher volumes cost reductions and productivity improvements are offset by net headwinds from discrete items in 2019 and lower nylon prices coupled with a weaker nylon mix  From a quarterly perspective  these headwinds are most pronounced in the first quarter  which I ll cover on the next slide  I ll now go into further detail on the nylon dynamics we re facing  Nylon industry fundamentals were weaker in the second half of 2019  as the lower demand coupled with improved industry supply reliability negatively impacted our discretionary pricing power  We anticipate a similar operating environment as we enter 2020 and forecast T I segment prices will be down about mid single digits  Primarily due to lower year over year nylon prices and weaker mix resulting in pricing headwinds of approximately  200 million to  250 million For context in 2018 T I segment earnings were up 20  as steady demand coupled with industrywide supply disruption and force measures and nylon 66 and key raw materials fueled higher prices with our pricing peaking in the first quarter of 2019  With the supply issues resolved and weak auto build forecast for 2020 market prices for nylon have been pressured and are expected to continue to decline as the year progresses  with the most significant impact in the first half of 2020  Additionally  we can demand in our core markets has resulted in a shift toward more opportunistic lower margin nylon sales so that we can fill our assets resulting in a weaker mix of products sold we have and continue to implement a series of actions to moderate the pricing impact focused on productivity and asset utilization  while we anticipate a challenging 2020 for T I  we remain  Technical Issues  on our mid to long term outlook  Aerospace  healthcare and auto electrification continue to provide steady demand and our deep innovation capabilities have us well positioned for renewed growth as markets recover In summary  our T I expectations for this year are disappointing but I m confident that we will continue to take the right actions to drive sustainable long term growth Moving to Q1 on slide 10  As I noted  our growth headwinds are most pronounced in the first quarter and predominantly encompass declines from lower discrete item gains  weakened nylon dynamics and unplanned outages and S C  Once we get past the first quarter  we expect the nylon headwinds to abate given the peak of nylon pricing was in Q1 of last year  In addition  our Kevlar assets that are causing the headwinds in S C are already back up and running  These dynamics  coupled with the 2020 cost actions that will start to ramp up to the first quarter  give us confidence that we can return to a more normal pattern of growth beyond the first quarter  This quarter  we anticipate sales to decline in the mid single digits  and adjusted EPS to be in the range of  0 70 to  0 74 per share  The top and bottom line declines are driven by nylon headwinds and the unplanned outages in our S C segment  Additionally  there were approximately  80 million or  0 08 per share of discrete items in the first quarter of 2019 that will not repeat Jean will cover some additional guidance detail in her comments and in the appendix we have provided segment level commentary as well as some additional modeling specifics  I will now turn the call over to her Jeanmarie Desmond    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Mark  Starting on slide 11  we closed the quarter about where we expected from a top line and EPS perspective  As we mentioned on our mid December call  our operating EBITDA was going to be at the low end of the range  which is consistent with our reported results  In total  operating EBITDA of  1 4 billion was down 14  versus the prior year  Driven by lower gains in our non core segments associated with customer settlements from our Hemlock Semiconductor joint venture as well as lower nylon pricing in our T I segment  I ll get into further segment detail in a few moments While many of the market challenges that Marc mentioned for the year also impacted our fourth quarter  the team s disciplined focus on driving price and executing on our cost saving initiatives  Technical Issues   Net sales of  5 2 billion were in line with our expectations and down 2  organically versus the prior year Our Electronics   Imaging business had the strongest results this quarter  led by further expansion of our content in the newer high speed  high frequency phones which generated greater than  1 per phone of additional sales for us  We also continue to see strength in our Water Solutions business  which was up in the low teen driving overall organic growth in the S C segment  A few additional bright spot  I would highlight from the quarter in our Nutrition   Biosciences segment  these include our offerings into the alternative or plant based meat market  which is included in the Food   Beverage business  And our animal nutrition and food enzymes business  both of which fall into our Health   Biosciences business Moving to the fourth quarter adjusted EPS on slide 13  Fourth quarter adjusted EPS of  0 95 was down 34   I ll highlight two items within the segment results that are specific to the fourth quarter  First is lower equity affiliate income  specifically our Hemlock Semiconductor joint venture within the non core segment  Equity affiliate income on an adjusted basis declined about  120 million or 42  to  166 million  This decline is mostly attributable to lower income associated with customer settlement from the Hemlock joint venture  These settlements were at their peak in 2018 and have trailed off substantially in 2019  We expect another significant decline into 2020 from further reductions in the customer settlement and declines in underlying results as customers are released from the contract Also specific to the fourth quarter was the price decline in Transportation   Industrial segments  Although  we started to see sequential pricing pressure earlier this year following the peak in first quarter 2019  The year over year price only move negative on it in the fourth quarter and down 2   Tax was a headwind in the quarter due to a lower rate in the prior year  driven by benefits from the DowDuPont transaction that did not repeat  Our full year rate of 21  is in line with our expectations Turning to the balance sheet on slide 14  you ll see that our net debt increased slightly to  15 9 billion  mostly attributable to lower cash balances as we ended the year  In the fourth quarter  we closed three acquisitions in the water space for a total of about  175 million and we made  185 million pension contribution that was triggered by the stand up of new DuPont  Share repurchases in the quarter were about  290 million  bringing our total repurchases since June 1st  to  750 million  Excluding the pension contribution  which is reflected in operating cash flows  our fourth quarter free cash flow conversion was greater than 100   again exceeding our target of greater than 90   On the slide you can see the trend of working capital over the past five quarters  While I m pleased that our working capital has improved in the back half of 2019  We are still above year end 2018 levels and not where we need to be  This remains a key focus area of mine in 2020 to free up cash  We ve put in place the working capital improvement target of 10  for the current year Shifting to a review of segment results and starting with Electronics   Imaging on slide 15  Fourth quarter net sales were the strongest of the year at  937 million and were up 3  versus the prior year  Strength was led by our Interconnect Solutions business where our advanced materials are supporting the launch of next generation smartphones  Low teens growth in the Interconnect business in the second half of  19 is a proof point that we have market leading innovative solution to support the development of 5G technology  The strength in Interconnect Solutions was partially offset by softness in Semiconductor Technologies similar to what we saw in the third quarter of 2019 Our semiconductor business is about half exposed to memory  which remains sluggish  however  the overall semiconductor market is on a positive trajectory as evidenced by our sequential improvement in the last two quarters  and we expect the recovery to continue returning to more normal growth in the back half of this year Fourth quarter operating EBITDA for the segment was  293 million  a decrease of 9  from pro forma operating EBITDA of  321 million in the year ago period  The mix shift between strength in Interconnect Solutions and softness in Semiconductor Technologies  the highest margin business within E I created margin pressure leading to the EBITDA decline Moving to Nutrition   Biosciences on slide 16  Net sales of  1 5 billion were flat on an organic basis  with 1  price improvement offset by 1  volume declines  For the fourth quarter strength in food enzymes  animal nutrition and our meat free offerings  each of which were up mid to high single digits in the quarter were able to offset market driven weakness in proteins  probiotics and biorefineries and supply chain disruptions in sweeteners  Fourth quarter operating EBITDA for the segment was  323 million  a decrease of 2  from pro forma operating EBITDA of  330 million in the year ago period Productivity and pricing gains were more than offset by manufacturing headwinds  unfavorable product mix and lower volumes  The unfavorable product mix was partially the result of softness in the North America probiotics market  Our business consistent with the market was down on a year over year basis for both the quarter and the year  We are working with channel partners accelerating initiatives to get the North America market back on track  While the North American market recovers  we expect that probiotics growth will continue to be fueled from Asia Pacific  where current market penetration is low as compared to other regions  but growing steadily  For the year probiotic sales in China were up over 30   Our Transportation   Industrial results on slide 17 reflect lower auto builds and weak demand in electronic and modest continued destocking in the automotive channel Net sales of  1 2 billion were down 9  versus the prior year  Fourth quarter operating EBITDA for the segment was  277 million decrease of 19  from pro forma operating EBITDA of  344 million in the year ago period with cost reductions and lower raw material costs being more than offset by lower volume and price headwinds Turning to the results of Safety   Construction on slide 18  net sales of  1 3 billion were up 1  on an organic basis  Volumes are mixed with strength in areas such as Water Solutions were double digit volume gains on strong demand for ion exchange and reverse osmosis membranes in industrial markets  Were more than offset by volume declines in Safety Solutions and continued softness in Shelter Solutions  Safety Solution demand remained steady across most product lines  However  plans maintenance downtime and raw material disruptions in the supply chain limited production volumes  Fourth quarter operating EBITDA for the segment totaled  311 million flat with the year ago period with pricing gains and productivity actions being offset by higher manufacturing costs  primarily from cost associated with planned maintenance and lower volumes I ll close with a few comments on our cash generation and needs in 2020 on slide 19  We continue to expect to generate strong cash flows with the conversion rate greater than 90   While many of the DowDuPont transaction related items are behind us  we will start to incur cost associated with our recently announced N B transaction Our commercial paper balances at year end were about  1 8 billion  I m committed to bringing these balances down throughout the year  And finally  shareholder remuneration remains an important aspect of our overall capital allocation policy  While our current forecast has the majority of cash that we generate from normal operations going toward paying down commercial paper balances and the N B transaction costs  We are targeting reducing working capital by about 10  this year  Which along with future non core divestments would be targeted for share buyback With that  I ll now turn the call over to Ed Edward Breen    Executive ChairmanThanks  Jean  This morning I ll provide an update on the N B and IFF transaction as well as say a few words on PFAS and the Chemours litigation  I continue to be excited about the value creation potential of our transaction with IFF and have confidence in a strong strategic logic for this combination  As a proof point  we have already heard from several large customers about their excitement over the portfolio breadth and technology depth for the new combined company As you can see on slide 20  we have already begun working on the integration and a rigorous process is being run to ensure this go smoothly  As you know  DuPont and N B team specifically as a lot of experience in this area starting 10 years ago with the integration of Danisco into DuPont and then more recently executing the complex integration of the Dow and FMC portfolios with our business  In addition to the internal combination of the former Nutrition   Health and Industrial Biosciences business  we know how to do this and we will execute the same playbook that as worked so well for us in the past Some of the key short term milestones that have already been completed  are the establishment of the executive steering team and the appointment of leaders for key work streams  including separation and integration  our financials  IT separation and stand up  legal entity work and talent selection  The teams at both IFF and N B are well staffed and I am confident we will stay on track with our plan Beyond the N B transaction  we continue to believe our portfolio presents many ways to create shareholder value  and we continue to assess our options  I ll close with a few words on the Chemours lawsuit and PFAS  We continue to believe our potential risk exposure remains contained and I feel it s worthwhile to underscore that point while also updating a couple of items we discussed on our last call  Regarding the Ohio MDL personal injury claims  two related cases are currently being tried together in Ohio as we speak  Chemours continues to indemnify and defend these cases and others subject to eliminate cost sharing agreement As I mentioned last time  we still have not contributed  0 01 in excess of the  25 million trigger and by default Chemours has not spent more than  25 million  With respect to the South Carolina MDL most of these cases are tied to allegations of PFAS containing firefighting foam use over the last 60 years  These suits relate largely to PFOS a chemical that neither Chemours or historical DuPont ever made or sold  The same is true for firefighting foam  Historical DuPont was not a manufacturer of foam but for a limited period along with numerous others provide an ingredient to foam manufacturer  This ingredient could lead to trace amounts of PFOA but absolutely no PFAS which is the primary concern  We continue to believe that the exposure of Historical DuPont where Chemours is negligible compared to those that manufactured marketed and sold these materials We also continue to defend ourselves against various natural resource damages cases  most of which are in states where we never had a manufacturing presence  These claims in the focus on foam or generic PFAS containing products  We take these cases very seriously and monitor developments closely  However  we still believe that direct impacts to DuPont are limited and are being managed appropriately  As to the Chemours suit in late December the Delaware Chancery Court heard our arguments to dismiss the case and send it to arbitration  We thought our argument went well and we expect a decision by the end of this quarter or early next I ll now turn it to Lori to open for Q A Lori Koch    Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  Ed  With that  let s move on to your questions  First  I would like to remind you that our forward looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q A  We will allow for one question per person  Operator  please provide the Q A instructions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And we will take our first question from John Inch with Gordon Haskett  Please go ahead John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystThank you  Good morning  everybody  Yeah  Thank you  Good morning  everybody  You sound like you have a little bit of a cold  I hope you haven t been the Wuhan  China recently Edward Breen    Executive ChairmanNo  but I do have a bad cold  so I apologize John Inch    Gordon Haskett    AnalystIt could be a lot worse  So  understanding some of the first quarter of 2020 compares issues such as the one timers  Still if I annualize the midpoint of your first quarter guide  You get about  0 90 short of your fiscal year    fiscal year estimate  So  I m just curious  what are the key drivers of your post 1Q growth assumptions  your confidence level there  And then just secondly  your  1 billion working capital opportunity that you call out in the slides  Is that tied to your 2021 asset footprint rationalization initiative  are these two discrete buckets that lead to two discrete streams of benefit  Thank you Marc Doyle    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks  John for that question  This is Marc  Let me take it to give Ed voice a bit of a break and then he can jump in and I ll ask Jean to take the working capital question  Just starting with the first quarter  you re right  it is an abnormally weak quarter  But I ll tell you in terms of the second quarter on  we do have strong confidence in our forecast  We re not assuming a recovery for the markets here  We ve got a number of things that are really under our control happening from Q1 to Q2  and it starts with sort of the typical seasonal lift that happens from 1Q to 2Q most every year  but also we ve got a significant change in the one timers because there is a sizable settlement associated with the Hemlock joint venture in the second quarter which is worth about  80 million in EBITDA  And then on top of that  the S C manufacturing headwinds that we had that hit us in the first quarter are largely behind us now  So  we re confident that the S C business will be back to sort of normal supply against continued strong demand And then final kicker  the cost actions we announced here which we ve kicked off are going to start to deliver in the second quarter and that will be worth another about  0 05 per share going forward per quarter  So  when we wrap these things up  it provides us confidence that the second quarter is going to be kind of back to a more normal earnings environment Jeanmarie Desmond    Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  in terms of working capital  really it s separate and apart from the asset rationalization  This is the working capital opportunity that we identified at the time we brought the portfolios together  Now  unfortunately as we went through the separation process was Dow  DuPont and Corteva  our working capital balances actually increase with all the system freezes we had and we built inventory and then as we came into  19 and we saw slowdowns in some of our markets that exacerbated the problem  So  we are taking a very  very strong effort in 2020 to reduce working capital  But as I said 10   We ve got teams activate it to do that effort and you should see that benefit  Separate and apart from these others  I would think  longer term with the asset rationalization  We will have additional working capital benefits  but those will be further out past 2020 OperatorAnd we ll hear next from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research  Please go ahead Jeffrey Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystThanks  Yeah  Thank you  Good morning  everyone  Just wanted to kind of come back to manufacturing  the S C item  as you said  it sounds like it gets ironed out  you also you mentioned some manufacturing issues in N B  we ve heard a few of these over the last several quarters  I wonder if you could just address Marc whether kind of the manufacturing side of the equation is largely kind of settled here post separation  Is there any particular disruptions going on as you try to get after synergies  It would just be nice  not have to kind of talk about these issues Marc Doyle    Chief Executive OfficerYes  Yeah  Thanks  Jeff  Couldn t agree more  I d call some of this  particularly like in N B  these things are abnormal that happened once in a blue moon  S C is the one that s really been the most pronounced and you know it s    it s a few quarters running now  But for different reasons  So if you    if I take you back to last year  we had a real strong first half in S C and then we did run into a disruption in our supply chain for key material in Kevlar raw material  supplier disruption and that was part of the weakness in the third quarter  The fourth quarter  we had a planned maintenance sort of a two year every two year maintenance cycle on Nomex but that had an earnings impact in the quarter and now we ve got a subsequent outage again in the Kevlar manufacturing line and it s a little bit connected to that raw material shortage because our inventories were so tight  After that  that a small disruption in manufacturing here has really had a bigger impact on the quarter And so  to your question on the kind of operational stability  I d say  first of all by and large 180 manufacturing sites around the world  We ve got strong performance  We re making investments in productivity  We re making investments in digital  I ve got confidence in our operations leadership around the world  Our safety performance by the way  was a record last year for us as a company in the history of the company  And so  I think the team are doing the blocking and tackling  The Kevlar issues and S C are extremely frustrating to us and to our Kevlar business team  but we feel pretty good  Just in terms of where the units running right now and given a couple of months to catch back up with inventory  we think we ll be able to weather any future disruption there  And so  hopefully this is behind us and as you said  we won t be talking about this every quarter OperatorAnd next we will hear from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead Vincent Andrews    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThank you  Ed  if I could ask you on the PFAS  the personal injury cases  originally there was  there was a settlement of personal injury cases a few years ago  So  I m just curious why not settle these cases  I mean we ve subsequently seen the jackpot that are going against Bayer and the and the glyphosate cases  So  why not settle these and how confident are you that this doesn t spiral into something that we don t want to deal with Edward Breen    Executive ChairmanYes  So  thanks for the question  Vincent  Look  there s about 60 of these cases outstanding  These two are in trial right now  I can t necessarily forecast the outcome  but there is always the opportunity here to settle and settlement usually happens kind of in this window of time  So  it s possible that that will be the outcome  So  we ll just have to see over the next ensuing weeks  how that plays out  but obviously we re very cognizant of the point that the question that you just asked OperatorAnd next we ll hear from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank  Please go ahead David Begleiter    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThank you  Good morning  Ed  can you address the issue in terms of the discount in the share price due to PFOA and the potential and desire to do additional tax efficient transactions for the portfolio perhaps of the electronics franchise  Thank you Edward Breen    Executive ChairmanYeah  so let me go back  maybe just high level to the IFF transaction and just talk about that a moment also  You all have done the math and I read it all your reports  But you just do the math  IFF as it stands right now and RemainCo DuPont trades at about eight times  So  I think this will play out  Just on the IFF transaction as we get closer to it  I would also mention  I really believe and we re hearing this from our customers  Pretty broadly that we ve created the de facto leading platform in the industry  By way  it s incumbent upon us and IFF to elegantly pull this merger off with each other and we will do that  I know we have to prove that to everybody  I understand that  But IFF also trades at a discount to the top peer set in the industry by about 500 basis points  So  I think there is great leverage here in creating this phenomenal company  both the value we re getting initially out of it and the value that can be created over the next couple of years with that transaction  but having still said that we trade at peak times of RemainCo Let me just say this  and I don t want to get into too much detail on it  but we re actively in conversations with others  I like tax efficient transactions that we like creating global leading companies and we are very agnostic  we want to do the right thing for our shareholders and also we ll pursue those opportunities and we re assessing that with our Board as we speak OperatorNext we ll hear from Steve Tusa with J P  Morgan  Please go ahead Steve Tusa    J P  Morgan    AnalystGood morning  guys  Just on the kind of news flow that s out there  It was  it seem to be kind of the discussion that you guys were looking at on the back of the last question  something around the T I business  But then there was some news flow to that  there was something perhaps on the electronic side  can you just talk about  I mean is it that  is the situation with your portfolio  kind of that fluid that you can kind of pivot from one to the other like that  I know there s a bit of a restriction on how much you can actually sell down with that with that EBITDA floor  But maybe  is it really kind of that fluid Edward Breen    Executive ChairmanNo  actually it s not  it s fluid is that sounds  it s a shame that those kind of leaks occur and it s also not great for our employees to be hearing one rumor after another to be honest with you  So  I don t want to comment in too much detail but by way Steve  to your point  we do have an agreement with Corteva that we ought to maintain  2 5 billion of EBITDA that stays with the liability  Having said that doesn t mean we can t separate things if we want to and I m not saying we are  but if we want to  we can an separate into different businesses  but we would have to leave  2 5 billion of EBITDA liability with  it could be two entities  by the way we leave it with  So  we have a fair amount of flexibility in front of us  But    so  we don t have to hold it in one entity  If we don t want to OperatorAnd next we ll hear from Steve Byrne with Bank of America  Please go ahead Steve Byrne    Bank of America    AnalystYes  thank you  In the spirit of your comments about innovation  Marc  I wondered if you had any thoughts about using some of your technologies to maybe take a little more of a proactive stance on these PFAS liabilities  For example  using your skills in water treatment to help these municipalities that have PFAS unrelated to legacy DuPont sites  but just for goodwill like  three  Fayetteville pulls water that s got 20 parts per trillion PFO a PFOS and its upstream from the Chemours plant or use your capabilities in probiotics to develop bacteria that can degrade these chlorinated compounds in these industrial wastewater treatment plants  Your thoughts on that Marc Doyle    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  yeah  Thanks  Steve  It s a great question  And actually we published some commitments as new DuPont late last year and those included kind of our commitments for use of PFAS in our products and manufacturing and the my perspective on this is  is that this isn t so much about health effects  at the low levels of exposure  we re talking about  but the fact that these long chain chemicals or bio accumulative  is just unacceptable these days to all of us  And so  we made a statement that included that we would be ending all use in our product lines we d be driving the use of PFAS free firefighting foams at all of our manufacturing sites to be a leader there and we made a commitment around our water business and just year point  we ve been pretty active in the water space  Now  this is  as you re probably aware the heritage Dow Water Solutions business  then a leader in the global water industry for decades  We ve been of course investing aggressively in that business because the growth is fantastic  and those acquisitions we made last year  Of course  sort of further strengthen our portfolio now so that we ve got offerings that span from US to Ion Exchange to reverse osmosis And Ion Exchange in RO in particular are pretty effective techniques for removal of traits PFAS compounds  And so  one of the commitments we made in the    in that document last year was to provide technology including royalty free licenses to certain pieces of IP that we had around the PFAS area  We re also working very actively on product developments that would allow our materials  our components to be targeted to clean up activities  And so just as you said  we re trying to do the right thing  working around the country and areas where there is need here Edward Breen    Executive ChairmanBy the way  I would just add  as a point back whole PFAS conversation and you know we ve been sued by the State of Michigan and just to make a point back to my prepared remarks  we had no manufacturing facility there that used any of those materials  It s more of a firefighting foam case  And so  I think as it plays out in the fax early on the table  We had nothing to do in that state with any of that OperatorOur next we ll hear from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein  Please go ahead Jonas Oxgaard    Sanford Bernstein    AnalystWell  thank you  I was curious about the automotive  So  a two part question on which we strip out the nylon impact  What does that business look like in 2020  And what underlying automotive market growth do you use for that outlook Marc Doyle    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  thanks  Jonas  it s a good question  So  just starting with the underlying market growth  we re assuming our planning assumption is a continued slight contraction in the auto industry for 2020 like minus 1  with respect to builds this year  So  that s another contraction versus the more significant contraction last year  When you strip out nylon pricing  We are expecting our engineering plastics to continue to grow from a volume perspective  a little bit faster than the market  We re expecting destocking  we re seeing that destocking is pretty well ended  And so  that provides some sequential improvement in the situation  And then on top of that  we re benefiting from some of the growth drivers  like auto electrification and EV sales were up double digits  last year  expected to be up double digits this year  We re seeing our growth into electric vehicles growing even faster than that  And so  that s starting to become a more significant driver So  you re absolutely right  The nylon pricing dynamics are so significant they re kind of overwhelming a lot of the positives  But there are some bright spots or green shoots there underneath that  On top of that I just add  you know given the nylon situation  we are taking some pretty aggressive action around cost control and that includes productivity actions in the sites  The production sites  but also the G A costs at the business level  to try to tighten up the belt as much as we can to mitigate some of that pricing downside that we re seeing OperatorNext we ll hear from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets  Please go ahead John McNulty    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystThanks for taking    thanks for taking my question  So  with regard to the non core assets  Can you give us an update on how the sales are looking there and I understand the Hemlock businesses is a little bit more complicated  but is that something you feel like you can get pulled off by the end of the year this year  Thanks Marc Doyle    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks  John  This is Marc  I ll take that  Yeah  So  we feel pretty confident we re going to continue to make progress and like we said  the last couple of quarters  My expectation is  you ll see kind of a steady drip of progress here across the businesses and non core  Hard to time  obviously a lot of work behind the scenes on transactions  A lot of rumors  I saw that there was a new one this week that came out  I d say ignore the rumors  but have confidence that we re working hard to execute the non core divestitures and we should see progress quarter by quarter here OperatorNext we ll hear from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse  Please go ahead Christopher Parkinson    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thank you  Within the S C segment  you ve obviously had good margin progress over the last few years  But more recently  obviously faced some procurement challenges outages  etc  Can you just walk us through your intermediate to long term expectations for S C margins  just given the current asset footprint  procurement strategy evolution  And then also the growth outlook for and mix expectations for both on individual rebound for Safety Solutions and momentum in RO membranes in water  Just any color would be greatly appreciated  Thank you Marc Doyle    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks  Chris  Yeah  absolutely right  We had great progress on S C margins through  18  first half of  19  We ve stumbled a bit now in the last few quarters  And as I said earlier  the majority of that is really operational issues in the aramids business and Safety Solutions  We are pretty confident that that s behind us When you look at the demand environment  So  we ve got three primary markets that we re exposed to safety  water and shelter  no big trajectory change year over year in the market environments  So  the demand is still very strong and water strong in safety  kind of pockets of weakness and shelter  but no big trajectory change  And so  in that environment  with the operational issues resolved  we feel pretty good that we ll see the margins come back to what we said is the kind of operating range that we expect sort of mid to high  20s range  And then going forward as water grows  Water segment margins are strong  a little bit above the average  With the acquisitions we made  We ve got some further upside to drive margin improvement  And so  I would expect that to provide longer term lift in terms of what we could expect margins to continue to do  So  I m feeling pretty good  You know we got through some issues here  we should see with continued demand  the margin strengthened and then we ve got some longer term upside on top of that Jeanmarie Desmond    Chief Financial OfficerAnd maybe just to follow up on Marc s comments  if you look at Safety within Safety   Construction has the highest margins and our largest capital investment that we re making  We ve talked about before the tie back line eight that we re building in Luxembourg  so obviously that s not an impact on 2020  But if we go toward the future  And we look at the needs for tie back for medical packaging and for protective garments  we ll see I think will have the capacity to meet what we expect to be continued strong demand in that space Marc Doyle    Chief Executive OfficerThat will be accretive to margins over time as we get the new asset up and running and filled  Thanks OperatorNext we ll hear from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Bob Koort    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi  everyone  This is    hi guys  Quick question on the nylon if you  I know you guys got out of nylon commodity years ago within Vista  Phonetic   I guess I d assume that engineering polymers business maybe had a little bit more downstream high value offering  So  why is it that you re exposed to that nylon pricing risk in not really passing through whatever you need to in order to recover that  And then secondly that you talked about trying to keep tax leakage at a minimum  Do you also worry about value leakage here if you try to monetize some of these assets when they re not exactly pumping with us all cylinders going at the present time  Thanks Marc Doyle    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks  Bob  I ll take the first one and then turn it over to Ed  give Ed a chance for his voice to prepare itself  Yeah  it s a great question on nylon  So  just to be clear  this isn t raw material cost fluctuations  So  there is not exactly a pass through  but you could challenge fairly are we getting the value for our nylon compounds  which are we call the trade name Zytel  Zytel is a differentiated product  It s a market leading product  it s got unique properties in terms of temperature mechanical for applications  Automotive is sort of the highest value space sizable market  where Zytel is used  So  what s really happening here is us making the decision  that to continue to stay in the game for new qualifications in the auto space  We do have competitors that are at lower price  We ve got to move price a little closer to where now the competitors are in order to continue to be requalified for future applications  And so  it s a delicate balance  I mean we do try to price for value  but at the end of the day  we re not the only supplier of nylon compositions in the market  And so  that s the kind of balance here that s happening Edward Breen    Executive ChairmanYeah  to the other question  Look  the way I would answer it is very similar to what we did with IFF  We have great franchises that we have in our respective industries and let me just use electronics now as an example  The premier companies are trading literally 600 to 700 basis points above ours  We have a great franchise and electronics  If we were to do something in one of our other businesses  it was a tax advantage transaction  We would get the equivalent value out of it  Just like we did in the IFF transaction with the right appropriate multiple that industry should have  So  whether the industry is up a little right now or down a little bit right now is sort of your irrelevant in one of those deals as long as you lock in the proper multiple that you deserve in that industry  So again  I m not saying we re doing something tomorrow  we re assessing our options we are talking to people here  But clearly  we can get the value out of a transaction if we want to do something  If by the way  if we were outright going to sell something right now it take cash for it  Yeah  you got assesses the industry opposite down at all that  are you getting the proper value at the right time  But just going back to the transaction  we already announced  We don t have to worry about that  In that we think we re creating long term great value by creating the de facto world leader in that industry and that s the take the things we re looking at OperatorNext we will hear from John Roberts with UBS  Please go ahead John Roberts    UBS    AnalyswtThank you  You noted a big mix effect in the Electronics   Imaging segment  Is that lower margins in the Imaging segment versus electronics  a wide range of margins within electronics Marc Doyle    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  it s more of the latter  so the semi  we ve got three businesses there  Interconnect Solutions  Semiconductor Technologies and Image Solutions as you said  and the Semiconductor Technologies business is the highest margin segment and the margins are about 700 basis points over higher than the average for E I  So  it s a pretty significant mix effect semi as you know was soft all year  I d say the benefit is that  we did see some sequential improvement now two quarters running in the semi business  And so  as we ve seen from the semi companies out there  We re starting to see the signs of a recovery here for 2020 and so  we re confident that some growth in semi  as well as the  the margin mix improvement will be a key kicker for E I this year OperatorAnd we will take our final question from PJ Juvekar with Citi  Please go ahead PJ Juvekar    Citigroup    AnalystYes  hi  good morning  And I want to go back to your    yeah good morning  So  you are seeing compression in line in nylon pricing  A lot of these Engineered Materials start out of the specialties and then get commoditized over time  Are you seeing commoditization in nylon or is there a new China competition or is it just that the capacity that was down is starting back Marc Doyle    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  it s really that  Yeah  good question  PJ  this is Marc  I ll take that  I mean there is no change  No significant change in the competitive environment  still the same group of major suppliers globally all fairly sizable multinationals  This is really the demand environment and automotive being so soft for an extended period  That s really impacting the pricing dynamics  And so  for us in terms of actions to take  I mean I talked about cost and productivity  We ve got to continue to develop high value applications  so diversifying out of automotive  automotive is a great space for nylon because of the temperature mechanical properties  But we are focused on industrial applications obviously electric vehicles  that core will continue to create value  We still think the competitive dynamics globally are good here  but it s really  as I said  it s really the demand environment that s causing the pain Lori Koch    Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you everyone

192643,414159,DD,Why Shares of DuPont Fell Today,news,"What happened
Shares of DuPont de Nemours  NYSE  DD  fell more than 8  on Thursday following the chemical company s quarterly earnings report  The fourth quarter results matched estimates  but Wall Street was disappointed by the company s guidance for the first quarter 
So what
Before markets opened on Thursday  DuPont  one of three publicly traded companies formed out of the 2019 breakup of DowDuPont  reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings of  0 95 per share on revenue of  5 2 billion  in line with analyst expectations  Net sales were down 5  year over year due to weakness in the automotive market and a declining price for nylon 

CEO Marc Doyle issued a statement saying that while the company has faced  challenging global macro conditions   it has  mitigated these headwinds through pricing and cost actions while continuing to strengthen our position in key growth areas such as water and 5G through continued innovation and investment  
But those headwinds didn t disappear when the calendar changed to 2020  and are expected to affect first quarter results  DuPont said that it expects first quarter adjusted earnings between  0 70 and  0 74 per share  well below the  1 01 consensus estimate  due to continued pressure on nylon pricing and some short term manufacturing issues 
For the full year  DuPont expects adjusted earnings between  3 70 and  3 90 per share on revenue between  21 5 billion and  22 billion  Analysts were expecting  4 12 per share in earnings in 2020  on revenue of  21 98 billion 
Now what
The new DuPont isn t yet a year old  but the company is already splitting again  In December  it announced plans to combine its nutrition and biosciences unit with International Flavors   Fragrances  NYSE IFF  in a deal that values the combination at about  45 billion 
DuPont chairman Ed Breen  the architect of the creation and split of DowDuPont  said the IFF deal  advances the strategic direction of the company and will generate value for our shareholders   and hinted that other transactions could follow 
 I remain focused on this aspect of DuPont s value creation opportunity  working closely with the Board to assess opportunities to unlock shareholder value through portfolio refinement and differentiated investment   Breen said 
Investors understandably tend to get more excited about proven growth stocks than they do with financial engineering  But Breen  through his history first at Tyco International and later at DuPont and DowDuPont  has proven he knows how to buy and sell assets in a way that creates shareholder value  The near term will likely be volatile  but over the long run  DuPont remains an intriguing investment idea ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp4y-,2072374
192644,414160,DD,Why Shares of DuPont Were Down in January,news,"What happened
Shares of DuPont de Nemours  NYSE DD  lost 20 3  in January  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  as investors were forced to adjust expectations due to challenging global macroeconomic issues  This is a company with a lot of potential  but it is going to take some time for that potential to play out 
So what
Shares of DuPont  one of three publicly traded companies formed out of the 2019 breakup of DowDuPont  were under pressure for most of the month as investors fretted about weakness in nylon pricing and in end markets like automotive  China s coronavirus outbreak  while offering a potential boost to sales of medical suits and protective gear  also threatens to slow the global economy and eat into DuPont results 

Late in the month  the company reported fourth quarter results that were in line with expectations  but the shares dropped more than 8  on the day due to DuPont s worse than expected outlook  DuPont said it expects first quarter adjusted earnings between  0 70 and  0 74 per share  well below the  1 01 consensus estimate  due to continued pressure on nylon pricing and some short term manufacturing issues 
For the full year  DuPont expects adjusted earnings between  3 70 and  3 90 per share on revenue between  21 5 billion and  22 billion  Analysts were expecting  4 12 per share in earnings in 2020  on revenue of  21 98 billion 
Now what
When DuPont was split off from DowDuPont last summer  I predicted the company was not done shedding businesses  In December  the company announced plans to sell its nutritional division to International Flavors   Fragrances  NYSE IFF   and is reportedly exploring options for its  2 6 billion sales electronics business 
DuPont is a century old name  but it is important to remember the current iteration is still in its early days  The shuffling of assets and difficult macroeconomic conditions could make 2020 a difficult year for DuPont  but this is a company with a number of intriguing platforms and the potential for long term growth  DuPont is a stock to keep on the radar ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prlvu,2077246

192646,414162,DD,Is DuPont De Nemours  DD  A Good Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put DuPont de Nemours  Inc    NYSE DD   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  DuPont de Nemours has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 76  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 62  If we focus on the long term PE trend  DuPont de Nemours s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 15 02 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Basic Materials sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 26  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that DuPont de Nemours has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 34  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for DuPont de Nemours stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  DuPont de Nemours has a P S ratio of about 1 09  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 58x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  DuPont de Nemours currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DuPont de Nemours a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  What About the Stock Overall Though DuPont de Nemours might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of D  This gives DD a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been dismal at best  The current year has seen none estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower  while the next year estimate has seen one up and three down in the same time period  This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has declined by 9 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has decreased by 8 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below DuPont de Nemours  Inc  Price and Consensus   Apart from this somewhat soft trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term  Bottom LineDuPont de Nemours is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 15  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Chemical   Diversified industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices  In the process  it s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate  12 3 trillion in activity A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech  Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  in the 1990s  Zacks  just

192658,414174,DD,Amid trade row with Japan  South Korea gains Dupont investment to make chip materials,news,"By Heekyong Yang
SEOUL  Reuters    South Korea said on Thursday DuPont  NYSE DD  will invest  28 million in the country to produce advanced photoresists and other materials by 2021  a move that will help reduce its reliance on Japan for the products used in semiconductor manufacturing 
Amid a bilateral row over wartime laborers  Japan in July imposed curbs on exports of three materials including photoresists to South Korea  prompting a scramble among South Korean tech firms to diversify their supply chain 
Last month  Japan reversed the curbs on exports of photoresists  although tighter curbs on the two other materials   fluorinated polyimides used in smartphone displays and hydrogen fluoride used as an etching gas when making chips   remain 
 Although Japan has recently eased export controls of photoresists  which is partial progress  but it is not a fundamental solution   South Korea s Industry Minister Sung Yoon mo said in a statement 
A trade ministry official said DuPont will invest in two existing factories in South Korea and build a new one 
Photoresists are thin layers of material used to transfer circuit patterns onto semiconductor wafers  Japan produces around 90  of photoresists 
The ministry official said Dupont s Korean subsidiary currently produces photoresists  but not ones needed to make chips with an advanced technique known as extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography 
The new investment will also go towards the production of CMP pads  which are polishing pads used during the semiconductor manufacturing process  the ministry said 
A representative for the U S  industrial materials maker was not immediately available for comment ",2020-01-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/dupont-to-invest-280-million-in-south-korea-to-make-key-chip-materials-2055552,2055552
192659,414175,DD,Here s Why DuPont Fell 40 5  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of DuPont  NYSE  DD  fell 40 5  last year  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  That looks terrible next to the 28 8  gain of the S P 500 in 2019  but the dividend stock actually performed better than it appears  
That s because the entity now known as DuPont was the old DowDuPont    on paper  anyway  When it completed the spinoffs of the materials science unit Dow Inc and agricultural sciences unit Corteva Agriscience last year  each transaction had the expected effect of lowering the market valuation of DowDuPont  That shows up in stock charts as a sudden drop in value  
If investors only look at the stock s performance from the first day the new DuPont became a separate company  June 3  to the end of 2019  then shares lost 5 6  of their value  compared to a gain of 18 9  for the S P 500 in that span  That said  investors had their reasons for selling the stock at the end of 2019  

So what
The primary argument for splitting DowDuPont into three unique companies was that each business would be stronger and more efficient on its own  While it ll take time for DuPont to reach all operating efficiency targets  the specialty materials leader performed relatively well in the third quarter of 2019  considering challenging market conditions and currency headwinds  
That wasn t enough to overcome other sources of uncertainty  In the second half of 2019  investors started to grow concerned about the new DuPont s potential liabilities related to the old DuPont s fluoropolymer products  Precursors used in the manufacture of such products don t easily break down in the environment and are highly toxic to humans  
While the portfolio is now a part of Chemours  NYSE CC   and the companies have previously settled public health lawsuits in Ohio  a heavily populated region of North Carolina is now dealing with similar environmental issues caused by a fluoropolymer manufacturing facility nearby  The risk of incurring substantial liabilities forced Chemours to sue DuPont  alleging that the former parent company saddled it with the onerous liability by not preparing financial projections in good faith 
The bitter dispute is working its way through the courts right now  Chemours estimates that it will need to pay over  200 million to address environmental damages in North Carolina  For reference  the prior settlement in Ohio cost  671 million  which was split between the two companies 
Now what
DuPont owns a formidable portfolio of specialty materials products  including an under the radar biosciences unit  which may be the world s premier industrial biotech unit  It s a shame that the toxic legacy of fluoropolymers is overshadowing the company s promising future  but investors would be wise to navigate the uncertainty with caution ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pg4u6,2056532

192664,414180,DD,4 DuPont Driven Top Ranked Stocks For Quality Investing,opinion,"Wall Street is at a record high on a stupendous Santa rally  U S  Sino trade deal hopes and solid U S  economic activity have been fueling the momentum  But overvaluation worries and earnings weakness may emerge as key concerns in 2020  And investors can definitely look for some quality picks to allay such worries 
Return on equity is an investor favorite metric when it comes to cherry picking quality stocks  But ROE doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might get fooled by picking stocks based on this number   Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont  NYSE DD  technique seems to be an intriguing idea 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
The DuPont analysis allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis gets the upper hand while finding out the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are all four stocks that made it through the screen

192689,414205,DD,Third Point  U S  settle over antitrust filing in DowDuPont stake,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
BOSTON  Reuters    Third Point LLC has agreed to pay more than  600 000 to settle allegations the hedge fund failed to properly file for antitrust clearance when it bought DowDuPont stock two years ago  the U S  Justice Department said on Wednesday 
Third Point  which invests roughly  15 billion in securities around the world and is run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb  will pay a civil fine of  609 810  the department said 
Two years ago the hedge fund allegedly bought too much DowDuPont stock too quickly  failing to make the required Hart Scott Rodino filings or observe a required waiting period 
The hedge fund could have faced much higher penalties but the Justice Department said it reduced the fine because the  violation was inadvertent  
Firms are required to make the Hart Scott Rodino filings to give the government time to investigate potential antitrust violations 
Third Point declined to comment 
Third Point s alleged misstep revolved around the August 2017 merger of Dow and DuPont  NYSE DD  when their separate stocks stopped trading on Aug  31  2017 and were replaced by DowDuPont shares  which began trading on Sept  1  2017 
Earlier this year Dow Inc was formally spun off from DowDuPont Inc 
Third Point received voting securities of DowDuPont in excess of  80 8 million through the merger  the threshold for making the required filing at that time 
While Third Point properly observed the rules when it bought Dow stock long before the merger in 2014  the Justice Department said that because DowDuPont was a different company  the hedge fund was required to make another filing after the merger 
The government also noted that Third Point had previously violated filing requirements in connection with building a stake in Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  Inc shares in 2011 ",2019-08-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/third-point-us-settle-over-antitrust-filing-in-dowdupont-stake-1965739,1965739

churners from profit burners  return on equity will come across to you as one of the most appropriate metrics  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity But ROE doesn t tell the complete story and an investor might get fooled by picking stocks based on this number  If you closely look at the components of ROE  you will be surprised to see that it can be high for the wrong reasons as well  Here comes the DuPont technique which helps investors to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont The DuPont analysis allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at

192709,414225,DD,Analysts Estimate DuPont  DD  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when DuPont  NYSE DD  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This specialty chemicals maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 86 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  79 1  
Revenues are expected to be  5 64 billion  down 76 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 68  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for DuPont 
For DuPont  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that DuPont will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that DuPont would post earnings of  2 10 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 52  delivering a surprise of  20  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
DuPont doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-dupont-dd-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200444834,200444834

192713,414229,DD,Is DuPont De Nemours  DD  A Great Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put DuPont de Nemours  Inc    NYSE DD   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  DuPont de Nemours has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 14  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 98  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  DuPont de Nemours  current PE level puts it way below its midpoint of 15 41 over the past five years The stock s PE compares quite favorably with the Basic Materials Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 98  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  DuPont de Nemours has a P S ratio of just 0 61  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 17x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  DuPont de Nemours currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DuPont de Nemours a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though DuPont de Nemours might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of B  This gives DD a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go down in the past sixty days compared to no upward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen two down and four up in the same time period This has had a negative effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus estimate dipped 1  over the past two months  the current year estimate has decreased 2 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Dow Chemical Company  NYSE DOW   The  Price and Consensus   Such negative analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDuPont de is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 13  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is too hard to get excited about the stock Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the analyst sentiments and Zacks Rank to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2019-09-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-dupont-de-nemours-dd-a-great-pick-for-value-investors-200460831,200460831
192714,414230,DD,5 Top Ranked Stocks Screened On DuPont Criteria,opinion,"Return on equity is an investor favorite metric when it comes to cherry picking quality stocks  But ROE doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might get fooled by picking stocks based on this number  Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont  NYSE DD  technique seems to be an intriguing idea 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
The DuPont analysis allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to a ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis gets the upper hand while finding out the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of eight stocks that made it through the screen 
MEDIFAST Inc   NYSE MED    This Zacks Rank  2 company is a leading manufacturer and distributor of clinically proven healthy living products and programs  The stock comes from a top ranked Zacks sector  top 25    You can see

192728,414244,DD,Bet Big On DuPont Analysis With These Top 5 Picks,opinion,"Return on equity is an investor favorite metric when it comes to cherry picking quality stocks  But ROE doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might make a mistake by selecting stocks based on this ratio   Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont  NYSE DD  technique seem a prudent decision

Why Use DuPont 
Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock

Bet Big on DuPont  NYSE DD  Analysis with These Top 5 Picks
Return on equity is an investor favorite metric when it comes to cherry picking quality stocks  But ROE doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might make a mistake by selecting stocks based on this ratio   Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont technique seem a prudent decision 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income Equity
Net Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity 
ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis

192742,414258,DD,Dow Inc   A Solid Dividend Stock To Stash In Your Income Portfolio,opinion,"Away from the daily market noise and volatility  there are some old economy stocks that don t get as much investor attention as they deserve  The new born Dow Inc  is one such player  which after its recent spin off from the parent DowDuPont Inc   is offering a very attractive income generating opportunity 
Dow shares began trading on April 1 after the old Dow Chemical Co   NYSE DOW  and DuPont Co   NYSE DWDP  announced a grand  120 billion merger in 2017  with an intention to create three separate entities 
Corteva Agriscience is expected to become a separate company in June and will focus on pesticides and other agricultural products  DuPont will also spin out in June as a specialty chemicals company 
The third one is the new Dow  entirely focusing on material sciences  plastics and silicones  and is expected to generate more than  9 billion in earnings this year  before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
What makes it a compelling income generating opportunity is the chemical producer s clear focus to return most of the income back to investors in the shape of dividends and share buybacks  According to the company s presentation to investors  the new Dow will pay out 65  of its net income to shareholders each year through stock buybacks and a hefty dividend 
The company plans to achieve that goal by spending less on new factories and through a more focused approach to its target markets after cutting down the number of its business units to six from 15  Plastics and packaging is now the Dow s largest business  accounting for about half of revenue and earnings  with operations in 31 countries 
A Cyclical Stock But Paying Hefty Dividend
Its stock currently pays  0 7 dividend a share  with an annual yield of about 5   With the targeted payout ratio of 45  of the company s net operating income  that dividend is quite conservative and potentially has more room to grow as the group cuts costs and takes advantage of its leading market position in the global plastic business 
That said  investors should be aware that plastic  being a derivative of oil  is a highly cyclical business where demand and supply is closely tied to the global economic growth and other macro influences 
In its first quarterly earnings after the spinoff  Dow said last week that its core earnings from operations fell 24  in Q1 2019  hurt by a weak pricing environment for its chemicals  The drop was in line with analysts  expectations  The pricing was beginning to improve in its key markets  with a recovery in crude prices that is expected to benefit full year earnings  Dow said in the earnings statement  adding it expects to make revenue between  11  11 5 billion for the second quarter 

The weak earnings report  coupled with the U S  China trade dispute  have hurt the stock in its early trading days  After surging  60 52 in April  a jump of 26  from its  when issued  level that preceded the distribution of the new stock  Dow stock was trading at  52 64 a share yesterday 
But that pullback is a good entry point if you re a long term investor  willing to stay invested with an aim to earn steadily growing income 
 Dow offers a compelling value opportunity   Robert Koort  an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group  said in a note in April cited by Bloomberg 

 In addition to a promising cyclical positioning  we believe the transformation from  old Dow  to  new Dow  suggests more shareholder friendly capital allocation and a leaner  more focused cost structure  

Goldman has a  71 a share price target for Dow  higher than analysts  average estimate of  62 67 for next 12 month period  
Bottom Line
The new Dow has a much better business focus and more potential to provide a regular income  Its 5  dividend yield  a low debt level  and an investment grade credit rating make it a strong candidate for your income portfolio  The recent selloff offers a good entry point to lock in its juicy yield ",2019-05-09,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dow-inc-a-solid-dividend-stock-to-stash-in-your-income-portfolio-200419302,200419302

192761,414277,DD,5 Top Ranked Stocks To Play DuPont Analysis,opinion,"Return on equity is one of the most coveted metrics by investors  The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity 
To shortlist these gems  one can look at the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of the 12 stocks that made it through the screen

192777,414293,DD,DowDuPont forecasts drop in first quarter sales  shares fall,news," Reuters    U S chemicals company DowDuPont Inc on Thursday forecast a surprise drop in revenue for the current quarter  hit by reduced sales in its biggest unit  sending the company s shares down 9 percent in pre market trading 
The company  formed by the  130 billion merger of chemical giants  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW  and DuPont  NYSE DWDP  in September 2017  said it expects first quarter revenue to down in the  mid single digits percent  without giving detailed numbers 
Analysts were expecting DowDupont to report revenue of  22 63 billion for the first quarter  5 percent higher than the year earlier quarter 
The company said sales at the material science unit   its biggest revenue generator   would fall by high single digits percent in the first quarter  weighing on the overall forecast  The unit makes chemicals that are used to make brake fluids and packaging materials among other things 
For the fourth quarter  net sales were  20 1 billion  unchanged from a year ago  but were below the average analyst estimate of  20 92 billion  according to IBES data from Refinitiv  Sales were hit by currency effects  Chief Financial Officer Howard Ungerleider said 
 We expect global economic expansion to continue in 2019 at a moderately slower pace than 2018   Ungerleider said  adding that the company was closely monitoring ongoing trade negotiations and the pace of economic activity in China 
During the quarter  DowDuPont clocked double digit percentage volume growth in China  Ungerleider told Reuters in an interview 
DowDuPont  which is in the process of splitting itself up into three companies  reiterated that the separation was on track  The new Dow will spin out of DowDuPont by April 2019 and its agriculture division  Corteva Agriscience  will spin out in early June 
In the quarter  the company said local prices in the regions they operate rose by about 1 percent  but currency changes reduced sales by 2 percent 
Sales in the materials science business fell 1 percent to  11 8 billion  Volumes   a proxy for demand   rose 1 percent

192778,414294,DD,MarketPulse  DowDuPont Drags Materials Lower ,news,"Investing com   A slump in DowDuPont triggered a malaise in materials stocks after the company was punished for delivering results that missed on the top line  
DowDuPont  NYSE DWDP  shares sank 8  after the conglomerate reported revenue of  20 1 billion  missing the expectation for  20 95 billion  Earnings were marginally ahead of estimates at  0 88 a share 
The revenue miss was blamed on lower demand for automotive and appliance related products  which experienced  more than normal season slowdown   the company said

192780,414296,DD,Why A US China Trade Pact Will Be A Boon For US Chemicals,opinion,The United States and China are inching toward a trade deal that could lead to a potential end to the year long trade spat between the world s two biggest economies The countries  which are engaged in a fierce trade conflict since last year  are in the final stages of negotiation for a deal that could see the roll back of most of the U S  tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods as long as Beijing pledges to lower retaliatory tariffs on U S  products  protect intellectual property rights and purchase a significant amount of American made products Top trade negotiators of both countries are currently discussing  major issues  that must be resolved before the parties could hammer out a formal deal to ease the trade disputes that have cost both economies billions of dollars  One of the top priorities of the U S  administration is to achieve structural changes to end China s unfair trade practices  If everything goes well  a deal may happen by the end of this month U S  Chemical Industry Bearing Brunt of Trade TariffsThe chemical industry is among the industries that have been badly hit by the trade tariffs  The damaging effects of the trade war were evident from the industry s lackluster performance in 2018  The U S  chemical industry  in particular  is caught in the crosshairs of Sino U S  trade tensions The Trump administration slapped punitive tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese products last year while China has imposed retaliatory tariffs on  110 billion in U S  goods  China s tariffs on American products include a wide range of petrochemicals  specialty chemicals and plastics  The list includes chemicals such as polyethylene  polyvinyl chloride   PVC   and polycarbonates According to the American Chemistry Council   ACC    a leading industry trade group  the United States has levied tariffs on  15 billion worth of imports of chemicals and plastics from China  with Beijing retaliating with duties on  11 billion in U S  exports of chemicals and plastics to China Progress on trade negotiations in February led the Trump administration agreeing to hold off raising tariffs  to 25  from existing 10   on  200 billion in Chinese goods that would have taken effect March 1  However  the tariffs currently in place are already doing damage to the chemical industry China is one of the biggest export markets for U S  chemicals  leaving the American chemical industry heavily exposed to China s countermeasures  The tariffs have created an uncertain demand environment for U S  chemical products in this major market  The tariffs are hurting U S  chemical exports and the competitiveness of the American chemical industry According to the ACC  China s tariffs on U S  chemicals and plastics exports have put roughly 55 000 American jobs and  18 billion in domestic activity at risk as a result of lower demand for those products  which would lead to considerable losses for U S  manufacturers  The ACC estimates that the loss to U S  chemical and plastics exports to China could reach as much as  6 1 billion annually There is also concern that the tariffs may dampen new chemical investment in the United States  According to the ACC  333 chemical projects  both on new plants and capacity expansions  have been already announced by chemical makers since 2010 worth  202 billion  A significant portion of the investment is directed toward U S  export markets including China The shale boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies to pump in billions of dollars for setting up facilities  crackers  in the United States to produce ethylene and propylene in a cost effective way  Chemical makers including DowDuPont Inc    NYSE DWDP   and LyondellBasell Industries N V    NYSE LYB   are investing on shale gas linked projects to take advantage of abundant natural gas supplies However  the tariffs have raised concerns that chemicals companies would reconsider their investments in new projects  which could lead to a slowdown in growth in the American chemical industry Trade Truce Will Bring RespiteA U S  China trade pact  if eventually takes place  will likely provide a much needed relief for the U S  chemical industry  As part of the trade deal  China is reportedly offering to lower tariffs and other sanctions on U S  made goods including chemicals  automotive and farm products  Beijing has also reportedly pledged to import a significant number of U S  products   The ACC has urged the United States and China to remove all chemical products from their tariff lists  The trade group has also appealed to the Trump administration to include chemicals and plastics on Beijing s import list as the United States seeks commitment from China to purchase more American products  The ACC sees this as  the most promising and advantageous opportunity for U S  export growth  China is among the most important trading partners of the U S  chemical industry  Moreover  export markets are expected to contribute to the growth of the American chemical industry in 2019 The ACC expects growth in manufacturing and exports markets to drive demand for U S  chemicals this year  As such  a potential trade deal could provide a significant boost to American chemical exports which would augur well for the U S  chemical industry s growth this year and beyond  Chemical Stocks Worth a LookA few stocks currently worth considering in the chemical space are Ingevity Corporation   NYSE NGVT    Innospec Inc    NASDAQ IOSP

Top trade negotiators of both countries are currently discussing  major issues  that must be resolved before the parties could hammer out a formal deal to ease the trade disputes that have cost both economies billions of dollars  One of the top priorities of the U S  administration is to achieve structural changes to end China s unfair trade practices  If everything goes well  a deal may happen by the end of this month 
U S  Chemical Industry Bearing Brunt of Trade Tariffs
The chemical industry is among the industries that have been badly hit by the trade tariffs  The damaging effects of the trade war were evident from the industry s lackluster performance in 2018  The U S  chemical industry  in particular  is caught in the crosshairs of Sino U S  trade tensions 
The Trump administration slapped punitive tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese products last year while China has imposed retaliatory tariffs on  110 billion in U S  goods  China s tariffs on American products include a wide range of petrochemicals  specialty chemicals and plastics  The list includes chemicals such as polyethylene  polyvinyl chloride   PVC   and polycarbonates 
According to the American Chemistry Council   ACC    a leading industry trade group  the United States has levied tariffs on  15 billion worth of imports of chemicals and plastics from China  with Beijing retaliating with duties on  11 billion in U S  exports of chemicals and plastics to China 
Progress on trade negotiations in February led the Trump administration agreeing to hold off raising tariffs  to 25  from existing 10   on  200 billion in Chinese goods that would have taken effect March 1  However  the tariffs currently in place are already doing damage to the chemical industry 
China is one of the biggest export markets for U S  chemicals  leaving the American chemical industry heavily exposed to China s countermeasures  The tariffs have created an uncertain demand environment for U S  chemical products in this major market  The tariffs are hurting U S  chemical exports and the competitiveness of the American chemical industry 
According to the ACC  China s tariffs on U S  chemicals and plastics exports have put roughly 55 000 American jobs and  18 billion in domestic activity at risk as a result of lower demand for those products  which would lead to considerable losses for U S  manufacturers  The ACC estimates that the loss to U S  chemical and plastics exports to China could reach as much as  6 1 billion annually 
There is also concern that the tariffs may dampen new chemical investment in the United States  According to the ACC  333 chemical projects  both on new plants and capacity expansions  have been already announced by chemical makers since 2010 worth  202 billion  A significant portion of the investment is directed toward U S  export markets including China 
The shale boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies to pump in billions of dollars for setting up facilities  crackers  in the United States to produce ethylene and propylene in a cost effective way  Chemical makers including DowDuPont Inc  and LyondellBasell Industries N V  are investing on shale gas linked projects to take advantage of abundant natural gas supplies 
However  the tariffs have raised concerns that chemicals companies would reconsider their investments in new projects  which could lead to a slowdown in growth in the American chemical industry 
Trade Truce Will Bring Respite
A U S  China trade pact  if eventually takes place  will likely provide a much needed relief for the U S  chemical industry  As part of the trade deal  China is reportedly offering to lower tariffs and other sanctions on U S  made goods including chemicals  automotive and farm products  Beijing has also reportedly pledged to import a significant number of U S  products   
The ACC has urged the United States and China to remove all chemical products from their tariff lists  The trade group has also appealed to the Trump administration to include chemicals and plastics on Beijing s import list as the United States seeks commitment from China to purchase more American products  The ACC sees this as  the most promising and advantageous opportunity for U S  export growth  
China is among the most important trading partners of the U S  chemical industry  Moreover  export markets are expected to contribute to the growth of the American chemical industry in 2019 
The ACC expects growth in manufacturing and exports markets to drive demand for U S  chemicals this year  As such  a potential trade deal could provide a significant boost to American chemical exports which would augur well for the U S  chemical industry s growth this year and beyond  Chemical Stocks Worth a Look

192800,414316,DD,After Monsanto patent ruling  Indian farmers hope for next gen GM seeds,news,By Rajendra Jadhav and Mayank Bhardwaj MUMBAI NEW DELHI  Reuters    Monsanto s victory this week in a patent case in India regarding genetically modified  GM  cotton seeds has raised hopes among farmers that the company will now launch its next generation seeds  India approved Monsanto s GM cotton seed trait in 2002 and an upgraded variety in 2006  helping transform the country into the world s top producer and second largest exporter of the fiber  But newer traits have not been available since the company withdrew an application in 2016 seeking approval for the latest variety due to a royalty dispute with the government and worries over patent claims     Nevertheless  the new herbicide tolerant variety seeped into Indian farms and many cotton growers openly sowed them last year  prompting a government investigation that is ongoing   Monsanto   NYSE MON  has said local seed companies have illegally attempted to  incorporate unauthorized and unapproved herbicide tolerant technologies into their seeds    We don t understand legal issues but we want new technologies   Shrikant Kale  a cotton grower in Yavatmal district in the western state of Maharashtra  said by phone   If the court verdict helps seed companies in bringing new technology  then it would be good for us as well   Nearly a dozen other farmers in three Maharashtra districts said they planted the illegal cotton variety in June after buying seeds from the gray market  and that they would be happy to use it legally if Monsanto launched it   Illegal sales mean that there s always a risk of buying spurious seeds and we buy such smuggled seeds as there is no alternative   said Vijay Niwal  another cotton farmer in Maharashtra   We don t mind paying a few hundred rupees more for seeds if they help us in saving thousands of rupees on managing weeds   India s Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that Monsanto can claim patents on its GM cotton seeds  after the company appealed an earlier ruling by the Delhi High Court that the world s biggest seed maker could not claim such patents  Monsanto owner Bayer  DE BAYGn  welcomed the Supreme Court s decision  It said in a statement to Reuters on Friday that it was confident of  defending any challenge to our patent by presenting solid scientific evidence   and that the company would seek a ruling on  infringement of the patent  in India  Asked about plans to launch new products in India  Bayer said   Protection of intellectual property encourages innovation that is essential to providing India s farmers with access to breakthrough technologies   But two industry sources aware of the company s plans said that a dispute over royalties paid by local companies that license its technology remained a hurdle to seeking fresh approval to sell a new variety of cotton seeds  India s agriculture ministry has twice slashed royalties in the past two years  apart from cutting cotton seed prices   The government could step in again to decide the rate of royalty  which could be really miniscule in comparison with the cost of developing a really good product   said one of the sources  declining to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media   Biotechnology research is very expensive and if the government arbitrarily fixes the rate for expensive  cutting edge technologies then that becomes a major hurdle in launching new products   The agriculture ministry did not respond to an email seeking comment   SELF RELIANCE  GROUP The court ruling has been criticized by a nationalist group that has links to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and favors non GM technologies and  India first  economic policies  The Swadeshi Jagran Manch  which loosely translates to National Forum for Self Reliance  said the government needs to amend the country s patent law to negate the court verdict  Industry executives say several foreign agrichemical companies had to scale down projects  fire scientists  or pull applications to sell products in India because of government mandated cuts in royalties and a lower court s order in April that rejected Monsanto s patent claim  They said the Supreme Court verdict overturning the lower court order could set a precedent for any future patent dispute and encourage fresh investments in one of the world s biggest farm markets  whose seed industry is worth around  3 billion a year   The entire biotechnology space has been liberated   said Ram Kaundinya  director general of the Federation of Seed Industry of India that represents foreign and local seed companies including Monsanto and Syngenta    There was uncertainty in this area for the last three to four years  which led to a reduction in investments  There are still some issues regarding price control but those are not as big as validity of patents   Many biotechnology companies working on corn and other GM crops will now push hard to get government approvals for their seeds  he said  declining to name the companies  DowDuPont  N DWDP   which in August last year told the Indian government it was putting off trials needed for approval to sell a GM corn variety  did not respond to a call seeking comment  A public relations firm for Syngenta directed Reuters to Kaundinya for comment  But permitting GM food crops is a big call for India  which so far only allows genetically modified cotton seeds  The country spends tens of billions of dollars in importing food  as dated technologies  poor yields  shrinking farms and unreliable weather patterns afflict the country of 1 3 billion people  But opponents of GM crops say they threaten the country s biodiversity and are too expensive for Indian farmers  Annual

192808,414324,DD,Early winter weather puts U S  safe haven corn planting in doubt,news,"By Mark Weinraub CHICAGO  Reuters    Illinois farmer Brent Johnson had planned to bump up his corn acreage by 10 percent in 2019 and plant fewer soybeans as a way to shelter himself from the lower soy prices caused by U S  President Donald Trump s tariff war with China  But some early winter storms caused him to abandon the late autumn fieldwork necessary to seed the yellow grain in the spring  That will force him and other farmers to devote more of his acreage to soybeans than expected next year  As soybeans are far more affected by the U S  trade war with China than corn  the trend adds to economic risk across a U S  farm belt the Trump administration recently said would get up to  12 billion in aid to make up for trade related losses   China resumed buying U S  soybeans in December as part of a trade war truce following a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U S  President Donald Trump  but the amount of purchases remains well behind the pace of previous years  It is unclear how much U S  soy China will actually buy with a record Brazilian harvest just weeks away   Even with China back in the market for the first time in six months  the record soybean supplies littering the countryside have weighed on prices    soy futures  were down 8 2 percent so far this year    and made corn a more attractive option to growers  Corn futures  Cv1  have risen 7 9 percent during 2018 and were on track for their biggest yearly gain since 2012  China historically has imported very little corn    With some of these corn prices and the corn yields we ve had  I wanted to plant some continuous corn  but  the window  to prepare the ground  closed on us too tightly   Johnson said  The severe weather across the U S  Midwest in October and early November meant farmers left nearly 11 million acres of corn and soybeans from Kentucky to North Dakota standing in their fields as of the end of November   the fourth highest amount ever  Crops left in the ground during winter can still be harvested once the snow melts but face severe yield loss as soybean pods split and corn stalks are often knocked down  and mold is another risk  That will further squeeze farm profits after a bleak year of low prices and few buyers  Analysts are now casting doubt on the U S  Department of Agriculture s early November forecast that 2019 corn plantings will rise about 3 million acres to 92 0 million acres  At that time  soybean acres were seen falling 7 5 percent to 82 5 million   Because of what happened during fall tillage     maybe you do not plant as much corn   said Don Roose  president of U S  Commodities in West Des Moines  Iowa   The weather problems also could cut into the bottom lines of seed and fertilizer companies  Corn requires more tilling and fertilizer applications that cannot be completed with unharvested crops or frozen ground  Seed companies like DowDuPont  N DWDP  that earn more money from corn seeds could see their businesses affected by the changes  Two thirds of DowDuPont s net seed sales are corn and only 20 percent are soybeans  The company said in October it would take a  4 6 billion charge to write down the value of its agriculture business  which has been hurt as Brazilian farmers increased soy planting to meet China s demand for South American soybeans and reduced corn output  Bayer  DE BAYGn   the German drugmaker that bought U S  seed company  Monsanto   NYSE MON   has a much bigger market share in corn seeds and related crop protection products than in the soy market  and would also would benefit from rising corn acreage  DowDuPont and Bayer did not respond to requests for comment   Back on his 4 000 acre  1620 hectare  farm in central Illinois  Johnson had planned to boost corn seeding by 400 acres  160 hectares  in 2019 before adverse weather sidelined him in November  After some heavy rain  early snow and hail  he parked his tractor and other equipment in the shed for the winter as there was little benefit to plowing through a sloppy field

192835,414351,DD,A Quick Overview Of The Bayer Monsanto Merger After DOJ Approval,opinion,"The Justice Department granted antitrust approval on Tuesday for Bayer s   OTC BAYRY   proposed acquisition of Monsanto   NYSE MON    after requiring the German giant to divest roughly  9 billion worth of assets and businesses  So let s dive into a quick overview of everything investors need to know about the deal 
Brief Background 
Bayer  DE BAYGN  is a Leverkusen  Germany health care  pharmaceutical  and agriculture conglomerate that is currently a major force in the pesticide industry and employs almost 100 000 people worldwide  St  Louis based Monsanto is a world leader in seeds and crop genes  Therefore  at the moment  Bayer is much bigger in Europe and Asia  while Monsanto s presence in North America is huge 
The roughly  66 billion merger was initially announced in September 2016  and would make Bayer the world s largest supplier of pesticides and seeds  Bayer received antitrust approval from the EU on March 21  The DOJ s approval was one of the last remaining regulatory hurdles to jump in order for Bayer to officially buy Monsanto 
The move also comes after Dow Chemical and DuPont   NYSE DWDP   successfully completed their merger last September  Meanwhile  investors await news about AT T s   NYSE T   acquisition of Time Warner   NYSE TWX    with a federal judge expected to hand down a decision by  
DOJ Approval 
The DOJ announced that it required Bayer to move on from  9 billion of assets businesses  which the department said in an official  was the  largest merger divestiture ever required by the United States  
The antitrust division was reviewing Bayer s acquisition based on the idea that it would lead to higher seed prices and negatively impact both farmers and consumers   Without the agreed to divestitures  the proposed merger would likely result in higher prices  lower quality  and fewer choices across a wide array of seed and crop protection products  The merger also threatened to stifle the innovation in agricultural technologies that has delivered significant benefits to American farmers and consumers  
Bayer must now divest its businesses that compete with Monsanto  The list of businesses Bayer must divest includes  cotton  canola  soybean  and vegetable seed businesses  along with Bayer s Liberty herbicide business which the DOJ noted is a key competitor to Monsanto s Roundup brand 
Furthermore  the settlement requires  structural divestitures  and the sell off of some intellectual property and research capabilities  in order to foster a competitive environment going forward  This includes Bayer s relatively new  digital agriculture  business 
The German giant will sell these businesses and assets to chemicals rival BASF SE   NYSE BAS    which the DOJ referred to as  an experienced chemical company with a substantial crop protection business  that will  fully resolve all horizontal and vertical competition concerns   The DOJ now believes that  American farmers and consumers will continue to benefit from competition in this industry  
Going Forward 
The planned merger is now subject to a 60 day public comment period   Receipt of the DOJ s approval brings us close to our goal of creating a leading company in agriculture   Bayer CEO Werner Baumann said in a company statement  Bayer noted in the same statement that it has  obtained almost all clearances  and now expects to receive all outstanding approvals  very shortly  
 According to the DOJ s conditional approval  the integration of Monsanto into Bayer can take place as soon as the divestments to BASF have been accomplished  This is expected to be in approximately two months  
Recent Performance  
Shares of Bayer and Monsanto both opened higher on Wednesday following the DOJ announcement  However  over the last five years  both Bayer and Monsanto have greatly underperformed the S P 500 s 68  surge  BAYRY stock is up just 11 8   while MON has climbed 26 7  
 
Over the last year  investors can see that things look even worse for Bayer  which is one of the reasons that it hopes its planned merger finally goes through after two years of speculation and review

192839,414355,DD,NASCAR notebook  Knaus late to fulfill career dream,news,"TALLADEGA  Ala    Almost from the day he arrived at Hendrick Motorsports 25 years ago  Chad Knaus had a specific ambition  He wanted to be crew chief on Jeff Gordon s No  24 Chevrolet  Only one problem  Ray Evernham had the job  So Knaus began his association with the No  24 team as a fabricator  He also changed rear tires for Gordon as an original member of the vaunted Rainbow Warriors pit crew and was part of Gordon s championship teams in 1995 and 1997  After subsequent stints with Dale Earnhardt Inc   Tyler Jet Motorsports and Melling Racing  Knaus returned to Hendrick in 2002 as crew chief for a largely untested rookie named Jimmie Johnson  In the 17 years that have followed  Johnson has won 83 races    most among active drivers    and a record tying seven Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series championships under a variety of postseason formats  The five straight titles accumulated by Johnson and Knaus from 2006 through 2010 likely constitute an unassailable mark  At the end of the 2018 season  however  the partnership between Johnson and Knaus will end  Johnson will get a new crew chief    Kevin Meendering  Knaus will finally a get his shot as crew chief of the No  24 Chevrolet  but not with Gordon  who has left the driver s seat for the TV booth  Knaus will call the shots for William Byron  a 20 year old Sunoco Rookie of the Year contender this season  Byron s current crew chief  Darian Grubb  has been promoted to an executive position in the competition end of the Hendrick organization   It s exciting for me    it really is   Knaus said   I m an old racer guy  but I m totally geeked to be crew chief on the No  24 car  I m not lying when I said that  when I started here  I was like   Man  I want to be crew chief on that No  24 car    I always wanted to be Jeff Gordon s crew chief  I didn t make that happen  but I  will be  at least crew chief for his team and for his car number   Knaus ticked off similarities between Gordon s situation in 1993 and Byron s next year   We had sponsor DuPont  NYSE DWDP  which is now Axalta on the No  24 car back then   Knaus said   I m going to the No  24 car with Axalta  which was DuPont  Jeff was 21 years old  William s going to be 21 years old next year   It s a really neat thing  I m stoked  I really am  I m sad that this chapter  with Johnson  is    It s not over  I mean you can t  what people think   The era s over     You can t erase what we ve done  It s not over  It s going to live forever   FOR BUBBA WALLACE  DAYTONA WAS A LONG TIME AGO The good news  Bubba Wallace finished a close second in the Daytona 500 in his first trip as a full time driver of the No  43 Richard Petty Motorsports Chevrolet  The bad news  That was the singular highlight in an otherwise difficult season  Including the runner up finish at Daytona    his only top five this year    Wallace has posted an average result of 24 9 through 30 races  At this point  the Daytona 500 is a distant memory   That was a long time ago   Wallace acknowledged on Friday at Talladega Superspeedway  venue for Sunday s 1000Bulbs com 500  2 p m  ET on NBC  MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio   There s a lot of racing  This schedule  first rookie year with the Cup schedule    it s a long schedule   I know that was a while ago  but we still relive those moments  those little highlights of success I still relive and think about constantly  It s kind of off in the distance  but it seems like you can just reach out and view it all over again   Wallace hopes to relive the moment more directly in Sunday s race  the last restrictor plate event of the season  but he has to be careful this weekend  Because of attrition  Wallace arrived at Talladega without a backup car   Yeah  out of all the speedway races we ve had  we have run OK  but then the cars are totaled at the end  That s part of it  So  yeah  we re just going to go out and do our own deal until the race starts  That was new news to me going into this weekend  I was like  Oh  all right    SORRY  NOAH  BUT THAT S NOT YOUR CREW CHIEF For a while  at least  Noah Gragson thought he might have the services of Kevin Meendering as his crew chief next year  Gragson has signed with JR Motorsports  where he ll replace NASCAR Xfinity Series championship contender Elliott Sadler  who is retiring from full time racing at the end of the season  Meendering is Sadler s crew chief  But Hendrick Motorsports team owner Rick Hendrick had other plans for Meendering  who will replace Chad Knaus as crew chief for the No  48 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series team of seven time champion Jimmie Johnson next year  That leaves Gragson with a major unanswered question   I don t know who my crew chief will be   said Gragson  who is battling for the NASCAR Camping World Championship in the No  18 Kyle Busch Motorsports Toyota this season   I was reading on Twitter yesterday  and I saw Meendering  who I think that is the crew chief for the No  1 car  Sadler    I started to put things together  and I thought that was the guy who is supposed to be my crew chief  Why is he going to be the crew chief of Jimmie Johnson next year  I don t know who it s going to be  I m really focused on competing this weekend and finishing this year out strong with my Kyle Busch team

192850,414366,DD,Samsung Back in Favor as Moon Tries to Kick Start Korean Economy,news," Bloomberg     In a meeting that was unthinkable 19 months ago  South Korea s president will this week introduce the head of the country s biggest conglomerate to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang 
The parley caps a remarkable period for Jay Y  Lee  vice chairman of Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co   who since the start of 2017 has been arrested  tried and jailed before being released a year later  Meanwhile  President Moon Jae in is finding his political fortunes tied to the company and South Korea s other conglomerates amid a sputtering economy  even though he swept to an election victory promising to rein in the power of the chaebol 
While close links between politicians and chaebol aren t new in South Korea  Moon talked tough about cutting that influence before his election  a poll that only took place because his predecessor was brought down by a bribery scandal involving Lee  With exports of semiconductors one of the few bright spots in an economy that s showing signs of strain  the country s reliance on its most profitable company is deepening and thus reducing regulatory pressure on Samsung 
 The government needs Samsung now   said Chung Sun sup  chief executive officer of corporate analysis firm Chaebul com   Samsung also has nothing to lose by complying  
The president s office and Samsung haven t said what Lee would discuss on the trip  The company doesn t have any businesses in North Korea  which is subject to international sanctions 
Lee s trip comes less than two months after he appeared at a photo opportunity at Samsung s latest and biggest chip factory in Pyeongtaek  south of Seoul  where he met with Kim Dong yeon  South Korea s finance minister  There  Samsung pushed for lower regulations on pharmaceuticals  construction of plants  mobile networks and other business areas  which the minister planned to look into  Kim told reporters after the meeting 
When Moon was elected in May last year  expectations were high that the government would force the chaebol to improve their corporate governance and reduce the power held by founding families such as the Lees at Samsung 
In a sign of how that dynamic has changed  Moon has called for easing a law that limits companies from owning a bigger chunk of a bank  generating criticism by activists that it could pave the way for chaebol families to use financial units to increase their control 
Samsung has an outsized influence on South Korea  Not only is it the biggest private employer in the country  but its flagship electronics business alone accounts for a staggering 20 percent of the nation s benchmark Kospi index  and it has five other affiliates in the top 30 
Lee  son of South Korea s richest man  was arrested in February 2017 on charges including bribing a friend of former President Park Geun hye  After a six month trial  he was sentenced to five years in prison  a term reduced and suspended earlier this year  He is appealing the remaining jail term while prosecutors seek a harsher punishment  The Samsung heir has consistently denied any wrongdoing 
On Tuesday  Lee and other chaebol leaders will join Moon at his third summit with the North Korean leader  It will be the second public meeting between Moon and the Samsung boss this year after a brief handshake at the opening of an Indian smartphone factory 
Moon s chief of staff said Monday it isn t unusual for conglomerate chiefs to visit North Korea on the occasion of a summit  as they have previously done so  Samsung declined to comment 
While Samsung is coming off a year of record profits  South Korea s economy and Moon s own approval ratings are struggling  The president s so called wage led growth plan is failing to increase jobs  with the August unemployment rate hitting the highest since early 2010 and consumer confidence tumbling to its lowest in 17 months 
Companies filing for bankruptcy jumped 9 2 percent to 994 this year through July  the most ever for the period  according to Supreme Court of Korea data going back to 2012 
 Slow economy means a halt in chaebol reforms   said Bruce Lee  chief executive officer at Seoul based Zebra Investment Management   It s become really hard to reform chaebol because they are the biggest employers  
That s not the only concern for South Korea  As one emerging market nation after another feels the impact of rising U S  interest rates and the trade spat between China and the U S   the importance of foreign reserves is greater than ever and making exports more important 
That s where Samsung becomes a powerful ally with about 90 percent of its revenue coming from overseas sales  where it leads the world in smartphones and TVs  The Suwon based company is also the world s biggest maker of semiconductors and  along with local rival SK Hynix Inc   a member of another chaebol  it dominates supply of critical memory chips 
Semiconductors accounted for 23 percent of South Korea s exports last month  more than any other product  That forces Moon and Samsung into a delicate situation  Too much reliance on the chaebol could further harm his political stock  but it also means any downturn in chip demand spells trouble for the company and Asia s fourth largest economy   Its pricing has been very good and margins for Samsung have been really strong   said Erik Zipf  head of emerging market equities at DuPont  NYSE DWDP  Capital Management  We don t think that s sustainable  We think as capacity comes on  that ll kind of reduce margins  
Still  Samsung continues to play along  Two days after the meeting with the finance minister  Samsung announced a three year plan that includes 180 trillion   160 billion  of investment  with the promise to hire 40 000 more people  That s a shot in the arm for a president under pressure and a company under scrutiny 
 Reforms are dying on the vine   said Kwon Young june  a professor who researches corporate governance at Seoul s Kyung Hee University   The government will find itself more and more in need of conglomerates as long as it is fixated on quick results rather than long term reforms  ",2018-09-17,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/samsung-back-in-favor-as-moon-tries-to-kickstart-korean-economy-1613698,1613698

192866,414382,DD,Digital Realty  DLR  To Post Q4 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,Digital Realty Trust  Inc    NYSE DLR   is scheduled to release fourth quarter and full year 2017 results on Feb 15  after the market closes Last quarter  this San Francisco  CA based date center real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 1 34   Results were supported by growth in revenues Over the trailing four quarters  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and met estimates in the other  with an average beat of around 1 69   This is depicted in the graph below Digital Realty Trust  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for Digital Realty prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderData center REITs are experiencing a boom market amid growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increasing number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure  This has been driving demand which is outpacing supply in top tier data center markets  Therefore  despite enjoying high occupancy  the top tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace Additionally  improved outlook for economic growth is anticipated to fuel demand for data centers  Amid these  Digital Realty s focus on offering upgraded technology to entice clients is likely to bolster its revenue stream in the to be reported quarter In addition to this  strategic acquisitions are likely to aid the company s top line growth  Also  in September 2017  the company announced the completion of a merger with DuPont  NYSE DWDP  Fabros  This buyout helped the company reinforce its hyper scale product offering and widen the blue chip customer base Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues is currently pegged at  729 3 million  indicating projected growth of around 49 8  year over year However  Digital Realty faces intense competition in its industry  In fact  the company competes with several data center developers  owners and operators  many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in locations same as Digital Realty  Also  there are a number of local developers in the United States  and several regional operators in Europe  Asia and Australia Given the solid growth potential of the data center real estate market  competition is expected to have been intense from existing players  as well as entry of new players  Amid this  aggressive pricing pressure is predicted to have been prevalent in the data center market in the quarter to be reported  while robust growth in occupancy might remain elusive Moreover  Digital realty has a significant number of properties situated outside the United States  The company is also considering making additional international acquisition  Although a sound global footprint helps the company meet rising data center requirements of customers around the world  the process exposes the company s earnings to foreign currency translation  Also  the hike in interest rate is a concern as the company has a substantial debt burden Hence  prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations  FFO  per share for the fourth quarter remained unchanged at  1 52 over the past week  However  FFO per share denotes a projected increase of 6 3  year over year Also  Digital Realty s shares have declined 12 5  in the past three months  underperforming the 10 7  loss incurred by the  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Digital Realty will likely beat estimates this season  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP is 0 00   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Digital Realty has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around CubeSmart   NYSE CUBE    slated to release fourth quarter results on Feb 15  has an Earnings ESP of  1 10  and a Zacks Rank of 3  You can see  Extra Space Storage Inc    NYSE EXR    scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Feb 20  has an Earnings ESP of  0 23  and a Zacks Rank of 3 Outfront Media Inc    NYSE OUT    slated to release quarterly numbers on Feb 27  has an

192867,414383,DD,Hone In On DuPont Analysis   Pick 5 Top Stocks ,opinion,"Return on equity is one of the most coveted metrics by investors  The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity To shortlist these gems  one can look at the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis

192868,414384,DD,What Lies Ahead For Materials ETFs ,opinion,"The materials sector is attracting a lot of investor attention lately  Industrial Metals have been rebounding on greater global optimism  This is primarily due to robust global growth cues and strong demand  Manufacturing has been gathering pace globally and driving demand for metals 
However  the scenario in the United States and among its trade partners is not that sweet right now  U S  Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross stated last week that the administration has got the green light to move ahead with proposed tariffs on metals and that President Donald Trump has until April to decide the future course of action around his protectionist agenda  read    
Into the Headlines
Ross recommended a possible global tariff of at least 24  on imports of steel and 7 7  on aluminium after careful consideration of all factors including import surges in recent years  Ross added that the current scenario threatens to impair the U S  national security   
Per a Financial Times article  Wang Hejun  an official at China s commerce   said   The spectrum of national security is very broad and without a clear definition it could easily be abused   adding   If the final decision from the US hurts China s interests  we will certainly take necessary measures to protect our legitimate rights  
American companies have for long criticized Chinese practices  as they complain that Chinese companies dump their products at below market prices  thanks to the state subsidy they receive 
As a result  Trump is expected to take a strict stand against this move  because he has been following his  America first  agenda since his first day in office  Per a Financial Times   in a meeting with Congress members  Trump said   I want to keep prices down but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminium industry and we do need that for national defence   adding   If we ever have a conflict we don t want to be buying steel  from  a country we are fighting  
If Trump moves ahead with his agenda  China in retaliation will need to carefully administer its moves  so as to not hurt its export dependent economy 
Infrastructure
Moving on to Trump s infrastructure plans  the President unveiled his  1 5 trillion plan last week  However  a mere  200 billion of that will come from direct federal spending  whereas the rest is to be funded by state and local governments who are expected to match any federal allocation by at least a four to one ratio  read    
Although the plan is still in its early stages  if passed  it will significantly benefit materials companies   For too long  lawmakers have invested in infrastructure inefficiently  ignored critical needs  and allowed it to deteriorate  As a result  the United States has fallen further and further behind other countries   Trump s message to the  read   It is time to give Americans the working  modern infrastructure they deserve   he added

192869,414385,DD,The Classic DuPont Model,opinion,"In their February 15 DataTrek newsletter  Jessica Rabe and Nick Colas refer to the classic DuPont  NYSE DWDP  model in discussing how to deal with equity valuations  They admit that  Permanent changes to the tax code shift returns higher   We agree  They then temper their outlook by introducing the deficit issue  inflation expectations  risks of higher interest rates  and other factors  We agree with their list  but we don t agree that those factors are a reason to reduce the classic DuPont model valuation results 
Let s use a hypothetical  Assume for a minute that the 500 companies in the S P 500 Index all merged and are a huge global conglomerate that has diverse businesses that are represented by the sectors of the S P large cap index  The company s 2018 earnings were estimated at  140 per share before the new tax code was implemented  And the expected growth rate of those earnings for the next 10 years was 6  per year  Therefore the earnings estimate for 2019 was 1 06 times  140  which equals  148 40 per share next year 
Now along come the tax code changes  The 2018 earnings number is revised upward to  154 per share  The 6  growth rate is unchanged  Thus the new estimate for 2019 is  163 24  Readers can quickly see how this works  Start with a higher threshold  and the growth rate is applied to a larger number  Thus the future years  earnings numbers will be higher than they would otherwise be  and the trajectory of that future growth is based on a higher compounding rate than it would otherwise be 
So how do we value the tax code change  Do we use the same multiple of earnings that we used for the original  140 but apply it to  154  Or is it higher  Or lower  We think it is higher 
Here is where the DataTrek list becomes a challenge  Of course  future paths of growth and interest rates and inflation and other factors alter the future earnings estimates  That would be the case with or without the tax code changes 
The critical question is whether the compounding of the earnings growth rate is altered so that it is lower than the effects of the changes introduced by expectations of inflation and interest rates  And we must remember that inflation is a nominal item  so that stated earnings  in nominal terms  can be increased by inflation  That used to be a detriment  because higher tax rates were applied to those nominal earnings  That impact too has changed  since the baseline corporate tax rate has declined from 35  to 21  
So a second item in the calculus is the reduction of the inflation tax premium  DataTrek mentions real returns in general terms  We agree  But we think that too needs more elaboration 
Note that we won t see earnings reported for Q1 of 2018 until April  But all we have seen for 2017 revealed a very positive picture  Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  stated  February 16  that 85 9  of the S P 500 market cap had reported earnings for Q4 of last year  They note a  beat rate  of 4 9   with 73  of companies surpassing bottom line estimates  They remind us that this compares with 4 7  and 68  over the past three years 
In sum  the earnings reports of the S P 500 were pointing to an improving trend before the tax code change  Add in the new tax code  and it only gets better 
Note that we haven t mentioned the repatriation effects  They are coming  Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO   for example  has announced its intention to repatriate  67 billion and to use  44 billion of that for share repurchases and dividends  Clearly  Cisco s earnings per share are positively impacted  as is its stock price  For details see
  Dan Clifton of Strategas adds this observation on February 20  2018   We also note that Cisco s repatriation in 2018 will be nearly as large as the combined tax cuts for all US companies in 2018   just one company s repatriation  
The stock market correction took US stock prices down to levels below those that preceded the tax code passage  In fact those levels were even lower than the prices that preceded the expectations that the new tax code change would be passed  The average stock corrected about 14   We think that was way overdone  It created an entry opportunity  and we became fully invested in our US and US Core ETF accounts  We remain that way today 
We still expect an S P 500 Index above 3000 by decade s end  and we still believe the disaggregation of the classic DuPont model has merit today  given the permanent nature of the tax code changes

192877,414393,DD,Trump s trade war splits a Missouri county into winners and losers,news,By P J  Huffstutter NEW MADRID COUNTY  Mo   Reuters    People don t talk about trade tariffs in this stretch of the Mississippi River basin  where grains and metals have paid the bills for generations  They skirt the subject at church fundraisers and sidestep it at Jerry s Caf  and Quick Stop  where farmers and aluminum workers gossip about everything else  Here  the winners and losers in U S  President Donald Trump s trade war live side by side  The Republican president s tariffs on imported metals were instrumental in reviving an aluminum plant that most locals had written off for dead  But in the fields surrounding the plant and across the county  farmers anxious over trade retaliations against U S  crop exports are delaying equipment purchases  renting their land to hunters and pre selling crops before harvest   locking in today s prices for fear they will fall   People don t want to talk about trade   said Justin Rone  a farmer with deep family roots in soybeans and cotton   It s safer to talk about how best to grow your crop  keep your head down and pray   Farmers  fears were realized Friday as the United States and China levied dueling tariffs on  34 billion worth of each country s goods  Many U S  agricultural exports  including soybeans  now face 25 percent duties  Neil Priggel knows both sides of the trade war s impact on his community  He worked at the Noranda Aluminum smelter before it went belly up in 2016 and also runs his family s 4 000 acre farm along with two brothers  As Trump announced steel and aluminum tariffs in March  Priggel stared at the TV news and thought  We re saved  We ll get our jobs back  His very next thought  We ve got to protect the farm  Priggel and other farmers here  where about 70 percent of voters supported Trump  know their crops are obvious targets for countries striking back against U S  tariffs  They also know the tax on metal imports helped lure new owners to reopen the plant that has long financed their neighbors  mortgages  truck payments and groceries  Kathee Brown worked at Noranda for three decades  She returned in March a one person human resources division for what s now called Magnitude 7 Metals  Her phone rings constantly  Is it true the plant is coming back  Did you get my application  At her dusty office desk  its drawers still full of old invoices  she checks her voicemail   full  again  Many callers are former plant workers  sometimes they break into tears when she calls back  The plant s new owners plan to hire 465 people  for now  More than double that number have applied       SAINTS PRESERVE US Getting the smelter back was a long shot  locals say  just like getting a high paying factory to this rural corner of Missouri in the first place  When it was built in 1969  they named its site for the patron saint of lost causes  the St  Jude Industrial Park  Workers rode out years of aluminum price drops  labor strikes  recessions and fights with electricity suppliers  The company would cut shifts  lay off workers  then hire them back  workers say  But the plant closed in early 2016 after a series of crippling blows  global aluminum prices plunged  a New York private equity fund heaped on  1 billion in debt in a leveraged buyout  an explosion disabled the plant s cast house  a power outage shut two production lines  About 1 000 people had to go find jobs  often at much lower pay  said Mark Baker  a farmer and presiding commissioner for New Madrid County   People lost homes   said Dick Bodi  mayor of New Madrid  Missouri   People got divorced    Local police and ambulance budgets were cut  The county went into the red for two years  Baker said  Noranda never made a  3 1 million tax payment to the New Madrid school district  forcing job cuts and halting school repairs  said Sam Duncan  county superintendent of schools  The district saw a 10 percent drop in school enrollments as families left the area  Duncan said  But most stayed  often turning to the region s other dominant for work   The only people hiring were the farmers   said Dalton Bezell  31  who worked for Noranda  By late summer  Noranda s staff had shrunk to nine people  making a fraction of their previous salaries  Their job  Secure the plant and try to figure out a way to revive it       A BET ON TRUMP TARIFFS Steve Rusche  now chief operating officer of Magnitude 7 Metals  was among the nine  He watched as prospective buyers toured the plant   not to restart it  but to chop it up and sell it for scrap  One was different  Magnitude 7 Metals LLC  founded by former  Glencore   LON GLEN  Plc aluminum trader Matt Lucke  who wanted to operate the plant if it could work financially  Rusche said  Lucke did not respond to requests for comment  The Republican controlled state legislature helped by passing a controversial law making it easier for manufacturers to hire non unionized workers  a bill plant representatives supported  Some of Noranda s remaining crew of nine helped to cut electricity deals and lock in raw material prices for the new company   The pivot point was when things started to come out of Washington about the metal tariffs   Rusche said  Last June  Magnitude 7 Metals Chief Executive Officer Bob Prusak testified before the Commerce Department at a public hearing about a department investigation into aluminum imports  Tariffs  he told them  were  nothing short of critical to get us up and running   according to a video of the hearing  More investors joined as Trump threatened and later imposed the metal tariffs  The plant ramped up hiring and opened its first production line on June 14   Now  there s hope   said Bodi  the New Madrid mayor       FEAR IN FARM COUNTRY Hope is fading on the farms of New Madrid county  The region was among Missouri s top soybean and corn producers last year  according to data from the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA   DuPont  NYSE DWDP  Pioneer runs a massive soybean seed production plant here  A nearby riverbank is crowded with farm bins and barge loaders operated by global grain trader Archer Daniels Midland  farm cooperative Riceland Foods Inc and suppliers Crop Production Services and Agrium Inc  Local grain farmers sell most of their harvests to river terminals for overseas markets because there is scant local demand  The traders ship crops down the Mississippi River to Gulf Coast seaports for international distribution  Friday s retaliation by China hits a slew of U S  made products  including soybeans  the most valuable U S  agricultural export  Rising tensions with Mexico and Canada could also hit U S  farmers as the countries renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement  Farmers were already hurting before the trade fight  with net farm incomes slashed in recent years as a global grains glut undermined prices  About half of U S  soybeans were exported last year  according to USDA data  More than one quarter of the crop  worth about  12 3 billion  went to China  Missouri exported  2 billion worth of agricultural goods  federal data shows  A couple of Rone s employees took the farmer aside recently  They told him they were grateful he gave them work after they lost their jobs at the smelter  But with the plant reopening  they were applying for their old jobs   I m happy for them  We all are   Rone said   But for us  for farmers  it s still to be decided        CASHING OUT Priggel and his brothers already sold more than half of the corn  soybeans and cotton they planted this spring  a move to lock in profits in case trade retaliations undercut prices  In June  U S  soybean futures contracts nearly hit a 10 year low  Missouri cotton marketer Barry Bean said one of his farmers was so freaked out about the tariff threat that he sold nearly 80 percent of the crop before he had planted anything this spring  He has no crop insurance  He keeps calling Bean  trying to sell even more cotton still growing in his fields   Stop   Bean keeps telling him   If something happens   you get a weather event   you are going to be in serious trouble   Third generation soybean farmer Bobby Aycock has cut his operating expenses  avoided buying new equipment and rented out some of his farmland  He s got a plan in case the tariffs drive down grain prices to a point that threatens his farm s survival   I ll cash out  get out of farming and go get a job at Magnitude 7   Aycock said   I have to protect what I ve worked for   for 37 years   and what I ve put away  so my kids will have it a little better than I had it growing up    GRAPHIC  Metals and agriculture employment in Missouri

Express Inc    NASDAQ PETS   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 DuPont Tested Winning StocksReturn on equity  ROE  is one of the most favored metrics of investors  It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity  Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock However  stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns  Here is where the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  analysis comes into play It is an analytical method  which examines three major elements   operating management  management of assets and the capital structure   related to the financial condition of a company  Below we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierImportance of Du PontAlthough one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research

192888,414404,DD,Digital Realty  Despite Fear Mongers  Dividend  Price Will Rise,opinion,"There is a lot of fear mongering surrounding data center Digital Realty Trust Inc  NYSE DLR   However  we believe its 3 4  dividend is safe and it will grow  and its price will increase too  This article reviews four fears circling Digital Realty  and then highlights three reasons why we currently like it 
Overview 
Digital Realty is a real estate investment trust engaged in the business of owning  acquiring  developing and operating data centers  Data centers are basically offsite server warehouses where companies store data  often accessible via  the cloud   As shown in the following table  DLR recently owned 182 data centers across the US and internationally 

DLR owns data centers across a variety of industries ranging from financial services  cloud and information technology services  to manufacturing  energy  healthcare and consumer products 
Digital Realty has delivered strong total returns  price appreciation  plus dividends  over the last 10 years  but has been underperforming over the last year  as shown in the following charts 


Four Fears Plaguing Digital Realty 
1  Rising interest rates are one of the market fears currently plaguing Digital Realty and contributing to its recent underperformance  As a REIT  Digital Realty relies on borrowing to fund growth  and as interest rates are expected to keep rising that makes borrowing more expensive  According to DLR s annual report 

 We have substantial debt and face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business activities  including refinancing and interest rate risks  

However  this risk is offset to some extent by the company s hedging program  and by the fact that if interest rates keep rising that means the economy is strong which will have a positive impact on DLR s business  Regarding hedging  here s what DLR had to say in its annual report 

 Approximately 90  of our total indebtedness as of December 31  2016  was subject to fixed interest rates or variable rates subject to interest rate swaps  

To a large extent  rising interest rates are already baked into DLR s price  which is part of the reason the shares have sold off  and it s the incremental changes to future interest rate expectations that will impact the share price in the future 
Importantly  DLR s business remains strong  which we will cover in more detail later in this report 
2  The false narrative that  income investing is going out of style  is another one of the fears plaguing Digital Realty  A recent review of market performance shows buyers have strongly preferred growth stocks over income securities in recent months  For example  here is a look at the  growthy  PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  and the Russell 1000 Growth Index vs  traditional income sectors  REITs and utilities 

The surge in growth stocks makes sense considering our booming economy  e g  strong GDP growth  low unemployment   but that doesn t mean defensive income sectors  e g  REITs  Utilities  are going out of style  Many of these companies  such as Digital Realty  continue to generate healthy income and cash flows  And from a contrarian standpoint  it s not usually a good idea for investors to chase after what has been performing the best in the recent past  e g  growth stocks  
3  Negative press also has plagued Digital Realty in recent months  Aside from the media pundits fawning all over growth stocks  back in September a prominent venture capitalist gave an overly negative outlook for data center REITs which drove the price lower 
 
Keep in mind  West Coast venture capitalists are usually more interested in finding the next unicorn  which is a different investment objective altogether  than they are in generating safe steady growing income 
4  Conflicting financials are another fear that has been plaguing DLR  Specifically  DLR has been completing a lot of investment activity that s made its non core FFO numbers look  lumpy  and lower than the company s true cash generation power  The big one was on September 14  2017 Digital Realty closed the acquisition of DuPont  NYSE DWDP  Fabros for about  7 9 billion  Other recent investments include land parcels in Japan and Texas  as well as an agreement to acquire 19 acre data center in Franklin Park  Illinois  for  350 million  The point is that DLR reported a net loss last quarter  Q3  and standard FFO that was lower than the same quarter a year earlier  NOT because the company is in decline  but rather because it s been spending on attractive future growth opportunities  This is why it s important for investors to focus on core FFO  which adjusts for non core activities  and core FFO has been growing  and is expected to keep growing  which is a big part of the reason we like Digital Realty  More growth  a safe dividend  and an attractive price  Digital Realty is expected to announce earnings again on February 15 
Three Reasons We Like Digital Realty 
1  A powerful secular trend is one of the reasons we like Digital Realty  Specifically  data centers  especially including DLR  are benefiting from a huge secular growth trend  i e  companies are moving their data into the cloud  and the amount of data companies need to store is expected to continue increasing rapidly   Data centers will benefit from enormous growth in artificial intelligence  autonomous vehicles  the Internet of Things  IoT   and virtual reality  to name a few 

And DLR expects these trends to benefit its EBITDA positively 

2  Attractive valuation is another reason we like Digital Realty  Specifically  the market appears to not be pricing in the company s expected growth  as described above  For example  DLR recently provided 2018 Core Funds from Operations  Core FFO  per share guidance of  6 45  6 60  which is 8  year over year growth   and the shares still only traded at only 16 2 times 2018 Core FFO  which is a very conservative number  in our view  considering the continuing long term growth potential   For perspective  at the midpoint of last year  DLR was trading at 18 7 times forward core FFO guidance  and despite the fact that core FFO guidance has been raised  the share price and multiple are both now lower 
3  A safe growing dividend is another reason we like Digital Realty  For starters  DLR currently has a dividend yield of 3 4   and this yield is very well covered  For example  the bottom line in the following table shows DLR s adjusted FFO payout ratio is only around 68   which leaves plenty of room for cushion  i e  the dividend is very well covered  

Also  DLR management is committed to a secure and growing dividend  and the company has a history of delivering 

And based on the current low dividend payout ratio  plus growth opportunities  we believe the dividend is likely to keep increasing in the future  Remember  DLR has been spending heavily on investments for growth  and these opportunities will literally help pay bigger dividends in the future 
Final Thoughts 
If you are looking for a high risk high reward stock that could triple in value over the next six months  Digital Realty is NOT for you  But if you are looking for safe  steady  growing income  along with the potential for healthy price appreciation  we believe Digital Realty is worth considering for a spot within your diversified investment portfolio ",2018-01-28,Blue Harbinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/digital-realty-despite-fear-mongers-dividend-price-will-rise-200284251,200284251

192897,414413,DD,5 DuPont Tested Winning Stocks,opinion,"Return on equity  ROE  is one of the most favored metrics of investors  It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity  Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock 
However  stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns  Here is where the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  analysis comes into play It is an analytical method  which examines three major elements   operating management  management of assets and the capital structure   related to the financial condition of a company  Below we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierImportance of Du PontAlthough one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of 16 stocks that made it through the screen  Incidentally  each of these sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

192906,414422,DD,Incoming BASF boss rules out DowDuPont style break up,news,"By Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss FRANKFURT  Reuters    The incoming boss of BASF  DE BASFn  has thrown his weight behind the chemical titan s contentious strategy of keeping divergent businesses folded into one company  at a time when its major rivals such as DowDuPont are breaking themselves up  The comments from Martin Brudermueller  who will take over as CEO on Friday  provide clarity on a key strategic issue that is dividing investors  in marked contrast to predecessor Kurt Bock who would not be drawn on which path he favored   The German group has grown from a 19th century indigo dye workshop to a diversified juggernaut worth  95 billion  It is the only major Western chemicals player banking on an integrated value chain   which it dubs  Verbund    where a company owns businesses throughout the production process    We often hear the Verbund getting criticized for being too rigid  That s not true   said 56 year old Brudermueller    If you have everything under one roof  you can coordinate things much better  that is the sense in which we will develop it further  You wouldn t normally want to sell attractive businesses that are growing   he told Reuters and other reporters in remarks released late on Tuesday   At its Ludwigshafen headquarters and at five other hubs abroad  BASF runs close knit networks of chemical reactors that churn out products as diverse as basic commodities  coatings  vitamins  drug ingredients and engineering plastics  Bock  when asked in February whether BASF would continue to have diverse businesses under one roof or was considering other options  said the company might learn from what rivals did but did not say which path he favored  Both strategies have potential advantages  break ups can create more focused individual companies and allow stronger units to attract investors unshackled from weaker ones  while an integrated model can reduce costs  U S  rival DowDuPont  N DWDP  is planning to break up into a Materials Science division that relies on in house basic petrochemicals plants and a Specialty Products unit selling more differentiated and complex materials  A third spin off will focus on agriculture  In other recent separation deals in the industry  Bayer  DE BAYGn  spun off its Covestro plastics unit and is now selling down the shares  Air Products spun off specialty chemicals unit Versum  N VSM  and coatings group  Akzo Nobel   AS AKZO  is selling its specialty chemicals division   SHAREHOLDERS SPLIT BASF competes with DowDuPont in areas such as pesticides  engineering plastics  nutrition  insulation foams and petrochemicals  Its rival s three way split will restore BASF s position as the world s largest chemical maker but some investors and analysts would rather see it lose that crown  Patrick Jahnke  portfolio manager at Deka Investments  which owns BASF stock  said he favored the firm selling its upstream petrochemical assets  saying the benefits of physical proximity to downstream operations could be shared with a new owner   You can sell the assets but the factory remains in place   Jahnke said   There are many who would pay a high price  for upstream BASF assets   Private equity would run the business with higher debt and optimized for cash flows and would arrive at a better profitability   he added  Upstream refers to basic petrochemicals  and downstream to more complex specialty chemicals  A portfolio manager at a top 20 BASF shareholder  who declined to be named as they are not authorized to comment publicly on the investment  also saw the merits of a break up   Downstream  speciality chems could work separately   the manager said   To de clutter and reduce complexity     tends to increase multiples and returns  but German companies are not well known for it   BASF has said that sharing logistics  excess energy and by products within its chemical complexes saves it more than 1 billion euros   1 2 billion  per year  There are also supporters of the integrated approach among BASF s shareholders   Arne Rautenberg  of Union Investment  said there was still a lot of value in the model   The results this year wouldn t have been good without the basic chemicals assets   he said  Any move to separating them from the rest  would very much surprise me and I wouldn t be excited   he added   TALE OF TWO SECTORS BASF has been a tale of two sectors over the past year  Supply bottlenecks at rivals and strong industrial demand have flung BASF s basic chemicals business into a surprise upward cycle  Meanwhile  margins of its more complex  specialty products  the group s designated growth drivers  have been squeezed by higher raw materials prices    If upstream strength dissipates and the downstream margin struggles continue  then we think investor focus will turn to portfolio questions   HSBC analyst Sriharsha Pappu said in a recent research note  If allowed to strike out on their own  BASF units making construction chemicals  coatings and catalytic converters could bolster their earnings and fetch better trading multiples on the stock market  the HSBC analyst said   Brudermueller  a BASF veteran  is currently chief technology officer and deputy CEO at the firm  which is due to report first quarter results on Friday  He said that his focus would be on new technologies after taking over from CEO Bock  who by contrast had been the company s finance chief before taking the helm and has a background in business administration   The CEO

192908,414424,DD,Materials ETFs Head To Head  XLB Vs  IYM,opinion,"The materials sector is garnering a lot of investor attention lately  Industrial Metals have been rebounding on greater global optimism  This is primarily due to robust global growth cues and strong demand  Manufacturing has been picking up pace globally and driving demand for metals 
Cause for Appeal
On Oct 19  the Senate passed a budget of  4 trillion in a 51 49 vote  which will allow the Republicans to move ahead with the tax cuts with a simple majority instead of the 60 vote supermajority that is generally required  Moreover  this has increased investor optimism about President Donald Trump delivering on his promises of greater infrastructure spending  which is expected to give a boost to the materials sector  read    
Per the Commerce department  construction spending increased 0 3  in September on a monthly basis to  1 22 trillion  It grew 2  on a year over year basis 
Moreover  strong earnings performance has contributed to gains in the sector  U S  economic fundamentals seem to be strong  GDP increased 3  annually in the July September period compared with a 3 1  increase in the third quarter 
Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector 
Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF 
This fund seeks to provide exposure to materials stocks and tracks the Materials Select Sector Index  It has AUM of  4 4 billion and charges a moderate fee of 14 basis points a year  It has 25 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as over 68 7  of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings 
From a sector look  the fund has high exposure to Chemicals  Containers   Packaging and Metals   Mining  with 72 9   13 2  and 9 2  exposure  respectively  as of Sep 30  2017   The fund s top three holdings are DowDuPont Inc    NYSE DWDP    Monsanto Co    NYSE MON   and Praxair Inc   NYSE PX   with 22 9   8 0  and 6 5  allocation  respectively  as of Nov 7  2017    The fund has returned 26 4  in a year and 18 0  year to date  as of Nov 7  2017   XLB has a Zacks ETF Rank  3  Hold  with a Medium risk outlook 
iShares U S  Basic Materials ETF 
This fund seeks to provide exposure to materials stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U S  Basic Materials Index  It has AUM of  967 3 million and charges a fee of 44 basis points a year  It has 50 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as over 66 5  of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings 
From a sector look  the fund has high exposure to Diversified Chemicals  Specialty Chemicals and Fertilizers   Agricultural Chemicals  with 28 6   22 7  and 12 7  exposure  respectively  as of Nov 6  2017   The fund s top three holdings are DowDuPont Inc   Monsanto Co  and Praxair Inc with 24 2   7 8  and 6 2  allocation  respectively  as of Nov 6  2017   The fund has returned 28 7  in a year and 19 3  year to date  as of Nov 7  2017   IYM has a Zacks ETF Rank  3 with a High risk outlook 
Bottom Line
XLB is more popular than IYM  as is evident from its higher AUM  Moreover  it also may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio   However  IYM has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings 
Moreover  both the funds have had relatively similar year to date performance  IYM returned 1 3  more than XLB so far this year whereas in a year  IYM outperformed XLB by 2 3   With growing developments in the sector  these ETFs are poised to offer great growth potential  However  since the factors driving growth in this sector are still exposed to a great deal of uncertainty  a more popular ETF like XLB might help alleviate some of the political uncertainties prevailing in the region

192918,414434,DD,Tarnished  Olympic brand mints money like never before,news,"By Karolos Grohmann and Liana B  Baker PYEONGCHANG  South Korea  Reuters    A long running Russian doping scandal  Corruption scams  Major cities say  no  to staging the Olympics Games  If the International Olympic Committee  IOC  were a publicly traded company  its stock might be struggling to stay afloat in a sea of damaging headlines  Instead  it has never been in better financial health  thanks increasingly to enduring and growing support from Asia    from the region s sponsors  governments  cities and sports fans  The IOC s revenue from broadcast rights  its main income source  is setting records  touching  2 87 billion at the Rio summer Games in 2016  up 12 percent from London 2012  and is set to reach new heights at the Tokyo Games in 2020  Its top sponsor program  which made up a fifth of its revenues in 2013 16  topped  1 billion for the first time between Russia s 2014 Sochi winter Games and Rio 2016  two of the most challenging events for the Olympics brand  Sochi  which cost around  50 billion  was a symbol of Olympics over spending and is also now synonymous with alleged systematic Russian doping  Rio was hit by a ticket scalping and corruption investigations involving senior Olympic officials  But in interviews at the Pyeongchang winter Games  executives betting on the Olympic brand say they do not lose sleep over the scandals  Unlike misbehaving athletes who can lose sponsors overnight  the brand is  resilient   some say  Sponsors say their customers simply don t care that much   I haven t seen any evidence that the brand has taken negative hits   said Louis Vega  vice president of Olympic and sports solutions for Dow  N DWDP   an IOC top sponsor  Sponsors  comments and the IOC s swelling coffers contrast with some experts who doubt that the value of the Olympics brand can withstand the barrage of bad publicity and a drop in interest among Western cities in staging the Games  Andrew Zimbalist  economist at Smith College in Massachusetts and a former adviser to a  No Olympics  campaign in Boston  says sponsors understand this but won t admit it   The fact that the current Olympic sponsors assert that the brand is strong indicates little   he said   Why would a company that has invested tens of millions of dollars in building its association with the Olympics do anything to diminish the IOC s image  Doing so would just devalue its investment   The willingness of host cities to spend heavily to put on a huge spectacle continues to underpin the IOC s business model  even under its new  sustainable  Games policy  Agenda 2020  But fewer cities want to take the risk  Paris  awarded the 2024 Games after Agenda 2020 came into effect  has budgeted 6 8 billion euros   8 4 billion   It emerged the winner only after four rival bidders quit  Boston  Rome  Hamburg and Budapest  In Asia  by contrast  cities are still stepping forward  to the relief of the IOC and sponsors  By the Beijing winter Games in 2022  three straight Olympics will have been held in Asia  and Japan s Sapporo is a contender for the 2026 winter Games   Asia is opening itself up to the world more and more and there is a logic that sport as part of society is also following this trend   IOC president Thomas Bach told Reuters   For a graphic on Olympic financials  click    OFF THE CHARTS  Though the IOC s most valuable broadcast rights are still for the United States  held by NBC  and for Europe  held by Discovery Communications  O DISCA   U S  TV audiences dipped at the Rio Games after a long  steady climb  NBC Sports data shows  However NBC  a unit of Comcast Corp  O CMCSA   says the U S  ratings reflect a shift from TV to online consumption  which is an emerging source of ad income  NBC says it made  250 million in profits from Rio  double its earnings from London  In Japan  opening ceremony ratings for broadcaster NHK show a pickup in viewers between the summer Games of Athens 2004 and Rio 2016  In the Kanto area  which includes Tokyo  a quarter of households watched the Rio ceremony  up from 17 percent in 2004  The Tokyo 2020 Games has already accumulated almost three times as much domestic sponsorship as London 2012 or Rio  with a current total of about  3 billion   The sponsor demand to partner with the Tokyo 2020 Games inparticular has been unprecedented and off the charts   said Michael Lynch  global head of consulting at Nielsen Sports  Entertainment  which works with Olympic sponsors  China is the biggest Asian market for Olympic viewers  but Chinese rights holder CCTV did not reply to requests for data  Asian companies are also gradually replacing U S  names on the IOC s top sponsorship program  which now includes Chinese Internet giant  Alibaba   N BABA   Japanese tire maker Bridgestone  T 5108  and Japanese carmaker Toyota Corp  T 7203   Five of the IOC s 13 top sponsors are from Asia  including longer standing partners Samsung  KS 005930  and Panasonic  T 6752   The top program began with two Asian firms in 1985  a few years after the IOC went close to going broke   The Asia play is very important to us  Korea and China are two very big emerging markets and our home country is in Japan  so the Asia swing is very good for Bridgestone   Bridgestone s vice president for sports and events marketing in the Americas  Phil Pacsi  told Reuters  DOUBLE EDGED SWORD The Games  growing ties to Asia present complications for the IOC  however  especially in the U S  market  The United States has not hosted a Games since Salt Lake City in 2002 and NBC  whose parent spent more than  12 billion to hold U S  rights from 2014 2032  faces a long wait before the next U S  Games are held in Los Angeles in 2028  The U S  Olympic Committee lost several domestic sponsors ahead of the Pyeongchang Games  the first in the run of three straight Asia hosted Games  For now  the IOC  which says it uses 90 percent of its income to fund sports globally  is in strong financial shape and counting increasingly on Asia to keep it that way  
 It is still a very valuable property for us regardless of the political situation going on around them   said Iain Jamieson  South Korea manager for Visa  N V   a top IOC sponsor ",2018-02-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/tarnished-olympic-brand-mints-money-like-never-before-1268698,1268698

192921,414437,DD,Digital Realty  DLR  Q3 Earnings  What s In The Offing ,opinion,Digital Realty Trust  Inc    NYSE DLR   is scheduled to release third quarter 2017 results on Oct 25  after the market closes Last quarter  this San Francisco  CA based date center real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 3 36   Results were supported by growth in revenues Over the trailing four quarters  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions  met estimates in the other  and missed in another  with an average beat of around 1 18   This is depicted in the graph below  Digital Realty Trust  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for Digital Realty prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderData center REITs are experiencing a boom market amid growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increasing number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure  This has been driving demand which is outpacing supply in top tier data center markets  Therefore  despite enjoying high occupancy  the top tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace Additionally  improved outlook for economic growth is anticipated to fuel demand for data centers  Amid these  Digital Realty s focus on offering upgraded technology to entice clients is likely to bolster its revenue stream in the to be reported quarter   In addition to this  the company is expected to ride on its growth curve backed by strategic acquisitions  In fact  it acquired Telx in October 2015 and a portfolio of eight high quality  carrier neutral data centers in Europe  Amsterdam  Frankfurt and London  in July 2016  We expect such diligent efforts to drive the company s top line in the quarter to be reported Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter revenues is currently pegged at  593 2 million  indicating projected growth of around 8 6  year over year Also  in September  the company announced the completion of a merger with DuPont  NYSE DWDP  Fabros  This buyout helped the company reinforce its hyper scale product offering and widen its blue chip customer base Nevertheless  Digital Realty faces stiff competition in the industry  In fact  the company competes with several data center developers  owners and operators  many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in regions same as Digital Realty  Amid this  aggressive pricing pressure is likely to sustain in the data center market  while robust growth in occupancy is anticipated to remain elusive Hence  prior to the third quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations  FFO  per share for the third quarter remained unchanged at  1 49 over the past week However  Digital Realty s shares have rallied 25 6  year to date  outperforming 3 4  growth recorded by the  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Digital Realty

192934,414450,DD,Selecting The Best Put Strike Based On Overall Market Assessment ,opinion,"Selling cash secured puts requires us to master the three required skills  stock  or ETF  selection  option selection and position management  This article will highlight how to select a put strike based on our overall market assessment 
Market assessment data published in BCI newsletters
Investor Business Daily s market assessment

BCI market assessment
Each investor must establish criteria for determining market tone and categorize this parameter as bullish  neutral or bearish 
Pros and cons of various put strikes
For most of us who use puts to generate monthly  or weekly  cash flow or to buy stocks at a discount  we focus in on out of the money put strikes  These are strike prices lower than current market value  In addition to generating put premium income  we will also have downside protection if share price should decline  Near the money  slightly below current market value  will generate the highest initial premium returns but give us the smallest amount of downside protection  These should be favored in neutral to bull market environments  Deeper out of the money put strikes  much lower than current market value  should be considered in bear or volatile market scenarios 
We must first set a range for initial premium returns  Let s say our range for initial returns is from 1 4  per month  To evaluate a real life example  I have selected Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   a stock on our Premium Stock List as of 5 17 2017 
Options chain for AMAT as of 5 17 2017

With AMAT trading at  43 56 on 5 17 2017  we view the out of the money  43 00   42 00   41 00 and  40 00 strikes  The published bid prices range from  1 42 to  0 48 per share  Note that the bid ask spreads are small so negotiating with the market makers by leveraging the Show or Fill Rule does not apply here  The deeper out of the money we go  the lower the option premium  Next  we enter this information into the  
Put calculations for AMAT as of 5 17 2017

Let s focus in on the two extremes  the  43 00 closest to the money strike and the  40 00 furthest from the money strike 
 43 00 put strike
This strike generates an unexercised return of 3 42  or 41 55  annualized  If exercised  shares are purchased at a cost basis of  41 58 or a 4 55  discount from the original price of  43 56 
 40 00 put strike
This strike generates an unexercised return of 1 21  or 14 78  annualized  If exercised  shares are purchased at a cost basis of  39 52 or a 9 27  discount from the original price of  43 56 
Matching strikes with market assessment
In a bull market environment  we would favor the  43 00 which yields a higher unexercised return  With a positive market tone  shares are less likely to move below the strike  In a bear market  we would favor the  40 00 strike where share value would have to decline by more than 9 27  before we start losing money  View these decisions as a negotiation where we base our choices on the tone of the market at the time  We can adjust on a monthly basis  Chart technical will also play a role in our bullish bearish strike price decisions

192940,414456,DD,Protein plight  Brazil steals U S  soybean share in China,news,By Karl Plume CHICAGO  Reuters    U S  soybean growers are losing market share in the all important China market because the race to grow higher yielding crops has robbed their most prized nutrient  protein  Declining protein levels make soybeans less valuable to the  400 billion industry that produces feed for cattle  pigs  chickens and fish  And the problem is a key factor driving soybean buyers from the U S  to Brazil  where warmer weather helps offset the impact of higher crop yields on protein levels  A decade ago  the United States supplied 38 percent of soybeans to China  the world s top importer  compared to 34 percent from Brazil  Now  Brazil supplies 57 percent of Chinese imports compared to 31 from the United States  according to China s General Administration of Customs  Soybeans are by far the most valuable U S  agricultural export  with  22 8 billion in shipments in 2016  Declining protein levels and market share pose another vexing problem for soy farmers already reeling from a global grains glut and years of depressed prices  The U S  soybean industry also faces rising competition from a growing number of synthetic and organic alternative feeds that provide more protein for less money  These are troubling trends for the  41 billion U S  soybean sector  but the industry s response has yet to take on much urgency  That s because the erosion of protein levels has come over many years  and many industry players still have short term economic incentives to prioritize higher yields over higher protein   For graphic on soybean yield  protein content and market share  see    Protein levels have fallen as biotechnology and other breeding advances have pushed yield per acre to record highs  which dilutes protein content  But U S  farmers can still make more money producing higher volumes of lower protein crops because they only get an additional 3 to 5 cents a bushel for higher protein beans  Over the long term  however  falling protein levels could have dire consequences for the U S  industry as a whole   especially in China  which buys two thirds of all soybeans traded in the world market to feed its vast livestock operations   China needs soybeans  and we re at risk of becoming a residual supplier if we don t work on protein improvements   said North Dakota farmer Jared Hagert  a director and past chairman of the United Soybean Board  USB   an industry association  HIGHER YIELDS  LOWER PROTEIN The USB and other industry advocates are starting to take the protein problem seriously  The industry group will spend  5 6 million in fiscal year 2018 on research and other efforts to boost protein  up from  3 7 million last year  They face a tough task  Like many farmers  the agribusiness giants that develop seed technology  such as  Monsanto   NYSE MON  Co and DowDuPont Inc  have little incentive to focus on raising protein levels   Seed developers have had great success boosting yields through traditional breeding methods and genetic engineering to make crops use less water  tolerate weed killers and grow better in colder or drier climates  But they have yet to crack the genetic code that would raise protein content without hurting yield  seed breeders said  At DowDuPont  scientists have identified some promising leads in boosting protein without hurting crop yields  said Steve Schnebly  senior research manager with the agriculture division of DowDuPont  But any commercially viable solution could be two decades away  he said  and isn t a company priority    Our major objective to our farmer customers is maximum yield   Schnebly said  Monsanto  the world s largest seed producer  currently has no genetic research projects focusing on elevating protein  spokeswoman Christi Dixon said in a written statement   Market potential and demand doesn t warrant the R D investment   she said  The protein decline coincides with a rise of cheaper and more abundant alternative feeds available to livestock and poultry producers  They include distillers grains  a byproduct of the ethanol production process  and synthetic amino acids that are mixed with corn to mimic soymeal  Jeff Knott  a swine nutrition consultant and owner of Minnesota based Ideal Animal Nutrition  creates recipes with such alternatives for hog feed used by producers in several Midwest states   Compared to 20 years ago  we re probably feeding 70 percent less soybean meal than we used to   he said   And it s all economically driven   LOWER PROTEIN  LOWER EXPORTS Brazilian soybean producers use the same genetically modified seeds as their U S  counterparts  and have also seen a reduction in protein content   But Brazilian growers retain an crucial edge in protein thanks to warmer weather and longer days  The nation s soybeans contain 37 percent protein on average  according to data from Embrapa  the government s agriculture research agency  That compares to 34 1 percent for U S  crops in 2017   a record low  according to the U S  Soybean Export Council  The protein shortfall in this season s crop has prompted U S  processors such as Bunge Ltd to cut the amount of protein they can guarantee in soymeal they sell  Brazil s three percentage point protein advantage is plenty enough to sway many buyers  especially when combined with the nation s recent efforts to expand production and reduce shipping delays  Since overtaking the United States as the world s top soybean exporter in 2013  Brazil has boosted production by about 40 percent  Expanded port capacity in northern Brazil and lower freight costs have widened the country s advantage in China  said a Brazilian trader with a large exporting company   Brazil s soybeans on average have less impurities and higher protein content   said the trader  who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly   Some destinations will pay a premium for that   Protein is paramount for Chinese importers  two managers at soy crushing plants and one soy meal buyer at a pig producer told Reuters in interviews   Feed producers mainly consider the cost of the soy meal   the price  and the amount of protein it contains   said a swine feed buyer who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak   With more supplies from Brazil     we don t necessarily need to buy beans from the U S   SCRAMBLING FOR SOLUTIONS  The United Soybean Board has launched a pilot project at a small number of processors and grain elevators   facilities that store and load grain for shipping   to record and analyze the protein content of soybeans delivered by local farmers   The effort aims to provide highly localized data in the hope that farmers will select seed varieties that produce higher protein crops and that soybean buyers will pay them a premium  Other USB efforts include financing genetics research to boost protein  including studies by researchers at the University of Illinois and by scientists at DuPont  NYSE DWDP  Pioneer   We ve got to be cognizant as to what kind of product we are providing the end user   said Hagert  the USB director  Another study   conducted by the University of Wisconsin and paid for by the Illinois Soybean Association and the U S  Soybean Export Council   suggests that farmers can better compete with synthetic alternatives by planting beans with a specific amino acid balance  Such soybeans can save hog feeders up to  3 a head and save chicken producers 7 cents a bird  said the study s lead author  John Osthus   Right now  there are synthetic amino acid companies that are undermining U S  market share   Osthus said   If we don t do something about this  we re missing a huge market opportunity

192943,414459,DD,Trump Passes Order To Fix U S  Infrastructure  ETFs In Focus,opinion,"President Donald Trump s most recent activity involves passing an executive order aimed at reducing restrictions and regulatory burden in order to speed up infrastructure projects 
This revokes an Obama era rule aimed at imposing strict reviews of projects in flood prone areas in order to battle sea level rise and flooding  The Obama era rule required scientific factoring of how infrastructure projects would withstand floods and rise in sea level  Eliminating this rule means focusing on short term gains and ignoring long term outlook 
Although Trump has promised not to pass projects that might pose a threat to the environment  this order should not be a shocker given his take on climate change 
In a move toward his vow of spending  1 trillion on public and private infrastructure  Trump s most recent order would speed approvals for roads  bridges  highways etc  Trump s administration proposes  200 billion in government funding over a period of 10 years  as he works towards making his investment plan a reality 
Trump has repeatedly compared U S  infrastructure to that of a third world country  He also added that the defeat of the healthcare bill will not be a drain on his confidence for passing the infrastructure policies 
Many environmentalists and flood experts have criticized this order  as it is not only a threat to the environment  but also might be a drag on taxpayer money relating to flood related damage control  Per an article on   an estimated  260 billion has been spent on flood control between 1980 and 2013   
However  the order is expected to bode well for companies in the Materials sector  These companies can expect a surge in demand as infrastructure projects expedite and spending increases  read

192949,414465,DD,Pure Play Oklahoma Junior Surrounded By Majors In The Stack ,opinion,"A growth oriented oil junior that is acquiring acreage in a red hot area of Oklahoma paid a fraction of what its neighboring majors are paying 

Jericho Oil Corp  V JCO   JROOF OTC   a growth oriented oil and gas company based in Tulsa  Oklahoma   recently that it is acquiring an interest in 9 400 net surface acres in the Anadarko Basin STACK in Oklahoma  STACK  a major area of energy development interest in Oklahoma  stands for Sooner Trend Anadarko basin Canadian and Kingfisher counties 
The company has the option to invest up to  9 million in acquisition and development capital to acquire just under one third of the joint venture that owns the assets 
Jericho Oil  the following features of the joint venture 
8 600 net Mississippian acres in the normally pressured oil window of the play
Significant high quality resource potential with unrisked inventory of more than 160 locations
Implied acreage value of USD 2 300 net Mississippian acre adjusting for proved developed producing  PDP  reserves
Acreage position surrounded by substantial drilling and pooling activity targeting the Meramec and Osage formations from Alta Mesa  Chesapeake  Sandridge  Gastar as well as multiple private equity backed operators
Aligns with strategy to generate attractive returns at sub  50 bbl
The joint venture was able to acquire the rights at a much lower cost than many of its neighbors  its implied acreage acquisition cost of  2 300 net Mississippian acre adjusted for PDP compares to as much as  15 000  20 000 per acre that major players have paid in this area of the STACK 
Jericho CEO Brian Williamson told Streetwise Reports that its acreage is 

Sandwiched between several best in case  sizable independents  including the likes of Alta Mesa Holdings  AMR NASDAQ   Marathon Oil Corp   NYSE MRO NYSE   Sandridge Energy Inc  NYSE SD   Newfield Exploration Company  NYSE NFX   Continental Resources Inc  NYSE CLR   Gastar Exploration  NYSE GST  and Chesapeake Energy Corp   NYSE CHK NYSE   which trade at much higher multiples for their STACK acreage values 

Most analysts believe that the price of oil will remain well under  100 barrel for the foreseeable future  Williamson commented 

The things we are seeing suggest that the STACK and our acreage in particular can be developed profitably with oil in the  30 35 bbl price range 

The land was drilled with conventional vertical wells in the 1950s and 1960s  but the continuing evolution of development technology has made it possible to access much more oil  The company believes that historical wells may have extracted as little as 10  of the oil 
Technical analyst Clive Maund noted on August 4 that 

This relatively young company has taken advantage of the weakness of the oil price in the last several years to buy up good properties and wells  and most of the stock is tightly held by investors who are in for the long haul  It is also highly geared to the oil price on the upside 

Maund noted 

Jericho s structure is truly unique and gives the company a tremendous advantage  Its biggest shareholders and supporters are large U S  family offices  including some very successful oil industry veterans  Having patient money with deep pockets has really allowed it to develop its strategy successfully  If you do a little digging through the filings of insiders you will see that the Breen Family Trust whose patriarch is Ed Breen  the CEO of DuPont  NYSE DWDP   was an early investor and great supporter 

Maund commented on Sept  4 that since he highlighted Jericho s fundamentals a month ago 

It has broken out into a new intermediate uptrend and advanced  without any help from the oil price  which has been falling  and despite announcing another significant funding this funding  which is for an Oklahoma Stack acquisition  was enthusiastically taken up and had virtually no impact on the share price 

Maund concluded Jericho Oil 

is considered to be one of the best oil investments around  so holders should stay long and new purchases are in order at this juncture  The stock trades in light but generally adequate volumes on the US OTC market  where liquidity is expected to improve as the price advances

192967,414483,DD,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Dow Chemical  DuPont  Syngenta  Albemarle And Monsanto,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL  July 26  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Chemicals  Part 2  including Dow Chemical  NYSE        DuPont  NYSE DD   NYSE       Syngenta  NYSE        Albemarle Corp  s  NYSE       and Monsanto Company  NYSE MON   NYSE       

	Industry  Chemicals  Part 2

	Link  

	The chemical industry is back in business after being stuck in limbo for a spell  making it an attractive investment proposition  The industry s upturn is expected to continue this year on continued momentum across major end markets 

	Despite a few industry related headwinds    weak demand across agricultural and energy markets and sluggishness in China    there are a number of reasons to be optimistic about the broader chemical industry for both the short and long haul  Let s find out what s supporting the bullish case for chemical stocks 

Shale Bounty   Driving Force for Chemical Spending

	The shale gas revolution in the U S  has been a huge driving force behind chemical investment on plants and equipment in the country  According to the American Chemistry Council   ACC    the U S  has emerged as an attractive investment location and petrochemical makers are now significantly expanding capacity in the country  leveraging new supplies of natural gas  New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  are boosting shale production  bringing down prices of ethane  derived from shale gas  in the process 

	The shale boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies to pump in billions of dollars for setting up facilities  crackers  in the U S  to produce ethylene and propylene in a cost effective way  Per the ACC  310 new chemical projects have been already announced by chemical makers worth around  185 billion that are under construction or planned  Such investments    many backed by Federal government support    are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years 

Rebound in Construction

	A recovery across housing and commercial construction    major chemical end markets    has been another supporting factor for the chemical industry recovery  After being hit hard in the recession  the construction sector has bounced back on the back of healthy housing fundamentals 

	Recent housing data has been fairly upbeat with U S  housing starts scaling a four month high in June  buoyed by a rise in both single family and multi family construction  Per the Commerce Department  housing starts climbed 8 3  to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1 22 million units in June  the highest level since Feb 2017  Single family starts rose 6 3  while construction of multi family homes shot up 13 3   Building permits  a proxy for future construction  also went up 7 4  for the month  These strong data paint an upbeat picture for U S  homebuilding moving ahead 

	The renewal of long stalled construction projects and long awaited access to credit from lending institutions has also helped invigorate the commercial construction sector  U S  architecture firm billings continue to rise  The US Architecture Billings Index  ABI   an indicator that offers a glimpse into the future of U S  non residential construction spending activity  clocked 54 2 in June 2017  a reading above 50 indicates an increase in billings   up from 53 0 in May  Moreover  the American Institute of Architects  AIA  expects non residential construction spending to go up 3 8  in 2017 and 3 6  in 2018 

	Positives such as an improving economy  steady buyer demand  low unemployment levels  low interest rates and positive consumer confidence raise optimism about the construction sector s performance 

Healthy Automotive Demand

	Chemical makers continue to see healthy demand from the automotive sector    a major end use market  The last two years have been exceptional for the auto sector  Sales in the U S  saw record highs in both years  while sales in China and Europe also gained strength 

	U S  light vehicles  a key end user market for chemicals  had a strong run in 2016  supported by an improving job market  rising personal income  improved consumer confidence  low fuel prices and attractive financing options  While recent sales trends suggest that the automotive industry has peaked  it is still in good health 

	According to IHS Markit  global light vehicle sales are expected to increase 1 5  year over year to 93 5 million units in 2017  Moreover  IHS Markit sees U S  light vehicle sales to reach 17 4 million units in 2017    a slight moderation from the 2016 level of 17 5 million units  but still looks poised for another strong year 

	Low interest rates  favorable financing and cheap oil have also backed a recovery in the European auto market  The auto industry in Asian countries  especially China  is also expected to thrive over the next several years  This augurs well for chemical demand in this important end market 

A Resurgent European Economy

	The Eurozone economy has gained traction of late  as evident from recent upbeat economic data that suggest a recovery is steadily firming in the region  The European chemical industry has also swung back to life on the back of a rebounding Eurozone economy

192975,414491,DD,Digital Realty  DLR  To Post Q2 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,Digital Realty Trust  Inc    NYSE DLR   is slated to report second quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 27  after the market closes Last quarter  this San Francisco  CA based date center real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 2 04   Results were driven by growth in revenues Over the trailing four quarters  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions  met estimates in the other  and missed in another  with an average beat of around 1 44    This is depicted in the graph below Digital Realty Trust  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Digital Realty s shares have rallied 14 5  year to date  outperforming the  s gain of 3 3  Let s see how things are shaping up for Digital Realty prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderWith growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increasing number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure  data center REITs are experiencing a boom market  In fact  demand is outpacing supply in top tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy  the top tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace Moreover  improved outlook for economic growth is anticipated to drive demand for data centers  Amid these  Digital Realty s focus on offering upgraded technology to entice clients is likely to bolster its revenue stream in the to be reported quarter Additionally  the company is expected to ride on its growth curve backed by strategic acquisitions  In fact  it acquired Telx in Oct 2015 and a portfolio of eight high quality  carrier neutral data centers in Europe  Amsterdam  Frankfurt and London  in Jul 2016  We expect such strategic efforts to drive the company s top line in the quarter to be reported Notably  in Jun 2017  the company announced that it is set to acquire DuPont  NYSE DD  Fabros Technology  Inc    NYSE DFT   in an all stock transaction for an enterprise value of about  7 6 billion  The move would enhance Digital Realty s portfolio in top U S  data center metro areas across Northern Virginia  Chicago and Silicon Valley However  Digital Realty faces stiff competition in the industry  In fact  the company competes with several data center developers  owners and operators  many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in regions same as Digital Realty  Amid this  aggressive pricing pressure is likely to sustain in the data center market Furthermore  per the management  second and third quarter results are anticipated to reflect higher property tax accruals  increased general and administrative expense associated with promotions  merit increases and timing of stock grants  Apart from these  it would bear the impact of settlement of the residual 2 4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements the company entered into last May Hence  prior to the second quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to be reported quarter remained unchanged at  1 48 over the past seven days Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Digital Realty will beat estimates this season  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Digital Realty is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at  1 48  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Digital Realty s Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter Liberty Property Trust   NYSE LPT    slated to release second quarter results on Jul 25  has an Earnings ESP of  1 61  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  CyrusOne Inc    NASDAQ CONE    scheduled to release earnings on Aug 2  has a Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of  2 70  Note  All EPS numbers presented in this write up represent funds from operations   FFO   per share  FFO  a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs  is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non cash expenses to net income More Stock

193001,414517,DD,Special Report  Drowning in grain   How Big Ag sowed seeds of a profit slashing glut,news,"By Rod Nickel CARMAN  Manitoba  Reuters    On Canada s fertile Prairies  dominated by the yellows and golds of canola and wheat  summers are too short to grow corn on a major scale  But  Monsanto  Co  N MON  is working to develop what it hopes will be North America s fastest maturing corn  allowing farmers to grow more in Western Canada and other inhospitable climates  such as Ukraine  The seed and chemical giant projects that western Canadian corn plantings could multiply 20 times to 10 million acres by 2025   adding some 1 1 billion bushels  or nearly 3 percent to current global production  The question  amid historically high supplies and low grain prices  is whether the world really needs more corn  A global grains glut is now in its fourth year  with supplies bloated by favorable weather  increasingly high tech farm practices and tougher plant breeds  The bin busting harvests of cheap corn  wheat and soybeans are undermining the business models of the world s largest agriculture firms and the farmers who use their products and services  Some analysts say the firms have effectively innovated their way into a stubbornly oversupplied market  Never has the world produced so much more food than can be consumed in one season  World ending stocks of total grains   the leftover supplies before a new harvest   have climbed for four straight years and are poised to reach a record 638 million tonnes in 2016 17  according to USDA data  Farmers and agriculture firms could once count on periodic bouts of crop destroying weather to tame gluts and drive up prices  But genetically modified crops that repel plant chewing insects  withstand lethal chemicals and mature faster have made the trend toward oversupply more resistant to traditional boom and bust agrarian cycles  experts say  Another key factor  China   the world s second biggest corn grower   adopted stockpiling policies a decade ago when crop supplies ran thin  resulting in greater production than the world needs   I think the norm is where we are now   said Bryan Agbabian  director of agriculture equities at Allianz  DE ALVG  Global Investors  Allianz investors seem to agree  The value of two agriculture equity funds that Agbabian manages fell to  300 million this year from  800 million in 2011 as crop prices slid  he said  Abundant supplies have helped lower food prices across the world  but the benefit to consumers and impoverished nations is muted by several factors  including problems with corruption and distribution of food in developing regions  said Sylvain Charlebois  professor of food distribution and policy at Canada s Dalhousie University  The bumper harvests may actually harm poor communities more than they benefit their residents in food savings because lower prices depress farm incomes in the same areas  said John Baffes  a senior economist at the World Bank  Even as farmers reap bountiful harvests  U S  net farm incomes this year will total  63 4 billion   about half of their earnings in 2013  according to a U S  Department of Agriculture forecast  Lower incomes mean farmers cannot spend as much on seed  fertilizer and machinery  extending their pain to firms across the agriculture sector   Potash Corp of Saskatchewan   TO POT   the world s biggest fertilizer company by capacity  closed its newest potash mine last year  eliminating more than 400 jobs  and has seen its U S  listed shares fall by nearly half since the beginning of 2015  The drop erased  14 billion in value  and left Potash seeking to merge with rival  Agrium  Inc  TO AGU    With profits under pressure  seed and chemical companies are scrambling to consolidate  Monsanto s annual profit in 2016 was its smallest in six years  It agreed last year to combine with  Bayer AG   DE BAYGn   which would create the world s largest integrated pesticide and seed company if the deal closes next year   Grain handler  Bunge  Ltd  N BG  said this summer it would cut costs  and left the door open to selling itself after posting a 34 percent drop in quarterly earnings   Bunge CEO Soren Schroder sought to reassure investors in May by saying all that was needed to trim supplies was one bad stretch of weather in the U S  Midwest   But the glut pervades many major farming regions  making it unlikely that drought or floods in one region could wipe out the mounting global surplus  Even with dry conditions in North America  Europe and Australia  the U S  Department of Agriculture forecasts that this year will bring the second biggest global corn  wheat and soybean harvests ever   Bunge s Schroder made his comment about bad weather less than three weeks before confirming an informal merger approach from commodities giant  Glencore  Plc  L GLEN    When prices tanked  farmers were no longer willing to pay more  for seed and chemicals  said Jonas Oxgaard  analyst at investment management firm Bernstein   The mergers are absolutely driven by oversupply because their growth is gone   Monsanto spokeswoman Trish Jordan said the company believes demand growth still justifies corn expansion  and she disputed the notion that crop science advances are backfiring on agricultural technology firms  Monsanto rival DowDuPont Inc  N DWDP  is making the same bet and currently sells the shortest season field corn in North America  maturing in 70 days  spokesman Ali Aziz said  Success in the lab and the field  however  has contributed to oversupply and may continue to sustain it  said Oxgaard  the Bernstein analyst   It s somewhat the seed companies  fault   they keep breeding better and better seeds every year   he said    Exploding crop yields eat into farm profits  click    Grains glut guts global prices  click    DARWIN  SEX AND CORN Charles Darwin helped plant the seeds of the grain glut  The biologist and evolution theorist showed in the late 1800s that cross fertilization of plants   in which sex cells are fused between crop varieties of the same species   creates a more vigorous breed than those that are self fertilized   His work and others  influenced successive generations of crop scientists and led to the development of hybrid corn  said Stephen Moose  a professor specializing in crop genetics at University of Illinois  U S  farmers started planting the first significant acres of hybrid corn in the 1930s  and by 1950 it made up nearly all the corn seeded in the United States  Yields exploded  Farmers who reaped 20 5 bushels of corn per acre in 1930 harvested an average of 38 2 bushels in 1950  according to the U S  Department of Agriculture  Further hybrid breeding breakthroughs generated corn with leaves that grow more erect  allowing farmers to sow it more densely without starving plants of sunlight  Yields first topped 100 bushels per acre in 1978  After conventional breeding breakthroughs became harder to find  corn gained new vigor through the 1990s with genetic modification  In 1996  U S  regulators approved corn that was genetically engineered to produce bug killing proteins  accomplished by inserting a bacterium hostile to the corn borer insect into the plant genome  Before the end of the 1990s  corn able to resist weed killing chemical glufosinate or Monsanto s glyphosate hit the market  Those modified varieties and others that followed proved pivotal in generating the abundant corn crops that have since become commonplace  Moose said    In the seed industry  it stimulated a whole other round of investment   Moose said   In the 20 years since GMO corn reached U S  farms  yields jumped another 37 percent to a record 174 6 bushels per acre last year  Some experts believe the expansion of corn yields may soon hit a ceiling  The crop may be nearing the natural limit of its production potential  and crop yields will likely plateau in the next decade  based on how plants convert light to food and their ability to recover from heat  said Ken Cassman  agronomy professor at University of Nebraska Lincoln   Technology has also provided better defenses against pests   Syngenta  AG s  S SYNN  Viptera and Duracade traits  used to control worms and beetles  launched in 2010 and 2013  SmartStax corn seed  introduced by Monsanto and Dow in 2009  brought twin benefits of insect protection and herbicide tolerance  said Paul Bertels  vice president of production and sustainability at U S  based National Corn Growers Association  The breakthroughs in seed and pesticide technologies have not come without problems  Monsanto is now embroiled in a controversy over dicamba  a big selling chemical designed to kill weeds that harm Monsanto s genetically modified crops   Many U S  farmers say dicamba has drifted from its intended fields  damaging plants that are not resistant to the chemical  Monsanto believes the main causes of drifting are errors by farmers and applicators in deploying the herbicide  company spokeswoman Charla Lord said  GROWING CORN IN ALASKA As it grew stronger  corn grew faster  Corn that required 120 days to mature in the U S  Corn Belt during the 1960s now needs only 105 to 115 days  Farmers in northern North Dakota plant and harvest corn in 80 days  and have doubled the state s production in five years  Fast corn is now stirring even the imaginations of researchers in the far north   University of Alaska Fairbanks horticulture professor Meriam Karlsson grew hundreds of corn plants in the Arctic state in 2015   The plants  germinated in a greenhouse before they were transplanted outside  grew from a short season garden corn variety that matured in less than 60 days  Corn rose only four to five feet  allowing plants to spend maximum energy on growing ears  rather than leaves and stalks   Karlsson had expected few corn plants to survive in Fairbanks   less than 120 miles  190 kilometers  from the Arctic Circle   It s much more adaptable than I expected   she said   Amazing what breeding can do  It was kind of exciting that you could do it    The lure of technology comes down to money for farmers  Even with Chicago corn futures down more than 50 percent from their 2012 record high  the high yielding crop offers one of the strongest returns to Canadian farmers  generating profits per acre four times that of canola  based on average prices and costs  said National Bank analyst Greg Colman   As corn spreads across the Canadian Prairies  those robust yields are winning farmers over  said Dan Wright  Monsanto Canada s lead for corn and soybeans   Once you harvest corn at 140 or 180 bushels  it s something you want to do again   he said   While corn compares nicely to some crops  it offers U S  farmers marginal returns at current prices  Bernstein s Oxgaard said  Switching to other crops is not easy in areas like the U S  Midwest  where farmers traditionally swing between corn and soybeans  and have invested in costly equipment to grow them   GLUT TRACES ROOTS TO SHORTAGE The problems of plenty were on nobody s mind less than a decade ago  In 2008  a dramatic food price run up stirred riots from Haiti to Egypt  Four years later  the U S  Midwest  the engine of the global corn and soybean growing machine  suffered its worst drought in decades  opening gaping cracks in the soil and withering crops  Chicago corn and soybean futures  Cv1   hit record highs as U S  production fell to multi year lows  But high prices proved the cure for high prices  Farmers in traditionally less productive corn growing countries such as Russia  Argentina and Brazil expanded corn output to seize bigger profits   U S  farming quickly rebounded  reaping record corn harvests in three of the next four years   New corn varieties have made global production more balanced than ever  with 12 countries producing at least 10 million tonnes of corn annually  up from 10 before the drought  Even if U S  or Brazilian corn crops suffered major weather damage  the world would still have the expanding Black Sea corn region to tap  not to mention China s enormous supplies  said Bertels  of the U S  corn growers association  China s stockpiling policies  enacted in 2007 when corn supplies were tight  also stimulated oversupply  Aiming for self sufficiency in grains  Beijing bought virtually the entire domestic crop each year and paid farmers as much as 60 percent more than global prices  The program stuffed Chinese warehouses with some 250 million tonnes of corn by the time Beijing scrapped it last year  China is now boosting incentives for farmers to switch to soybeans from corn   The world s corn is mainly in China   said Li Qiang  chief consultant at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co Ltd   He said it will take three to four years for stocks to reach a  normal  level of around 40 50 million tonnes  The Black Sea region  made up of Russia  Ukraine and Kazakhstan  has become a disruptive force with rapidly expanding exports  Moscow aims to drive grain production to 150 million tonnes by 2030 from 117 million in 2016 after increasing storage and export capacity in ports in the last couple of years  Glut conditions are expected to ease modestly this year  amid dry conditions in China and the United States  but supplies are still so large that prices remain weak   OVERSUPPLY OF EVERYTHING In northern North Dakota  an expanding frontier for corn and soybeans  Paul Thomas started dabbling in both crops about a decade ago on his farm near Minot  seeking higher returns than wheat  Both are now among his biggest crops  including short season Monsanto corn varieties that have only been available for a couple of years   Profits may be tougher for Thomas to eke out this year due to dry weather and soft prices  but he shrugs off the struggle    We re very capable of producing a large amount of bushels given an economic incentive   he said   If we end up over producing  then we shift to one that s more in need  That s just the way agriculture works   Thomas acknowledged  however  that the traditional dynamic may be changing in this current glut   I don t know any single crop that isn t in oversupply   he said  Seeding equipment is becoming more precise  and increasingly cost conscious farmers are applying fertilizer and chemicals more intelligently  said Al Mussell  head of research at Canadian think tank Agri Food Economic Systems   Monsanto projects that corn will become by the mid 2020s one of the biggest crops produced in Canada  which is an agriculture exporting powerhouse in canola  wheat  oats and pork  Soybeans are also spreading across Canada  Farmers seeded a record high 7 3 million acres in 2017  up 75 percent in five years  On Monsanto s research farm in Carman  Manitoba  the next target is marketing a corn variety that matures in 70 days within the next two years  After that  an even quicker plant to snatch DowDuPont s claim to North America s fastest corn  It is ambitious but realistic  said Kelly Boddy  manager of Monsanto s research farm

193012,414528,DD,Exclusive  EPA eyes limits for agricultural chemical linked to crop damage,news,"By Tom Polansek and Emily Flitter  Reuters    The U S  environmental agency is considering banning sprayings of the agricultural herbicide dicamba after a set deadline next year  according to state officials advising the agency on its response to crop damage linked to the weed killer  Setting a cut off date  possibly sometime in the first half of 2018  would aim to protect plants vulnerable to dicamba  after growers across the U S  farm belt reported the chemical drifted from where it was sprayed this summer  damaging millions of acres of soybeans and other crops  A ban could hurt sales by  Monsanto  Co  N MON  and DuPont  NYSE DWDP  which sell dicamba weed killers and soybean seeds with Monsanto s dicamba tolerant Xtend trait  BASF  DE BASFn  also sells a dicamba herbicide  It is not yet known how damage attributed to the herbicides  used on Xtend soybeans and cotton  will affect yields of soybeans unable to withstand dicamba because the crops have not been harvested      The Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  discussed a deadline for next year s sprayings on a call with state officials last month that addressed steps the agency could take to prevent a repeat of the damage  four participants on the call told Reuters  It was the latest of at least three conference calls the EPA has held with state regulators and experts since late July dedicated to dicamba related crop damage and the first to focus on how to respond to the problem  participants said  A cut off date for usage in spring or early summer could protect vulnerable plants by only allowing farmers to spray fields before soybeans emerge from the ground  according to weed and pesticide specialists  Monsanto spokeswoman Christi Dixon told Reuters on Aug  23  the day of the last EPA call  that the agency had not indicated it planned to prohibit sprayings of dicamba herbicides on soybeans that had emerged  That action  would not be warranted   she said  The EPA had no immediate comment      EPA officials on the last call made clear that it would be unacceptable to see the same extent of crop damage again next year  according to Andrew Thostenson  a pesticide specialist for North Dakota State University who participated in the call  They said  there needed to be some significant changes for the use rules if we re going to maintain it in 2018   he said about dicamba usage  State regulators and university specialists from Arkansas  Missouri  Illinois  Iowa and North Dakota are pressuring the EPA to decide soon on rules guiding usage because farmers will make planting decisions for next spring over the next several months   Tighter usage limits could discourage cash strapped growers from buying Monsanto s more expensive dicamba resistant Xtend soybean seeds  Dicamba tolerant soybeans cost about  64 a bag  compared with about  28 a bag for Monsanto s Roundup Ready soybeans and about  50 a bag for soybeans resistant to Bayer s Liberty herbicide  Already  a task force in Arkansas has advised the state to bar dicamba sprayings after April 15 next year  which would prevent most farmers there from using dicamba on Xtend soybeans after they emerge  Arkansas previously blocked sales of Monsanto s dicamba herbicide  XtendiMax with VaporGrip  in the state       If the EPA imposed a April 15 cut off date for dicamba spraying  that would be catastrophic for Xtend   it invalidates the entire point of planting it   said Jonas Oxgaard  analyst for investment management firm Bernstein  Monsanto has projected its Xtend crop system would return a  5 to  10 premium per acre over soybeans with glyphosate resistance alone  creating a  400  800 million opportunity for the company once the seeds are planted on an expected 80 million acres in the United States  according to Oxgaard  By 2019  Monsanto predicts U S  farmers will plant Xtend soybeans on 55 million acres  or more than 60 percent of the total planted this year   RISKY DRIFT  About 3 1 million acres of soybeans vulnerable to dicamba were hurt by sprayings this summer  accounting for 3 5 percent of U S  plantings  according to the University of Missouri   Graphic    Chemical companies have blamed the crop damage on farmers misusing the herbicides   Specialists  though  say the weed killers are also risky because they have a tendency to vaporize and drift across fields  referred to as volatility  Summer can be a riskier time for sprayings  they said  because high temperatures can increase volatility  Monsanto previously denied requests by university researchers to study its XtendiMax herbicide for volatility  as previously reported by Reuters  In the end  the EPA gave dicamba weed killers from Monsanto and BASF abridged two year registrations  less than the five years experts say is more common  To address the crop damage  the EPA has also asked state officials about enhanced training for dicamba users  tighter restrictions on when and how the herbicides can be sprayed  and the possibility of reclassifying the products so the general public could not buy them  according to participants on the call    Everything is an option   said Jason Norsworthy  a University of Arkansas professor who was on the call       Monsanto Chief Technology Officer Robb Fraley said in a statement that the company was communicating with the EPA  which is  evaluating potential actions to facilitate enhanced training and compliance for 2018   DuPont  too  is working with the EPA and state regulators on issues involving its dicamba herbicide  FeXapan  spokeswoman Laura Svec said   Rival BASF  could see some label enhancements  to its dicamba herbicide  Engenia  if the EPA requires changes  spokeswoman Odessa Hines told Reuters  The company  will be as flexible as possible  so farmers can use the product  she said

193013,414529,DD,Monsanto fights to sell Arkansas farmers herbicide linked to crop damage,news,"By Tom Polansek CHICAGO  Reuters     Monsanto  Co  N MON  filed a petition on Thursday asking Arkansas agricultural officials to reject a proposed date next year that would end sprayings of the herbicide dicamba  which has been linked to crop damage across the U S  farm belt  A state task force recommended last month that Arkansas bar sprayings after April 15  2018  to protect plants vulnerable to the chemical  after farmers complained that soybeans and other crops were damaged when the weed killer drifted away from where it was sprayed this summer  The recommendation amounts to an  unwarranted and misinformed ban on dicamba  because the chemical is designed to be sprayed during the summer over genetically engineered crops  according to Monsanto   The deadline  is not based on scientific data  much less on any scientific consensus  about crop damage attributed to the chemical  the company said in a filing with the Arkansas State Plant Board  Monsanto  BASF  DE BASFn  and DuPont  NYSE DWDP  sell dicamba herbicides under different brand names to be sprayed on top of growing U S  soybeans and cotton modified by Monsanto to tolerate the weed killer   Chemical companies have blamed the damage on farmers misusing dicamba   Specialists  though  say the weed killers are risky because they have a tendency to vaporize and drift across fields  a process known as volatility  High temperatures can increase volatility  In July  Arkansas temporarily banned the use and sale of dicamba herbicides after farmers said the chemical was drifting off target   Monsanto  in its filing  said weed scientists who investigated the reports of damage from dicamba predicted it would probably not cause significant yield losses  The company also called into question the objectivity of Arkansas weed experts Jason Norsworthy and Ford Baldwin  whom Monsanto said advocated bans on dicamba  Monsanto said in its petition that Baldwin works as a paid consultant for Bayer Crop Science  which makes glufosinate  a competing herbicide  and that he is serving as a retained expert witness for plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Monsanto involving dicamba  With its petition  Monsanto submitted an affidavit from Baldwin stating that he works as a consultant for corporate clients including Bayer and endorses a competing weed control technology called glufosinate    Baldwin spoke at the first task force meeting in support of a statewide ban on dicamba herbicides in 2018   Monsanto said in its petition  Baldwin  a private weed consultant and former weed scientist for the University of Arkansas  told Reuters he did not speak in favor of the April 15 ban at the meeting  He declined further comment  Monsanto also included advertising literature on Bayer s LibertyLink product that quoted Norsworthy saying   The next best technology is already available in the LibertyLink system    Norsworthy  a University of Arkansas professor  could not immediately be reached for comment   Bayer  DE BAYGn   which is seeking to buy Monsanto for  66 billion  told Reuters that Baldwin and Norsworthy  are two of the preeminent weed scientists in the country    Their voices along with other scientists are critical to ensuring sound science that supports the regulatory system   Bayer spokesman Jeff Donald said  POSSIBLE LAWSUIT Monsanto s petition also requested the Arkansas plant board change its regulations to allow farmers in the state to use the company s dicamba weed killer  called XtendiMax with VaporGrip  on crops engineered to withstand it  in 2018 and beyond    Arkansas previously blocked XtendiMax herbicide because the company did not provide testing data that state officials wanted  The plant board said it had received Monsanto s petition and may consider the company s requests at meetings this month   Arkansas Gov  Asa Hutchinson has repeatedly encouraged the board to vet the science behind dicamba sprayings when making its decision  said J R Davis  spokesman for the governor    Agriculture is the state s number one industry  and the governor understands the importance of getting this right   he said  Monsanto may take legal action against the board if it denies the petition  Scott Partridge  the company s vice president of global strategy  told Reuters  The April 15 deadline  puts Arkansas farmers at an incredible disadvantage   he said  Monsanto s dicamba resistant soybeans  called Xtend  will be the company s biggest ever launch of a seed with a biotech trait   U S  farmers planted Xtend soybean seeds on about 20 million acres this year  and Monsanto is targeting that by 2019  farmers will plant Xtend soybeans on 55 million acres  or more than 60 percent of the total acreage planted with soybeans this year  
The U S  Environmental Protection Agency is separately considering banning sprayings of dicamba herbicides after a set deadline next year because of this summer s crop damage  state officials advising the agency told Reuters ",2017-09-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/monsanto-fights-to-sell-arkansas-farmers-herbicide-linked-to-crop-damage-526713,526713

193036,414552,DD,Drifting crop chemical deals  double whammy  to U S  farmers,news,"By Rod Nickel  Reuters    An advanced weed killing chemical has twice come back to haunt Arkansas farmer John Weiss  The herbicide  known as dicamba  has long been employed in the United States to kill weeds before fields were planted  but its use spiked after regulators last year approved a new formulation that allowed farmers to apply it to growing plants   That should have been good news for Weiss and hundreds of other farmers  who planned to use it to control hard to kill weeds in fields planted with crops bioengineered to survive the chemical  Instead  farmers reported the agricultural chemical was drifting into neighboring fields and damaging crops unable to resist it  Last month  in response to the reports  Arkansas and Missouri temporarily banned its use  The fallout from dicamba hit Weiss on two fronts  The drifting chemicals  he said  stunted his unprotected soybean crops and marked the plants with damaged  withered leaves   Then came the ban  which meant he could no longer use the chemical on the dicamba resistant soybeans and cotton it was meant to protect    It s just a double whammy  this whole thing   said Weiss  Crops have suffered damage across much of the farm belt  Governments in 17 states are investigating more than 1 400 complaints of dicamba problems covering 2 5 million acres  Kevin Bradley  a University of Missouri associate professor in the plant sciences division  wrote last week  The three companies that sell the chemical in the United States for use on growing crops of soybeans and cotton   Monsanto  Co  N MON   BASF  DE BASFn  and DuPont  N DD   say their products have not always been used according to label instructions  Some farmers used older dicamba products that were more drift prone  deployed spraying equipment contaminated with other herbicides  or applied dicamba in the wrong conditions  Monsanto s chief technology officer Robb Fraley said  The situation is part of an evolving battle between farmers and pests that threaten their crops  For two decades  growers have sown crops genetically modified to resist chemicals such as glyphosate  popularly known as Roundup  allowing them to selectively kill all the weeds in a field  But the weeds have rallied  developing resistance to many popular chemicals  prompting farmers to try alternatives such as dicamba  LIMITED OPTIONS It is unclear what is causing dicamba to drift into other crops  though agronomists say it could be caused by high winds or changes in temperature  Complaints have been rampant  So far  Arkansas has received 760 reports from farmers of dicamba drift damage   a record for one product   spanning 209 000 acres  according to the state plant board  The state has taken a tough stance against the chemical  banning its use for 120 days starting July 11  Missouri imposed a one week ban starting July 8  Tennessee placed tight restrictions on when dicamba can be sprayed  The Arkansas State Plant Board relies on the  honor system  to enforce its ban  said director Terry Walker  Violations are punishable by fines up to  25 000  he said  The damaged crops and the subsequent bans have created tensions among some farmers  Lee Cole  a farmer in Hayti  Missouri  who said his soybeans looked like they had been burned by  a blowtorch  because of dicamba  doubts everyone will comply with the regulations    Even the best farmers  when you re under pressure to get it done  you re going to do whatever you ve got to do   Farmers who lose bushels because of drift have little recourse  since U S  crop insurance does not cover losses caused by dicamba  according to U S  Agriculture Department guidelines  Some farmers have filed lawsuits against dicamba producers  while others have turned on their neighbors  blaming them for ruined crops  In one case late last year  an Arkansas sheriff said a farmer fatally shot a neighbor over a dispute about crops damaged by dicamba  according to media reports  Many farmers  such as Brad Doyle  have scrambled to find alternative ways to protect their crops  The Arkansas grower  who planted dicamba resistant soybeans to re sell through his seed business  said he chose to spray less effective fomesafen to avoid dicamba drifting  He has deployed workers to pull weeds by hand   Options are running out   he said  Ted Glaub  who manages 30 farms in Arkansas  Missouri and Mississippi  said it would be a costly mistake to write off dicamba   We need dicamba  We don t have enough tools   he said   STRAIGHTENING UP  Farmers  regulators and the companies selling the pesticide are examining ways to control the drift  BASF  for instance  gave away 600 000 chemical spray nozzles to prevent the wrong ones from being used   In Missouri  the department of agriculture consulted Monsanto  BASF and DuPont to develop new requirements for dicamba  including spraying only when wind is light and during certain hours  Penalties range up to  10 000 per violation   The chemical companies must inform pesticide sellers and trained applicators of the restrictions  according to Missouri s department of agriculture  A BASF spokeswoman said the changes are being flagged on industry websites and through media coverage  adding the company has spoken with retailers who sell the product  Monsanto was consulted about Missouri s requirements  but believes its current label directions are sufficient  Fraley said  A DuPont spokeswoman said it followed all special requirements in Missouri  Some farmers said the efforts   particularly the bans   have revived damaged plants  Tom Burnham  who grows soybeans in both Arkansas and Missouri  is among them   Ever since we got the ban in Arkansas  my crop has really progressed  started to straighten up   Burnham said  
Burnham added  however  that his Missouri crop shows fresh dicamba damage since the state s ban lifted ",2017-08-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/drifting-crop-chemical-deals-double-whammy-to-us-farmers-513403,513403

193062,414578,DD,Steel ETF Declines As Tax Ruling Disappoints,opinion,"The U S  Commerce Department increased anti dumping duties on oil and gas drilling pipes from South Korea on April 11  2017  Duties were increased to a range of 2 76  to 24 9  from 4  to 6 5  
According to the Commerce Department  dumping occurs when a company sells its goods at less than their fair value  It seeks to apply new legal tools to determine the price discrepancies and discover any unfair trade practices deployed by foreign nations to dump cheaper than fair value goods in the U S  If any nation is able to produce these goods at a cheaper price than American companies  they export it to the U S   therefore making it difficult for the domestic companies to compete  read    
In the July 2014 August 2015 timeframe  an estimated amount of  1 1 billion in oil country tubular goods were imported from South Korea  This ruling seeks to protect the American steel industry from unfair subsidized imports into the United States 
The U S  trade deficit with South Korea reached a record  27 6 billion in 2016  a 60  increase over the last five years  The increase in duties was not deemed sufficient by the markets  as steel manufacturers had expected duties of 30  40   This made them question the White House s protectionist stance 
As a result  steel stocks dropped sharply in the April 12  2017 trading session  Let us now discuss about the steel ETF  SLX  see all   
VanEck Vectors Steel ETF   AX SLX

Let us now compare the performance of SLX to a broader material based ETF  XLB 
Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund 
This fund is appropriate for investors looking to gain indirect exposure to commodity prices by investing in companies involved in extraction or production of natural resources

To Conclude
Though the performance of SLX has been impressive in the past one year  it is evident from the chart that in the year to date time frame  XLB has outperformed SLX   This was largely due to the fall of SLX in yesterday s trading session  President Trump s proposed infrastructure policies have been a major driver of the steel industry  However  a weaker than expected protectionist policy implementation resulted in the declines in the steel fund

There were a number of reasons why the small cap space outperformed mid  and large caps in 2016  2017 is a big year for U S  small caps due to the potential change in regulations and planned corporate tax rate cut  Trump s plans could boost small cap companies  revenues and earnings  which would push their share prices higher 
Trump has a protectionist mindset and argues for less global trade  U S  small cap stocks could generate more sales since smaller companies tend to generate only a minor portion of their earnings from overseas sales  Less global trade will squeeze mid  and large cap companies  profit margins  and in turn  this would benefit small cap companies  margins 
Now  Trump s tax reform is one of the main factors that should boost small cap stocks  Trump s tax plan was one of the main focus points of his campaign  and it s his main priority for the first 100 days as U S  President  What does this mean for small cap stocks  Higher potential gains 
Small caps are typically taxed in the U S  at a higher tax bracket than mid  and large cap companies with sales overseas  If Trump is able to lower corporate taxes significantly  the  

Take a look at the analysis above  if the new effective tax rate falls to approximately 15   the S P SmallCap 600 Index earnings are estimated to grow by 23 1   while the S P 500 Index earnings are estimated to grow just by 18 2  
That being said  let s take a look at some of the memorable trades in the small cap space  in 2016  A Small Cap Stock Expert Weighs in on the Performance
One small cap expert  Jason Bond  who has  and provides newsletters  capitalized on a small cap stock in 2016  Jason wasn t always a small cap expert  However  with hard work  dedication and a good mentor  he went from being a New York state elementary school teacher with no net worth and a massive student loan debt to an expert in the space 
According to Jason Bond  he anticipates a good first half performance from stocks in 2017  He stated in a report 

I anticipate a good first half for stocks in 2017  with FANG  NASDAQ FANG  stocks underperforming  while industrial  commodities  defense and gold stocks leading the way  I mention gold stocks in my short list  because I also anticipate consumer price inflation to accelerate during the first six months of 2017 

Now  Jason Bond had an impressive trade in Fannie Mae in November 2016  and here s a look at its performance during the fourth quarter of 2016  Bond got long this stock after the election results came out  However  nearly a year ago  he suggested that Trump fully understood how shareholders of Fannie Mae suffered due to the US government  That s not too hard to conclude  and is why the stock soared following his win at the polls 
Federal National Mortgage Association  Fannie Mae 
Fannie Mae  OTC FNMA  was one small cap stock that had impressive returns in 2016  FNMA ended 2016 up an impressive 137 80   outperforming many large cap stocks  Now  this meteoric rise was primarily driven by Trump s unexpected win and selection of former Goldman Sachs partner Steven Mnuchin as the next U S  Treasury Secretary  Mnuchin aims to privatize FNMA and Feddie Mac under the Trump administration  which should increase FNMA s profit margins 
Large hedge funds were also in on the action  Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  and Paulson   Co  bought large stakes in both FNMA and Freddie Mac  expecting that these government sponsored enterprises would be privatized 
Now  FNMA surged from approximately  1 70 per share to  5 per share in just a matter of weeks  but slightly pulled back thereafter  as shown in the chart below

2016 was a great year for Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD  shareholders  AMD ended up an astonishing 295 12  in 2016  Additionally  it s up 370 22  over the past year  as of January 13  2017 
Take a look at AMD s impressive move in 2016

The stock is still trending higher  and it s starting to get more competitive with its rival chipmakers  Intel  Nvidia and Qualcomm  AMD unveiled its innovative Zen microprocessor technology during the summer of 2016  and it s expected to be released to the public during the first quarter of 2017  AMD s new release coupled with the potential corporate tax cut should increase its profit margins  and in turn  its stock price should rise 
The Chemours Company
The Chemours Company  NYSE CC   a spin off from DuPont  NYSE DD   generated remarkable returns in 2016  Chemours Co  ended up a remarkable 314 37  in 2016  and significantly outperformed major indices  Additionally  as of January 13  2017  Chemours was up an immense 657 88  over the past year  Again  this was fueled by Trump s corporate tax plan  as well as his   The selection of Dow Chemical CEO Liveris to head Manufacturing Council could benefit the chemicals industry with the potential deregulations 
The markets were quick to price this in  as shown in the chart here Source  TradingView The Bottom Line
Small cap stocks outperformed mid  and large caps in 2016  and 2017 should be better for the small cap space  Now  the spectacular move higher was primarily fueled by Trump  and if all his plans are properly executed  small cap stocks could continue their remarkable run ",2017-01-17,Craig Adeyanju,https://www.investing.com/analysis/year-end-review:-small-cap-stocks-200172666,200172666

193077,414593,DD,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Dow Chemical  DuPont  Albemarle  Syngenta And Monsanto,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   April 03  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Chemicals  Part 2  including Dow Chemical  NYSE         DuPont  NYSE DD   NYSE         Albemarle Corp   NYSE         Syngenta  NYSE        and Monsanto Company  NYSE MON   NYSE        

	Industry  Chemicals  Part 2

	Link  

	The chemical industry is back on the growth path after being stuck in a rut  making it an attractive investment proposition for 2017  Strength in the automotive sector and a rebound in non residential construction and housing markets have helped pull the industry out of its funk  notwithstanding a persistently challenging global economic environment 

	Despite a few industry related headwinds  weak demand across agricultural and energy markets and sluggishness in China  there are a number of reasons to be optimistic about the broader chemical industry for both the short and long haul  Let s find out what s supporting the bullish case for chemical stocks 

Shale Bounty   Driving Force for Chemical Spending

	The shale gas revolution in the U S  has been a huge driving force behind chemical investment on plants and equipment in the country  According to the American Chemistry Council  ACC   the U S  has emerged as an attractive investment location and petrochemical makers are now significantly expanding capacity in the country leveraging new supplies of natural gas  New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  are boosting shale production  bringing down prices of ethane  derived from shale gas  in the process 

	The shale boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies to pump in billions of dollars for setting up facilities  crackers  in the U S  to produce ethylene and propylene in a cost effective way  Per the ACC  over 275 new chemical projects have been announced by chemical makers  worth more than  170 billion  since 2010  nearly half of which already complete or under construction  Such investments    many backed by Federal government support    are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years 

Automotive   Healthy Run Continues

	Chemical makers continue to see healthy demand from the automotive sector    a major end use market  The sector is enjoying the fruits of low fuel prices  The last two years have been exceptional for the auto sector  Sales in the U S  saw record highs in both years  while sales in China and Europe also gained strength 

	U S  light vehicles  a key end user market for chemicals  continued to show strength in 2016  supported by an improving job market  rising personal income  improved consumer confidence  low fuel prices and attractive financing options  A high average age of cars on the U S  roads is also fueling replacement demand for cars  U S  sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high of 17 55 million in 2016  rising 0 4  from 2015 s record of 17 47 million 

	According to IHS Markit  global light vehicle sales are expected to increase 1 5  year over year to 93 5 million units in 2017  Moreover  IHS Markit sees U S  light vehicle sales to reach 17 4 million units in 2017    a slight moderation compared with the 2016 level  but still looks poised for another strong year 

	Low interest rates  favorable financing and cheap oil have also backed a recovery in the European auto market  The auto industry in Asian countries  especially China  is also expected to thrive over the next several years  Healthy momentum in the automotive space augurs well for chemical demand in this important end market 

A Rebound in Construction Sector 

	A recovery across housing and commercial construction    major chemical end markets    has been another supporting factor for the chemical industry recovery  After being hit hard in the recession  the construction sector has bounced back on the back of strong housing fundamentals 

	The underlying demand trends in the housing space remain strong  supported by an improving employment levels  affordable interest mortgage rates and a rise in income levels  The year 2016 was reasonably good for the housing market  and the momentum is expected to continue this year 

	Recent housing data has been fairly upbeat with U S  housing starts scaling a four month high in February  buoyed by construction of single family houses that rose 6 5  to reach its highest level in nearly a decade  Housing starts rose 3  to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1 29 million units in February  per the Commerce Department  Homebuilding was up 6 2  year over year for the month  These data paint an upbeat picture for U S  homebuilding 

	The renewal of long stalled construction projects and long awaited access to credit from lending institutions has also helped invigorate the commercial construction sector  U S  architecture firm billings continue to rise  The US Architecture Billings Index  ABI   an indicator that offers a glimpse into the future of U S  non residential construction spending activity  clocked 50 7 in February 2017  a reading above 50 indicates an increase in billings   up from 49 5 in January 

	Moreover  the American Institute of Architects  AIA  expects healthy growth in non residential construction spending this year based on strong growth expectations for hotels  office space and retail  The AIA sees spending to go up 5 6  in 2017 and 4 9  in 2018 

Trump s  1 Trillion Spending Boost

	The U S  chemical industry is expected to be one of the key beneficiaries of Donald Trump s presidency  Chemical stocks got a boost following Trump s election win in November on expectations of significant infrastructure spending in a Trump administration 

	Trump has pledged to pump  1 trillion of new infrastructure spending into the U S  economy  aimed at fixing America s  crumbling  infrastructure  The president has called on Congress to pass a bill that would produce a  1 trillion investment in the national infrastructure to rebuild roads  bridges and other public infrastructure  and create millions of new jobs 

	The president s call for the massive infrastructure spending    one of his key campaign promises    is likely to have a beneficial effect on the U S  chemical industry given the expected increase in demand for chemicals used in construction 

Chemical Bonding   M A Gathering Steam

	Chemical makers remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and shore up growth in a still difficult global economic environment  The industry saw a pick up in consolidation activities in 2015 and the momentum continued in 2016 

	Chemical companies are increasingly looking for cost synergy opportunities and enhanced operational scale through consolidations  The  130 billion mega merger of Dow Chemical  NYSE        and DuPont  NYSE          the biggest chemical deal ever    is a huge testimony to these strategic moves 

	Other major deals that have taken place in the chemical space in the recent past include Albemarle Corp  s  NYSE         6 2 billion buyout of Rockwood Holdings  Inc   Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA s  17 billion acquisition of Sigma Aldrich  ChemChina s proposed  43 billion acquisition of Syngenta  NYSE        and the  66 billion proposed merger between Monsanto Company  NYSE        and Bayer AG  DE BAYGN  

Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News

5 Dupont Tested Picks to Excel in Any Market Condition

	Return on equity  ROE  is one of the best arrows in investors  quiver that enable them to single out the right investment choices  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings a company generates from its equity 

	However  delving into the basic ROE and analyzing it at a deeper level  with the help of DuPont  NYSE DD  analysis  could lead to better returns  It is an analytical method  which critically examines three major elements   operating management  management of assets and the capital structure   related to the financial condition of a company  It s basically taking ROE apart to examine how it works  Although it can be presented in several ways  the most popular one is shown below 
	ROE   Net Income Equity
	Net Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity 
	ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierAdvantage of DuPont over ROE
	The importance of ROE can t be gainsaid but still it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
	In fact  it also sheds light on a company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  ROE of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt burden 
	So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective will be at a loss if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  DuPont analysis comes to the rescue and finds out the better stock  Thus  a company with a healthy mix of all the three metrics   profit margin  asset turnover ratio and equity multiplier   will be the most alluring 
	DuPont analysis is not difficult  as the required numbers are available in a company s income statement and balance sheet 

	However  looking at the financial statements of each and every company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can easily shortlist the stocks that look impressive based on DuPont analysis Screening Parameters
	  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE 
	  Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales 
	  Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets 
	  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment 
	  Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed 
	Here are five of the seven stocks that made it through the screen Winnebago Industries  Inc   NYSE      enjoys a leading position as the manufacturer of vehicles  which are used primarily in leisure travel and outdoor recreation activities in the U S  This Zacks Rank  1 company s earnings are expected to grow at a rate of 32 3  for this year Thor Industries Inc   NYSE      is one of the largest manufacturers of recreational vehicles globally  THO has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 24 1   The stock has a Zacks Rank  1  You can see     Airgain Inc   NYSE      is engaged in designing  developing  and engineering antenna products for original equipment and design manufacturers  chipset vendors  and service providers worldwide  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  The company has been experiencing positive estimate revision for the current quarter in the last 30 days Nutrisystem  Inc   NASDAQ      is a leader in the weight loss industry and has a number of weight loss management products including Nutrisystem My Way  Fast 5  and Turbo 10 in its kitty  Its earnings are expected to grow at a rate of 33 7  for this year  The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 Comfort Systems USA Inc   NYSE      is a premier provider of commercial  industrial and institutional heating  ventilation and air conditioning   HVAC   services  This Zacks Rank  2 company has an average four quarter EPS surprise of 15 8

193128,414644,DD,You ll Never Guess How Much Bayer And Monsanto Spend On Lobbying,opinion,"By now you ve surely heard about the massive merger between Bayer   OTC BAYRY   and Monsanto   NYSE MON   that will see the German drug and crops chemical giant buyout the world s largest seeds firm for  66 billion  What you may not know  however  is the politics that surround the two companies as they seek regulatory approval for the merger 
Massive takeovers like this one draw a lot of scrutiny from government regulators  especially when they involve a U S  company being sold to a foreign entity  Right now in the same industry  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW   and DuPont   NYSE DD   face an uphill battle to get their own merger approved  while Syngenta s   NYSE SYT   sale to ChemChina was recently approved after several U S  senators urged the government to dissect the deal 
 Also Read   
Over the next few weeks or months  government officials will investigate the Bayer Monsanto deal to determine whether it would breach antitrust regulations or negatively impact food safety and supply  As that process plays out  it s important to remember that corporations like Bayer and Monsanto spend quite a bit of money to ensure that the government sides with them in moments like this 
Interestingly enough  these two companies in particular are known for their political spending  According to   a non partisan research firm dedicated to government accountability  Monsanto has spent nearly  2 5 million on lobbying efforts this year  making it the biggest spender in the agricultural industry  Bayer is the eighth highest spender in the pharmaceuticals industry and has spent over  3 6 million on lobbying so far this year 
And it s not like both companies decided to start lobbying the government in anticipation of this big merger  In fact  both companies have a long history of political spending  over the past decade  Bayer and Monsanto have spent a combined  120 million on lobbying 
Throughout the past few years  the focus of both companies  lobbying efforts has centered on the labeling of genetically modified foods  Bayer and Monsanto supported the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015  a bill that critics claim makes it harder for shoppers to interpret GMO information on food labels 
Of course  all the lobbying in the world doesn t necessarily matter when the company lawyers sit down with officials from the Justice Department  the regulatory body that will be tasked with investigating the merger 
With that said  massive deals like this are often subject to increased scrutiny in the public eye  which can result in congressional hearings or even separate congressional investigations  That s really when lobbying efforts begin to pay off 
Given the sheer size of this merger  I don t expect that it will be an easy regulatory process  Investors should pay close attention to the latest from the U S  government regarding this deal  and it s worth nothing that Bayer will pay Monsanto  2 billion if the merger falls apart due to regulators

193141,414657,DD,Bayer Edges Closer To A Tie Up With Monsanto,opinion,"We are on the verge of the largest all cash deal  with Monsanto Company   NYSE MON   expected to collaborate with Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY    However  skeptics still question whether the  130 per share deal will overcome regulatory hurdles Slew of Bids  But Mostly in VainThe German chemical behemoth  Bayer  had offered  122 per share for the buyout in May 2016  The proposal was rejected by the premium U S  genetically modified seed manufacturer  on grounds of being  insultingly low   Bayer gradually started sweetening its bid  raising it to  125 per share in July and further to  127 50 in early September  Monsanto did not accept the revised proposals at once but kept doors open for further negotiations  Analysts believe that the latest offer of roughly  130 per share would finally satisfy the renowned U S  GMO producer   The new tender is worth  66 billion  inclusive of debt  and entails a higher break up fee of  3 billion Bayer Deal the Best OptionThe drop in commodity prices has put pressure on companies like Monsanto  with farmers lowering their demand for supplies  Weaker agro product prices are currently weighing on farmers  income  affecting their purchasing decisions At this stage  companies within the global seeds  traits and agricultural chemical industry are banking on the strategy of consolidation  While E  I  du Pont de Nemours and Company   NYSE DD   and The Dow Chemical Company   NYSE DOW   inked a  130 million merger deal in 2015  Syngenta AG   NYSE SYT   agreed to be bought by ChemChina for  43 billion in Feb 2016 Monsanto has viewed itself as an exalted buyer  rather than a target  However  the company failed to acquire Syngenta and also could not establish a concrete deal with the German chemical company  BASF  Bayer s fourth time renewed bid of  130 per share  was higher than Monsanto s closing share price on Sep 13  Thus  the deal seems to be the only credible alternative for Monsanto at present MONSANTO CO NEW Price

193142,414658,DD,3 Stocks With Magic PEG Ratios ,opinion,"For generations  value investors have looked to the price to earnings ratio  or P E  as a means to finding value stocks  

However  Benjamin Graham  long considered to be the  father  of value investing  found that a low price to earnings ratio wasn t enough to unearth the true undervalued companies 

Graham combined the low price to earnings ratios with the power of growth by using the PEG ratio  The PEG ratio is calculated by taking the price to earnings  P E  ratio and dividing it by the growth rate 

Normally  a stock with a PEG ratio under 1 0 is considered a  value  

With the S P 500 and the NASDAQ trading at new all time highs  you might think it would be hard to find ANY value but it does still exist if you dig deep 
Screening for PEG

I created a screen for PEG ratios under 1 0 on   

Just this one criteria gave me 348 stocks  That s not too shabby 

But that doesn t mean all 348 companies are necessarily the companies I want to be buying right now  A list that big is somewhat unruly and isn t small enough to give me the truly best companies  

Therefore  I eliminated companies that had a Zacks rank of 4 or 5  which are Zacks Rank Sells  and only searched for Buy ranked stocks which are Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   

Stocks with Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  usually have rising earnings estimates  That s a criteria that I want my companies to have  

That screen gave me 59 results which was more manageable 
Adding Another Top Value Criteria

I decided to add another layer of value on top of that screen  though  because I wanted to find the very top value stocks  which also have growth 

Therefore  I also searched for companies with a price to sales  P S  ratio under 1 0  Companies with a low P S are usually undervalued compared to the rest of the market  

The P S ratio is also a great value component to look at to find those companies that are really cheap 

While companies can find a penny here or there for the earnings component of a quarterly earnings report  and therefore  beat  the estimates  it s hard to fudge sales numbers 

Adding the P S ratio under 1 0 gave me 30 stocks  
3 Stocks with Magic PEG Ratios

Now comes the hard part  of actually narrowing down the 30 stock to just 3 
1  The Chemours Company   

Chemours makes performance chemicals  The company has 37 production facilities in 12 countries in three segments  Titanium Technologies  Fluoroproducts and Chemical Solutions 

It recently celebrated its first year as a public company as it was spun off from DuPont  NYSE DD  in 2015 

Chemours is in the middle of a 5 Point Transformation Plan  It sold its Sulfur business for  325 million and announced the sale of its Clean and Disinfect business for  230 million 

Everyone in the industry is raising prices of their TiO2 so that is creating a boost for earnings  Analysts have been raising 2016 and 2017 estimates 


Earnings for 2017 are expected to jump 73 5  

Magic PEG ratio   0 9
P S ratio   0 4
Zacks Rank  2  Buy 
2  Party City Holdco Inc    

Party City is the largest party goods company be revenue in North America and the largest vertically integrated supplier of decorated party goods globally by revenue  

It designs  manufactures and sources party goods  including paper and plastic tableware  balloons  Halloween costumes  accessories  novelties and party gifts  

Party City operates 730 corporate stores and 183 franchise stores for a total store count of 913  

Party City isn t seeing the consumer slowdown like other retailers  Party goods normally see steady demand and the company said they are  generally unaffected by economic conditions   

Apparently  if you re going to throw a 40th birthday party  you re going to do it no matter what  

Revenue jumped 4 8  in the second quarter with comparable sales up 3 8  driven by strong summer graduation sales and larger than average purchases  

Additionally  Easter was shifted to the first quarter this year which boosted the quarter as the company shuts its stores on Easter Sunday 

Earnings are expected to rise 21  this year and 12  again next year 


Magic PEG ratio   1 00
P S ratio   0 9
Zacks Rank  2  Buy 
3  Tower International  Inc    

Tower makes engineered automotive structural metal components and assemblies including frames and chassis structures for cars and trucks  

It has a global business although it intends to sell its remaining business interests in China and Brazil shortly  

The company is benefiting from higher US truck demand  In the second quarter earnings report  it maintained its full year guidance 

Still  investors are worried about North American auto weakness and that there is peak auto  That s why the shares are so cheap  

Analysts aren t as pessimistic  as they see another 13  earnings growth in 2017

193143,414659,DD,Bayer Takes Over Monsanto,opinion,"Germany s Bayer  DE BAYGN  and Monsanto  NYSE MON  are set to announce a successful tie up deal on Wednesday  The merger would value the US seed maker at nearly  130 per share  or more than  65 billion in total including debt  according to sources 
Bayer s administrative board is scheduled to meet Wednesday afternoon  where it is predicted to seal the company s latest takeover proposal 
During a meeting late Tuesday  Monsanto s board accepted the German company s latest bid  which is higher than its recent offer of  127 50 per share last week  Moreover  Bayer significantly boosted its break fee from a previous amount of  1 5 billion 
The expected merger would come about four months after Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann made his initial bid for Monsanto  The pharmaceutical company originally offered to acquire Monsanto for  122 per share back in May 
Since then Bayer increased its offer twice  including last week s revised proposal  However  it failed to provide Monsanto with an adequately high figure 
Baumann spent several hours over the summer trying to persuade doubtful investors on both parties that a merger would create value for the two companies  Most of his own shareholders questioned whether Bayer could manage such an acquisition with its high debt  The company s net debt amounted to 17 45 billion euros last year  more than double the 7 billion euro figure in 2011 
Several investors had wanted the company to continue to extend its productive health care operations 
The agreement with Monsanto would considerably alter Bayer s portfolio  drifting it away from its primary health care operations  The company s crop science business would include nearly half of overall sales  compared with 30 percent last year  The health care segment  such as pharmaceuticals business  would comprise roughly the other half of group sales 
Bayer s agrochemical sector posted a revenue of 10 4 billion euros in 2015  out of total group sales of 46 3 billion  On the other hand  Monsanto reported total sales of  15 billion in the previous year 
Market analysts widely anticipate Bayer and Monsanto to finalize a deal  but some still doubt the benefits of the tie up and whether it would overcome potential regulatory challenges 
 We see the Bayer Monsanto deal as close to an end   analysts at Germany s DZ Bank wrote in a note Wednesday morning   We don t like the transaction because we think that Bayer is overpaying significantly   an analyst stated 
Benefits Of Bayer Monsanto Merger
Market players and analysts have noted that Bayer and Monsanto s agricultural enterprises are complementary  Bayer performs much stronger in crop chemicals  while Monsanto is a global leader in seeds 
The deal  which would establish the world s biggest agrochemicals businesses  is the latest in the briskly consolidating agricultural sector 
Other seed developers such as Syngenta AG  NYSE SYT   Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW  and DuPont  NYSE DD  have all closed their own deals in the previous months  Agrochemical groups have been under pressure to reduce costs and build scale as farmers struggle with a three year decline in crop prices that has pushed seed manufacturers  crop chemicals  fertilizers and tractors to curb prices and lay off employees ",2016-09-14,Trade12,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bayer-takes-over-monsanto-200153541,200153541

193146,414662,DD,4 ETFs In Focus Following Bayer Monsanto Merger Deal,opinion,"After several attempts  German chemical behemoth  Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY   has succeeded in acquiring agribusiness giant Monsanto Company   NYSE MON   in the biggest merger deal of this year  If implemented  the combined company will emerge as one of the major players in the seeds and pesticides market  However  a series of regulatory hurdles await the deal 
Bayer Monsanto Deal in Detail
Monsanto agreed to be  by Bayer in an all cash deal worth  66 billion or  128 per share  which is a 21  premium from Monsanto s closing price on Tuesday  This was Bayer s fourth attempt to acquire the company  The German company had offered  122 per share for the buyout in May 2016  The proposal was rejected by Monsanto on grounds of being  insultingly low   Bayer gradually started sweetening its bid  raising it to  125 per share in July and further to  127 50 in early September  read     
With the acquisition  Bayer seeks to hold greater share of the seeds and pesticides market  The combined company will own more than one fourth share of the seeds and pesticides market  Though the deal is expected to be closed by the end of next year  in the event of its failure due to regulatory issues  the German company will have to pay  2 billion to Monsanto as break up fee  The deal is expected to have a positive impact on Bayer s earnings in the first year following its closure while by the third year earnings are expected to get a double digit percentage boost 
Regulatory Issues a Concern
The threat of market concentration following the merger will lead to increased scrutiny by regulatory agencies  For an instance  EU Antitrust Chief Margrethe Vestager signaled that the deal will be closely examined by the agency and they will evaluate its impact on the crop market  The agency is already investigating the merger deal between The Dow Chemical Company   NYSE DOW   and E  I  du Pont de Nemours and Company   NYSE DD    read    
Separately  Agrium Inc    NYSE AGU   and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc    NYSE POT   recently agreed to get merged  which has further raised concerns over market concentration  Given the increasing instances of mergers  U S  Senator Charles Grassley plans to hold a hearing on Sep 20 to discuss the impacts of these deals on the global seeds and pesticides market  Grassley said   In most instances when you have less competition  prices go up  and consumers pay more  
ETFs in Focus
Despite these concerns  both the companies sound confident about overcoming regulatory barriers  Werner Baumann  CEO of Bayer said   some initial contacts with regulatory agencies describing what this combination would be about    We have so far received encouraging feedback but nothing beyond that   Regarding regulatory issues  Monsanto s CEO Hugh Grant said that  We feel quite good  
Hence  we have highlighted four ETFs with significant exposure to Monsanto  the performances of which are expected to be impacted as the deal progresses  see   
iShares MSCI Global Agriculture Producers 
This fund provides global exposure to 122 companies by tracking the MSCI ACWI Select Agriculture Producers Investable Market Index  Of these  Monsanto occupies the top position with a 13 96  allocation  On a regional basis  American firms dominate the fund s holding with 45 7  of total assets  followed by a double digit exposure to Switzerland  From a sector look  materials takes the largest share at 47 6   closely followed by food beverage   tobacco  21   and capital goods  17 1    The ETF is less popular and illiquid with  27 2 million in AUM and around 8 000 shares in average daily volume  The ETF charges 39 bps in fees per year from investors 
Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF 
This is the most popular material ETF that follows the Materials Select Sector Index  This fund manages about  2 6 billion in its asset base and trades in heavy volume of around 5 2 million shares  The ETF charges 14 bps in fees per year from investors  In total  the fund holds about 29 securities in its basket with MON taking the third spot with an 8 7  allocation  In terms of industrial exposure  chemicals dominates the portfolio with 70 3  share while containers   packaging and metals   mining round off the top three positions  The fund currently has a Zacks ETF Rank  3  Hold  with a Medium risk outlook 
iShares US Basic Materials 
This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U S  Basic Materials Index and holds 51 stocks in its basket  The fund has amassed  577 million in its asset base and charges 43 bps in fees and expenses  Volume is good as it exchanges around 153 000 shares a day  Monsanto occupies the third position in the basket with 8 8  share  The product is heavily skewed toward the chemicals segment  as it makes up for nearly 70  of the portfolio while industrial gases receives double digit allocation  The fund currently has a Zacks ETF Rank  3 with a High risk outlook  read    
VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF   V MOO  
This fund is a popular and liquid choice in the space with AUM of about  839 8 million and average daily volume of nearly 120 000 shares  It tracks the MVIS Global Agribusiness Index and charges 55 bps in annual fees  In total  the fund holds 52 securities in its basket with MON occupying the second spot at 7 8  of total assets  From a sector look  materials takes the largest share at 39 5   closely followed by consumer staples  30 6   and industrials  16 9    In terms of country allocation  more than half of the portfolio goes to U S  firms while Canada  Switzerland and Japan get a decent exposure of around 7  each

193147,414663,DD,Bayer Monsanto Deal Highlights Changing Agriculture Industry,opinion,"After months of negotiations  Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY   announced Thursday that it signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire Monsanto Company   NYSE MON   for  128 per share in an all cash deal worth  66 billion  If the buyout successfully makes it through the regulatory process  the agriculture and farming industry will certainly be changed forever 
The German drug and crop chemicals maker and the world s largest seeds firm will merge to create a global agriculture superpower  The combined entity will leverage Monsanto s expertise in the Seeds   Traits and Climate Corporation platform and Bayer s Crop Protection product line to create a true giant in the industry  also read    
The Times They Are A Changin   
Bayer and Monsanto s consolidation of businesses is the latest in what is becoming a completely different chemicals and agriculture landscape  Just a few weeks ago  the merger between Bayer rival Syngenta   NYSE SYT   and ChemChina was approved by regulators  and industry giants Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW   and DuPont   NYSE DD   are working on receiving approval for their own merger in the EU 
Syngenta  which currently sits just above Bayer as the world s largest crop chemicals producer  was sold to state owned ChemChina for  44 billion  The deal faced an uphill battle to receive approval after a group of U S  senators urged the government to dissect the deal due to concerns over its effects on food security and the American agriculture industry as a whole  also read    
The Dow Chemical and DuPont merger has also hit a snag  as EU regulators seem to be taking their time on an antitrust probe that was launched to investigate the deal   In July  shareholders of both companies approved a merger that would value the newly formed company at approximately  130 billion  also read    
While DowDuPont isn t quite a guarantee  the recent trend of collaboration within this industry is noteworthy  The leaders within the greater agriculture sector are desperately trying to consolidate in an effort to protect their current market share  while also expanding their international presence 
For some  like Dow and DuPont  merging is also a method of increasing efficiency  once approved  DowDupont plans on separating its business into three independent  publicly traded companies focused on agriculture  material science  and specialty products 
A Real Impact
The reason why it s important to understand these changes in the agricultural industry lies within the inherent importance of the industry itself  While farming may seem like an outdated occupation to some  it s an essential piece of our economy that impacts every person on earth 
When things change in the agriculture industry  things change in the entire food supply chain  Consumers might not realize how much these companies matter  but basically anyone who eats food in North America interacts with Monsanto on some level on a day to day basis 
Critics of these deals will point to food safety concerns and anti competitive business practices that can harm consumers  proponents of these deals will assert their importance for maintaining healthy businesses  Regardless of which side of the debate you happen to fall on  it s important to be paying attention

193159,414675,DD,Monsanto   4 Poorly Ranked Toxic Materials Stocks To Avoid ,opinion,In order to assemble a healthy portfolio  investors should currently avoid material stocks like Monsanto   NYSE MON    Investment in poorly ranked material stocks would not be very rewarding right now  as these companies are presently confronting several headwinds   Why to Shun Monsanto   Monsanto s shares gained 3 8  to  107 44 as of Aug 30  2016  The upside reflects investors  confidence on the stock  However  the company s lackluster third quarter fiscal 2016 results connote the existence of certain setbacks troubling its business  Over the last four trailing quarters  Monsanto has generated an average negative earnings surprise of 437 98   missing estimates thrice amongst the four quarters  Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock is pegged at a loss of 2 cents for the current quarter over the last 60 days  The same has been revised downwards both for fiscal 2016 and 2017  over the preceding 60 day tenure Weak Q316 ResultsIn third quarter fiscal 2016  Monsanto s diluted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10  and also fell short of the year ago tally by 13 5   The company stated that certain temporary tribulations such as restructuring charges  litigation   environmental issues  and the Argentinean tax associated problem had weighed over the quarterly bottom line figures However  we recognize that earnings of Monsanto were also hurt by lower revenues in fiscal third quarter  Quarterly revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 3  and decreased 8 5  year over year  Commercial hitches such as absence of Scotts Miracle Gro Company s  274 million licensing deal  delayed European Union import approval for glyphosate weed killer  greater pricing regulations   lower cotton acreage in India  weak prices Round Up Ready Xtend and glyphosate as well as lower volumes of soybeans hampered Monsanto s revenues and earnings in third quarter fiscal  OutlookMonsanto perceives that dismal pricing conditions  lesser number of non core licensing deals  anticipated rise in commissions   incentives  rise in inflation spend and currency related issues would continue to weaken its financial recital in the quarters ahead  Owing to these bearish facets  Monsanto projects to accrue earnings at the lower end of the range  4 40  5 10 per share for full year fiscal 2016  predicting currency headwinds of 85 cents per share Bayer s Sweetened Buyout Offer Still OpenBayer AG  DE BAYGN  had revised its acquisition proposal for Monsanto in Jul  2016  after the company turned down its initial takeover bid on grounds of being  insultingly low   Bayer sweetened its pot by raising the bid to  125 per share  at a premium of 16 3  over the closing share price of Monsanto on Aug 30  Though Monsanto has again rejected Bayer s revised offer on grounds of being financially inadequate  doors for further negotiations are still open  We believe that Monsanto has not given up on the possibility of a meatier deal to grapple with the problems encountered by its business Though the company remains bullish in boosting its financial fundamentals on the back of greater innovation  higher yield and improved operational efficacy  we offer it s stock a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  status on grounds of the aforesaid mentioned adversaries A Broader View We deem that Monsanto s performance is currently fragile due to several industry specific headwinds  Negatives like economic slowdown in booming nations like China  cyclical downturn of agricultural industry  low prices of agro products  strengthening U S  dollar  devaluating Argentinean Peso and extensive industry rivalry are the major causal factors weighing over the company s financial fundamentals in recent times At this stage  companies within the worldwide seeds  traits and agricultural chemical industry are banking on the strategy of consolidation to brave headwinds  Notably  DuPont  NYSE DD  and Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW  agreed upon a  130 million merger deal in 2015  In Feb 2016  Syngenta agreed to be bought by ChemChina for  43 billion Monsanto conducts its trade within the agricultural products industry  broadly grouped under the Basic Materials sector as per Zacks Industry classification  Our latest article  dated Aug 24  2016  confirms that the sector has largely underperformed this earnings season  Q216   Notably  the sector has witnessed a decline of 11 6  and 8 9  in earnings and revenues  respectively  in the second quarter Zacks CounselInvestors can be winners only by apportioning their funds with a clear roadmap in the current indecisive equity market  At this stage  we recognize that investors can do well by avoiding or discarding poorly ranked basic materials

193168,414684,DD,Global ag tech startup investments drop 30 percent in 2016  study,news,"By Karl Plume
CHICAGO  Reuters    Global investments in agriculture technology startups fell 30 percent in 2016 as investor interest in companies offering drones and satellite guided farm machines cooled following the biggest capital inflow ever a year earlier  according to a study released on Tuesday 
Still  the number of deals grew 10 percent from 2015 to a record 580  and the  3 23 billion invested by venture capitalists and others was the second highest annual total on record for the sector  according to the annual report from food and agriculture investment platform AgFunder 
The pullback outpaced declines in the broader global venture capital market  Weak commodity prices have dragged U S  farm income to the lowest in seven years  while sales have slumped for industry leaders such as equipment maker Deere   Co and seedmaker  Monsanto   NYSE MON  Co 
Funding for drones and robotics companies  bioenergy and food e commerce businesses slowed  while crop biotechnology and farm management tools experienced an uptick  AgFunder data showed 
 Investors are becoming more aware of the challenges in distribution and adoption rates   said AgFunder CEO Rob Leclerc 
 New investors in this space didn t realize how hard distribution might be  It s raising risk  it s seeing companies not growing as fast as they d like them to grow  and that s a real challenge   he said 
Investment was unusually slow in the fourth quarter of the year  a standout period in previous years  as political uncertainty in the United States and Europe kept investors on the sidelines 
Some investors may be waiting for large M A deals such as the  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW  and DuPont  NYSE DD  merger and Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG s takeover of Monsanto Co to be finalized before making large bets  Leclerc said 
The food e commerce segment  which includes companies like U S  based Blue Apron  Germany s Hello Fresh and China based Yiguo com  remained the largest category of investment for a second straight year with  1 29 billion in annual funding  Yiguo com scored the year s biggest investment with  200 million raised from  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  and private equity firm KKR  AgFunder said 
Agriculture biotechnology investments surged 150 percent to  719 million  led by Indigo  which launched a crop boosting microbial seed coating for cotton  and animal nutrition business Benchmark Holdings

productivity actions  The U S  chemical giant registered adjusted earnings  barring one time items  of 95 cents per share for the quarter that trounced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents On a reported basis  the company logged profit of roughly  3 1 billion or  2 61 per share  a nearly three fold surge from a profit of around  1 1 billion or 97 cents per share recorded a year ago  The bottom line was boosted by a sizable gain associated with the Dow Corning ownership restructure  Dow  last month  took full control of Dow Corning   earlier a 50 50 joint venture between Dow and Corning Inc Dow s EBITDA margin  as adjusted  rose 160 basis points year over year to 21  in the quarter with gains recorded across Infrastructure Solutions  Consumer Solutions and Performance Plastics businesses Dow achieved  90 million in productivity savings during the reported quarter  bringing the first half tally to nearly  180 million  The company expects  300 million in savings this year However  Dow s revenues dropped roughly 7  year over year to  11 952 million  Lower prices of hydrocarbons and raw material and impact of the sale of the chlorine products business hurt revenues in the quarter  Sales  however  came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  11 269 million  Volumes  excluding divestments and acquisitions  rose 4  in the quarter  Segment Analysis Agricultural Sciences Sales fell roughly 10  year over year to  1 6 billion in the quarter  hurt by currency headwinds  high inventories and lower crop commodity prices  Crop protection volumes declined on lower demand for herbicides and the AgroFresh divestiture  Seeds volumes fell as weak demand for sunflower and soybeans more than offset growth in corn Consumer SolutionsRevenues from the division were roughly  1 3 billion  up around 15   supported by the addition of the silicones business  Automotive Systems registered double digit volume growth in the quarter  Volumes rose in Electronic Materials on new business wins and market share gains in the semiconductor and display Infrastructure SolutionsSales from the division rose around 6  to  2 1 billion in the quarter as the addition of the silicones business more than offset reduced pricing in all other businesses Volumes rose in most geographies in the company s building and construction business  In Energy and Water Solutions  volumes fell on weak demand in the U S  shale gas market  Coating materials volumes rose on double digit growth in China and gains in industrial and architectural markets  Performance Materials   ChemicalsRevenues slid 30  to  2 3 billion in the quarter  reflecting the impacts of divestments and lower pricing  Polyurethane volumes rose on higher demand for downstream  higher margin system

ahead  Dow sees sustained momentum in consumer driven end markets  The company is witnessing healthy demand in North America and continued recovery in Europe  despite geopolitical uncertainties  Latin America is also showing signs of improvement  The company s strong business portfolio  strategic investments and productivity actions position it well in the prevailing volatile macroeconomic environment Dow should continue to gain from its productivity improvement and cost control actions  Moreover  the company remains committed to invest in attractive regions through highly accretive projects including the expansions in the U S  Gulf Coast and Sadara joint venture in the Middle East Dow should also gain from the synergies associated with Dow Corning Silicones business in 2016  The company  in late June  said that it is taking a number of actions  including closure of silicones manufacturing plants in Greensboro  NC  and Yamakita  Japan  to attain synergies from the restructuring of its ownership in Dow Corning Dow is moving ahead with its planned mega merger with DuPont   NYSE DD    The companies agreed to combine their businesses in Dec 2015 in an all stock

193209,414725,DD,Bonus Trade Idea For The Week June 27  2016  DuPont,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
DuPont  NYSE DD  has been making chemicals for a long time  The sign above gives you a bit of perspective into this  Chemistry in the 1920s  But he company was supplying the US Government with gun powder during the War of 1812  over 100 years before that  The stock has been a staple of income portfolios as well with a steady solid 2 2  dividend yield 
The chart below shows that it has had some good and bad points over the last 7 months  After making a higher over 75 in December it sold off nearly 33  to a low near 50 in January  That is a big fast move for a  57 billion company  Since that low the stock has made steady progress higher  After a quick first month pop  it has settled into a steady move higher against trend resistance and  but for a couple of days  trend support 
It was moving higher towards that resistance when the Brexit decision brought the market down and DuPont with it  The drop brought the price back to that trend support  It also brought the momentum indicators to important levels  The RSI broke down though the mid line and the MACD crossed down  Both are still in the bullish zone  but near the edge  An inflection zone 
A break of the channel to the downside sees possible support lower at 62 85 and 60 50 followed by 57 50 and 56  A bounce off of support might find resistance above at 67 50 and 69 before 70 40 and 75 72  Short interest is low under 1  and the company is expected to report earnings next July 26th 
The options chain for this week shows not much open interest  but what there is is focused lower from 64 to 65  For the July monthly options it is spread pretty evenly with size at 65 and 62 5 on the Put side ad 67 5  70 and 72 5 on the Call side  The July 29 Expiry options  the first beyond the earnings report show the at the money straddle pricing a  4 50 move  and most notable very large open interest at the 72 5 Strike

Trade Idea 4  Sell the stock short on a move under 65 50 with a stop at 66 50 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which saw the week marked by the Cavaliers winning the NBA title  and the Summer solstice ushering in the new season  with all well early in the week  then the Brexit vote changed all that as the equity markets  and all other markets dumped Friday  Leave it to the Brits to screw up a great week  just kidding   With a one day turn now equities look weak 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue higher while crude oil consolidates with a pullback in the uptrend  The US Dollar Index remains stuck in a sideways consolidation while US Treasuries are moving back higher  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are stuck in consolidative ranges with the Chinese market biased to break the range to the upside while Emerging Markets are biased to break theirs lower 
Volatility looks to remain elevated in the coming week keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETFs SPY  NYSE SPY   NYSE IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts all look better to the downside in the short term  with the QQQ at intermediate support and the SPY breaking its intermediate support  All 3 printed possible reversal candles though so stay nimble  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

5 Gems Unearthed Using the DuPont  NYSE DD  Strainer

Return on equity  ROE  is one of the most popular ratios that investors use to single out healthy stocks  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings a company generates from its equity  However  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to better returns 
	Yes  we are talking about DuPont analysis  It is an analytical method  which critically examines three major elements   operating management  management of assets and the capital structure   related to the financial condition of a company  It s basically taking ROE apart to examine how it works  Although it can be presented in several ways  the most popular one is shown below 
	ROE   Net Income Equity
	Net Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity 
	ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierDuPont versus ROE
	The importance of ROE can t be gainsaid but still it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis on the other hand allows investors to assess which of the elements is dominant in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having high margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods which rely on higher turnover 
	In fact  it also sheds light on a company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  ROE of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt burden 
	So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective will be at a loss if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  DuPont analysis comes to the rescue and finds out the better stock  Thus  a company with a healthy mix of all the three metrics   profit margin  asset turnover ratio and equity multiplier   will be the most alluring 
	DuPont analysis is not difficult  as the required numbers are available in a company s income statement and balance sheet 
	However  looking at the financial statements of each and every company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can easily shortlist the stocks that look impressive based on a DuPont analysis Screening Parameters
	  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE 
	  Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales 
	  Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets 
	  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally outperform the market 
	  Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed 
	Here are five of the eight stocks that made it through the screen Expeditors International of Washington Inc       is engaged in the business of providing global logistics services  EXPD has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 4 6   The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 Winnebago Industries  Inc     enjoys leading position as the manufacturer of vehicles  which are used primarily in leisure travel and outdoor recreation activities in the U S  This Zacks Rank  2 company has been witnessing positive estimate revision for the current year in last 30 days Calavo Growers Inc     is the avocado industry leader on a global scale  The company is also engaged in procuring and marketing diversified fresh produce items such as tomatoes and tropical produce  Its earnings are expected to grow at a rate of 27 2  this year  The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 The Ensign Group  Inc     is focused on providing skilled nursing and assisted living services  physical  occupational and speech therapies  home health and hospice services  urgent care services and other rehabilitative and healthcare services  This Zacks Rank  2 company is expected to report earnings growth of 27 2  this year Universal Forest Products Inc       focused on supplying wood  wood composite and other products  carries a Zacks Rank  2  The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 10  for the next 5 years  much higher than the industry average of 6 9

So  an investor looking at two stocks only from an ROE perspective will be impartial if the values are the same  However  DuPont analysis will help to differentiate between the two stocks and find the better one  Thus  a company with a healthy mix of all the three ratios   profit margin  asset turnover ratio and equity multiplier   will be the most alluring 
DuPont analysis is not very difficult  as the required numbers are available in the company income statement and balance sheet of a company 
However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can easily shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis

193240,414756,DD,5 Picks Based On DuPont For Exciting Returns,opinion,"Return on equity  ROE  is a commonly used profitability ratio that measures the earnings a company generates from its equity  ROE is one of the top strategies on investors  mind  when they set out to select stocks  as it enables them to distinguish between a profit churner and a profit burner  Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks 
However  delving into the basic ROE and analyzing it at a deeper level  with the help of DuPont  NYSE DD  analysis  could lead to better returns  It s basically taking ROE apart to examine how it works  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components

In fact  it also sheds light on a company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  ROE of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt burden 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective will be at a loss if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  However  DuPont analysis will come to the rescue and find out the better stock  Thus  a company with a healthy mix of all the three metrics   profit margin  asset turnover ratio and equity multiplier   will be the most alluring

193242,414758,DD,ETFs To Watch On Monsanto Buyout Offer,opinion,"The drop in commodity prices has hit farm income globally  thereby leading to a wave of consolidation in the agrochemical business industry  The latest catalyst in the space is the merger of    with Bayer AG  DE BAYGN      The German chemical giant made an unsolicited all cash bid to acquire the world s largest seed provider Monsanto  NYSE MON  for  62 billion  including debt 
The deal comes at a time when Monsanto is struggling with the slowdown in its agricultural market  particularly in Latin America  and a strengthening U S  dollar Bayer Monsanto Deal in Detail
As per the terms of the deal  Bayer will pay Monsanto shareholders  122 per share in cash  reflecting a 37  premium to the Monsanto stock price of  89 03 at the close on May 9  the day when rumors of the bid initially emerged  Bayer will finance the deal with a combination of debt and equity primarily via a rights offering  Notably  equity would account for about a quarter of the deal value 
The proposed acquisition will create the world s largest agricultural seed and chemical company with a strong global presence in the U S   Europe and Asia  The combination will have  23 1 billion in total sales  much higher than the two nearest rivals after their merger  The combination of Syngenta   and ChemChina AG announced in February is valued at  14 6 billion in sales while that of Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW     and DuPont  NYSE DD     announced last December is valued at  14 8 billion  read

193243,414759,DD,Bayer Bids Billions For Monsanto,opinion,"Germany based chemical and pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG  DE BAYGN   has made an unsolicited take over offer to buy U S  based chemical and biotech company Monsanto  NYSE MON  for  62 billion  If successful this would fuse together the world s two largest suppliers of crop seeds and pesticides  A written proposal was sent by Bayer earlier this month on May 10th  so Monsanto had some time to consult with its legal and financial team to carefully consider the deal 
So far Monsanto has  but says it s open to further talks with Bayer AG NA  DE BAYGN    62 billion already represents a sizeable premium for Monsanto s stock at  122 per share  from its  90 per share in early May  But experts say the deal will probably end up being higher  JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  analysts wrote in a research note that they  believe it is unlikely that the deal gets done at  122 and still believe  135 is a more likely price   It s interesting how Bayer s bid seem to come right after China Natural Chemical Corporation s bid to take over Syngenta for  43 billion earlier this year  not to mention the planned merger between Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW  and DuPont  NYSE DD  
If Bayer becomes successful with it s deal to purchase Monsanto it would be able to tap into the growing  as farmers are expected to feed an estimated 10 billion people world wide by the year 2050  Bayer s Chief Executive Officer Werner Baumann says rationale will win over skeptical investors and overcome a public black lash against Monsanto s genetically modified seeds  About twenty years ago Monsanto started selling these GMO seeds and they now account for the majority of corn and soy beans that grow in the United States  This potential merger would be the largest German company take over of a U S  company  But some stakeholders are not too fond of the deal  The proposed merger has attracted criticism by some major Bayer shareholders who believe the company is simply playing empire building  They don t want to see Bayer stretching its finances too thin in an attempt to become the world s biggest seller of seed and agricultural chemicals  They also see no benefit of getting into Monsanto s business of selling genetically modified crop seeds  Such seeds have been blocked in some countries and been a subject of anxiety among some consumers and the target of environmental activists  Other investors remain skeptical as well as they think the deal is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in several countries  including the U S  and Germany  Bayer shares dropped 6  on Monday earlier this week  and is down nearly 13  since it confirmed it was in talks with Monsanto  Some of Bayer s long term shareholders would have invested in Bayer due to its primary focus on pharmaceuticals so they may not be very happy about the business getting a stake in a seed company 
But despite the backlash and criticism Baumann is optimistic  In a statement he says   We are confident that we can address any potential financing or regulatory matters related to the transaction  Bayer remains committed to working together to complete this mutually compelling transaction   Bayer says that it would finance its cash bid with a combination of debt and equity 
Even if the merger becomes successful it doesn t necessarily mean Bayer will start to sell genetically modified Monsanto crop seeds in Europe  Political resistance to genetically modified crops remains strong in Germany and other European countries  As of right now Monsanto only has one product there  which is variety of corn that is pest resistant  As large multi national companies run out of ideas to foster organic growth  mergers and acquisitions such as this one will likely become more frequent in the financial markets in the foreseeable future ",2016-05-25,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bayer-bids-billions-for-monsanto-(mon)-200132047,200132047

193249,414765,DD,Bayer s Monsanto acquisition to face politically charged scrutiny,news,"By Diane Bartz and Greg Roumeliotis WASHINGTON D C  NEW YORK  Reuters    As the global agricultural sector races to consolidate  Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG s  66 billion all cash deal to acquire  Monsanto   NYSE MON  Co will test growing political and consumer unease in the United States and abroad over the future of food production  Bayer s pesticide focused agricultural business has few overlaps with Monsanto s dominant seed franchise  according to the companies  executives  Still  marrying two of the world s top farm suppliers at a time when rivals are also merging is fueling concern over reduced competition in the  100 billion global market  Monsanto and Bayer  have chosen to do a deal in the year of merging dangerously   said David Balto  a former policy director at the U S  Federal Trade Commission   They are in for a tough time   U S  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley has called a hearing next Tuesday to scrutinize the wave of consolidation  Farmers in Iowa  the Republican senator s home state  are worried that seed and chemical costs are rising while grain prices are near their lowest levels in years  Farm incomes have plunged  Senator Bernie Sanders  who recently ended a run for the Democratic presidential nomination  called the deal  a threat to all Americans    These mergers boost the profits of huge corporations and leave Americans paying even higher prices   he said   Senators Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar  the two top antitrust lawmakers  also expressed concern   The transaction has the potential to result in a significant loss of competition and reduced incentives and ability to innovate  thereby raising prices   said Lee  a Republican from Utah  Monsanto agreed to sell itself to Bayer for  128 per share in cash  yet its shares hovered around  107 Wednesday  reflecting investor uncertainty about regulators  Bayer has agreed to pay Monsanto a  2 billion breakup fee if the deal is thwarted  The German company aims to create a one stop shop for seeds  crop chemicals and computer aided services to farmers   That was the idea behind

agreed to merge  sparking questions of whether regulators will sign off on the new company s potential pricing power  INEVITABLE SCRUTINY It has been a tough year for aggressive mega deals  Antitrust authorities have challenged agreements ranging from oilfield services mergers to health insurance buyouts  Other regulators have cracked down on deals that aid tax avoidance or risk harming national security  The Monsanto and Bayer deal  which would be the largest ever all cash acquisition  faces intense and lengthy regulatory processes in the United States  the European Union and elsewhere  experts said   This merger is not a slam dunk   said Diana Moss  president of the American Antitrust Institute  Hugh Grant  Monsanto s chief executive officer  told reporters the companies will need to file in about 30 jurisdictions  Monsanto and Bayer have had  initial contacts with regulatory agencies describing what this combination would be about   Bayer Chief Executive Officer Werner Baumann said on an investor call  and  received encouraging feedback   The value of assets Bayer is willing to divest is to be revealed by next week  when details of the merger agreement become public

193251,414767,DD,Special Report  Flawed CDC report left Indiana children vulnerable to lead poisoning,news,"By Joshua Schneyer and M B  Pell EAST CHICAGO  Indiana  Reuters    In this industrial northwest Indiana city  hundreds of families who live in a gated public housing community with prim lawns and a new elementary school next door are searching for new homes  Their own places have been marked for demolition  The school  temporarily closed  has been taken over by the Environmental Protection Agency and health officials who offer free blood tests to check residents for lead poisoning  Long after the U S  lead industry left East Chicago  a toxic legacy remains  Smokestacks at one smelter next door  shuttered 31 years ago  for decades polluted these grounds  Emissions from the now defunct U S  Smelter and Lead Refinery Inc  or USS Lead  left a potent hazard in the soil  By early this year  the EPA detected concentrations of the heavy metal so high in some yards that they could pose a serious health risk to families at the West Calumet Housing Complex  Children are told not to play outdoors  At the 44 year old housing complex  all 1 100 residents are being forced to move out  Many are outraged about why the dangerous soils weren t identified and removed earlier  One reason  Five years ago  a unit of the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a 19 page report that all but ruled out the possibility of children here getting lead poisoning   That CDC branch   the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  or ATSDR    conducts public health assessments to examine potential contamination risks and point the way to next steps to be taken by EPA and others  In its January 2011 report  ATSDR said it reached  4 important conclusions   Among them   Breathing the air  drinking tap water or playing in soil in neighborhoods near the USS Lead Site is not expected to harm people s health    ATSDR s report was built on flawed or incomplete data  a Reuters examination found  The assumption that residents weren t at risk was wrong  and many of the report s key findings were unfounded or misleading  The report said  nearly 100 percent  of children were being tested for blood lead levels in the impacted area  State data reviewed by Reuters show the annual rate of blood lead testing among children in East Chicago ranged from 5 percent to 20 percent over the last 11 years  In the area  well known for its history of lead contamination  ATSDR reported that  declining blood lead levels in small children appear to confirm that they are no longer exposed to lead from any source   Yet from 2005 to 2015  nearly 22 percent of children tested in the Indiana census tract that contains the West Calumet houses showed an elevated blood lead level   160 such results in all  Children tested in this tract were more than twice as likely to have an elevated reading than in other areas of East Chicago  state data reviewed by Reuters shows  The CDC s conclusions help explain why many West Calumet residents didn t learn until recently that their yards were toxic  according to health experts  city administrators and data compiled by Reuters  GRAPHIC   A Neighborhood and Lead   Carla Morgan  East Chicago s city attorney  believes the report contributed to a false sense of safety   In 2011  the ATSDR lacked data to make any conclusion about the potential health risks   she said  Contacted by reporters  the ATSDR initially said it would respond to detailed questions about its 2011 report  Over a period of weeks it said it was finalizing its responses  A spokeswoman  Susan McBreairty  told Reuters the answers were  complicated   Reporters also sought comment from the two ATSDR scientists listed as authors of the 2011 report  neither responded  Ultimately  ATSDR didn t address the questions  Instead  it released a broad media statement Thursday saying it is evaluating new EPA data  to determine if a human health hazard has developed since the Agency s 2011 public health assessment  PHA  of the USS Lead and Smelter site   A new analysis will come next year  ATSDR said in the statement  and  will help determine if additional public health activities are warranted   BARRIER BETWEEN CHILDREN  SOIL The report s findings factored significantly into EPA s decision not to conduct more urgent soil testing or urge residents to relocate  said EPA Region Five Administrator Robert Kaplan  Believing residents weren t at imminent risk  EPA focused on a multi year plan to gradually test for and replace lead tainted soil  Once EPA completed its soil sampling this year  the scope of the danger for children was clear   The high levels of lead in many yards in East Chicago would require a barrier to be placed between children and the soil  to protect them   said Dr  Helen Binns  a pediatrician at Lurie Children s Hospital in Chicago and professor at Northwestern University s medical school  who reviewed the testing data with Reuters  EPA s sampling found that 50 percent of the West Calumet homes tested had lead in their topsoil exceeding 1 200 parts per million  or three times the federal  hazard  level for residential areas  That level warrants  time critical  removal action within six months to protect human health  EPA standards say  In the most polluted yard found  a top layer of soil had 45 000 parts per million of lead  Patrick MacRoy  a former head of the lead poisoning prevention program in Chicago  expressed shock after reviewing the ATSDR report  He found especially troubling its conclusion that children faced no threat of lead exposure   I can t believe anyone with any degree of training or familiarity with environmental health would ever make  that  statement   MacRoy said   I can t believe that no one reviewing that report internally  or even at EPA or the state  wouldn t have flagged that as grossly misstating the available evidence    I generally respect ATSDR  but that report is embarrassingly bad   he said  GRAPHIC   Industry and Housing   In recent months  10 children under age 7 at West Calumet houses or in nearby areas were confirmed to have elevated lead levels  or around 5 percent of those tested  according to Indiana s State Department of Health  Following the notorious lead contamination of the drinking water supply in Flint  Michigan  around 4 9 percent of children tested there had high blood lead levels  In East Chicago  more monitoring is planned  and the recent results do not mean children are in the clear  experts said  Blood lead testing is usually indicated for children ages one and two  Ingesting lead tainted soil  dust or paint chips is most common among infants and toddlers with hand to mouth behavior  said Dr  Bruce Lanphear  an expert on neurotoxins at Simon Fraser University  A child poisoned at age two will often later test within a normal range  But the earlier exposure may have already wrought irreversible damage  including lifelong cognitive impairments   WHAT ARE THEY DIGGING FOR   Today  outside the orderly brick houses in the community   due west of Gary  Indiana  and some 23 miles south of Chicago   moving vans are parked  and poster board signs warn residents not to play in the dirt  Some of the 92 EPA staffers on site go door to door to speak with residents  offering testing and clean up for lead inside their homes  Contractors have placed mulch over exposed dirt areas  The forced exodus of tenants comes after East Chicago s mayor told them this summer that lead and arsenic contamination in the area made it unacceptably risky to live here  especially for the area s more than 600 children   I have lived here for five years and was never told anything about contamination until now   said Akendra Erving  a mother of five young children who is moving her family to Alabama   In May or June  I started to see these crews digging in peoples  yards   What are they digging for   I thought   Now I know   Recently  Erving got more bad news  A test showed that her three year old son  King  had a blood lead level of 8 micrograms per deciliter  Her daughter Kelis  4  tested at 9 micrograms per deciliter  CDC recommends a public health response for children who test at 5 or above  The lead crisis is the focus of several agencies  including ATSDR  EPA has taken a leading role  with Indiana s State Department of Health  city officials  state environmental officials and federal and local housing agencies also involved  Tensions and finger pointing among the parties has sometimes grown heated  In July  East Chicago s mayor wrote EPA a scathing letter  accusing the agency of withholding soil testing data that demonstrated grave health risks  EPA s Kaplan says the soil data was shared with the city as soon as the EPA could verify it  in May  Recently  a  peacekeeper  division of the U S  Justice Department  its Community Relations Service  stepped in to de escalate conflicts  ON TOP OF ANACONDA The West Calumet Housing complex stands near the center of a once humming U S  industry hub  It was also a dirty one  In the early 1970s  the houses were erected atop the former Anaconda Lead and International Refining Company  For decades  the plant churned out white lead pigment for use in paint  In 1978  the United States outlawed the type of paint Anaconda produced for residential use  That and other measures brought a sharp drop in average U S  blood lead levels in recent decades  No level of lead in the blood is safe for children  Next door was another smelter  USS Lead  From 1920 through 1985  the facility refined lead or lead products  Its blast furnaces pumped out soot that blanketed the land where the housing complex stands  Also nearby was a facility  formerly operated by chemicals giant DuPont  NYSE DD   that produced lead arsenate from 1928 1949  Its main ingredients were lead and arsenic  The product was banned as an insecticide in 1988  Much of the waste was stockpiled within the city s industrial complexes  Sometimes it got spread over nearby marshland or dumped in the Calumet River  Back in 2009  this corner of East Chicago  a working class city of 29 000  was placed on the federal Superfund s National Priorities List  or NPL  Michael Berkoff  an EPA project manager who led a 2012 public hearing in East Chicago to inform residents about clean up plans  described the NPL as  EPA s nationwide list of the most contaminated sites in the country   Numbering more than 1 300 nationwide  the Superfund sites require clean up to protect the environment and human health  In many cases  the companies that used to operate them folded years ago  At the hearing  Berkoff laid out EPA s long term goal of removing contaminated soil from West Calumet yards and other polluted zones in East Chicago   Some of the contamination here is at higher levels than we would consider hazardous waste   he told the audience  according to a transcript  Years earlier  the EPA had already cleaned up several area yards where topsoil testing detected lead levels exceeding 1 200 parts per million  ppm  The next round of remediation EPA proposed would cost tens of millions of dollars and take a few years  Berkoff said  At West Calumet  wherever EPA found yards whose shallow soil exceeded 400 ppm of lead  it would excavate and replace the layer with clean soil  To fund the effort  EPA and the U S  Department of Justice pursued what they called potential responsible parties for some of the area s contamination  In 2014  chemicals company DuPont and ARCO  a unit of oil giant  BP   LON BP   agreed to contribute  26 million to the East Chicago clean up  Under a consent decree  the companies acknowledged no wrongdoing  ARCO said it had taken on certain liabilities after it acquired the Anaconda Company in the late 1970 s  though it never operated the Anaconda lead plant itself  DuPont said it cooperated with EPA but its responsibilities under the consent decree were assumed by the Chemours Company  a former DuPont business now operating independently  a DuPont spokesman said  Chemours said it will cooperate with the EPA  a spokesman said  To date  the earth moving envisaged in the plans EPA s Berkoff described in 2012 hasn t happened  Securing funds  soil testing  and issues that crept up with contractors all took time  West Calumet soil replacement would have started this summer  EPA s Kaplan said  Instead  the city plans to raze the houses  TROUBLED TRACT The CDC s role in ensuring the health of people near Superfund sites is enshrined in federal law  When an area is added to the National Priority List  the ATSDR conducts an independent public health assessment  ATSDR s role is advisory  but its reports can lead to strongly worded health bulletins or other actions  including condemnation of properties deemed unfit for human habitation  EPA commissioned the ATSDR report because  we wanted to know  is it an emergency  time critical response or something that needs a remedy but isn t necessarily as urgent   said Kaplan  The CDC branch concluded that results from childhood blood tests in the region suggested there was no risk  Other report statements appeared to support that finding  Virtually all children in the area were being tested for lead poisoning  the report said  seeming to reflect close monitoring  Kids living in the area had blood lead levels  consistent with the national average   it said  Properties found to contain unsafe levels of lead in the soil had already been cleaned up by the EPA  the ATSDR said  and local health officials offered assurances there were no reports of health problems linked to lead  Citing Indiana Department of Health data from the 1990s through 2008  ATSDR said children in East Chicago had experienced a sharp decline in blood lead levels  Yet the report did not specifically cite the most recent blood testing data from residents at the West Calumet Housing Complex  or the census tract where it is located  Reuters obtained testing data from the Indiana census tract  labeled 303  from 2005 through 2015  The data compiled by Indiana shows that 21 8 percent of children aged up to 6 tested there had blood lead readings above CDC s current  elevated  threshold  Although only a portion of the area s children were being tested in the period  the 303 tract registered 160 elevated test results among small children  That was more than in any other tract in Lake County  where East Chicago is located  and more than in all but a dozen of Indiana s 1 507 census tracts  As recently as 2014  25 percent of the children tested in the 303 tract had elevated levels  During that same year  Indiana data shows  around 6 4 percent of kids tested across the state had elevated lead levels  CDC estimates show that  across the United States  the prevalence of children with elevated blood lead levels is around 2 5 percent  The ATSDR report credited Indiana s state health department with  excellent work  in ensuring almost universal testing  State and county data reviewed by Reuters tell a different story  The annual rate of blood lead testing among children aged up to 6 in Indiana hovered around 7 percent in recent years  Although around 20 percent of children in East Chicago were tested each year between 2005 and 2010  the rate plummeted to 5 percent in 2014  As for the ATSDR report s claim that it had heard of no concerns from local health officials  City Attorney Morgan said the agency never consulted East Chicago s health

daughter  Samira  2  had tested positive for lead poisoning with a level of 33 micrograms per deciliter  nearly seven times the elevated threshold  That result  the letter said  was from a test

later   The state health department said privacy law does not allow it to comment on a specific patient s case  However  it said local health departments have primary responsibility for conveying blood lead test results to family  Since July  Allen has had all her kids tested  Two had elevated levels  she said  Then  last month  Allen recalled an information packet she d received from the EPA  dated from late 2014  She didn t pay much attention to it back then  because she says she didn t understand its implications  It said the agency had conducted soil testing in her yard  Reading back the findings recently  she said EPA had detected lead at 4 510 parts per million in the top layer of her front yard  or more than 10 times the action level  Arsenic was found at nearly 13 times the action level  It was the yard her older kids had always played in  often tracking in dirt to the apartment  where Samira would crawl around on the floor  Another former West Calumet resident  Krystle

193253,414769,DD,DuPont  DD  Develops Advanced Anti Counterfeiting 3D Film,opinion,"Chemical giant DuPont   NYSE DD   has announced a new 3D anti counterfeiting film to make the packaging industry better equipped at preventing duplications  The company has developed the innovative film using its own imaging technology  which facilitates the integration of anti counterfeiting features directly with the product s label  DuPont will formally showcase the product at the drupa 2016 trade fair to be held in Germany from May 31 June 10 
Existing anti counterfeiting features on packaging materials are widespread and now easily replicated  The company has applied a patented DuPont imaging process to create an effective film with a differentiated 3D look 
The film contains a unique side dot verification design that validates complete 3D imaging with a red security dot which is easily visible for quick authentication of the product  Holograms are generally always visible on the packaging  but this new film is made of holograms that disappear when viewed from an incorrect angle  If customers require  an additional transparent layer can be constructed  which would make the bar code or other details visible from certain angles even if the film is placed over it on the packaging 
The company also offers additional field safety  A semi covert image may be visible when a flashlight is directed over the film to help brand protectors and enforcement agents to quickly authenticate products on the field  These features  as well as the complexity involved in replicating the film  will ensure prevention of counterfeiting 
The company will reveal more of the film s features and its optimum utilization technique in the packaging industry at the fair  The film s ability to enhance brand protection and its uniformity with the company s brand building programs will be further elaborated 
DuPont looks to feature several other technologies at the trade fair  The company has developed technology to enhance quality in the printing and packaging industry through its Cyrel TD System  Tyvek Graphics and DuPont Digital Printing  Its Cyrel Easy technology that makes flexoraphic plate making easier and more striking will also be featured 
Revenues from DuPont s Protection Solutions segment fell 8  year over year to  729 million in first quarter 2016  Operating earnings rose 5  to  176 million as cost reductions and improved utilization at the Chambers Works plant more than offset unfavorable currency impact and lower volumes

When the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  last met on July 26 27  some members anticipated that economic conditions would soon warrant  taking another step in removing policy accommodation   the minutes showed  It came as some participants judged that market conditions were close to reaching full employment  while most members noted that the rapid recovery of global financial markets in the wake of the Brexit decision provided encouraging signs on the resilience of markets worldwide  At the same time  others emphasized that it was appropriate to wait for additional data to determine whether prices could firm in the coming months  as long term inflation continues to run below the Fed s long term goal of 2

193267,414783,DD,Market s Oil Fueled Start Loses Momentum,opinion,"Early gains for U S  stocks that came courtesy of strength in energy issues on the continued rally in crude oil prices lessened late in the day with stocks finishing mixed  as a lowered growth target out of China and a lack of news on the economic and equity fronts to provide any catalyst may have tempered the early enthusiasm  Meanwhile  Treasuries and the U S  dollar were lower  exhibiting little reaction to a smaller than expected consumer credit report  while gold was higher 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  advanced 67 points  0 4   to 17 074 and the S P 500 Index was 2 points  0 1   higher at 2 002  while the Nasdaq Composite lost 9 points  0 2   to 4 708  In heavy volume  1 1 billion shares were traded on the NYSE and 2 1 billion shares changed hands on the Nasdaq  WTI crude oil jumped  1 98 to  37 90 per barrel and wholesale gasoline was  0 06 higher at  1 39 per gallon  while the Bloomberg gold spot price rose  9 06 to  1 268 01 per ounce  Elsewhere  the Dollar Index a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies was 0 3  lower at 97 10

Consumer credit less than expected  U S  economic week relatively subdued this week
Consumer credit  released in the final hour of trading  showed consumer borrowing expanded by  10 5 billion during January  well short of the  16 5 billion forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg  while December s figure was adjusted upward to an increase of  21 4 billion from the originally reported  21 3 billion  Non revolving debt  which includes student loans and loans for vehicles and mobile homes  rose  11 6 billion  while revolving debt  which includes credit cards  fell by  1 1 billion 
Treasuries were lower  as the yield on the 2 year note rose 5 basis points  bps  to 0 91   the yield on the 10 year note added 3 bps to 1 91   while the 30 year bond rate was flat at 2 70  
This week  the U S  economic docket will take a bit of a breather  with the key releases being wholesale inventories and weekly jobless claims  as well as tomorrow s NFIB Small Business Optimism Index  which is expected to tick higher to a reading of 94 0 for February from the 93 9 registered in January  However  the global markets will likely focus across the pond  with Thursday s highly anticipated monetary policy meeting from the European Central Bank  ECB   which will be preceded by the eurozone s preliminary 4Q GDP report  The ECB needs to avoid actions that may undermine the financial sector to help sustain the stock market rally  Investors may want to watch for several key developments that could help determine the direction for Europe s stock market  A cut to the key rate on banks  deposits at the ECB is priced into futures markets  but a bigger cut may be viewed negatively by investors since it may raise banks  costs  An introduction of a tiered system to shield some of banks  deposits from the cost of negative interest rates would likely be viewed as a positive by the stock market  Any expansion of the ECB s quantitative easing  QE  asset purchase program from the current monthly pace of 60 billion euros may be welcomed by market participants 
European stocks see pressure ahead of ECB decision  Asia mixed 
European equities traded mostly lower  retreating from their recent rally amid some caution ahead of Thursday s key monetary policy meeting from the ECB  Financials fell amid festering concerns about the Italian banking sector  while oil and gas issues showed some resiliency to help the markets pare losses as crude oil prices gained steam throughout the day  despite a lowered economic growth target out of China  Economic data in the region was mixed  with eurozone investor confidence surprisingly declining  while German factory orders dipped 0 1  in January  versus the expected 0 3  decrease  The euro traded lower versus the U S  dollar before battling back after Europe s closing bell  while bond yields in the region were mixed 
Asian stocks finished mixed following Friday s U S  labor report  which showed job growth was stronger than expected  though wages unexpectedly dipped in February  Also  traders digested China s National People s Congress meeting  where it lowered its 2016 growth target to 6 5 7 0   from last year s around 7 0  target  while it said it will raise its money supply growth and will allow a record high deficit  per Bloomberg  Mainland Chinese stocks  as did those traded in Australia and South Korea  but securities listed in Hong Kong Hang and Japan declined  while markets in India were closed for a holiday

Gold
On Wednesday gold inched up amid a sharply weaker dollar  as investors continued to prepare for next week s critical Federal Reserve meeting  But after reaching near one month highs in the U S  morning session  gold fell back again amid a wave of profit taking  before turning positive just before the close of trading  The precious metal still remains near six year lows from last week  A rate hike is viewed as bearish for gold  which is not attached to interest rates and struggles to compete with high yield bearing assets

193300,414816,DD,Gap And Go ,opinion,"Gaps are important  Gaps on charts can show powerful shifts in market dynamics and we can identify some interesting tendencies around these gaps  Intraday traders often find an edge in fading gaps  but let s look today what happens over a longer time span  Consider the daily chart of EI du Pont de Nemours and Company  NYSE DD  below  which shows a large gap to today s session open 

Daily DD with a large gap down opening  What might we expect over the next few weeks 
One thing to keep in mind is that stocks tend to mean revert  meaning that big moves on stocks tend to reverse  This is true across a very large sample of data on many time frames  so  to some extent  we don t really care what is driving the gap news wise   In this case  it is due to DuPont winning a proxy fight   All other things being equal  we might expect DD to float upwards over the next few sessions and at least partially close the gap  But  all other things are so rarely equal  in this case  there is an interesting and potentially important higher time frame influence  Take a look at the weekly chart 

A sell Anti is breaking down targets a downside extension toward  65 00 
On the weekly chart  we have an active sell Anti  which is one of the more powerful and useful patterns I have traded over the years   I cover this pattern and how to trade it in considerable detail in my free trading course   This is a simple pattern which basically looks for an established trend  uptrend  for DD   and then waits for a volatile shock against the direction of the trend  On the weekly chart  this was the downswing into the end of the first quarter 2015  Following a period of consolidation  which usually slopes in the direction of the preexisting trend  up   we are on guard for another downswing that will look roughly like the first downswing  in terms of length and volatility 
So  we have a higher time frame influence in DD that probably targets a move into the mid 60 s  Forget all the exact ratio projections and Fibonacci garbage it doesn t matter and it doesn t really work that well  What you need to know is that there is a higher time frame influence that is likely to act like a weight on the stock price 
What do you do with this information  Well  one of the practical problems of trading is execution  if you want to short  shorting into today s gap may be a difficult play  and your stop is probably around or above 76 00  This is not a problem because we likely have a run of that magnitude with a better than 50  probability we don t need to be obsessed about finding some theoretical high reward risk ratio trade  but it does mean that our position size might be smaller than we wish  However  for some traders  shorting into this gap might be a viable strategy   It would be a mistake  if you were seeing a pattern like this in backtesting  to think that you could have executed somewhere in the gap  Possible  but exceedingly unlikely  even if you respond quickly to news  The spread in that gap could have been several points wide at time execution is very difficult  
Some traders might try to  nickle and dime  the market  playing around on the daily or intraday chart in alignment with the weekly trend  That might work for some people  but it also can lead to a lot of small losses that do add up  and general frustration with trades that don t work out 
Another possibility is simply to be very cautious about buying this gap  If you normally would look for gap closure  but careful here because of the higher time frame influence  Of course  the gap may close  which simply would have been a losing trade for the short on the weekly time frame there certainly are many losing trades out there waiting to happen  Perhaps  though  if you re looking for gap closure  you would not want to blindly buy this stock  you might require stronger confirmation or you might be quicker to take profits  knowing that you were potentially fighting a strong higher time frame influence 
This is another case of seeing how higher time frame technical influences can shape price patterns and price directions on lower time frames  Let s watch how this one plays out over the next few weeks ",2015-05-13,Adam Grimes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gap-and-go-251670,251670

instead of black or red  A button mushroom that doesn t turn brown  Pigs that don t fall sick  These are all ideas thrown up by gene editing  the new technology taking the biomedical world by storm  and one which also promises a revolution down on the farm  It poses a thorny problem for European policymakers wary of new molecular manipulation in agriculture after a quarter century of conflict over genetically modified food   In a research lab in Norwich  100 miles northeast of London  Wendy Harwood is making exact DNA tweaks in barley plants to produce better germinating grain  with higher yield and quality    We ve never been able to go in and make such a precise change as we can now with gene editing   said the John Innes Centre scientist   This gives you exactly the change you want without anything you don t want   Further to the south of England in Basingstoke  animal genetics firm Genus has tapped the same  CRISPR Cas9  technique to develop the world s first pigs resistant to a devastating and common viral disease  in a tie up with U S  researchers   Agricultural scientists and companies worldwide are joining the gene editing race  including seeds giant  Monsanto   NYSE

wheat on the market in five to 10 years  Bright ideas from others include improved varieties of rice  soybeans and tomatoes  as well as hornless cattle and the heat tolerant breed of Angus  Using  molecular scissors  to cut DNA means scientists can edit genomes more precisely and rapidly than ever before  and agricultural products   which don t need the same clinical trials as human drugs   could get to market relatively quickly  U S  GREEN LIGHT Last month  a non browning button mushroom became the first CRISPR edited organism to get a green light from the U S  government   and several crops developed with two older  less efficient editing tools have already been waved through  But whether such products will ever arrive on European farms is another matter  since the European Commission has so far not made a decision on how they will be regulated  leaving the new science in limbo  The EU executive had been due to decide by the end of 2015 whether to class gene edited products as genetically modified organisms  GMOs   subjecting them to the same stringent restrictions that have curbed GMO use in Europe   This deadline was missed  as was a second one of end March 2016  and there is now no new timeline for a decision  Both sides in the debate are worried   Greenpeace wants the EU s GMO law to be fully applied to  new breeding techniques   NBT  like gene editing  because of potential environmental and health impacts  and it fears Brussels is dithering under pressure from Washington   We are concerned that we would get products that are risky but could arrive on the market without any risk assessment or labeling or detection methods   said spokeswoman Franziska Achterberg   She believes the EU has delayed regulation to pave the way for a transatlantic trade deal  citing a document in which a U S  official warned that  different regulatory approaches between governments to NBT classification would lead to potentially significant trade disruptions   A Commission spokesman denied the delays had anything to do with the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership trade pact talks  but could not say when the EU would make a ruling  Biotechnology companies  meanwhile  argue their gene edited products are  non GMO   since they do not contain foreign DNA from a different species   We fundamentally see gene editing as being very distinct from GMO   said Genus Chief Executive Karim Bitar   It s a very precise cut and there is no movement of genes from one species to another  That s a major attraction   FIND AND REPLACE FUNCTION  The argument is complex   Unlike traditional GMOs  in which a gene is added from another organism  gene editing works like the find and replace function on a word processor  It finds a gene and then makes changes by amending or deleting it  Proponents argue this makes it similar to conventional selective breeding  which is freely allowed in the EU  since such mutations within the same species can   and do   also occur naturally  Rene Smulders  a plant breeder at Wageningen University in the Netherlands  says the current uncertainty is affecting research  His group had a grant application turned down last year because of concerns about the legal situation  He wants Europe to follow the lead of Canada  which decides on new products based on their traits  not how those traits were produced   Europe s process based legislation creates problems and is not suitable for the future   Smulders said  Cellectis CEO Andre Choulika  whose Calyxt unit has used older forms of gene editing to improve potatoes  wheat and soybeans  thinks the odds are 50 50 that gene editing will end up being classified as GMO in Europe

The PEG ratio is now 1 84 x   consistently below the 2 5 x    3 x  range from last year 
The  earnings yield  on the S P 500 continues to shrink  and closed Friday  June 27th at 6 27  
The year over year growth rate of the forward estimate rose to 8 69  this past week  versus 8 60  last week 
Analysis   Commentary  Next week  as we roll into the 3rd calendar quarter of 2014   wow  how time flies  we will get the quarterly bump in the  forward 4 quarter  earnings estimate  which  given its history  should approximate  125 per share or more  when we get the number from Thomson Reuter s  This Week in Earnings  next Thursday July 3rd or Friday  July 4th  Using this week s closing value on the S P 500  and next week s expected  125 per share  the expected forward P E ratio will be around 15 7 x   slightly lower than this week s closing P E ratio 
The DuPont  NYSE DD  negative pre announcement this past week was one of the few major negative surprises that come to mind over the last month 
What continues to surprise me is the stability about the forward earnings estimates  and the lack of volatility  Although the absolute number of negative revisions of forward 2014 estimates has outnumbered the positive revisions  my own opinion is that the negative revisions are so small as a percentage of the dollar earnings per share  EPS  estimates  that the difference is minimal 
John Butters of Factset has picked up on the fact that Q2  14 expected S P 500 earnings growth estimates are being reduced at a much lower rate than previous quarters  We also saw this last fall for Q4  13  The expected Q2  14 S P 500 earnings growth for Q2  14 was  7  on May 30th  2014  and as of Friday  June 27th  has been reduced to just  6 6  
If you ve followed the data as long as I have  that Q2  14 growth rate reduction would normally be close to 1 5    2   not 40 basis points  Again  that is the 30 day reduction  not the 90 day reduction  Per Factset  the average decline in the EPS estimate over the last 4 quarters has been 3 9   the last 20 quarters has seen EPS decline  on average  by 2 90  and the last 40 quarters  4 6   What Factset isn t telling you is that typically through the quarter  the expected growth rate reduction gets more severe and then typically bottoms the first two weeks of the new quarter  and begins to rise when actual quarterly earnings are reported 
Jeff Miller  a great blogger and long time friend who writes the  A Dash of Insight  blog and I have talked about this phenomenon many times  using sector and S P 500 earnings estimates  the typical pattern for the consensus analyst estimates and growth rates is that the analysts start out optimistic 12   18 months out  then  once inside 12 months  start to gradually reduce their earnings estimates which typically reach a nadir just prior to the actual quarterly results being reported  and then the growth rate rises on actual earnings reports 
At least that has been the trend  post the 2008 Great Recession and Financial Crisis 
I will conclude our last post on Q2  14 S P 500 earnings with this comment  Analyzing S P 500 earnings is not a sound bite that you can give for a CNBC interview  Analyzing the data over longer time frames is a combination of different time horizons   for instance  Q2  14 expected earnings  versus Q1  14  and then watching how forward revisions are being changed  e g  watching the reduction the reduction in Q1  14 growth rate estimates and then the lack of reductions in Q2  14 growth rate estimates  all the time keeping an eye on the full year 2014 expected growth rate estimate   and the  relative  versus  absolute  game  For instance  in Q2  14  the Basic Materials sector has seen the sharpest downward revisions to expected growth for Q2  14 earnings  greater than any other S P 500 sector  and yet if we ranked the 10 S P 500 sectors by expected Q2  14 y y earnings growth rates  the Basic Materials sector would rank in the top 3 expected quarterly growth rates   That just tells me that analyst consensus started out too optimistically  and now the growth estimates are probably  reasonable  
This isn t a criticism of CNBC  but the punditry comments around S P 500 earnings are usually picked to fit the forecast  rather than  as Jeff Miller has long opined  the data is scrutinized and analyzed  and the forecast is a function of the data  I can t tell you how many times there has been a Strategist or Portfolio manager on CNBC who has used the  negative revision  data of S P 500 earnings to support a bearish outlook  without telling viewers at the same time  that S P 500 consensus operating earnings have been growing steadily higher since 2009 
S P 500 earnings   using the forward growth rate   look to be getting stronger as we progress through 2014  I still think we could see 10  y y growth in S P 500 operating earnings growth in 2014

193317,414833,DD,Bayer offers to buy Monsanto in global agrochemicals shakeout,news,By Greg Roumeliotis and Mike Stone NEW YORK FRANKFURT  Reuters    German drugs and chemicals group Bayer has made an unsolicited takeover proposal to U S  seeds company  Monsanto   NYSE MON   aiming to create the world s biggest agricultural supplier and take advantage of converging pesticides and seeds markets  Monsanto disclosed the approach on Wednesday before Bayer confirmed its move  though neither released proposed terms   The  42 billion market capitalization of Monsanto means that the deal would be likely to eclipse ChemChina s planned acquisition of Swiss agrichemicals company Syngenta    a target Monsanto itself pursued last year    and could face U S  antitrust hurdles  A Monsanto statement said that its board was reviewing the proposal  which is subject to due diligence  regulatory approvals and other conditions  There is no assurance that any transaction will take place  it added   Bayer shares dropped more than 8 percent to a 2 1 2 year low of 88 39 euros in early Thursday trading  with some investors worried by the potential cost of a deal   Monsanto shares were seen 7 6 percent higher at  104 50 in pre market trades  UBS Global Asset Management  which Reuters data shows is among Bayer s 30 biggest investors  said it was  deeply concerned  about the burden on Bayer s finances from a takeover  saying it would prefer the companies to agree a joint venture or a nil premium merger   Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  analysts said a deal could shift Bayer s center of gravity to agriculture  accounting for about 55 percent of core earnings  up from roughly 28 percent last year excluding the Covestro chemicals business Bayer plans to sell  That would have a negative impact on sentiment among Bayer s healthcare focused investor base  the bank said  PRICE ESTIMATES Bayer  which has a market value of  90 billion  said the merger would create  a leading integrated agriculture business   referring to Bayer s push to seek more synergies from combining the development and sale of seeds and crop protection chemicals  Most of the major agrichemical companies are aiming to genetically engineer more robust plants and custom build chemicals to go with them  selling them together to farmers who are struggling to contend with low commodity prices   While no takeover price was mentioned by either company  Bernstein Research analyst Jeremy Redenius estimated that it would be 41 9 billion euros   47 billion   plus 6 7 billion euros in assumed debt  He said that Bayer might need a 27 billion euro share issue to help to fund the purchase   Citi analysts have said that Bayer would probably need to pay 14 16 times Monsanto s core earnings  implying a takeover price including debt of 57 billion euros to 65 billion euros  A sale of Bayer s stake in foam chemicals maker Covestro could raise about 4 billion euros  while its animal health business  which Bayer has said it might put on the block  could fetch up to 7 billion euros   The proposal comes as ChemChina s deal for Syngenta faces regulatory review in the United States over concerns about the security of U S  food supply  Any deal between Bayer and Monsanto  which would be Bayer s largest by far and dwarf the 17 billion euro takeover of drugmaker Schering in 2006  could raise U S  antitrust concerns because of an overlap in seeds business  particularly in soybeans  cotton and canola  antitrust experts have said  The proposal comes less than three weeks after Werner Baumann took over as Bayer chief executive  a sign of the power base he built in his previous role as strategy chief  Bayer  the inventor of aspirin and maker of Yasmin birth control pills  is far more diversified than Syngenta or Monsanto  with products including cancer drugs  flea and tick collars for pets and Coppertone sunscreen  Some analysts have said a deal with Monsanto could lead to a break up of the group  Bayer s crop science division has businesses in seeds  crop protection and non agricultural pest control  potentially complementing Monsanto s seeds assets  BAYER  BASF AMBITIONS Both Bayer and German rival BASF SE  DE BASFN  have been looking to build scale in agrichemicals  Monsanto said after its failure to land Syngenta that it didn t need to do a deal  but it has also been involved in discussions   Monsanto approached Bayer this year to express interest in the latter s crop science unit  in the form of an acquisition or joint venture  sources told Reuters in March  Both Bayer and BASF had been exploring tie ups with Monsanto for months but valuation concerns have made a deal elusive  sources have said  Bayer is ranked No  2 in crop chemicals  with an 18 percent market share  just behind Syngenta on 19 percent  industry data shows   Monsanto is the leader in seeds  with a 26 percent market share  followed by DuPont  NYSE DD  with 21 percent  DuPont agreed last year to merge with  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW   Any Bayer Monsanto deal would further reduce the number of major players in seeds and pesticides to four from six   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  and Ducera Partners

offered to buy U S  seeds company  Monsanto   NYSE MON  for  62 billion in cash  defying some of its own shareholders in a bid to grab the top spot in a fast consolidating farm supplies industry   Monsanto Co s stock ended trading up 4 4 percent at  106 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday  well below Bayer s  122 per share cash offer price  in a sign that it faces a tough task convincing the St  Louis based company to sign off on the deal  Monsanto has said it would review the proposal  Some analysts have suggested Bayer might still have to pay more   The price that has now been disclosed is at the upper limit and it is just about economical  Should it rise further  which is to be assumed  the takeover will become increasingly unattractive   said Markus Manns  a fund manager at Union Investment  Bayer s 14th biggest investor Other Bayer shareholders have also responded coldly to the company s pursuit  condemned by one Bayer investor as  arrogant empire building  when news of the proposal emerged last week  The unsolicited proposal would be the largest all cash takeover on record  according to Thomson Reuters data  just ahead of InBev s  60 4 billion offer for Anheuser Busch in June 2008  The move would also eclipse a planned combination of peers  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW  and DuPont s agriculture units and comes just three weeks after Werner Baumann took over as Bayer CEO   Giving details for the first time  Bayer said on Monday it would offer  122 per share  a 37 percent premium to Monsanto s stock price before rumors of a bid surfaced    We fully expect a positive answer of the Monsanto board of directors   Baumann told reporters on a conference call  describing criticism from some investors as  an uneducated reaction in the media  when deal terms were not yet known  and driven by an element of surprise  Monsanto  which said last week it had a received an approach from Bayer but gave no details  declined to comment  Seven of Monsanto s top 20 investors declined to comment about Bayer s offer when contacted by Reuters  Others could not be immediately reached for comment   Antitrust experts see an overlap in the seeds business  particularly in soybeans  cotton and canola  Bayer s LibertyLink line of weed killers  plus crops that are resistant to it  are an important alternative for farmers suffering from weeds that have grown resistant to Monsanto s Roundup herbicide  Shares of Bayer  which had already fallen 14 percent since rumors of a bid emerged last week  ended trading down 5 7 percent on Monday to a new 2 1 2 year low of 84 42 euros   FULL PRICE  Global agrochemicals companies are racing to consolidate  partly in response to a drop in commodity prices that has hit farm incomes  and also due to the growing convergence between seeds and pesticides markets  ChemChina is buying Switzerland s Syngenta for  43 billion after Syngenta rejected a bid from Monsanto  while Dow and DuPont  NYSE DD  are forging a  130 billion business  With German rival BASF SE  DE BASFN  also looking into a possible tie up with Monsanto  Bayer has moved to avoid being left behind   Baumann rejected suggestions from some investors that Bayer should instead try to forge a joint venture with Monsanto  saying this would have tax disadvantages   Monsanto approached Bayer in March to express interest in its crop science unit  Reuters reported at the time  Among the possibilities discussed were an outright acquisition of the crop science unit and a joint venture  or other type of partnership between the two companies  Sources close to the matter have said BASF is unlikely to start a bidding war with Bayer  BASF declined to comment on Monday   But analysts say Bayer might still have to pay more to persuade Monsanto and its shareholders to sell up   That could be a problem  with some saying Bayer s proposal  at 15 8 times Monsanto s earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  for the year ended Feb  29  is already a stretch for the German company   Berenberg analyst John Klein said Monsanto and its shareholders were likely to argue that based on 2017 EBITDA expectations  the bid would represent a multiple of only 14 times  compared with the nearly 16 times ChemChina agreed to pay for Syngenta When pressed by analysts whether Bayer might sweeten its bid  Baumann said the offer reflected Monsanto s value   We are putting forward a very  very full price   he said  AMBITIOUS SYNERGIES Bayer said it would finance the bid with a combination of debt and equity  primarily a share sale to existing investors  Equity would account for about a quarter of the deal value  Equinet analyst Marietta Miemietz  who has a  buy  rating on Bayer stock  said the extra debt appeared manageable but could limit Bayer s ability to invest in its healthcare business  which some analysts think needs a boost to its drugs pipeline   Baumann said Bayer would continue to develop its healthcare arm  which includes stroke prevention pill Xarelto and aspirin  the painkiller it invented more than a century ago    We are not feeding Peter by starving Paul here   he said  adding no asset sales were planned to help pay for the deal  Bayer also forecast synergies from a deal with Monsanto would boost annual earnings by around  1 5 billion after three years  plus additional future benefits from integrated product offerings   a reference to its push to combine the development and sale of seeds and crop protection chemicals

193322,414838,DD,Book Review  Everybody Ought To Be Rich,opinion,No  this is not some witless self help book  Rather  Everybody Ought to Be Rich  Oxford University Press  2013  is  as the subtitle says  an account of The Life and Times of John J  Raskob  Capitalist  Never heard of him  Perhaps that s because  he never ran a major corporation  He never invented a noteworthy product  Even when he started up a new enterprise he almost never took public credit for his accomplishment  When he built the tallest skyscraper in the world the Empire State Building he did not name that building after himself  as his close friend and rival Walter Chrysler had done with his own venture   Nevertheless  he was a key player in the rise of American capitalism   In partnership with the great industrialists and financiers of his time he put his knowledge to work  buying up companies  leveraging investments  creating new pools of credit for both the rich investor and the middle class consumer  reorganizing corporations  plotting hostile takeovers  financing skyscrapers  and channeling money into the political system    p  4   David Farber s biography traces Raskob s life from his birth in Lockport  New York  in 1879 to his death in 1950  Although Farber devotes a large chunk of the book to Raskob s chairmanship of the Democratic Party during Al Smith s unsuccessful bid for the presidency  Roosevelt summarily fired him after he got the party s nod in 1932  and his generous support for Catholic charities  Raskob s contributions to American capitalism are the real story here   Raskob began his career as an assistant to Pierre du Pont and eventually became treasurer of the DuPont Company  He realized soon enough  however  that he couldn t advance further at DuPont  the top spots were reserved for family members   By 1915  Raskob had come to believe that an unstable  upstart auto company  the General Motors Corporation  offered the best opportunity    p  100  In that year  in the wake of a fight for control of GM  du Pont was named chairman of the board and Raskob became a member of the board  But Raskob would move only in stages from DuPont to GM  There was still work to be done at DuPont  including a major restructuring of the company s finances  among other things replacing old bonded debt with stock   By the mid 1910s  as a consequence of his leveraged purchases of both DuPont and GM stock  Raskob was  a capitalist of the first order  no longer beholden to salary or bonuses    p  120  He continued to engineer financial deals  In one of the most notable  he established and financed a holding company  owned by DuPont  that would buy over  25 million in GM and Chevrolet stock  DuPont owned 23 83  of GM Chevrolet  Raskob subsequently became head of the GM Finance Committee   ruled by DuPont Company officials    In early 1918 Raskob proposed that GM enter the auto installment financing business  at the beginning of 1919 the General Motors Acceptance Corporation launched  By April 1922 GMAC had financed 146 937 consumer sales   Raskob was an early advocate of profit sharing plans in the form of stock ownership  The plan that eventually

193328,414844,DD,Dow Chemical s margins hit decade high on pre merger cost cutting,news,"By Amrutha Gayathri and Swetha Gopinath
 Reuters     Dow Chemical  Co  N DOW   the No  1 U S  chemical maker by sales  reported a higher than expected adjusted profit as cost cutting ratcheted up margins to their highest in more than a decade 
Dow has been clearing the decks ahead of its  130 billion merger with traditional rival DuPont  N DD  by slashing administration costs and laying off employees 
The deal  due to close later this year  is the first step toward breaking the businesses into three separate companies focused on agriculture  material science and specialty products 
The merger is expected to create cost synergies of about  3 billion  the companies have said 
However  Dow s chief financial officer  Howard Ungerleider  indicated on Thursday that further cost savings were likely 
 We feel very good that  3 billion in synergies we announced in December is a floor  not a ceiling   he told Reuters 
Dow plans to slash costs by  300 million this year  Of that   90 million was cut in the first quarter  Ungerleider said 
Dow s strategy to focus on high margin products by shedding volatile commodity businesses such as its century old chlorine business has also been paying off 
 We see strong demand signals in North America  gradual recovery in Europe and ongoing sustainable urbanization in China   Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said in a statement announcing the company s first quarter results 
Dow is seeing continued strength in the packaging  transportation and infrastructure markets  said Liveris  who plans to retire by mid 2017 
The company s operating margin expanded by 164 basis points to 21 1 percent on an EBITDA basis in quarter 
However  net income available to the company s common shareholders fell 87 9 percent  mainly due to a charge related to the settlement of a class action suit 
Dow agreed in February to pay  835 million to settle a decade long lawsuit  Several companies  including Dow  were accused by customers in a 2005 lawsuit of conspiring to fix prices of urethane chemicals in the preceding six years 
The company s net income fell to  169 million  or 15 cents per share  in the quarter  from  1 39 billion  or  1 18 per share  a year earlier 
Excluding the legal charge and other items  Dow earned 89 cents per share  beating analysts  average estimate of 83 cents  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
Net sales fell 13 5 percent to  10 70 billion  beating the average forecast of  10 66 billion

their fields  contaminating soil  cutting crop yields and putting both food security and human health at risk in the country of 1 25 billion people  The use of spurious pesticides has exacerbated losses in the genetically modified  GM  cotton crop in northern India after an attack by whitefly  a pest  say officials  If unchecked  some of India s roughly  26 billion in annual farm exports could be hit  Made secretly and given names that sometimes resemble the original  counterfeits account for up to 30 percent of the  4 billion pesticide market  according to a government endorsed study  And they are gaining market share in what is the world s No 4 pesticide maker and sixth biggest exporter  Influential dealers in small towns peddle high margin fake products to gullible farmers  in turn

spray on the crop   said Harbans Singh  a farmer in Punjab s Bathinda region  whose three acre  1 2 hectare  GM cotton crop was damaged by whitefly this year   It s a double loss when you see the crop wilting away and your money is spent on pesticides that don t work   But S N  Sushil  who heads India s top pesticide testing laboratory in Faridabad  near Delhi  said farmers panic at the first sight of a pest attack  As a result  they overuse chemicals  reducing their effectiveness and raising costs  Sushil s team worked overtime after Punjab sent nearly 1 000 samples of suspect pesticides following the whitefly outbreak  finding some to be falsely labeled  Indian officials tested nearly 50 000 pesticide samples last fiscal year  finding around 3 percent of them  misbranded   Sushil said  He added the government was increasing inspections and looking to increase penalties  including jail terms of up to 10 years  TOXIC RACKET Lax laws  which punish by revoking licenses or imposing short jail terms for offenders  and staffing shortages compromise efforts to track and seize substandard products  Toxic pesticides that are banned abroad continue  meanwhile  to be sold freely in

said Shyam Khadka  FAO s India representative   Now if they turn out to be spurious it s a cause for even greater worry   Chronic exposure to pesticides can lead to depression  a factor in suicides  he said  Pesticides can also cause cancer  In recent years the European Union and Saudi Arabia temporarily stopped buying some vegetables from India after finding pesticide residues in produce  Indian officials say such cases result from the overuse of chemicals  RAPID GROWTH IN FAKES India s fake pesticide industry is expanding at 20 percent per year while the overall market is growing at 12 percent   We know that a racket is going on   said P K  Chakrabarty  an assistant director general of Indian Council of Agricultural Research   But it is only when suspicion arises that people go to inspect   He also said illegal chemicals are imported  under the garb of good material   and that there was a  definite risk  of some fake pesticides being exported from India  although there was no evidence yet   Theoretically it becomes a risk  but practically there are checks and balances   said Gantakolla Srivastava  CEO of CropLife India  an association of the top pesticide companies

Shares of the largest U S  chemical company rose as much as 4 5 percent in early trading on Friday 
The four new directors will be among Dow s nominees for election at the 2015 annual meeting  The company has also agreed to reduce the size of its board to 12 members from 13 before its 2016 annual meeting 
Dow said Third Point  one of its biggest investors with a 2 percent stake  has signed a one year standstill agreement with the company 
The  17 5 billion hedge fund was considering a proxy contest after negotiations with Dow over board seats broke down  Reuters had reported on Thursday 
The fund is known for pushing companies  including Yahoo Inc  O YHOO  and Sotheby s  N BID   to perform better 
Loeb  one of the hedge fund industry s most closely watched investors  has been pushing Dow to spin off its lucrative but slow growing petrochemical business and focus on specialty materials 
He had suggested that Dow s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization could rise by about  2 5 billion a year if it focused on selling basic petrochemicals such as ethylene and propylene on the open market rather than using them to make foams  glues and other consumer products 
The company  however  defended its strategy of using its commoditized raw materials businesses to keep costs down 
A number of chemical companies  including DuPont  N DD   have come under investor pressure to separate less stable businesses and raise shareholder returns

  Recasts with location of planned acquisitions 
 By Harro ten Wolde and Andrew Macdonald
 AMSTERDAM LONDON  Sept 11  Reuters    Dutch property firm
VastNed Retail said on Friday it had raised 75 6 million euros
  110 4 million  from a placement of new shares  to buy 50
million euros worth of retail shops in Turkey and Belgium 
 The 1 66 million new shares  representing up to 9 9 percent
of VastNed s equity  were offered through an accelerated
bookbuilding  The money would also be used to strengthen VastNed
Retail s financial position  VastNed said 
 VastNed s general counsel  Arnaud du Pont  said 50 million
euros of the money would be spent over the next six months on
buying and developing shops in central Istanbul and Belgian
retail parks 
 A further 50 million euros  including 25 million euros of
debt  would be put towards the firm s 55 million euro
development pipeline for the next six to nine months  du Pont
told Reuters 
 When asked how much of the 75 6 million euros would be used
to bolster the balance sheet  he said   I can t say that exactly
because it depends on the development of the acquisitions  It s
hard to say right now  
 The company s loan to value would fall marginally below its
current 42 percent  against a covenant limit of 55 percent 
 VastNed shares were down 7 76 percent at 45 20 euros by 1526
GMT  underperforming a 0 68 percent gain in the Amsterdam midcap
index 
 Petercam analyst Pieter van der Meijden said the discount
VastNed had to offer was less than he expected 
  We had anticipated that they at least had to offer a 10
percent discount  while they ended up offering between 7 to 8
percent   he said 
 As a result of the dilution caused by the offering  VastNed
said it now expects a direct investment result  or rental income
minus costs  in 2009 of about 4 00 euros per share  from its
previous guidance of at least 4 00 euros 
 ING Bank was sole bookrunner for the offering

193514,415030,DD,UPDATE 3 India  Brazil to take EU to court in generics row,news,"  India  Brazil decide on case against EU on generics
   No date for launching case
   Case triggered by Dutch seizure of blood pressure drug
   Drug was generic made in India en route for Brazil
 
  Adds EU comment 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA  Oct 22  Reuters    India and Brazil will take the
European Union to court at the World Trade Organisation 
diplomats said on Thursday  raising the stakes in a bitter
dispute over seizures of generic drugs 
 WTO ambassadors from the two emerging powers told Reuters 
their governments had decided to request consultations with the
EU in the row  the first step in launching a formal trade
dispute 
 Developing countries believe the case  originally involving
the seizure by Dutch customs of a blood pressure drug en route
from India to Brazil last December  is a symbol of their
mistreatment by rich nations and corporations 
 It also sums up a major dilemma in trade and intellectual
property policy    how to reconcile the provision of affordable
medicine to people in poor countries with the need to encourage
medical research through patent protection  
  We ve taken the decision to launch consultations   India s
WTO ambassador Ujal Singh Bhatia told Reuters   We re just
completing the procedural work  
  As of now the decision in Brasilia is to move forward  
Brazil s WTO ambassador Roberto Azevedo said 
 The two have not yet decided when to notify the request
formally to the WTO  as they continue to prepare the case 
 Sounding a conciliatory note  the European Commission said
it took access to medicines for developing countries seriously
and was examining the seizures of drugs last year 
  The Commission agrees that necessary action against
counterfeit and dangerous medicines should not be at the expense
of trade in genuine generic medicines   Lutz Guellner  spokesman
for European Trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton  told Reuters 
 Ashton had discussed the question with India s Commerce and
Industry Minister Anand Sharma earlier this month and agreed to
continue working on it  he said 
 
  DOUBLE STANDARDS 
 In a report this week  campaign groups Oxfam and Health
Action International accused Europe of double standards by
cracking down on medicine prices at home while undermining
access to cheap drugs in poor countries 
 Since late 2008  Dutch and German officials have made
customs seizures totalling 19 shipments of generic medicines
bound for developing countries  Oxfam and HAI said 
 Elise Ford  Oxfam head of EU advocacy  said the action would
result in higher medicine prices in developing countries  just
as the European Commission was stepping up its own campaign to
ensure access to cheap generics within EU member states 
 European antitrust regulators have launched a series of
raids of pharmaceutical companies since January 2008 in a bid to
uncover potentially illegal blocks on generics  which they
suspect are pushing up costs for EU healthcare systems 
 India and Brazil say last December s seizure  which has
since been repeated  is part of a pattern by rich nations to
claw back special treatment agreed for poor countries 
 The EU says it has the right to inspect generic drugs in
transit to protect its citizens and people in developing
countries from fake medicines 
 Last December s seizure involved a shipment of losartan  the
generic name for Merck   Co s blood pressure drug Cozaar  which
was developed jointly by Merck and E I du Pont de Nemours   Co 
 The drugs had been exported by India s Dr Reddys
Laboratories Ltd  which flew them back to India after customs
released them 
 Formally  under WTO rules  India and Brazil would launch
separate complaints  although these could be consolidated into a
single case 
  The legal teams are already talking to each other and
getting ready   Azevedo said   If there s a claim by one then
the other has to make a claim that is consistent
