189059,410575,ATVI,YouTube s Latest Bet on eSports Is a Quiet Win for Activision Blizzard,news,"At first glance  the news looks like a small victory for Alphabet s  NASDAQ GOOG   NASDAQ GOOGL  online video platform YouTube  and a small loss for Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN  video game streaming site platform  Watching videos of video game play is a fast growing market with seemingly lots of potential  But it s not exactly a game changer for either company 
YouTube s announcement that it has secured exclusive rights to stream eSports matches for three different leagues  however  was a big  but quiet  win for video game publisher Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI   The Call of Duty  Overwatch  and Hearthstone games that will be the basis of these competitive events are not only among the most popular eSports titles played  but all three games are owned and regularly updated by Activision Blizzard  Now those titles are centerpieces at the world s most popular website other than Google s search page 
That s kind of a big deal 
Yes  professional video gaming is a thing
The idea of professional video gaming was almost laughable a few years ago  The only ones laughing now are the video gamers who have made millions of dollars just for playing in a public arena  Many of those players also operate related side businesses outside of professional gaming  like creating video content for Amazon owned Twitch that s available only to paying subscribers  Some gamers earn more doing the latter than the former 

Even just the eSports numbers alone are stunning  however  Video game market research outfit Newzoo believes the global eSports  economy  is currently on the order of  1 billion per year  while Nielsen s data analysis indicates Overwatch tournament play averaged 313 000 viewers per minute last year  some of which was seen via linear  cable  television  Like any other sporting event  that viewership creates advertising opportunities 
It s the X factor  however  that could mean so much more  Newzoo estimates that the publicity value of such events in the gaming industry collected  160 billion worth of consumers  discretionary budgets last year 
Ticket sales for video game tournaments can rival those of traditional professional sports events like baseball or basketball  There s no telling  however  how valuable it is for hundreds of thousands of viewers to watch someone else playing your game title  Young  and not so young  people often dream of becoming the next millionaire superstar on the video game circuit  But to do so  they first have to buy and play the game  And like baseball and football  licensed merchandise sales are a big part of the video gaming industry s total revenue 
Activision Blizzard choosing to make an exclusive commitment with YouTube    and abandon Twitch in the process    speaks volumes about the maturity the game developer sees in the eSports industry  as well as the monetizable depth of these three particular games  YouTube  in fact  could be the last piece of the puzzle for Activision Blizzard s eSports ambitions 
YouTube is well positioned at the convergence
As popular as it may be within gaming circles  Amazon s Twitch is still mostly a destination for serious gamers  by serious gamers  Casual players and bored consumers looking for something besides basketball or football haven t been likely to stumble across Twitch tv  They re even less likely to pay to watch 
YouTube  however  is a different kind of platform  The site already attracts an average of 2 billion different viewers per month who watch an average of 1 billion hours worth of video content every single day  often without looking for anything in particular 
YouTube s video gaming viewership is also already organically strong  More than 200 million users watch some sort of gaming content at the site every day  funneled into the ecosystem by YouTube s Gaming partition  This YouTube niche has yet to foster the sort of gamer loyalty Twitch has  but it s conceivable it will win over more casual  and more numerous  gaming enthusiasts now that eSports is becoming a mainstream form of entertainment  Disney owned ESPN com now covers eSports news  for instance  and high schools are increasingly supporting their own eSports teams 
This evolution of eSports into a mainstream form of entertainment for a wider audience meshes perfectly with YouTube s arguable advantage over Twitch  That is  it s an advertising platform that s been evolving under the Google umbrella for years now 
Viewers at Twitch tv see ads  to be clear  much like they do at YouTube  But it s not a stretch to suggest Alphabet s YouTube    like Google    has perfected the art of displaying the right ads at the right time in the right place  This means gaming tournament sponsors like Activision Blizzard can finally get the most advertising bang for their buck when events are streamed online 
Exactly how much revenue this agreement might drive remains unclear  Alphabet offers little in the way of details about its ad business  and Activision Blizzard may simply not know  Nevertheless  it s a win win partnership that puts the game publisher in a better position to monetize its video game tournaments with a big audience that may not have otherwise watched ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/poewe,2070537
189060,410576,ATVI,3 Drivers for Activision Blizzard s Growth Strategy,news,"Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  is one of the world s largest video game companies  and it has experienced strong growth over the past decade thanks to its continued success releasing popular new titles as well as the growth of the video game industry overall 
Despite encountering some headwinds in 2018  there is good reason to believe Activision will continue to generate robust growth in the coming years 
1  Upcoming game releases
While 2019 turned out to be a lighter year for new titles  Activision s new game pipeline remains attractive  The company doesn t promote new releases until a game is within a year of hitting the market  but several titles are confirmed or rumored to be in development 

Date source  Activision news reports and industry news publications 
Activision s big budget titles will take years to develop and typically produce revenue in the hundreds of millions or more  The company s latest release    Call of Duty  Modern Warfare    grossed over  1 billion in sales in its first few months on the market  Activision will leverage these popular franchises with huge fan followings while also also employing a large marketing budget to ensure gamers are aware of each and every release 
2  Mobile game adaptations
One of the fastest growing subcategories of the gaming industry is mobile  Research firm Newzoo estimates that the market for mobile games was  68 5 billion in 2019  Historically  major developers like Activision have focused on console or PC platforms  but that is changing quickly 
In 2016  Activision acquired King Digital  the maker of Candy Crush  jump starting its entry in mobile games  More recently  the company released a mobile version of Call of Duty  During the latest earnings call  CEO Bobby Kotick noted 

Call of Duty  Mobile is experiencing one of the industry s most successful launches ever  In extending Call of Duty to the largest and fastest growing platform  we ve more than tripled the franchise s reach with over 100 million downloads in the first month alone  The game reached the top of the install charts in over 150 countries and regions  reflecting Call of Duty s global stature  and monetization is off to a strong start with the game entering the top 10 grossing charts in over a 100 countries and regions 

The success of this title proves that Activision has a significant opportunity adapting its most popular franchises for the medium  This lays the groundwork for other games like Overwatch and Starcraft to eventually make their way to smartphones and tablets  The company has already announced that a mobile version of Diablo is on its way 

3  Esports
It may seem far fetched  but there is a large and growing audience of video game spectators  Estimates peg the current global audience for esports at nearly 500 million  and where there is a large audience of engaged fans  there is an opportunity to make money 
Activision Blizzard has been one of the most active esports companies  In 2016  it purchased esports broadcasting company Major League Gaming and established the Overwatch League  which aired its championship finals on ABC and ESPN 
Building off the momentum of the Overwatch League  Activision is getting ready to launch a Call of Duty league and has already sold the rights for 12 teams  with each one fetching tens of millions of dollars  There are plenty of ways to monetize esports  from advertising and merchandise to additional game sales  What s clear is that the company is just getting started in its esports efforts and believes the business will be a major growth driver in the coming years 
A lot to look forward to
Activision has been a good tech stock to its shareholders over the past decade  and given the growth opportunities that lie ahead  that will likely still be the case going forward  Investors should monitor the company s new releases for mobile and the new consoles coming later this year  Growth from esports could be a surprise kicker that makes the stock even more attractive ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqvrq,2075381
189061,410577,ATVI,Why Fans Are Furious Over Activision Blizzard s Latest Game,news,"Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  released Warcraft III  Reforged on Jan  28  and the title will likely go down as a disappointment  The game has managed a user score of just 0 5 out of 10 based on roughly 24 600 ratings tallied on the review aggregating website Metacritic  and fans of the Warcraft series have been vocal about their dissatisfaction on a variety of platforms 
While the game has received better ratings from published reviewers and user ratings can be subject to vote manipulation  it s clear the game is off to a bad start  Warcraft enthusiasts are scorning the release due to a variety of unwelcome changes and glitches  and it hasn t helped that the most recent installment actually made a previous game in the franchise more difficult to play 

What it means for Activision Blizzard
Warcraft III  Reforged is a remake of Warcraft III  a hugely successful strategy game first released in 2002  The new version of the game has evoked the ire of fans by changing a variety of gameplay  story  and aesthetic elements  Making matters worse  Reforged launched alongside a mandatory update for 2002 s Warcraft III that made it more difficult to play the original version of the game  Reforged s developers have published a note saying that they will address some of the issues raised by players  but it s fair to say the recent release was botched 
Warcraft III  Reforged was never positioned as a make or break title for Activision Blizzard  but the game still looks like a squandered opportunity  The company s catalog of beloved game franchises is one of its biggest competitive advantages  and moves that reduce affection for valuable properties can be viewed as a significant misstep ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pq-qx,2075791

and thank you all for joining us today  Our fourth quarter results exceeded our prior outlook for both revenues and earnings per share  As we continue to transform the company  we ve remain focused on the delivery of epic entertainment that connects and engages the world  We believe we can do this with greater speed and efficiency  while maintaining our long standing commitment to quality and excellence and providing superior returns to our shareholders We ended the year with over 400 million monthly active users  strong year over year engagement and significant potential in monetization  We are in the privileged position of having a direct digital connection with hundreds of millions of players to whom we can deliver some of the world s best professionally produced content  And we have the ability to provide our audiences with a variety of ways to enjoy our content with monetization through subscriptions  premium digital purchases  digital native advertising and a variety of other player investment mechanisms Each of our large franchises  as well as our new potential franchises have greater opportunities than ever before  Using Call of Duty as an example  with the introduction of Call of Duty Mobile  we grew our player base from 40 million to 100 million players in less than a year  And we expect significant growth in the Call of Duty franchise in 2020 as compared to 2019  as a result of this and from other unannounced Call of Duty initiatives  Mobile  in fact  is now our leading platform  The business model for Call of Duty Mobile is free to play  which enables the rapid development of large community of players with the option to purchase digital items and services  as well as our ability to generate advertising revenues Franchises like Call of Duty offer advertisers a very difficult to reach target  And today  the ad load is extremely low as we re experimenting with the best advertising solutions for our players and our advertising partners  So  we successfully developed great game through Mobile  Our franchises have the power to attract far bigger audiences than previously  We are hard at work on high quality mobile games for all of our most important franchise And with respect to e sports  two weeks ago  we debuted the Call of Duty League with 12 city based teams  Working closely with our experienced team owners and globally recognized sponsors  we are thrilled to celebrate our players and inspire our community with professional Call of Duty e sports  And with our new strategic broadcast relationship with YouTube  over 200 million game reviewers now have access to our world class e sports content for both Call of Duty League and Over watch League Across console  PC  mobile and touch points like e sports the momentum for Call of Duty could not be stronger  And this success illustrates the larger opportunities we have across our diverse and large wholly owned library of titles dating back to our founding 40 years ago  Having our franchises on all platforms in all geographies with a constant flow of content and leveraging the additional touch points we have available to us like e sports and advertising  continues to be our focus Another great example of our franchise transformation is what happened with Warcraft  We doubled the size of the active World of Warcraft community in the second half of 2019 by adding Classic to the WoW subscription offering  The remarkable growth of the WoW community represents an important proof point of the value and potential of our established franchises  And it is energized our development team as we develop new content for all of our key franchises  These franchises form the basis for large  engaged communities of players and spectators with whom we take our responsibility to deliver high quality content very seriously Prioritization of opportunity and access to more talent are our challenges  But we are meeting these challenges with improved execution  and we expect to grow audience s engagement and monetization  and provide superior shareholder returns as we have for the last 30 years As a final note  we wanted to acknowledge the tragedy of Kobe Bryant s untimely passing  Kobe was a longtime friend of the company  starring master flee in commercials for Guitar Hero and Call of Duty  He was a tireless supporter of our veterans employment initiatives and always made himself available for all of our veterans events and activities  He will be greatly missed by all of us and our thoughts and prayers are with his family And now  Coddy will review the highlights of our operations with you Coddy Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerThanks  Bobby  Strong execution in 2019 on our strategy enabled Activision Blizzard to exceed our fourth quarter outlook and enter 2020 with momentum  That momentum was created by the increased investment and focus on the creative and commercial resources of our biggest franchises and allowed us to accelerate progress against our four key growth pillars And our first growth pillar  driving a consistent cadence of major new content to grow our reach  our expanded Call of Duty development team launched a very successful Modern Warfare  The unit sell through in Q4 increasing by a double digit percentage versus the prior year across console and PC combined  And the team followed up with great execution on our second growth pillar  live operations for Indian content  services  features and events to drive engagement  recurring revenues Modern Warfare s first season of follow on content will hit our new  more engaging in game system s throughput engagement and net bookings up significantly year over year  Similarly  the World of Warcraft team followed up on the remarkable Q3 launch of WoW Classic with substantial content updates  We kept the community engaged and the subscriber base well above pre Classic levels  In Hearthstone  we ve seen increased engagement on the launch of Blizzard s latest expansion and the roll out of the new Battlegrounds game mode in Q4 As for our third pillar  extending our acclaimed console and PC franchises to Mobile  the October launch of Call of Duty Mobile with one of the most successful in the industry history  driving Activision Publishing to record among the active users  It also highlighted the opportunity for our other large franchises to reach hundreds of millions of new players once they expand on the mobile  And finally  as we build and enhance new engagement models for our franchises  our advertising business again grew rapidly  and we further strengthen our leadership in e sports  We expect to build on this momentum in 2020 with each of these pillars driving net bookings growth for the company this year I ll now provide more detail on our Q4 results and recent developments across our franchises  Starting with Activision  Q4 was a fantastic quarter  Monthly active users tripled in Q3 to reach 128 million  Call of Duty continued its leadership on console with Modern Warfare driving year on year self requests in generating more upfront console sales in any other franchises worldwide the feat franchise had now accomplished for 10 over the last 11 years  Modern Warfare also saw strong growth in full game downloads with console digital mix at almost 50  And we ended Q4 with the retail channel at its tightest level in many years  positioning us well for ongoing catalog sales in 2020  Franchise also expanded it s audience on PC  the Q4 PC sell through on Battle net growing 50  year over year  This growing across platform Call of Duty community received in early December  the largest free content offering in franchise history along side of new system for player investment  And as a result  Q4 in game net bookings grew by double digit percentage year over year  despite a major launch of in game system and despite the removal of the season pass Now the second season of Modern Warfare follow on content launches next week  And the team has more great experiences and surprises in store both for that season and throughout 2020  which we expect to drive strong in game net bookings growth year over year  And of course  the Call of Duty franchise started breakout success in Q4 with the launch of Call of Duty Mobile  The game has received widespread acclaim  and with over 150 million installed has brought a huge number of new players into the franchise  and given existing players  new way to experience Call of Duty Engagement is strong  which the teams from Activision and Tencent gaming TV studio intend to sustain for the long term with a substantial pipeline of features  events  and content  benefiting from over 15 years of Call of Duty releases  The title outperformed our net bookings expectations in Q4  ranking in the top 15 growth communities in app stores  and the third season is already well under way and tracking well  So across console  PC  mobile and e sports  the Call of Duty franchise has never been better positioned for growth and there is more to come  including entirely new experiences within the Modern Warfare universe And then  of course  in Q4 of this year  a new premium Call of Duty release  which is already generating excitement in our play tests  Finally  across the Activision portfolio  we are honored to see the team is focused on high quality world class content recognized by the industry  the 2019 game rewards  Call of Duty Mobile won Mobile Game of the Year  Crash Team Racing won best game in the Sports and Racing category  and FromSoftware s Sekiro  Shadows Die Twice won Game of the Year Turning to Blizzard  monthly active users were 32 million in the fourth quarter  World of Warcraft monthly active users were higher sequentially  reflecting sustained engagement of players from the August launch of World Classic  Blizzard s recreation of the original WoW from 15 years ago  As you may remember  in Q3  WoW added more monthly or longer term subscription plans than in any prior quarter in franchise history  That momentum continued in the Q4 Then Blizzard sustained engagement with robust sale of content for both Modern and Classic WoW  and exited the year with an active community  more than twice the size of its Q2 ending level  That strong cadence of content will continue in 2020 with a great series of in game releases for Classic and a strong Shadowland expansion coming from Modern WoW in the second half of the year  Shadowlands will have new reasons to explore new ways to customize characters and our revamped leveling systems of on board of new players In Hearthstone  the competitive environment remains intense  But we did see sustained improvement engagement signed their lease of Descent of Dragons expansion and the new Battlegrounds auto battler mode in Q4  Q4 net bookings were lower year over year  but grew sequentially and the Hearthstone team continues to be very quickly  They launched new games store in December  and released a number of new content engagement model enhancements in 2020  Q4 also saw the launch of Overwatch on Nintendo Switch further expanding the community that has now surpassed 50 million of players since the 2016 launch And that has begin the Overwatch League returns to 20 teams from around the world competing in the home stand format for the first time  Blizzard s teams  as you know  are working on the broadest pipeline in its history  including Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 of PC and console  and Diablo Immortal  a mobile game  developed in partnership that is continues to make good progress  and will move into the testing phase with its first regional test planned for the middle of the year Turning to King  Monthly active users were 249 million  increasing 2 million form the third quarter  On a year over year basis  we saw a decline in web and smaller mobile titles  but importantly Candy mobile reach was little changed and benefited from growth in King s largest title Candy Crush Saga  In the second half of 2019  King introduced new initiatives to grow payer conversion targeting last payers as well as converting new payers into the ecosystem  And these initiatives led to encouraging payer engagement trends in the last two quarters While these initiatives dampened in game net bookings in Q4  and we ll continue to do so in Q1  we believe a broader and more engaged player base positions the franchise for growth over the medium and long term  And even with these actions  Candy Crush Saga remained a top grossing title in the US app stores and the wider Candy franchise  was once again number one King s advertising business grew net bookings over 80  year over year with strong growth in ad enabled users  volume and pricing  Both direct and indirect sales grew sharply for the full year ad net bookings exceeded  150 million with the business set for robust growth again in 2020  Throughout this year  King will continue to optimize the economy within Candy launching ongoing features  services and events to drive player engagement and investments  And having previously narrowed its pipeline is focused on the highest potential projects  King is investing in several promising new titles  including content based on Activision s beloved catalog IP  Regional testing of some of these new titles will begin in 2020 So in conclusion  our strategy to focus on our growth pillars and investment in creative and commercial resources  and initiatives of our biggest franchises is delivering results  In 2020  we will continue that focus with the releases and pipeline initiatives highlighted today to further expand our reach  engagement  and player investment  and to extend our largest IP across new platforms  geographies and business models  We plan to reach more players on more platforms in more regions than ever before To do so  we ll also further increase investment in our technology capabilities  technology platforms and data analytics  while fund these investments with an ongoing focus on efficiency and organizational optimization to leverage our scale across the business  And we know that some of our investments won t bear fruit until next year later  but we re confident in our growth trajectory this year  and our growth plan and we enter 2020 with momentum I ll now hand the call over to Dennis to discuss our Q4 and full year financial results and outlook  Dennis Dennis Durkin    Chief Financial Officer and President of Emerging BusinessesThanks  Coddy  Today I will review our Q4  2019 results as well as our outlook for 2020 and the first quarter  Q4 GAAP and non GAAP EPS were ahead of our prior outlook reflecting better than expected results for Call of Duty and World of Warcraft and a lower tax rate  To review the quarter  I ll start with our Q4 segment results  Activision revenue was  1 43 billion led by Call of Duty growth in both upfront and in game revenues on console and PC  and the addition of Call of Duty Mobile Operating income was  696 million with an operating margin of 49   As expected  Call of Duty Mobile was not a material contributor operating income in Q4 despite a great launch  as we invested to build our player base and position the title for long term success  Blizzard revenue was  595 million  lower year over year as growth for World of Warcraft and Overwatch was offset by a decline for Hearthstone and Diablo  Operating income was  260 million with the revenue decline more than offset by lower costs  Blizzard s operating margin was 44   significantly higher year over year due to mix and lower costs King revenue of  503 million was flat sequentially and lower year over year  driven primarily by King s actions to prioritize mobile payer engagement in the quarter  as well as year over year decline in web titles  The ads business grew more than 80  year over year  Operating income was  197 million with an operating margin of 39   1 point higher year over year  driven by high incremental margins from advertising  Across our segments  in game net bookings were  1 1 billion Now let s turn to our consolidated results  Unless otherwise indicated  I will be referencing non GAAP figures  Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non GAAP reconciliations  For the quarter  we generated Q4 GAAP revenues of  2 0 billion   174 million above our November guidance  This includes the net deferrals of  722 million  Net bookings of  2 7 billion were  62 million above our November outlook  We incurred GAAP only restructuring and related charges of  30 million  and we generated Q4 GAAP EPS of  0 68 and Q4 non GAAP EPS of  0 62  which was  0 19 above guidance  These figures include the net deferrals of  0 61 For the year  we generated GAAP revenues of  6 5 billion  This includes the net recognition of deferrals of  101 million  Net bookings were  6 4 billion  We incurred GAAP only restructuring and related charges of  137 million and generated GAAP EPS of  1 95 and non GAAP EPS of  2 31  These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of  0 06  From a cash flow perspective  our business delivered Q4 operating cash flow of  918 million  Annual operating cash flow was  1 8 billion  higher year over year due to lower working capital and cash taxes  Our cash and investments at the end of December was approximately  5 9 billion and we ended the year with a net cash position of approximately  3 2 billion Turning to capital allocation  We entered 2020 with a strong balance sheet and significant flexibility  As always  we continue to take a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation  And with this in mind  our Board has authorized an 11  increase in our annual dividend to  0 41 per share  payable in May  As we look back over the last year  we are pleased with the company s operating discipline  commercial execution  and content delivery during a period where we refocused the business and increased investment in key franchises to position us for future growth Now let s look forward to our outlook for 2020  First  regarding our slate and plans for each business unit  Activision enters the year with strong momentum for Call of Duty across upfront sales in game  mobile and e sports  Along with the tight retail channel that should benefit catalog sales  this positions us for strong growth in the franchise  particularly in the first half of the year  In Q4  we plan to launch the next premium release of Call of Duty  We can t wait to unveil what our teams have been working on  and we feel great about the content  Although  as is customary  we are prudently assuming lower sell in for Q4 versus Modern Warfare this past year Turning to Blizzard  which just last week released Warcraft III Reforged  Blizzard will build on World of Warcraft momentum with ongoing content for Classic and the Shadowlands expansion in the second half of the year  The Hearthstone and Overwatch teams will support their communities with ongoing content and services that drive engagement and player investment  And as Coddy mentioned  Diablo Immortal is planned to enter a regional testing toward the middle of the year  but we don t have any material revenue from that title in our guidance King will continue to release content  features  services and events across its portfolio with an ongoing focus on optimizing reach  engagement and player investment for Candy  And the advertising business is set to deliver another year of strong net bookings growth  At the same time  King will continue to invest in several promising new titles in its pipeline  And although  we expect regional play testing for certain titles  similar to Diablo Immortal  our outlook does not include material revenue from these titles  In addition  our business units will continue to tap into our portfolio of beloved IP to bring several remastered and reimagined experiences to our players in 2020  which we will announce closer to launch Bringing all this together  our outlook reflects 5  year over year growth in net bookings  We expect Activision to experience the strongest net bookings growth among our segments both in dollar terms and on a percentage basis  We expect solid net bookings growth from Blizzard for the year  and our outlook reflects a flattish performance at King with year over year trends improving in the second half of the year  From a margin perspective  our outlook reflects GAAP and non GAAP operating margin increasing year over year Now let s turn to the numbers  On a GAAP basis for 2020  we expect revenues of  6 45 billion  including net deferrals of  275 million  We expect net bookings of  6 73 billion  Product cost  game operations and distribution expenses of 22   operating expenses  including software amortization of 50   and a GAAP only restructuring charge of approximately  50 million  We expect the GAAP tax rate of 19   GAAP and non GAAP share count of  778 million and GAAP EPS of  1 85  For 2020  on a non GAAP basis  we expect product cost  game operations and distribution expenses of 23   Operating expenses including software amortization of 44   We expect a tax rate of 19  and non GAAP EPS of  2 22  including net deferrals of  0 13 Now let s turn to our Q1 outlook  On a GAAP basis for Q1  we expect revenues of  1 64 billion  including the net recognition of deferrals of  365 million  We expect net bookings of  1 28 billion  Product cost  game operations and distribution expenses of 21   operating expenses including software amortization of 48   and a GAAP only restructuring charge of approximately  35 million  We expect the tax rate of 17   GAAP and non GAAP share count of  775 million and GAAP EPS of  0 55  For Q1  on a non GAAP basis  we expect product cost  game operations and distribution expenses of 21   and operating expenses including software amortization of 41   We expect a tax rate of 17  and non GAAP EPS of  0 66  which includes the net recognition of deferral of  0 31 In closing  in 2019  we have come a long way and refocusing the business on our biggest franchises and opportunities  So momentum for World of Warcraft  Call of Duty and our new engagement models highlights the growth potential for our broader portfolio of durable fully owned franchises  when we apply our top creative talent and commercial talent against our biggest opportunities  We are encouraged by our 2019 results  and as we return to growth in 2020  the opportunity set for our business across platforms  geographies and business models has never been greater Going forward  we will maintain our operating discipline and focus  as we execute against a great content line up this year and a pipeline that includes Overwatch 2  Diablo IV and Diablo Immortal and multiple unannounced initiatives  including several mobile titles  We remain confident that ongoing execution against our plan will position us to deliver growth to our shareholders over the long term Now  I welcome our business leaders Jay  Humam and Rob as they join us for the Q A portion of the call  Operator Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  We ll take our first question from Mario Lu with Barclays Mario Lu    Barclays    AnalylstHi  Thanks for taking the questions  I have a couple on Call of Duty Modern Warfare  How has not having a season pass effective user behavior thus far compared to years passed  And secondly  any color you can provide regarding its impact on in game revenue growth  and what we can expect in 2020  Thanks Bobby Kotick    Chief Executive OfficerHey  Mario  It s Rob  Thanks for the question  I think  before I touch on season pass  specifically  it s important that we kind of step back for a second and look at some of the macro changes that we made  and season pass is one of them  Our intent was just to create a better overall experience for our player community  and we think we ve done that  The first big thing we did was bring in crossplay and cross progression  enabling friends to play together no matter what platform they are on  In the case of Modern Warfare  it s just great to see players come back together after so many years of experience in franchise in the past Now with season pass  it kind of played a similar role  right  So instead of certain portions of the audience having certain content  we re focused now on free content for the entire community to drive engagement with the overall community  And I d say the last big change that we made was really focusing on the new battle pass and item shop system in the game giving players kind of more transparency to the content thereafter and  obviously  focusing more on cosmetic content  And I suppose the best way to judge all of it is just what s the player behavior and what s the community saying  And when we look at engagement  you look at daily average unique  Our engagement is up significantly year over year  and that s really great for us to see so many people enjoying and playing this fantastic game And then  on the player investment side  I d say fans certainly seem to be appreciating the new system quite a bit  We mentioned kind of the growth year on year  but one other thing  I might  add is that we re also see an increased attach rates in game to the new system  which I think is a very  very positive sign for us  And for us  this all signals to a really healthy ecosystem within Modern Warfare  one that we think we can build on and create momentum with our community  It s really on us from now to really build great content  which we intend to do for the long haul on this game  a great pipeline of content is coming starting with Season 2 next week  And we have some surprises in store beyond that  So I d say overall  what we expect is a healthier Call of Duty in 2020 versus the previous year  And we look forward to sharing more in the future  but thanks for the question Mario Lu    Barclays    AnalylstOkay  Thank you Christopher Hickey    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Mario  Operator  next question please OperatorWe ll take our next question from Benjy Scurlock with Arete Research Benjy Scurlock    Arete Research    AnalystThanks for taking my question  Just one on King  So when do you expect to see engagement on monetization stabilize  and the King segment start to reaccelerate  Thanks Humam Sakhnini    President of KingThanks for the question  This is Humam  So overall growth is impacted by some of our smaller titles and the web platform  We also had a number of initiatives more recently in the driving payer conversion and bringing back lapsed players and that presented near term trade off  but it s the right thing to do for the medium term and beyond  And we ll continue to see some of those trade offs in Q1  But    with all that said  when I look forward  I see a number of growth areas of King First and foremost  is Candy  Candy continues to be an incredibly durable franchise  And we see growth just through the slate of new features  all the services we re releasing and the in game events that we hold  More recently  we are also thinking quite a bit about our social features  We ve seen that really work in different battles and in different genres  And when I think about how that could be in Candy  and the size of Candy  that could be a big unlock for us Another thing that s really I look to for growth is our advertising business  So as you heard  that s really coming along really nicely  And we ve built a really large and high margin business  and I see growth there  And then additionally  I see growth in our pipeline  We reset our pipeline recently and we re starting to see some really good results  and our prototypes  and we will start doing some regional testing on some of those this year  So when I put all that together  I look to the medium term and beyond than I think  we have some really good growth opportunities here Christopher Hickey    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Benjy  Operator  can we have the next question please OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust Anthony Duplisea    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystHey  This is Anthony on for Matt  Thanks for taking the question  Do you have any color on how successful World of Warcraft has been in 4Q and into 2020 and retaining users from the Classic mode launch  And then relatedly also on Warcraft  there s been some negative press on Warcraft 3 Reforge lately  Can you tell us what you re doing to address that  Thanks J  Allen Brack    PresidentHi  This is Jay  I will talk about like the World of Warcraft question first  So  as a reminder  when we designed the model for World of Warcraft Classic  it was important that players have a single existing subscription to support both games  And we think about the WoW community as supporting both even though Classic and Modern are very distinct experiences  And we re committed to kind of continuing to support both of those experiences over the long term Given the content updates for Modern WoW  and the cadence that we have for Classic  we exited our year with the subscriber base that was doubled what it was at the end of Q2  And we also see players remaining engaged in both versions of the game  And we launched Visions of N zoth  which is a content patch for Modern WoW in January  Engagement with Classic has been  particularly strong in the East  and we see very high levels of player retention there  And our next update for Classic is going to be Phase 3  which is Blackwing Lair  It s one of my favorites  And we re planning on launching that on February 13 Concerning Warcraft III Reforged  honestly  it s been a bit of hurry  Our community has come to expect really amazing things from us  and we ve heard from them that we did not achieve that bar  But we stand behind our games and have consistently shown that not only do we support them  but we continue to build on them even after launch  And we re committed to doing that here as well  And so we re going to continue to update the depth of the game and we ll continue to update the community with our plans going forward  Thanks for the question OperatorThank you  We ll take our next question from Ben Harland  Phonetic  with Bank of America Ben Sharland    Bank of America    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks for taking the question  You now have about  3 billion of net cash on the balance sheet  You ve got the annual dividend have done some buybacks in the past some acquisitions  Maybe just an update on the thoughts around capital allocation and uses of cash against the opportunities ahead  Thanks Coddy Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  No  Thanks for the question  Obviously  we do view a strong balance sheet as a really important strategic asset for the company and having that gives us considerable flexibility to invest in the business  do buybacks and return capital or pursue M A when we see attractive opportunities  And our track record probably somewhat speaks for itself as you look at that over a long period of time  We borrowed  I d say  very fortuitously to finance our Vivendi transaction  our King transaction and then subsequently pay down that debt  So we paid down more than  4 billion since we finance those transactions and actually have climbed our way up the investment grade ratings grid And then we ve returned over the last decade  more than  I guess  around  10 billion of capital back to our shareholders  About  8 billion through share repurchases and we still do have our  1 5 billion authorization  and then about  2 billion over that time period in dividends  which has increased double digits  I d say  probably on average over the course of that period  and again this year with the  0 41 dividend  which we announced today  M A is always something we keep our eye on  and as we have our radar detectors up  and we always look at a lot of things  but we    I d like to think we re pretty disciplined about our process  We do have a pretty rigorous process and we try to look for a few criteria of things when we are considering it  We re always trying to find great franchises of our technology that could add to our portfolio and make our business in our franchise portfolio stronger  We d like to see a track record of profitability or path to profitability  a strong leadership team that s aligned around growing the business And then lastly  and this one has been more challenging is finding things at a valuation that makes sense  So it s not easy to find all those things  And so you have to be very disciplined and patient as you think about those inorganic opportunities  So that gives you a little bit of an overview in terms of how we ve approached it  I think  our past track record and philosophy on this is probably the best indicator of how we think about it and how we will allocate capital in the future OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs Michael Ng    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey  Thanks for the question  Could you just give us an update on Diablo Immortal and discuss how that informs your go forward mobile strategy for Blizzard  Thanks Bobby Kotick    Chief Executive OfficerAbsolutely  So as you know  we ve been working closely with NetEase on the development of the game  And our goal is to deliver an authentic and deep Diablo experience for mobile  We did show an updated version of the game at BlizzCon last year  and we saw a lot of excitement  We ve also begun doing internal play tests or additional internal play tests since that time and the results are encouraging  We re getting ready to move to the next phase of development with some regional Alpha testing later this year  Player feedback is invaluable  And as we continue to work on building the game  we will be looking to that feedback to make sure that we re making a really a great Diablo experience When we think about    when I think about mobile overall for Blizzard  we have our roots in PC gaming  And we re going to continue to be deeply committed to the PC  But we do think there are opportunities for additional experiences in a different ways for players to engage on different kinds of devices  And we see Mobile is also a way to attract players that we don t currently reach on PC and console  So we think the mobile opportunity for Blizzard overall is very substantial  And Diablo Immortal will be our first release as a mobile first game  And we continue to work on multiple mobile initiatives across Blizzard in addition to the PC and console games Christopher Hickey    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Mike  Operator  can we have the next question please OperatorOur next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird Colin Sebastian    Baird    AnalystThanks  Digging down a little bit more into your relationship with Google  I m wondering what the key factors behind the decision to partner with GCP  And then as well as YouTube gaming  are there    as well there considerations or implications embedded that could increase your level of support for Stadia  Thank you Coddy Johnson    President and Chief Operating OfficerSure  Hey  This is Coddy  I ll take that  And I ll take first  as Bobby mentioned in really today in an interview  we ve had a long standing relationship with Google that s been great  We are thrilled to formalize that into a deeper partnership over multiple years  And as you said  there s really two big pieces to it  The first is on sort of the global IT infrastructure  and then the second is on what really is just a fantastic content platform in YouTube On the first piece  what we have the opportunity to do now is have a more efficient and better delivery in the back end services and infrastructure handled by our partner where that is their great expertise  And what it allow us to do is it frees up our resources and developers and mind share to focus on what we do best  which is making the content in getting it out into the hands of our players at a faster cadence  That is a great balance of trade for us and we feel really good about that partnership  and how that carry us going forward On the content side on YouTube  there s 200 million gamer viewers on YouTube  And it s just a tremendous opportunity to bring our platform to new audiences there  We think not only just in the way that players can experience it today  put new modes and formats  and also YouTube is a great on demand viewing platform  And we think viewers might be increasingly interested in viewing our content that way  There are other pieces to this deal where there is real value we think in terms of how we utilize their platforms and how they help us build more reach and engagement in our ecosystem  not in this deal  and you mentioned it as Stadia There s cloud game streaming experiences that are driving to the consumer  We continue to watch with interest and will make appropriate assessments as we go forward to figure out our own next steps there  But I think what it point to is just as the last thought  a broader point  which is over the last two years  we ve been talking about these large technology players that are coming to our space at scale  What we ve said is we see this tremendous opportunity as a content provider to take advantage of where we sit in the space  And this we could use an example  It s just a large amount of value for us as we go forward  and we think we re only even better positioned for other partnerships as we take next steps  Thanks Colin Sebastian    Baird    AnalystThanks OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS Eric Sheridan    UBS    AnalystThank you so much for taking the question  Can you provide us an update on how Call of Duty mobile is trending in terms of engagement retention of users  How we should be thinking about future content as a driver of monetization for that property going forward  And second part  any key learnings that we should be aware of as you re learning to develop mobile games at that sort of scale and how it might be applied to all the parts of the portfolio  Thanks so much for the color Bobby Kotick    Chief Executive OfficerEric  it s Rob  Thanks for the question  Let me start with the last part of your question on the key learnings  and I apologize for being little redundant on this  But I think a key theme throughout our call is that  we go we learn more anything else is that the market is certainly ready for our franchises on mobile  When we make a great game and kind of stay true to the core tenants of what made the franchise great in the first place  and we execute on that  Now we can reach just millions of millions of people around the globe that may have never experienced our franchise before  And that s just    that s very exciting for us as an organization because that obviously is true  not just for just Call of Duty  but also for the many great franchises that we have in the organization If I were to turn back and talk about Call of Duty Mobile a little bit in terms of engagement and retention like you asked  look  I d say it s still in the early days  but we ve seen a number of encouraging signs  Obviously  the install at the beginning  which we were reported out have been fantastic  but also in terms of our daily engagement  are looking at our doubts  Phonetic   Mobile hit levels that were multiples higher than any other title in franchise history  So that engagement basis really  really exciting for us to work from  Now for us the content now becomes on the content pipeline to sustain and build on that In Mobile  we have a game at a platform essentially that we want to build on for a really long time to come  So we re hyper focused on our content pipeline  our monthly  weekly  and daily events as they come into the game to make sure we drive the best possible experience for our player community there  We re in the middle of Season 3 right now  and that s tracking really well  And I think what we re going to see is we re learning a lot real time  the learnings are great  And you ll see us adjusting our content and continuing to make the best possible experience we can for our fans as we move forward in the future  So I d say  right now  we re off to really a nice start and that I m excited about  And we ll be reporting on our progress as we head in the future  but thanks for your question OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Sandler Mike Olson    Piper Sandler    AnalystHey  Good afternoon  and thanks for taking the question  You touched on a bit  but could you update us on anything further related to the status of King advertising  How is it ramp throughout 2019 and what s your thinking on potential for 2020  Thanks Humam Sakhnini    President of KingYeah  This is Humam again  Thanks for the question  So look I think advertising has been a real success story for King as we saw in 2019  We re really built a durable business here and it s a high margin one  And the way  I think about it is with our scale of monthly  it really allows us to get the benefit of having such a large audience  As you know  small fraction of them participate in our in game economy  So now it s become a needle mover for us  We crossed 150 million net bookings in 2019  And it s really a testament to a great collaboration between the product teams and the game teams and the advertising team  and really all of them thinking about what s a great player experience and how do we deliver something very differentiated for our advertisers And so when I look to 2020 and beyond  I see continued growth  There are many avenues of that growth  First and foremost  we re going to continue to roll out advertising to more and more of our players  And then  I think the teams will continue to innovate  There    we already  as I said  have an incredibly differentiated products that advertisers are really attaching to  but we can continue to make it better  A good example of this was in Q4 was some of the    what we delivered to Sony Pictures on the Jumanji phone launch  And there  we not only had our flagship rewarded video product  but we did something truly differentiated in the marketplace where we put an in game integration  We put some of the game    the film characters in our game  That was greatly engaging for our players and it delivered tens of millions of views to Jumanji  and it really moved the needle for them too So I think about continuing to move down that journey  and as we do that  we unlock more demand and we are working very closely with our agencies  while we also continue to build our direct sales team and continue to build kind of the infrastructure around it  So all in all  I think kind of that strategy that s been working continues to bear fruit for us  And I think there s plenty of growth ahead of us on good runway Christopher Hickey    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Mike  Operator  we have time for one last question OperatorThank you  We ll take our final question from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Mike Hickey    Benchmark    AnalystHey  guys  Congrats on the quarter  Thanks for taking my question  You made a lot of changes  obviously  to Call of Duty this year  You introduced the cross platform  Newer game system  launched Mobile  obviously  has a huge success in e sports  I guess to what extent we expect to see summer moves over the rest of your key franchises  Thank you Bobby Kotick    Chief Executive OfficerThanks for the question  Mike  It s Bobby  When    I think one of the things that we found with the launch of Call of Duty Mobile with games like Hearthstone  our designers and developers have gotten a lot more excited about reaching bigger  broader audiences  And we ve seen that across the whole company  And so I think what you re going to continue to see is a commitment to innovation on all of our franchises and then now includes commitment to innovation with mobile devices  And I think that as long as we can deliver new innovative game play with great user experiences on mobile devices  you ll see more franchises taking advantage of that as a platform I think the other thing  we ve seen is that people want to reach more customers in more countries and  especially when you look at some of the things that we re doing in e sports  being able to build these big inclusive communities around the world and today  our mobile games are played in almost 200 countries  That s been a real catalyst for us to really rethink the way that we re approaching our franchise development  So you can expect  as Jay pointed out  obviously  as Humam can attest to and as we ve been seen in the Activision business with the success of Call of Duty Mobile  Mobile is now our largest platform and you ll continue to see us with not just mobile touch points  but all the other important touch points that we ve now added into the business  expanding the reach of our franchises  the engagement of our franchises and the monetization of our franchises So we are going to be more enthusiastic about the prospects that we have going forward  We ve talked a little bit about the challenges  which is prioritization of opportunity and making sure that we have the right talent aligned with those opportunities  but those are challenges we managed for a long time  So it s a great question  And I think you can expect that all of our franchises are investing in all of these new opportunities Christopher Hickey    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsAll right  Thanks  Bobby  Thanks everyone for joining us today  We look forward to speaking with many of you this quarter  And if not  we ll see you on our next earnings call in late April  early May  Thank you Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  49 minutesCall

189069,410585,ATVI,Activision Blizzard Plans to Release Several Video Game Remakes in 2020,news,"Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  reported fourth quarter results and held an earnings call after the market closed on Thursday  In addition to discussing recent performance and touching on plans for upcoming new installments in major franchises  management revealed the company expects to release several  remasters and reimaginings  of previous titles this year 
The video game publisher didn t specify which titles would be getting the update treatment  but it confirmed the games are on track to debut in 2020 and plans to officially announce them when they are closer to their respective release windows  Based on the comments  the upcoming games will likely be a mix of titles that have been updated to feature more advanced  high definition graphics and titles that have been recreated from the ground up 

What does it mean for Activision Blizzard 
Remasters and full on remakes have been a profitable way for the company to monetize its franchise catalog because much of the development work has already been done  and these updated releases can tap into a built in audience of fans from the previous versions  
Activision Blizzard has found success remaking and remastering games in the Call of Duty  Spyro the Dragon  and Crash Bandicoot franchises  and it has a deep library of potential franchises and titles it can pull from  The company s recent reimagining of Blizzard s hit strategy game Warcraft III turned out to be a flop with fans due to a series of bugs and unwelcome design choices  but the company s remakes and remasters generally stand a good chance of being profitable if the core product is strong ",2020-02-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pskn5,2079489

189089,410605,ATVI,Will Activision Blizzard Stock Rise in 2020 ,news,"After a dramatic fall to end 2018  Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  stock rose 28  in 2019  The maker of hit franchises including World of Warcraft and Candy Crush finished the year strong  with momentum across mobile  console  and PC titles  Notably  the company made a tremendous splash with Call of Duty Mobile  which has significantly expanded its audience reach and opens the door for lucrative monetization opportunities in the new year 
There are several small catalysts on the horizon that could add up to an even better year for the game maker in 2020  We ll review those as well as whether the stock s current valuation warrants further upside 

Why the stock could climb in 2020
Activision Blizzard stock is still trading about 30  below its 2018 high  However  it ended 2019 with a series of upbeat news items about a few of the company s top franchises  The new mobile version of Call of Duty  developed by Tencent s TiMi studios  was downloaded over 100 million times in the first month after release and has a 4 8 star rating in the iOS app store 
The game includes a free rewards program  Battle Pass  that unlocks additional in game content  but players can also progress through the Battle Pass tiers by purchasing Call of Duty points in the app  Activision Blizzard reported during its third quarter conference call in November that monetization and player retention were looking strong  
Additionally  Activision released the next installment for the console version of the franchise with the late October launch of Call of Duty  Modern Warfare  Call of Duty is usually among the best selling console titles every year  and 2019 will likely be no different  On the last call  management reported that first week unit sell through of Modern Warfare was up  high teens  over the previous year s release  
What s more  Activision has a solid pipeline of add on content to monetize the game heading into 2020  During the last conference call with analysts  COO Coddy Johnson said the company has  more surprises and initiatives planned to further enhance the scale and value of the overall Call of Duty franchise in the coming quarters   
Monetizing games with add on content is a key revenue driver for Activision Blizzard  which generated 58  of its revenue in the third quarter from digital in game sales 
Another title seeing strong performance lately is World of Warcraft Classic  which was released in August  Blizzard reported slightly higher monthly active users for the third quarter  driven by a significant increase in the number of prior and existing players who returned to the franchise  The investments the company has made to double down on development staff are really coming through for World of Warcraft  as Johnson mentioned that  the team is already starting to deliver an extraordinary cadence of in game classic content   

Activision Blizzard plans to capitalize on the momentum in these two pillar franchises with the launch of a Call of Duty esports league and the 2020 release of the World of Warcraft  Shadowlands content expansion  
Esports is a 10 year project for Activision  so it s not expected to significantly contribute to the company s financials yet  But if the company reports continued success bringing in sponsors and advertisers for Call of Duty League and season 3 of Overwatch League  as it did last year  this could be another short term catalyst that boosts investor sentiment 
Another possible near term catalyst is upside from in game advertising  This initiative is showing real progress  with net bookings from mobile ads in Activision Blizzard s King unit nearly doubling year over year in the third quarter  Management expects in game advertising to exceed  100 million in net bookings in 2019  which means this business could approach  200 million next year if the recent pace of growth holds up 
Stock is expensive compared to peers
Those are some of the big items to watch this year  but these positives may already be priced into the stock  The shares currently sport a forward price to earnings  P E  ratio of 23 5 and a price to sales  P S  ratio of 6 56  That makes Activision Blizzard one of the more expensive gaming stocks right now across a range of metrics 

Data source  Finviz and Yahoo  Finance  FCF   Free cash flow 
There could still be some upside for Activision Blizzard stock in the near term  as the shares continue to march their way back to the 2018 high of  84  It s also worth pointing out that over the last two console transition years in 2005 and 2013  Activision s stock performance was stellar  The share price rose 52  between the beginning of 2005 and the end of 2006 and jumped 90  between the beginning of 2013 and the end of 2014  This is likely because technology changes in the industry tend to bring more players into the gaming fold    or at least get existing players more engaged  which bolsters game sales  The new consoles launching in fall 2020 from Sony and Microsoft could help Activision s stock performance  as previous console launches did in the past 
More catalysts beyond 2020
Looking beyond 2020  the big catalysts that could really get the stock moving are the releases of Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4  Given that Overwatch content has gotten a little stale in the last year  there should be plenty of pent up demand for that release  The same goes for Diablo 4  which is a popular franchise but hasn t had a new release in more than seven years 
Overall  there are plenty of potential catalysts to push Activision Blizzard stock higher  but the stock s valuation may limit the upside 
Whichever way the chips fall in 2020  investors shouldn t fall into the trap of concentrating too much on a single year s performance  With a new console cycle about to kick off in the fall and promising growth opportunities across new games  esports  and advertising  shares of Activision Blizzard are a good bet for the next five years ",2020-01-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pdvvf,2052584

189101,410617,ATVI,Blizzard Entertainment cuts punishment for HK gamer in protests row,news,"SHANGHAI  Reuters    Blizzard Entertainment has reduced the punishment that it dealt out to a Hong Kong based Hearthstone esports player for his public support of pro democracy protests in the city  after its decision sparked controversy among players and the public 
The U S  games publisher  a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI   said last week that it would suspend the player Chung  blitzchung  Ng Wai from competition for a year and strip him of prize money after he called for the liberation of Hong Kong in a post game interview 
The decision made the company the latest corporate name to get caught up in tensions relating to the Hong Kong protests  garnering it support in China but also drawing criticism from fans  players and commentators in the West  some of whom said that they would stop working with Blizzard as a result of its decision 
However on Saturday  Blizzard said it had decided to cut his punishment to a six month suspension and would still award him his prize money  with its president J  Allen Brack saying the company had  reacted too quickly  in making its decision 
Brack said that Chung still had to be penalized as he had violated rules  but that his specific views were not a factor in the decision 
 I want to be clear  our relationships in China had no influence on our decision   he said in a post on Blizzard s website 
Chung said in a statement posted on Twitter that he accepted Blizzard s decision and would express his opinions on his personal platforms in the future  but urged the company to reconsider its decision to penalize two commentators at the tournament where he had made his remarks 
The Hong Kong protests began in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy  with activists throwing petrol bombs  setting street fires and trashing metro stations 
China has accused the West of stirring up anti Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong and reacted strongly to expressions of support for the protests 
Last week  the NBA became the target of a fierce backlash in China after one of its team managers posted a now deleted tweet that expressed support for the Hong Kong protesters  which Chinese state media characterized as the latest example of meddling in China s own affairs ",2019-10-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/blizzard-entertainment-cuts-punishment-for-hk-gamer-in-protests-row-1995684,1995684
189114,410630,ATVI,Activision Jumps After it Launches WoW Classic,news,"Investing com   Shares of Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  rose on Tuesday after the gaming company launched a classic version of its World of Warcraft to celebrate its 15 year anniversary  
Activision gained 2 7  in afternoon trading   
The relaunched game was on the top channels on Twitch and is a recreation of its pre expanded mode  It went live on Monday and racked in more than 1 1 million viewers on Twitch  according to TwitchTracker  That is well above the average of around 34 000 concurrent viewers in a given week 
With World of Warcraft players on the decline  Activision has returned to the basics in hopes of attracting both new and old blood to the franchise  betting that a return to classic version of the game  known as the  Drums of War  update released in August 2006  will be too good an opportunity to pass up 
In 2015  when Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  last reported on World of Warcraft subscriptions  the game had 5 5 million global subscribers  according to data collector Statista  It is projected that the numbers will be gradually decreasing to reach 4 46 million in 2023 
But the move to win the hearts and minds of gamers by dangling an escape to a classic version of the game appears to have been a masterstoke  with a surge in viewers watching the live streams of World of Warcraft Classic gamers in action ",2019-08-28,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/activision-jumps-after-it-launches-wow-classic-1964497,1964497
189115,410631,ATVI,World of Warcraft nostalgia to boost Activision Blizzard  Barron s,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    The initial reception for a re launched version of a classic video game points to potential stock price growth of Activision Blizzard Inc  NASDAQ ATVI   with new titles from key franchises also bolstering the company s outlook  according to Barron s 
The U S  financial newspaper said last Monday s release of World of Warcraft Classic  a repackaging of the first edition of the online role playing game that was hugely popular in the 2000s  had created substantial buzz in the video games world 
Barron s cited reports of hours long wait times to log into the game  and quoted Blizzard Entertainment  a subsidiary of Activision  as saying World of Warcraft Classic set a record for launch day concurrent viewers on Twitch  a platform which hosts live streams of gamers playing which people can watch 
 The business model for World of Warcraft is highly profitable  with a subscription costing  15 a month  If World of Warcraft Classic drives a couple million new subscribers for a few quarters  it would boost the company s earnings significantly   Barron s said 
Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
The Santa Monica  California based video games maker  which has a market capitalization of  38 8 billion according to data from Refinitiv s Eikon  has endured a rough few months  compounded by intense competition 
Its share price slumped by half between October and mid February  when it announced weak full year results for 2018 and 800 job cuts  The company s chief financial officer also warned at the time 2019 would be a transition year  with few frontline releases planned 
However  having traded in a stable band since then  the stock price rose 6 9 percent last week to end at  50 60  Barron s said  with 2019 releases now likely to do better than expected and momentum into next year   there s probably still plenty of upside  for Activision 
Barron s also noted positive reviews for the recent first public demonstration for Activision s latest installment of the Call of Duty series  which also bode well for the company s outlook 
The first person shooter has been one of the most popular series in gaming since it debuted in 2007 
Activision also has sequels planned for its Overwatch and Diablo series in the coming years  both of which were successful in the past  Barron s said ",2019-09-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/world-of-warcraft-nostalgia-to-boost-activision-blizzard-barrons-1968069,1968069

189230,410746,ATVI,Can better cancer care lower company s health costs ,news,By Beth Pinsker NEW YORK  Reuters    When companies try to tackle rising healthcare costs  shifting more of the burden to employees is increasingly the strategy of choice  But Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI   an entertainment company that employs more than 6 000 people in the United States  has been spending less on healthcare than projected for the last few years  in large part because it is offering better options for cancer care    I m a cancer survivor myself  I know what it s like when you get a diagnosis   said human resources head Milt Ezzard  who joined the Santa Monica  California based company six years ago   You go into a black hole and just get through it   Cancer is one of the most expensive conditions to treat  driving about 20 percent of a company s healthcare spend  said Hugh Ma  co founder and Chief Executive Officer of Robin Care  which guides workers through cancer illnesses   Rather than focus on the big picture of cutting costs  some companies are designing benefits that specifically target certain conditions   Often the first step is for a company to contract a third party patient advocate like Robin Care or Edison Health that specializes in cancer cases  This is because human resources departments cannot delve into the particulars of an employee s health issues  due to privacy rules   The benefit of these subcontractors is that they can really be there and hold your hand  said Dave Chase  co founder of Health Rosetta  which promotes healthcare reform    All they deal with is cancer  Having somebody available on your side is good   Chase said   Tom Emerick  CEO of Edison Healthcare  works with about 5 000 client companies and gets personally involved in cancer cases   Emerick s first priority is to make sure that the cancer gets diagnosed properly  About 30 percent of the cases he handles are misdiagnosed originally  he says  Many workers are sent for surgery they do not need or expensive treatments that will not help them  he added  Edison works to get patients to the right place for treatment based on the type of cancer they have  A top echelon of cancer treatment hospitals are designated as Centers of Excellence  and companies can contract for services with them directly or through their insurance provider  Centers of Excellence also help workers with organ transplants  Currently  40 percent of large companies use Centers of Excellence for cancer care  up 10 percent over the past two years  according to the National Business Group on Health  NGBH   a nonpartisan research group for large employers   About 24 percent more large employers have said they plan to start offering this benefit by 2021   In addition to helping with specialized care  companies are easing the cancer burden in other ways  Some companies  like Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   will also cover travel costs up to  10 000 for the patient and accompanying family to go to a special facility    That goes a long way   said Vickie Strickland  director of health strategy and resources for Delta  which is based in Atlanta  Georgia  Only a few of the few thousand employees dealing with cancer hit the  10 000 limit each year  from a workforce of 150 000    It s a nice message to send to the employee  They care enough about you to send you to the Mayo Clinic to make sure you get the best treatment  With the misdiagnosis rate  it easily pays for itself   said Health Rosetta s Chase  Top cancer centers can do advanced genetic testing on patients to identify those mostly likely to benefit from particular treatments  avoiding extremely costly new regimens for those unlikely to be helped by them    I can t imagine what our costs would be if we weren t doing all of this   said Delta s Strickland   Nearly 30 percent of large companies are also offering incentives for employees with cancer to use the case management companies or an on call nurse to help manage their condition  which can involve dealing with treatment side effects and future care choices  Employers deposit money into the health savings account or offer some other type of monetary reward  according to NGBH   Sometimes getting to the right place is just the start  At Robin Care  Hugh Ma helped an employee deal with her elderly mother s stomach cancer diagnosis  All the experts concluded that the woman needed her stomach removed  and fast  but she balked   Ma assessed the situation  He found another elderly Vietnamese woman who had the same surgery to reassure the patient that the treatment was safe    We were visiting her in the recovery room four days later   Ma said  His conclusion   When you take the approach to support the human being  you ll have better outcome and lower costs  ,2018-12-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/can-better-cancer-care-lower-companys-health-costs-1708202,1708202

189253,410769,ATVI,Is Activision Blizzard  ATVI  Stock Outpacing Its Consumer Discretionary Peers This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Consumer Discretionary space have likely heard of Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  One simple way to answer this question is to take a look at the year to date performance of ATVI and the rest of the Consumer Discretionary group s stocks 
Activision Blizzard is one of 250 individual stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector  Collectively  these companies sit at  13 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups  measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group 
The Zacks Rank is a successful stock picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months  ATVI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ATVI s full year earnings has moved 1 15  higher  This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend 
Our latest available data shows that ATVI has returned about 3 03  since the start of the calendar year  In comparison  Consumer Discretionary companies have returned an average of 24 52   This means that Activision Blizzard is outperforming the sector as a whole this year 
Looking more specifically  ATVI belongs to the Toys   Games   Hobbies industry  a group that includes 8 individual stocks and currently sits at  42 in the Zacks Industry Rank  On average  stocks in this group have gained 15 44  this year  meaning that ATVI is slightly underperforming its industry in terms of year to date returns 
Going forward  investors interested in Consumer Discretionary stocks should continue to pay close attention to ATVI as it looks to continue its solid performance ",2019-07-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-activision-blizzard-atvi-stock-outpacing-its-consumer-discretionary-peers-this-year-200436780,200436780
189254,410770,ATVI,Activision Blizzard  ATVI  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Activision Blizzard is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Activision Blizzard imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Activision Blizzard
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this maker of  Call of Duty  and other video games is expected to earn  2 19 per share  which is a change of  15 8  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Activision Blizzard  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 5  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Activision Blizzard to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/activision-blizzard-atvi-upgraded-to-buy-heres-what-you-should-know-200439289,200439289
189255,410771,ATVI,Analysts Estimate Activision Blizzard  ATVI  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 8  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of  Call of Duty  and other video games is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 26 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  36 6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 19 billion  down 13 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 82  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Activision Blizzard 
For Activision Blizzard  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 77  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Activision Blizzard will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Activision Blizzard would post earnings of  0 25 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 31  delivering a surprise of  24  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Activision Blizzard doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-activision-blizzard-atvi-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200449147,200449147

189287,410803,ATVI,Stocks Rise Along With The Tariffs  Go Figure ,opinion,"We just had the best performance of this rough week on the same day as the dreaded tariff hike 
	The market never ceases to amaze 
	Stocks may have taken a bark is worse than the bite attitude on Friday  but we ll have to keep our eyes on how the hike to 25  and ongoing trade negotiations will impact the market in the longer run 
	For today though  the Dow boomeranged yet again from a loss of more than 350 points to a gain of 114  It finished higher by 0 44  to 25 942 37 
	The other two major indices finished with their first greens of the week  The S P advanced 0 37  to 2881 40 and the NASDAQ managed a 0 08  rise to 7916 94 
	The week started under pressure with President Trump s Twitter threat to raise tariffs as negotiations hit a brick wall  Despite a few late day rallies  especially today   stocks were constantly behind the eight ball  In the end  the NASDAQ dropped 3  this week  while the Dow and NASDAQ were each off by more than 2  
	The bottom line is we still have no deal  We do have handshakes and smiles on the news  but nothing on paper  The market s immediate response was to move sharply lower 
	However  positive trade headlines still appear to be working  U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Trump both said the talks were  constructive   while China s Vice Premier Liu He said that the meetings went  fairly well  
	So far  the tone seems to be that this impasse is no big deal  and the market decided to go with that  Stocks reversed course after the negative open and eventually finished higher  The market appreciated that talks have not broken down and that there will be future negotiations 
	Moving into next week  a bunch of questions remain  What will China s retaliation look like  When will the next round of talks happen  How much longer will the market remain relatively optimistic that something will eventually get done

189344,410860,ATVI,Dollar Rises As Trade War Talks Get Under Way,opinion,"FX   Dollar Rides Safe Haven Wave
The U S  dollar was higher across the board versus major pairs  U S  and Chinese officials kicked off a new round of talks to avoid increasing tariffs on March 1  Despite hopeful comments from both sides there has been little of substance that markets can digest as trade representative Robert Lightizer and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin will visit Beijing this week  Even if there is no grand agreement  a reduced tariff percentage could be a temporary solution as the two nations remain far apart in key issues 

Sterling fell 0 58 percent as monthly GDP came in lower than expected with a loss of 0 4 percent and manufacturing production shrank 0 7 percent  Brexit remains a major factor as Prime Minister May has yet to convince the EU to accept the amendments that were so contested in the U K  The EU has said that there would be no changes to the agreement May already has  but as the March 29 deadline approaches some concessions will have to be made from both sides to avoid a hard Brexit 
Oil   Disruptions Balance Out Trade War Concerns
Oil prices pared losses from earlier in the session  but crude remains under pressure as the U S  China talks get underway with some tension on the South China seas stealing some of the thunder  Last week U S  President Donald Trump said that he won t meet his Chinese counterpart ahead of the March 1 deadline  Washington will remain a source of uncertainty as later this week the government shutdown will have to be addressed 

The trade war between the two largest economies has impacted global growth expectations  Until there is a positive breakthrough energy prices will keep dropping 
There have been positive comments from both sides  but until there are details ahead of the deadline to avoid increasing tariffs energy demand forecasts have more room to the downside 
Venezuela remains a factor as U S  sanctions have made heavier grades more expensive as U S  refiners look to purchase alternatives in the short term 
Gold   Dollar Hogs Safe Haven Flows
Gold was flat on Monday as the U S  dollar got its mojo back and advanced on trade uncertainty as U S  negotiators travelled to Beijing  The greenback has shaken off some of the dovish pressure from the Fed and has now gained for 8 straight days 
Optimism for a U S  China deal was offset by rising concerns that the Democrats and Republicans won t find a compromise ahead of Friday s deadline to avoid another government shutdown 

The dollar was also higher as European data revealed further signs of an economic slowdown  Brexit headlines combined with a disappointing British GDP and manufacturing as sterling dropped 0 58 percent 
Stocks   U S  China Talks Do Little to Dispel Uncertainty
Global stocks were mixed as investors returned from Lunar Year celebrations putting Chinese stocks higher  The U S  China trade talks made it difficult for equities to end in positive territory and companies that had strong earnings were balanced out with tech firms who are struggling  Activision  NASDAQ ATVI  fell in anticipation of layoff reports as the company is said to focus on more mobile games 

Recession fears have been pushed to the background after the Fed announced it would pause its tightening of monetary policy  but investors remain anxious after the drop in December  Uncertainty in Washington as the trade talks reassume  and a middle ground with Democrats on border security remaining elusive could have a negative impact on indices  with the dollar becoming the de facto safe haven

Square  NYSE SQ  soared on Friday morning  trading as much as 10  higher  after the financial services company announced it had hired Amrita Ahuja as its CFO 
However  key cycle indicators suggest downside risk into the March of this year 


Founder Jack Dorsey announced that Amrita Ahuja will take the position of Chief Financial Officer  She is currently CFO of Activision s  NASDAQ ATVI  Blizzard Entertainment unit  The previous CFO Sarah Friar had left Square to become the CEO of social network Nextdoor 
According to Dorsey   Amrita brings the ability to consider and balance opportunities across our entire business  and she will help strengthen our discipline as we invest  build  and scale  
Our analysis of the SQ market cycles suggest it is in the declining phase of its current minor cycle  Likewise  the stock is negatively configured  as it has broken the low at which it started its previous and current cycles  As such  we are bearish  with a target of  45 by March

189419,410935,ATVI,Activision  ATVI  Stock Gains Ahead Of Earnings  What To Expect,opinion,"Shares of Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI   gained about 1 3  on Wednesday  as investors eagerly anticipate the company s latest earnings announcement after the bell tomorrow  ATVI is looking to pare recent losses ahead of the report  which could be a pivotal moment for the video game publisher considering recent releases and controversy surrounding it 
Activision shares gapped down at the start of the week after its Blizzard segment s annual BlizzCon event  Wall Street was apparently reacting to the backlash Blizzard saw after revealing a new title in the Diablo franchise at the conference 
The new game  Diablo Immortal  is a mobile only addition to the popular Diablo franchise  and while that likely made sense from a business perspective given the profitability of ATVI s mobile segment  it frustrated traditional gamers  Core gaming audiences  especially those that have followed a particular property for years  tend to dislike when companies chase trends with their beloved franchises 
That said  Activision did just release one of the biggest games of the year  Call of Duty  Black Ops 4  and its King subsidiary recently rolled out the latest mobile smash hit  Candy Crush Friends Saga  All of this will likely be mentioned in the company s guidance and management s commentary tomorrow 
But what should investors expect from Thursday s Q3 report itself  Let s take a closer look 

Earnings Outlook
Activision Blizzard will release its third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results after the market closes on Thursday  Here s what analysts are expecting  according to our Zacks Consensus Estimates 
Earnings  ATVI is projected to report adjusted earnings of  0 51 per share  which represent a decline of 15  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions  Activision has witnessed three negative earnings estimate revisions and just one positive adjustment for the to be reported quarter within the last 60 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped two cents over the duration of the quarter 
Revenue  Consensus estimates have ATVI s Q3 revenue pegged at  1 67 billion  This would be down about 12  from the  1 90 billion it tallied in the comparable quarter last year 
Points to Consider
Video game releases are cyclical  so year over year comparisons are often not entirely helpful  Moreover  Activision had not missed EPS estimates in well over two years  so an expected earnings beat likely will not do much for the stock after the report is filed 
What investors are going to be looking for is positive guidance for the holiday quarter and goods news on the first month performances of Call of Duty  Black Ops 4 and Candy Crush Friends Saga  We already know the former sold a slightly disappointing  500 million in its first three days  but a positive update from management is still possible 
There is also a chance an analyst might ask Activision executives about the negative reaction to Diablo Immortal  This could reveal whether the company expected the game to drive any growth  or whether the backlash might educate its mobile game strategy in the future 
A pullback in the stock caused simply by headline volatility ahead of the report might give ATVI some space to swing to the upside if its report and guidance impress  Nevertheless  the uncertainty here could be great enough to keep some investors away 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge

189440,410956,ATVI,3 Leisure Stocks Set To Beat Estimates This Earnings Season,opinion,The leisure industry  which comprises companies providing recreational services such as swimming pools  golf courses  boats  outdoor spaces  cruises  travel etc   primarily thrives on overall economic growth and consumer spending A steady rise in wages  lower unemployment and upbeat consumer confidence indicate that leisure stocks are poised to record handsome gains  This is because these stocks are part of a cyclical industry where demand for goods and services is relatively elastic and any significant change in the general market affects consumers  preference Will the Leisure Space Gain From Economic Growth Per the advance estimate reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  gross domestic product  GDP  increased at an annualized rate of 3 5  in the third quarter  compared with 4 2  growth in the second quarter While real GDP was favored by increased personal consumption expenditures  PCE   private inventory investment  state and local government spending  federal government spending  and non residential fixed investment  it was slightly affected by a downturn in exports and a deceleration in non residential fixed investment Meanwhile  Federal Reserve raised its outlook on U S  economic growth  Current year economic growth is currently estimated to be 3 1   This is likely to support the industry s growth in 2018 Speed Breakers on the WayDespite an upbeat consumer spending scenario  a few concerns remain  The   encompassing all the leisure sub industries  has underperformed the S P 500 over the past year  The sector gained 0 3  in the past year compared with the S P 500 s rally of 3 3  The tricky nature of discretionary spending has been weighing on the sector s performance  Also  tariff concerns have been affecting the stocks in the leisure space of late  Moreover  Trump s stringent policies on immigration and tourist visas seem to have compelled international visitors to rethink their vacation plans to the United States  There has been a continued slowdown in U S  bound air travel bookings ever since Trump took charge  Also  online searches by prospective travelers to the United States have declined sharply We note that  so far this year  overall inflation and commodity price increases have been checked by a relatively stronger dollar  However  household wages  which have started to tick up  have not significantly gone up to combat the expected inflationary pressure  This puts the leisure industry in a tricky position for quite some time now Q3 ExpectationsMost of the Zacks sectors  14 out of 16  are expected to perform well in the third quarter of 2018  Leisure stocks  which are part of the broader Zacks Consumer

189441,410957,ATVI,Activision Blizzard  ATVI  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"The market expects Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 8  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of  Call of Duty  and other video games is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 51 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15  
Revenues are expected to be  1 67 billion  down 12 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Activision Blizzard 
For Activision Blizzard  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 75  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Activision Blizzard will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Activision Blizzard would post earnings of  0 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 41  delivering a surprise of  13 89  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Activision Blizzard appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-10-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/activision-blizzard-atvi-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200353194,200353194

ATVI s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  2 65 per share and revenue of  7 50 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  16 23  and  4 8   respectively 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for ATVI  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   It has a remarkable  outside audited track record of success  with  1 stocks delivering an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant  ATVI is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
In terms of valuation  ATVI is currently trading at a Forward P E ratio of 26 08  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 24 03  so we one might conclude that ATVI is trading at a premium comparatively 
Investors should also note that ATVI has a PEG ratio of 1 73 right now  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  The Toys   Games   Hobbies industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1 73 as of yesterday s close 
The Toys   Games   Hobbies industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector  This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 237  which puts it in the bottom 7  of all 250  industries 
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups  Our research shows that the top 50  rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1

189765,411281,ATVI,Gaming Stock Battle  Activision Blizzard  ATVI  Vs  Nintendo  NTDOY ,opinion,"The video game world  like many other industries  heats up as the holiday shopping season kicks off  But the gaming industry is so much more than a three month period of  buy the hottest new game for your kids   The video game industry is a global powerhouse that takes in billions of dollars a year  and it is set to continue to skyrocket 
This year  based on market research firm Newzoo s     2 2 billion video gamers around the world will help generate  109 billion in revenue for the global video game industry  And this 7 8  year over year jump in sales is only part of the story 
Esports  popularity and its newfound economic viability has created a whole new growth sector within the industry  The professional video gaming industry is projected to grow 41  from last year to hit  696 million  And the Olympic Council of Asia recently announced that it will include esports in the 2018 Asian Games spurred by support from Alibaba s   NYSE BABA   Alisports 
With so many companies set to profit from the gaming market s continued growth  let s take a look at two big time video game players with great Zacks Ranks to see which stock is the best investment right now 
Activision Blizzard  Inc    NASDAQ ATVI  
Activision Blizzard s stock has soared in 2017  experiencing a 77 79  year to date price change  which makes the S P 500 s 10 89  gain look modest  Now  the company s stock price sits just below its all time high of  66 58 per share  This might turn off some investors who tend to stay away from stocks at current highs  but let s look at some of the company s fundamentals and projections to see what s really going on 
The maker of widely popular video games such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft is coming off a better than expected second quarter that saw its revenues pop 4  to hit  1 63 billion  Maybe more impressively  Activision Blizzard s sales from its digital channels jumped 15  to reach  1 31 billion  The company boasted 407 million monthly active users last quarter 
Activision Blizzardstock is currently trading at 30x earnings  which is not great compared to the overall market  but its 2 22 PEG ratio does match the industry average  The company s P B ratio of 4 98 also hovers right around the industry average  so value investors don t need to be too worried here 
Thecompany s Current Ratio of 2 47 tops the industry average  Activision Blizzard s90 25  cash flow growth also helps to show that the company is on a strong growth trajectory  Based on our current consensus estimates  the company s sales are expected to climb 10 87  this quarter and gain 4 10  for the year to hit between  6 61 billion and  7 14 billion 
Within the past 60 days  ATVI has received six upward earnings estimate revisions for its full year  and the video game giant has also only missed earnings estimates once in the last 14 quarters 
Activision Blizzardis currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Nintendo Co  T 7974    Ltd    OTC NTDOY  
The legendary Japanese video game company has experienced a rebound in the last couple of years  as it got back to the basics that made the company a household name around the world  Nintendo is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   and its new Switch consoles are poised to help keep the company s resurgence going strong 
Nintendo s most recent quarterly revenues hit  1 37 billion  which marked an almost 150  year over year jump  The company s sales jumped based on strong demand for its multi purpose Switch consoles  Nintendo expects to sell 10 million of its  299 99 Switch consoles in its current fiscal year 
Shares of Nintendo have skyrocketed this year and hit a new 52 week high of  48 65 a share on Wednesday  But investors who are worried that it will be hard for the Super Mario maker to jump into a new range might consider some key Zacks Consensus Estimates  Our current consensus estimates call for sales to skyrocket 106 67  this quarter and 70 68  for the full year to hit a high end estimate of  7 91 billion 
Our consensus estimates also project EPS growth of 203 59  this fiscal year  That expansion is projected to continue  with current consensus estimates calling for 61 73  EPS growth in the next fiscal year 
The company has received one positive earnings estimate revision for its current quarter within the last 60 days  In that same time frame  Nintendo also received three positive revisions to its full year estimates and two positive revisions for its next year estimates 
Bottom Line
The battle between two video game industry heavyweights was certainly not lopsided and it could very well prove to be a split decision  Activision Blizzard s games and Nintendo s consoles have loyal and ever growing user bases 
But with Activision Blizzard s foray into the world of epsorts  with its new  Overwatch  league that has seen NBA owners buy city based franchise for  20 million  the long term edge could lean in its direction 
Also  the proliferation of smartphones around the world  even in some of the poorest nations  means more people have access to mobile videos games  and Activision Blizzard is growing its digital gaming sector at a huge rate 
Still  both companies are strong  boast high Zacks Ranks  and look poised to continue to grow

189766,411282,ATVI,Facebook  FB  Decides Against The Creation Of Class C Shares,opinion,Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB   has decided to drop the proposed creation of Class C shares  which could have helped CEO Mark Zuckerberg to hold his sway over the company  Facebook s sudden plan to discard the creation of Class C shares reportedly comes under tremendous investor pressure Last year  during its first quarter 2016 results  Facebook had proposed the creation of publicly listed but non voting new Class C shares  Facebook  at present  has a double class structure  The Class C shares will have the same economic rights as Class A and Class B shares  Notably  Class B shares have 10 times the voting rights of Class A shares  Class B shares aren t traded and are held mostly by Facebook executives The idea behind the creation of this new class of shares was to allow Zuckerberg to have control over the company while continuing his charitable work  In December 2015  following the birth of their first daughter  Zuckerberg had said that he and his wife plan to give 99  of their Facebook shares  valued at  45 billion then  over their entire lifetime  to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative LLC  a limited liability company for betterment of the society However  a certain section of investors filed a class action lawsuit against Zuckerberg s proposal  These investors reportedly argued that the new class

Zuckerberg Initiative  At the time  I felt that this reclassification was the best way to do both of these things  He went on to add that in the last 18 months  Facebook s robust performance has helped the stock to grow  to a point  that he can easily continue his charitable work as well as keep hold of his voting control for the next two decades and therefore a reclassification is not

189823,411339,ATVI,Zacks com Featured Highlights  Guess  Activision Blizzard  KKR  Sterling And FireEye,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 8  2017   Stocks in this week s article include Guess   Inc   NYSE   NYSE GES        Activision Blizzard Inc  Nasdaq   NASDAQ ATVI        KKR   Co  L P   NYSE   NYSE KKR        Sterling Construction Company Inc  Nasdaq   NASDAQ STRL       and FireEye Inc   Nasdaq   NASDAQ FEYE       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Get Sweet Surprises on Earnings from These 5 StocksThe investing world is at present tousled with geopolitics  domestic politics  natural disasters like hurricanes and mixed economic data points  But this doesn t mean that Wall Street activities will stop Even in a shaky market like this  people are busy investing  but with greater caution  Naturally  what every investor would want now is a quality pick  Stocks that are likely to beat earnings estimates fall in that category  After all  it is a positive earnings surprise or a beat that matters the most  irrespective of earnings growth Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if it has been decelerating Seasonal fluctuations also come into play  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company It s only after significant research and analysis on a company s financials and initiatives that Wall Street analysts project its earnings  They also take a company s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  If the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher How to Locate Potential Outperformers  Investors tend to look for stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line but might not always succeed  One way of identifying the winners beforehand is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company An impressive track record in this regard generally acts as a driver  It indicates the company s ability to exceed estimates  Investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through  greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from

189923,411439,ATVI,Extreme Networks  Synchronoss Technologies  Activision  Shake Shack And Zynga Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   May 05  2017   Extreme Networks  NASDAQ        as the Bull of the Day  Synchronoss Technologies  NASDAQ       as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Activision  NASDAQ         Shake Shack  NYSE SHAK   NYSE        and Zynga  NASDAQ        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

Extreme Networks  NASDAQ       is the Bull of the Day and that is a surprise to some  but those that follow me have known about this stock for a long time now  I have been talking about this stock for some time and the positive move in this stock following earnings is probably only the start of another year of growth in this stock 

Talking About It For A Month

	I have discussed Extreme Networks as a Zacks Rank Buy      on March 30  it was my Top Stock Pick of the Week      on April 17th and was the subject of a radio show interview      on May 2 

100 

	That is a lot of exposure  but let s face it  investors like a different sort of number  They really like to see 100   as in gains of 100  or more  Extreme Networks is up more than 100  in the Stocks Under  10 Service that I manage for Zacks Investment Research 

	That winner isn t the biggest  but it has a chance to be the best as the recent acquisitions point to more growth for Extreme Networks 

Acquisitions

	The company has made a few acquisitions over the last few months and that should drive growth over the next year  The first deal was a  100M deal for the networking assets of Aavaya 

	The next deal had the analysts applauding management for getting a great asset at an even better price  The data center networking assets of Brocade  AVGO  were bought in a deal that included future earn outs 

	Both of these deals should drive revenue and earnings for the next year or two 

Earnings History

	The earnings history for EXTR is very good  I see 8 straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and that means two straight years of management guiding expectations to the appropriate level 

Estimates

	Estimates have been moving higher  The 2017 number has moved from  0 19 in January to  0 22 in February  By March the number moved up to  0 24 and that is where it is at the time of writing this article  Given the recent beat  this number will likely move higher 

	The 2018 number might also creep higher following the recent earnings release as well  The number was  0 031 in January and is now at  0 36 

  

Synchronoss Technologies  NASDAQ       is the Bear of the Day  albeit a few days after the big move lower  The stock was crushed for about 40  after the company announced that the CEO and CFO will be leaving  At the same time  the company guided lower so estimates were hit as well moving the Zack Rank down to a  5  Strong Sell  

Good News

	Out of the bad news of the CEO and CFO leaving  we have some good news to look forward to  The founder of the company is back as the CEO and he has his CFO that there during his tenure with him  That 1 2 punch should be good for something  but what that is exactly is not certain 

	We have an earnings announcement coming on May 9  so at that time we can learn a little more about a potential turnaround  So the stock may see some pressure up to that print  but after that investors should take stock of what the founder says 

Estimates

	Of late  estimates have declined which is why this stock is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has slipped from  1 96 in April to  1 35 in May 

	Estimates were already on a downward trend starting in December of last year  The 2018 number was  3 09 in November and then  2 77 in December  That number fell to  2 65 in February and has since moved down to  2 46 in May
