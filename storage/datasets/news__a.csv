105291,326806,A,LPC  Firms refinance CLO step up tranches to avoid interest rate increase,news,By Kristen Haunss NEW YORK  Reuters    At least seven Collateralized Loan Obligation  CLO  managers have refinanced funds so far this year to cut spreads on Triple A tranches with coupons that can step up to more than 10  of the current market rate   A record number of CLOs were reworked in 2015  but refinancing volume has been muted so far this year as spreads on Triple A tranches  the largest and most senior portion of the funds  have remained wide   Issuance of new CLO funds  which are the largest buyers of leveraged loans  has also been weak this year  down 52  through July 26  compared to the same period in 2015  as the market prepares for rules that require managers to hold some of their deal s risk   At least 10 CLOs have refinanced in 2016 so far  with six in July for managers including  Carlyle Group   NASDAQ CG  and KKR  according to  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  and Thomson Reuters LPC Collateral data  A record 28 CLOs were refinanced in 2015   The recent rise in refinancings come as managers try to address step up CLOs  where the rate paid to Triple A investors increases over time  At least eight of the 10 refinancings this year have reworked these tranches  according to Deutsche Bank and LPC Collateral data   CLOs  which pool loans of different credit quality  sell slices of the fund of varying seniority  from Triple A to B  to investors including insurance companies  These debt investors are typically paid a set coupon in addition to Libor   Cutting the rate paid to Triple A investors increases payments to equity holders  Equity tranches are the most junior and riskiest part of a CLO and investors are paid last after the fund s bondholders  STARTED IN 2013  CLOs with step up tranches were introduced in 2013 after a 68  drop in issuance following a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp assessment that forced banks to pay higher deposit insurance premiums on their CLO holdings   The step up structure was designed to create a shorter bond with a lower coupon than typical Triple A slices  with a rate that would increase after a set period if it could not be refinanced  according to Bjarni Torfason  a CLO analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York   Step up Triple A tranches typically paid about 100bp to 110bp for the first 18 months compared to three year Triple A prime auto bonds that paid 30bp in October 2013 or three year Triple A subprime auto bonds that paid 56bp  according to  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  data   The spread on these tranches typically increased after 18 months to around 150bp  and again a year later to 175bp to 180bp  The funds were designed to be refinanced before the interest rate increased and investors would be paid the higher spread if the deals could not be reworked   Triple A spreads in June 2013 were about 120bp and forecast to fall to about 100bp at the end of that year   Equity holders initially received higher payments of around 25bp for 18 to 24 months due to the coupon on the Triple A step up tranches being lower than market rates  but distributions to equity investors decreased after the rate on the senior tranche increased  Torfason said   Carlyle refinanced the CGMS 2013 4 CLO step up tranche in July to cut the rate to 152bp  according to a July 19 Deutsche Bank report  The spread had recently increased to 190bp   The firm also refinanced its CGMS 2014 3 Triple A step up slice to 145bp  It was set to rise to 175bp at the next payment date in late July and then to 200bp a year later  according to the report    KKR refinanced a step up tranche in its KKR 2013 2 CLO to 145bp from 175bp  which was about to rise to 200bp  according to the Deutsche Bank report    A Carlyle spokesperson and a KKR spokesperson both declined to comment  LOW REFI ON TRADITIONAL CLOS Traditional refinancings to cut the interest rate on tranches without a step up feature has been low because most outstanding deals were issued with a coupon similar to or lower than the current market  said Torfason   Several managers including  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  Asset Management and Apollo Global Management have issued CLOs in the last two months that pay Triple A investors 153bp  according to LPC Collateral data   Some refinancings the past two years have sought to make deals compliant with the Volcker Rule  which prohibits banks from investing in CLOs that own bonds   On July 7  the Federal Reserve extended the conformance period for the Volcker Rule to July 21  2017    Refinancing volume may continue to build before risk retention rules requiring managers to hold 5  of their funds take effect on December 24  CLOs refinanced after the effective date will need to comply    As we go into the second half of the year there is  a  strong incentive to try and refinance if possible because after December 24 it will require complying with risk retention  which is costly   Torfason said   If it is possible to do an economical refinancing before that comes into play then that would be preferable

105295,326810,A,U S  stock futures on pause ahead of Yellen,news,"Investing com   Wall Street futures pointed to a flat open on Tuesday as investors took a pause after yet another record close ahead of Federal Reserve  Fed  chair Janet Yellen s appearance before Congress 
The blue chip Dow futures inched up 1 point  or 0 00   by 6 58AM ET  11 58GMT   the S P 500 futures slipped less than a point  or 0 02   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures edged forward 1 point  or 0 01  
The caution in equities on Tuesday arrived after major indices hit new record highs a day earlier  In fact  the Dow and S P posted their 22nd and 14th record close since the November 8 presidential election 
The rally which pushed the blue chip index past 20 000 points and the global stock benchmark past  20 trillion in value has largely been attributed to speculation that President Donald Trump will usher in an era of infrastructure spending and tax cuts that will spur economic growth with the recent leg up coming amid promises for a  phenomenal  tax plan in the coming weeks 
In that light  some observers attributed Tuesday s caution to the fact that Trump s national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned unexpectedly amid a flow of intelligence leaks that suggested he had secretly discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington and then tried to cover up the conversations 
The dollar deepened losses against a basket of major currencies after the news broke and continued under pressure on Tuesday 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  was down 0 22  at 100 78 by 6 59AM ET  11 59GMT   edging away from Monday s high of 101 11  its highest level since January 20 
Regardless  the session s main event will come when Yellen testifies on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 00AM ET  15 00GMT  Tuesday  Her comments will be monitored closely for any new insight on policy and the timing of when it might raise interest rates 
Though several Fed officials had recently insisted that March could be a live meeting  markets remained skeptical  pricing in only about a 13  of a hike next month  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool 
Fed fund futures continued to bet for the first policy tightening to come in June while  unlike the central bank s projection for three rate hikes in 2017  markets put the odds for a second and final hike in December at around 70  
Besides Yellen  Fed president Jeffrey Lacker  Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart and Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan will also make appearances throughout the day 
Investors will also digest data on producer price inflation out at 8 30AM ET  13 30GMT  
On the earnings front   Dr Pepper Snapple   NYSE DPS  and T Mobile US  NASDAQ TMUS  were among firms set to report before the open  while Agilent Technologies  NYSE A   AIG  NYSE AIG  and Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX  were scheduled to release their numbers after the close 
Meanwhile  oil prices bounced back from the prior session s losses on Tuesday  but remained trapped in a familiar trading range as market players continued to weigh the prospect of production cuts by major crude producing nations against a rise in U S  drilling

105431,326946,A,How To Time The Markets Like An Investing Pro   January 29  2020,opinion,"Have you ever dreamed of being that one in a million investor who has the talent to perfectly time the markets 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Computer and Technology stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  AAC Technologies Holdings Inc   AACAY   Applied Optoelectronics  Inc   AAOI   Apple Inc   NASDAQ AAPL   Agilent Technologies  Inc   NYSE A   ADTRAN  Inc   ADTN 
Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
The popular image of market timing is that it calls for making drastic  all or nothing moves at the precise  exact market top or bottom  There is a less well known  rather simple market timing approach that has been used successfully by savvy investors like Warren Buffet for decades 
Rule 1  Why trying to time the tops and bottoms of the market is a dead end 
Abandoning the objective to time the tops and bottoms conclusively gives you the flexibility to profit  and extends your chance to benefit from the equity markets over the long term whether your specific market timing calls are right or wrong 
Rule 2  Don t sell during minor crashes   instead  have the patience to weather the storm  or even better  milk the opportunity to buy low 
Warren Buffett has made a great part of his fortune due to this simple rule  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a major distinction between a financial crash and a mild market reset  If you own shares of a company that is well   established and has strong fundamentals  they are probably going to rebound to their pre   crash prices eventually  thereby rendering holding on a wise decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn  purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared  and being scared when others are greedy 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

105503,327018,A,Agilent Technologies  A  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Agilent Technologies  NYSE A   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Agilent Technologies currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for A that show why this scientific instrument maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For A  shares are up 4 46  over the past week while the Zacks Electronics   Testing Equipment industry is up 3 17  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 11 35  compares favorably with the industry s 6 67  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Agilent Technologies have increased 5 53  over the past quarter  and have gained 9 2  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 4 17  and 5 75   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to A s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  An is currently averaging 2 508 173 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with A 
Over the past two months  9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost A s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 05 to  3 08 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 3 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that An is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Agilent Technologies on your short list ",2019-09-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/agilent-technologies-a-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200463343,200463343

105505,327020,A,What Makes Agilent  A  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Agilent Technologies  NYSE A  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Agilent basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Agilent imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Agilent
This scientific instrument maker is expected to earn  3 08 per share for the fiscal year ending October   2019  which represents a year over year change of 10 5  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Agilent  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

Investors  the fact that the trade war may last much longer than anticipated  Against this backdrop  it would be prudent to take a look at the investing areas that have less exposure to trade war risks and stay safe 
  If you want to follow the investment bank  you can apply their suggestions with the following investment strategies 
Bet Blindly on Dividend Growers
Dividend aristocrats are dividend paying companies  which have a long history of raising dividend payouts year over year  These provide hedge against economic uncertainty and are high quality in nature  The S P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index has  with lower volatility over a longer period of time 
So  one can play funds like Proshares S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF    BO NOBL    and SPDR S P Dividend  NYSE SDY  ETF    TSX SDY     read     
Tap Companies With Lower Labor Costs
Companies with low labor costs should be better positioned than Goldman  These companies include Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and Google parent Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL    Like many other investment houses such as Goldman  we too believe that services companies are generally less susceptible to tariffs compared with goods companies  
So  Facebook and Alphabet heavy ETFs like Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund   Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF  and Vanguard Communication Services ETF    MU VOX    should serve investors on this regard 
Telecom   Utilities  Free From Trade Risks
Several companies are not exposed to duties at all including   per David Kostin  Goldman Sachs chief U S  equity strategist  Moreover  a dovish Fed and volatile equity market will likely keep the benchmark U S  treasury yield at low levels  This should be beneficial for rate sensitive sectors like telecom and utilities   Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund  yields 3 04  annually 
High Yield Investments A Good Exposure Too
Who can forget high yield ETFs  High yield products go a long way in keeping investors  portfolio safe if there is any capital loss  Global X SuperDividend Alternatives ETF    NYSE A    which yields 7 04  annually  can be tapped for gains 
Tap Small Cap ETFs
Per Goldman     so while tariff is an issue  it s concentrated in some industries and some sectors than others  
Since small cap stocks and ETFs are exposed to domestic economy  one can bet on the small cap ETFs  Invesco S P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF   IQ US Real Estate Small Cap ETF   yields 6 38  annually   ProShares Russell 2000 Dividend Growers ETF  and Invesco S P SmallCap Utilities ETF    should be good bets  read

105635,327150,A,Agilent Technologies  A  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Agilent Technologies  NYSE A  reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 14  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This scientific instrument maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 72 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 27 billion  up 5 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Agilent 
For Agilent  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 10  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Agilent will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Agilent would post earnings of  0 73 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 76  delivering a surprise of  4 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Agilent appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-05-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/agilent-technologies-a-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200418156,200418156

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates 
VGM Scores
Currently  Agilent has a nice Growth Score of B  though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D  Following the exact same course  the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side  putting it in the bottom 40  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  Notably  Agilent has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-03-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-agilent-a-up-53-since-last-earnings-report-200400168,200400168
105698,327213,A,Amtek  AME  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of AMETEK  AME   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6 4  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  85 92 in the previous session  AMETEK has gained 26 8  since the start of the year compared to the 21 5  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 26  return for the Zacks Electronics   Testing Equipment industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 5  2019  Amtek reported EPS of  0 86 versus consensus estimate of  0 84 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 37  
For the current fiscal year  Amtek is expected to post earnings of  4 04 per share on  5 24 billion in revenues  This represents a 22 8  change in EPS on an 8 07  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  4 3 per share on  5 44 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 6 57  and 3 88   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Amtek may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Amtek has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 21 3X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 20 6X versus its peer group s average of 21 5X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 22  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Amtek currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Amtek passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Amtek shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Amtek Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Amtek have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Agilent Technologies  NYSE A   BWX Technologies  BWXT   and LeGrand SA  LGRVF   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices

105700,327215,A,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Agilent  A ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Agilent Technologies  NYSE A   This company  which is in the Zacks Electronics   Testing Equipment industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This scientific instrument maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7 53  
For the last reported quarter  Agilent came out with earnings of  0 76 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 73 per share  representing a surprise of 4 11   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 73 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 81 per share  delivering a surprise of 10 96  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Agilent  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Agilent currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 10   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on May 14  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-agilent-a-200414462,200414462

105739,327254,A,Agilent  A  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Agilent Technologies  NYSE A  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Agilent is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Agilent imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Agilent
For the fiscal year ending October 2019  this scientific instrument maker is expected to earn  3 05 per share  which is a change of 9 3  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Agilent  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 4  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

Below  we take a look at Agilent Technologies  NYSE A   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions

Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for A that show why this scientific instrument maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For A  shares are up 3 3  over the past week while the Zacks Electronics   Testing Equipment industry is up 4 73  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 91  compares favorably with the industry s 12 44  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Agilent Technologies have risen 8 83   and are up 10 2  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 5 37  and 4 81   respectively 
Investors should also take note of A s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  An is averaging 1 826 022 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with A 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost A s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 04 to  3 05 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period

105775,327290,A,Will Agilent  A  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Agilent Technologies  NYSE A   which belongs to the Zacks Electronics   Testing Equipment industry 
This scientific instrument maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8 65  
For the most recent quarter  Agilent was expected to post earnings of  0 73 per share  but it reported  0 81 per share instead  representing a surprise of 10 96   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 63 per share  while it actually produced  0 67 per share  a surprise of 6 35  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Agilent  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Agilent has an Earnings ESP of  2 74  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 13  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-agilent-a-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200375302,200375302

105777,327292,A,Agilent  A  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Agilent Technologies  NYSE A  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Agilent basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Agilent  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Agilent
This scientific instrument maker is expected to earn  3 04 per share for the fiscal year ending October 2019  which represents a year over year change of 9  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Agilent  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

105778,327293,A,Agilent Technologies  A  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Agilent Technologies  NYSE A  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 20  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This scientific instrument maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 73 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 27 billion  up 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Agilent 
For Agilent  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Agilent will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Agilent would post earnings of  0 73 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 81  delivering a surprise of  10 96  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

105779,327294,A,3 Things To Know About Q4 Earnings Season,opinion,"We continue to see the picture that emerged from the Q4 earnings season as not great  but it is not bad either  Results have turned out to be better than many in the market had feared ahead of the start of this earnings season 
We knew that the period of very strong growth was now behind us  But the steady negative revisions to earnings estimates for the current and coming quarters have left growth expectations for the first half of 2019 barely in positive territory  This negative revisions trend is a function of uncertainty about global economic growth  with a host of leading companies in different industries citing weakness in China  Europe and elsewhere as the driver of lower guidance 
We will share the current scorecard and what s on deck this week a little later  but let s first point out the key trends that we have seen from the Q4 results through Friday  February 15th 
First  growth is decelerating  This isn t a surprise  as we knew already that Q4 growth would be materially below the pace set in the first three quarters of the year 
Total earnings for the 394 companies that have reported through Friday  February 15th  are  12 9  from the same period last year on  7 6  higher revenues  Earnings and revenue growth for the same cohort of companies had been  25 1  and  9 5  in the preceding earnings season  respectively 
The comparison chart below puts this growth deceleration in a historical context for these index members 
 

 
The growth pace is on track to decelerate even further in the current and coming quarters  as we will show a little later 
Second  companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus EPS estimates 
For the 394 index members that have reported results already  66 5  are beating EPS estimates and 62 4  are beating revenue estimates  For the same cohort of companies  the proportion of positive EPS and revenue surprises was 78 4  and 62 4  in the Q3 earnings season  respectively 
The proportion of these 394 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 45 7   which compares to 52 5  for the same group of companies in the preceding reporting cycle and 12 quarter average of 53 7  
The revenue beats percentage is on the weak side relative to historical periods  but the lag on the EPS beats percentage side is particularly noteworthy  The fact is that the Q4 EPS beats percentage is the lowest in more than 5 years 
The comparison chart below puts the Q4 blended beats percentage in a historical context for these 235 companies 
 

 
With Q4 positive surprises this hard to come by  one would reasonably assume that perhaps estimates had been too high  But we know that s not the case  as estimates for the quarter had fallen the most of any other recent periods 
Third  estimates for 2019 Q1 and full year 2019 are coming down in a major way  with the Q1 growth rate now in negative territory and Q2 barely positive 
The chart below shows how estimates for 2019 Q1 have evolved since late November 2018 
 

 
Negative revisions to 2019 Q1 estimates are along the same lines that we saw ahead of the start of the Q4 earnings season as well  And estimates for full year 2019 have been coming down  as the chart below shows 
 

 
This chart has been tracking consensus earnings growth expectations since the second half of 2018 got underway  As you can see  estimates were effectively unchanged during the September quarter  but they have been on a consistent downtrend since early October  Many in the market suspect that estimates have further to drop before stabilizing

Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of Feb 15th  2019 
We now have Q4 results from 394 S P 500 members that combined account for 85 6  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these index members are  12 9  from the same period last year on  7 6  higher revenues  with 66 5  beating EPS estimates and 62 4  beating revenue estimates 
The table below shows the current scorecard 
 

 
For Q4 as a whole  combining the actual results from the 394 index members that have reported with estimates for the still to come companies  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  13 4  from the same period last year on  6 7  higher revenues  which would follow the  25 7  earnings growth on  8 5  higher revenues in 2018 Q3 
Earnings growth is expected to be in double digits for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with Energy   99 9  growth   Finance   14 1    Construction   22 4   and Transportation   29 3   the strongest  Tech sector earnings are on track to decelerate meaningfully in Q4   7 6   after back to back quarters of very strong growth 
Four sectors are expected to have lower earnings in Q4 relative to the year earlier period  namely Conglomerates   7 4    Autos   9 3    Utilities   7 8   and Basic Materials   1 5   
The table below shows the summary picture for Q4  contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding earnings season 
 

 
The chart below shows Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following 3 quarters and actual results in the preceding 4 quarters 
As you can see  the growth pace is expected to decelerate materially from what we saw in the first three quarters of the year 
 

 
The chart below shows the same data on a rolling 4 quarter basis 
 

 
Whether we look at the growth picture on a quarterly basis or on a rolling quarter basis  there is no doubt that growth peak is now behind us  The question now is how much estimates for the coming quarters have still to come down  And the answer to that question will depend on the evolving economic backdrop that we discussed at the start

companies likely to issue earnings surprises  This week s list includes Wal Mart   NYSE WMT    CVS Health   NYSE CVS    Agilent   NYSE A    Hewlett Packard Enterprises   NYSE HPE   and Kraft Heinz   NASDAQ KHC   3 Things to Know About Q4 Earnings SeasonWe continue to see the picture that emerged from the Q4 earnings season as not great  but it is not bad either  Results have turned out to be better than many in the market had feared ahead of the start of this earnings season We knew that the period of very strong growth was now behind us  But the steady negative revisions to earnings estimates for the current and coming quarters have left growth expectations for the first half of 2019 barely in positive territory  This negative revisions trend is a function of uncertainty about global economic growth  with a host of leading companies in different industries citing weakness in China  Europe and elsewhere as the driver of lower guidance We will share the current scorecard and what s on deck this week a little later  but let s first point out the key trends that we have seen from the Q4 results through Friday  February 15th First  growth is decelerating  This isn t a surprise  as we knew already that Q4 growth would be materially below the pace set in the first three quarters of the year Total earnings for the 394 companies that have reported through Friday  February 15th  are  12 9  from the same period last year on  7 6  higher revenues  Earnings and revenue growth for the same cohort of companies had been  25 1  and  9 5  in the preceding earnings season  respectively The growth pace is on track to decelerate even further in the current and coming quarters  as we will show a little later Second  companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus EPS estimates For the 394 index members that have reported results already  66 5  are beating EPS estimates and 62 4  are beating revenue estimates  For the same cohort of companies  the proportion of positive EPS and revenue surprises was 78 4  and 62 4  in the Q3 earnings season  respectively The proportion of these 394 index members beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 45 7   which compares to 52 5  for the same group of companies in the preceding reporting cycle and 12 quarter average of 53 7  The revenue beats percentage is on the weak side relative to historical periods  but the lag on the EPS beats percentage side is particularly noteworthy  The fact is that the Q4 EPS beats percentage is the lowest in more than 5 years With Q4 positive surprises this hard to come by  one would reasonably assume that perhaps estimates had been too high  But we know that s not the case  as estimates for the quarter had fallen the most of any other recent periods Third  estimates for 2019 Q1 and full year 2019 are coming down in a major way  with the Q1 growth rate now in negative territory and Q2 barely positive Negative revisions to 2019 Q1 estimates are along the same lines that we saw ahead of the start of the Q4 earnings season as well  And estimates for full year 2019 have been coming down Estimates were effectively unchanged during the September quarter  but they

105816,327331,A,Agilent Technologies  A  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Agilent Technologies  NYSE A  reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 19  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This scientific instrument maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 73 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 26 billion  up 5 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Agilent 
For Agilent  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 45  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Agilent will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Agilent would post earnings of  0 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 67  delivering a surprise of  6 35  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

share  which was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but narrower than the year ago quarter s loss of 6 cents per share Revenues of  3 million increased 6  on a year over year basis and also met the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Notably  Samsung  KS 005930  accounted for 24  of total revenues compared with 21  during the previous quarter Guidance   EstimatesManagement lowered guidance for fourth quarter 2017  primarily due to Display Bridge customers trimming the fourth quarter forecast by around  450 000 and the delay in placing order for a new wearable design by the company s tier one smartphone customer Additionally  its focus on the currently licensed technology running at high volume instead of expansion of the license agreement with an existing fab partner hurt the company s

segment has seen rapid growth driven by its EOS S3 software on a chip  SoC   which has the capability to support always on always listening requirement at a very low power consumption level As the world is moving toward voice interfaces like Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   Alexa  Apple s Siri  Alphabet s OK Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   the need for technology products that run on voice command is also increasing  This is leading to growing demand for this always on feature in the mobile  wearable  hearable and battery powered IoT products industries This new feature is replacing the previously prevalent push to talk feature  The hardware architecture used for the push to talk feature is not considered apt for the always on feature as it will consume more battery life  Consequently  QuickLogic s low power consuming EOS S3 SoC with an integrated Low Power Sound Detector or LPSD is gaining wide acceptance in this scenario The company is witnessing increasing demand for wearable products in the B2B market  primarily driven by higher demand from hospitals and fitness focused companies  which need to track body activities and biometric information The smartphone market also

105971,327486,A,Protea Biosciences  Serving Up Industry Changing Molecular,opinion,"Sometimes the most fertile of investment opportunities can be right in front of our eyes  Unfortunately  when it comes to identifying those possibilities in the publicly traded markets  it seems as though the emerging companies who don t pay to play often get snubbed by the big money trading desks that rely on quid pro quo underwriting opportunity before providing a snippet of research 
On the flip side  astute researchers don t limit their perspective  and search out hidden opportunities regardless of share price or market cap  working tirelessly to introduce innovative companies to the investing public  With that tireless endeavor to introduce in mind  Protea Biosciences stands out as a potential gift to investors focused on micro cap and emerging opportunities  And  with ongoing clinical validation of the company s technology  PRGB investors may be rewarded with near term milestone achievements 
Protea Biosciences  OTC PRGB  may be a five cent stock  but this revolutionary and next generation company is on the cusp of attracting the attention and professional recognition it deserves  To prove that point  Massachusetts General Hospital is advancing the potential in PRGB  by signing a collaborative agreement with the company to assess the revolutionary and groundbreaking diagnostic and oncology tools that PRGB can offer  Beyond the validation from Mass General  once investors begin to understand the science within the PRGB platform  which delivers a comprehensive identification of the molecular structure of cell s  the alluded to  gift  of investment makes clear sense  And  for those that look past the dollar signs and look for innovative and humanitarian opportunity  the collaboration with Mass General may potentially lead to the saving of thousands of lives per year 
Not only that  the relationship may serve to validate the PRGB platform entirely  ultimately attracting the attention of the large institutional investors that recognize obvious and actionable potential 
Leading From The Front
The most successful investors did not make fortunes following the herd  Instead  they led the pack and recognized opportunity well before others realized the obvious  So  while many turn their head from a company based solely on its price as a real indicator of value  it s those that look at the company and form an opinion based on a comprehensive analysis that may provide significant returns  And  while being in front of an investment pack may bring the initial brunt of headwinds  it s the leader that emerges first  and with the rewards from understanding and acting upon what others did not see 
To be sure  Massachusetts General is indeed providing a clue as to what the future may hold for PRGB  and the recently announced collaborative effort to co develop a new diagnostic methodology that will provide cancer cell molecular profiles may already be paving the way forward  Beyond just identifying cell cluster saliency  though  the diagnostic platform will further offer information as to how treating drugs are distributed through the cell clusters and provide indicators as to the molecular response  with the goal to improve patient treatment and outcomes 
So  for a moment  let the five cent stock price and the ridiculous and undervalued  21 2 million market cap take a back seat to the reality of what Protea Bioscience is doing  From there  investors can conclude as to whether the market has not only left this emerging gem behind but has also neglected to realize the bright future that lay ahead for this emerging oncology company 
Molecular Information In Seconds
Oncology stocks are not necessarily easy to define  and an extensive list of scientific words often get used to describe what may be a relatively straightforward concept 
Understanding the Protea function comes with the need to define some terms  but in its simplest form  the company uses its state of the art  mass spectra  technology to provide comprehensive insight into the molecular cell structure  that is  PRGB technology can identify the molecules being produced and living inside of human cells  No doubt  that s where Mass General realizes the benefit to the oncology field  basing an assumption that PRGB s platform can help to not only eliminate unnecessary treatment but can also utilize the molecular panels produced for reference in future analysis  But  having a library of data to aid in identifying cell abnormality is only one measure of the breakthrough technology  the other primary focus is on the speed of producing reliable data 
Here is a critical concept  speed is essential in oncology  And  PRGB is emerging as the potential leader by having the ability to create dependable  consistent and trusted data about molecular cell structure  by producing identifiable results in seconds and minutes instead of the days to weeks necessary in the alternative competitive landscape  This ability to communicate near immediate results is a huge benefit for medical and oncology specialists  and it can be the difference in providing efficient and targeted medical care for patients 
Not only does Protea deliver quick and reliable results  it does so in both 2D and 3D imaging  which allows for not only an in depth look at living and preserved cells but can drill into the cell to identify particular molecules that may be a contributing factor in a specific diagnosis  To date  the company  s technology has been featured in over 50 publications and utilized by a large number of Fortune 500 pharma and biotech companies  Additionally  Protea holds 13 patents to date and can be credited with establishing the first fully integrated molecular information technologies 
The importance in determining molecular identification is that it allows drug developers to understand precisely how their drug is functioning at the molecular level  that is  is the therapy reaching its molecular target and how much of the therapeutic value entered the cells and over what period  Beyond that  PRGB can educate clients on the duration of particular drugs therapeutic effect as well as if the drug is causing any molecular changes in the targeted cell cluster  In other words  if more pharmaceutical companies were utilizing the molecular mapping from PRGB  perhaps the manufacturer s disclaimer and side effect disclosures could be materially shorter  which would be a direct benefit to patients and manufacturer  alike 
Going a step further  most medical professionals will admit that getting a comprehensive data set of molecular information not only takes too long  but it also requires a highly trained medical staff to interpret the data and in most cases only provides a limited data set for interpretation  It s mind boggling sometimes to see that companies like Protea are readily available to offer timely and measurable solutions to existing scientific lapses  but  because of limited marketing budgets don t get the privilege of being extensively exposed to the market  However  in time  things are expected to change for Protea  as the industry recognizes the superior technology and benefit from PRGB s technology and begins to address the current industry limitations head on 
The Market Potential
Now that the Mass General collaboration may provide PRGB the additional recognition they deserve  the company is primed to tap into a significant global opportunity 
Currently  the worldwide market for pre clinical drug services is estimated to be an  11 billion per year proposition  Of the total market  it s projected that about  1 5 billion is spent on understanding and analyzing molecular information related to a particular drug s development  Looking at the growth of the biopharmaceutical market  which represents about one third of the pharmaceutical industry and is expected to be a  386 billion market by the year 2020  the likelihood for PRGB to take advantage of providing molecular information to a demand driven market is substantial  Beyond pre clinical drug services  PRGB is also positioned well to capitalize on the growing field of immunotherapy  a treatment that mobilizes the body s immune system to fight disease and malignancy  The opportunity presented in this sector is currently a  62 billion market and is expected to grow exponentially over the next decade 
But  at its core  the oncology sector should be enormously receptive to the PRGB technology  especially when the cost of drug development has increased to the point where numerous drugs that may offer life saving potential get stalled in pre clinical trials due to lack of funding  For small companies  having the opportunity to fail early and fail cheap is considerably more advantageous than running through a late stage trial only to miss the end point  While progressing to a Phase III trial may certainly benefit any given stock in the short term  the failure at that stage provides a quick dose of gravity and a likely plunge in market value  Therefore  utilizing the most revolutionary technology available as a predictor of results is a far better course of action to take  allowing drug developers to cut losses early and take on new initiatives and development programs 
It s not a matter of if large pharma is going to look to Protea for informational value  it s a matter of when  But  as always  time is more costly to an emerging company like PRGB than it is to a multi billion  if not trillion dollar industry  Hence  patience is a virtue here  and as the company continues to accumulate and publish supporting data  a compelling argument can be made as to why PRGB is worth the investor interest 
 Big Data  By Protea
The sum of the parts make PRGB worthy of investor interest  and the reasons why PRGB is positioned to capitalize in the coming years is open to those that understand the value within the science  Trillions of cells exist in the human body  and each of these cells produces billions of additional biologically active molecules that define the health and disease in a patient  What PRGB does is to identify the  molecular output  of the living cell  and more importantly to the patient or specialist  separates 1000 s of different molecules to be defined in a single analysis  For instance  if a physician was to look at an image of a lung tumor when using the PRGB analysis  he could determine molecular levels in lipids  peptides  proteins  and metabolites  The identification through these distinct classifications offers tremendous value to scientists and developers alike  providing a comprehensive and almost complete analysis of the cells within that tumor  In other words  Protea delivers  big data  
Protea uses its LAESI DP 1000  a ground breaking instrument that identifies metabolites  lipids  peptides  and other biomolecules to generate and analyze cell cluster samples at the rate of one per 7 seconds  The technology housed within the device can provide both 2D and 3D imaging  and needs no sample data which can often produce bias results  It s the first device that provides the technology to view deep inside a cell cluster for molecular analysis and also provides the benefit of storing the data in a molecular database for future use  Thus  prior results become a future revenue stream  making the value at PRGB more stable by providing for potential recurring revenue streams off of previous data 
The LAESI device can be extremely profitable to PRGB in that it is fully automated  and requires less specific attention by technicians  Further  it generates results in about sixty seconds  needs no outside antibodies to produce results and creates a molecular data grid in pixel generated imaging that can accurately target a predetermined area  Impressive to LAESI is that its 2D case study that showed imaging of bacterial colonies not only produced a clear image of treatment in progress  but the data from LAESI remains visible even after analysis  This value added component to LAESI improves the ability to assess new antibiotic effectiveness in comparison to prior treatment  The device also provides cumulative data to developers who are a significant driver for therapeutic evaluation 
The 3D imaging capacity of LAESI is impressive as well  enabling three dimensional molecular imaging and the ability for analysts to visualize a new cancer treatment molecule  as well as maintaining the therapeutic value associated with the molecular targets inside a studied tumor  It get s even more important for patients who have cancer  and as the medical community focuses on the value of the speedy results from PRGB technology  patients get rewarded with quick opportunity to receive appropriate and targeted care 
Protea is one of the few  if not only publicly traded company  that is targeting its proprietary technology to look inside cancer cells to provide  molecular fingerprints  intended to improve both diagnosis and management of the disease  Molecular tests in development at the company already is showing accurate detection and diagnostic value of malignant melanoma  In collaboration with Yale Department of Pathology  PRGB shared encouraging results published in the American Society of Dermatopathology which indicated a greater than 90  level of accuracy and specificity in identifying specific molecular structure  These results have led to an extensive follow on clinical trial that is currently underway  with completion expected in the second half of 2017 
The Protea Advantage
The story  beyond what the share price tells is encouraging  The adage to never judge a book by its cover rings especially true in this case  No doubt  PRGB is in the process of building a major corporate franchise that can provide the pharmaceutical industry access to proprietary molecular technology that offers unique capabilities in meeting analytical needs  Market adoption is expanding  and the company s client base has been growing  Also important to note is that PRGB has collaborative partnerships with Agilent Technologies  NYSE A   Protein Metrics  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  Yale University  and Massachusetts General Hospital  positioning the company for long term success in the expanding global drug development and molecular information services market 
Although PRGB has about 387 million shares outstanding  after taking into account all anti dilution provisions in a prior financing  the capital structure tells a far different story than what is transpiring on a scientific front  Mostly  PRGB is creating a better field of play for drug developers and molecular scientists  providing a detailed and comprehensive data set to work from that can offer both predictive value and cost saving benefit  At current levels  PRGB is more a victim of a market that  sell s  coverage and the lack of institutional support for PRGB not only hides its real value but also conceals the technology from a cancer industry that is desperate to find important data sources that can save lives  At current stock levels  Protea sits in undervalued territory  However  as is the case with many emerging stocks that get mired in the world of stock market shenanigans  it may only be a short matter of time before the investment world wakes up to the fact that PRGB may have one of the best molecular identification tools on the market  At that point  investor patience may ultimately get rewarded with higher and deserved company valuations

106038,327553,A,Is Agilent Stock A Good Buy Before Earnings ,opinion,"Agilent Technologies Inc  NYSE A  is an  18 12 billion company today  Investors that bought shares one year ago are sitting on a 25 94  total return  That s above the S P 500 s return of 16 29  
Agilent stock is beating the market  and it reports quarterly earnings tomorrow  But does that make it a good buy today  To answer this question  we ve turned to the Investment U Stock Grader  Our Research Team built this system to diagnose the financial health of a company 
Our system looks at six key metrics   
 EPS is an indicator of a company s profitability and is considered to be one of the most important variables in determining a company s share price  At Investment U and The Oxford Club  we look for companies that grow their earnings year over year   data original title  Earnings per Share  Earnings per Share  EPS  Growth Agilent reported a recent EPS growth rate of 40 54   That s below the healthcare sector average of 62 43   That s not a good sign  We like to see companies that have higher earnings growth    P E is a valuation ratio of a company s EPS compared to its current share price  Generally speaking  a high P E means the market is bullish on a stock  but it can also signal that a stock is overpriced  What we look for is a stock trading below its industry average  This means we can get a better deal on a stock compared to its peers   data original title  Price to Earnings  Price to Earnings  P E  The average price to earnings ratio of the healthcare sector is 32  And Foot Locker  NYSE FL  s ratio comes in at 32 20  The company looks expensive compared to many of its competitors 
  Debt to Equity   The debt to equity ratio for Agilent stock is 46 33   That s below the healthcare sector average of 59 09   The company is less leveraged 
  Free Cash Flow per Share Growth   Agilent s FCF has been lower than that of its competitors over the last year  That s not good for investors  In general  if a company is growing its FCF  it will be able to pay down debt  buy back stock  pay out more in dividends and or invest money back into the business to help boost growth  It s one of our most important fundamental factors 
  Profit Margins   The profit margin of Agilent comes in at 15 75  today  And generally  the higher  the better  We also like to see this margin above that of its competitors  Agilent s profit margin is above the healthcare average of 11 86   So that s a positive indicator for investors 
  Return on Equity  ROE  gives us a look at the amount of net income returned to shareholders  It tells us how much profit a company produces with the money shareholders invest  This is another metric that is useful in comparison to other companies in the same industry 
  Return on equity tells us how much profit a company produces with the money shareholders invest  The ROE for Agilent is 12 16   and that s below its sector average ROE of 17 98

Agilent Technologies  Inc   A   a global company that provides application focused solutions to the life sciences  diagnostics  and applied chemical markets yesterday reported their second quarter 2017 financial results 
Agilent reported second quarter of  0 58 per share which beat analyst expectations of  0 48 per share  Agilent reported second quarter revenues of  1 1 billion which beat analyst expectations of  1 05 billion 
Agilent Technologies  Inc  Company s Comments

 The Agilent team delivered another excellent quarter   said Mike McMullen  Agilent President and CEO   Both revenue and earnings per share exceeded the high range of guidance  We saw a strong pick up in the Chemical and Energy business after modest gains last quarter  and strong growth in Pharma and Europe also contributed to the upside  
 We continue to deliver on our long term focus of driving above market growth  expanding operating margins  and deploying capital in a balanced manner   he added   Looking ahead  we are confident in our company s prospects  and we are raising our full year core revenue growth and earnings expectations   

A Technical Analysis

A opened trading yesterday at  56 52 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  56 13  A closed trading yesterday at  56 08 and spiked up after market to  58 55  equivalent to a 4  increase from the closing price  Doing some more  we can see the last time A traded above these levels we have to go all the way back to the month of April  2000 when it traded at  63 39 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike up A had been in an overall upward trend dating back to December 1st  2016 when it traded at  43 21  A has a float of 321 77 million shares and traded 2 49 times the normal daily trading volume on Monday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see A open trading on Tuesday above  57 75 or the  and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 25 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

The RSI is moving up through the mid line with the MACD crossed up and rising  Look for continuation to participate to the upside   

KeyCorp  NYSE KEY 

KeyCorp  KEY  had been floundering in a wide range sideways action along with many financial names  until it pushed higher in late October  For the past week it has consolidated that move in a bull flag 
As it consolidates the RSI is pulling back from an overbought condition while the MACD is turning down  Look for a break of the flag to the upside to participate higher   

Vulcan Materials Company  NYSE VMC 

Vulcan Materials  VMC  had a strong run higher off of a low in January as well  It peaked in July and pulled back to its 200 day SMA  Since then it has struggled to make a new high  finding resistance a couple of times at the 50 day SMA 
Friday saw another push to that resistance  The RSI is rising and in the bullish zone while the MACD is rising and positive  Look for a break over resistance to participate higher   
Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into the first full week of November and with the US elections Tuesday  sees the equity markets are weak and hemorrhaging 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue higher in the short term while Crude Oil continues to move lower  The US Dollar Index looks to continue to the downside while US Treasuries are biased lower but consolidating  The Shanghai Composite should continue to drift higher while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain elevated keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts agree and look better to the downside on both the daily and weekly timeframes  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

106063,327578,A,Vipshop  VIPS  Stock Rallies As Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates,opinion,"Shares of the chinese specialty online retailer Vipshop Holdings Ltd    NYSE VIPS   rallied 1 42  in New York after hours trading on May 15 after posting better than expected results in the first quarter of 2017 
Quarter in Detail
The Chinese online discount retailer reported adjusted earnings of 19 cents per share  Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents by 18 75   Net income increased 26  on local currency on a year over year basis  driven by higher sales 
Revenues surged 31 1  to  2 32 billion in the quarter  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 26 billion by 2 76   despite a challenging macro environment  Accelerated growth in active customers  repeat customers and total orders over the past quarter led to better than expected earnings 
During the quarter  the number of active customers increased 32  to 26 0 million  The number of total orders increased 23  to 72 1 million from 58 7 million in the prior year period 
Margins
Gross profit soared 25 0  in local currency to  536 7 million  However  gross margin contracted 110 basis points  bps  to 23 2  due to the company s promotional pricing to attract customers  The company expects to manage gross margin in the near term as it is making efforts to balance promotional activities and sales with its marketing expenses 
Adjusted operating income increased 31 2  to  145 9 million  Operating margin remained flat at 6 3  in the first quarter Vipshop Holdings Limited Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Other Financial Data
As of Mar 31  2017  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  644 3 million  capital expenditure of  85 1 million  At the end of the quarter  operating cash flow was  107 04 million  while free cash flow was  62 3 million 
Last week  Vipshop s board authorized the company to explore a proposed spin off of its Internet finance business into a dedicated entity  The objective of this proposal is to lessen the financial impact of Internet finance business on the company s core e commerce business and shift any associated incentives and risks to this dedicated entity 
Second Quarter 2017 Guidance
For the second quarter  the company expects total net revenue to increase in the range of approximately 26 30  on a year over year basis 
Our Take
We are impressed by the fact that Vipshop has delivered impressive results in a difficult macroeconomic environment  This was driven by the addition of new customers in the first quarter  which fueled top line growth  The company also witnessed the addition of younger and more Internet  and mobile savvy shoppers to its customer base 
Vipshop now expects to target these expanding demographics and offer products tailored for shoppers in various age groups  The company will also focus on delivering more personalized products and services to customers 
The ongoing macroeconomic slowdown in China and increasing competition in the retail space remain the major deterents 
Stock Price Movement
A glimpse of Vipshop sstock performance shows that its shares have been underperforming the Zacks categorized  industry since the past six months  Shares have inched up 0 66  in the said time frame  as against the Zacks categorized industry s growth of 19 9  in the past six months  Notably  the industry is part of the bottom 27  of the Zacks Classified industries  194 out of the 265   The broader Consumer Staples sector is placed at the top 44  of the Zacks Classified sectors  7 out of 16  

Vipshop currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Stocks that Warrant a Look
A better ranked stock in the same industry is MakeMyTrip Limited   NASDAQ MMYT    which carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Other better ranked players in the broader sector include Agilent Technologies  Inc    NYSE A   and AMTEK  Inc    NYSE A    Both of the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  While Agilent Technologies has a long term earnings growth rate of 9 65   AMTEK has a growth rate of 11 1  
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

106078,327593,A,Good News In Biotech Stocks  If You Know Where To Look,opinion,"It s been a bumpy year for biotech stocks 
Industry index funds are down by double digits  The main culprit  A rash of bad PR 
2016 has seen a number of scandals and botched clinical trials from big names like Theranos and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  NYSE VRX   Most recently  Mylan  Nasdaq  NASDAQ MYL  made headlines when it hiked EpiPen prices by 400     while at the same time raising salaries for top executives 
These negative stories have put the healthcare market in a sour mood  But believe it or not  there s still plenty of upside in the sector 
You just have to know where to look 
In truth  biotechnology isn t a single industry  It s made up of several distinct fields of medical research and development  Most of the pessimism is centered around the field of treatment drugs 
But many other areas  like genomics  surgical tech and vaccines  have been doing just fine 
We re going to look at some biotech stocks that aren t focused on the more volatile pill making industry  These three companies have actually seen double digit gains over the course of this year 

Genomics
Thanks to advances in technology  it s a great time to study DNA  The genomics industry has seen impressive growth in recent years  And looking forward  it has a forecasted compound annual growth rate of more than 15  
One company that s pushing the field forward   and rewarding shareholders in the process   is Agilent Technologies  NYSE A  

The company was spun off from HP Inc  NYSE HPQ  in 1999  Since then  it has grown into a market leader in genetic analysis  cloning and lab equipment 
Agilent is up by more than 14  from the beginning of the year  and it ll likely push higher 
In the last year  it has had newsworthy breakthroughs in two areas  lab grown meat production and heart disease research   It s an elegant business model   one project feeds the other  
On top of that  Agilent has beaten earnings estimates for two quarters running 
Surgical Tech
With an aging population like ours  there s high demand for safe and effective surgical technology  One of the biggest makers of joint replacements  operating room supplies and neutrotechnology devices is Stryker Corporation  NYSE SYK  

The company has led the S P 500 in terms of relative strength  And  despite a skittish earnings report last quarter  Stryker shares are up by more than 22  this year 
As long as there are bad knees and hips to be replaced  Stryker should continue to grow 

Vaccines
The Zika outbreak in Florida is scary stuff  But for investors  there s a silver lining  Recent public health scares have meant big gains for the vaccine industry 
It s certainly been a good year for Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ INO  

Several of its vaccines and immunotherapy products have passed Phase I trials  Some of Inovio s most ambitious projects include prophylactics for Zika  Ebola and Hepatitis B  They re a big part of why shares are up more than 38  year to date 
To learn more about investing in the race for a Zika vaccine  check out our article here 
It s easy to feel gloomy about the biotech market s prospects  Industry headlines are dominated by controversy from a few  bad apple  companies  But the treatment drugs industry is just one component of this multifaceted sector 
Many biotech stocks are doing better than ever  And unless we cure death itself  there will only be more opportunities to profit ",2016-08-30,Investment U,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/good-news-in-biotech-stocks,-if-you-know-where-to-look-200150686",200150686

106200,327715,A,Hey Fed   You Can t Jawbone A Bungee Jump,opinion,Incredible to me  as well as to many others I am sure  is the fact that the words of one guy  Chairman Bernanke  who is leaving office soon  carries more weight in the market than all of the actual news that we see from day to day Friday  France s sovereign rating was lowered by S P to AA  from AAA  This is more significant than it sounds  since it means that none of the European  bailout  institutions can feasibly carry a AAA rating any more unless Germany and the Netherlands want to guarantee the whole thing   They don t   In a humorous note  the French Finance Minister said that the country remains committed to restoring growth  lowering deficits  and adding jobs  Hmmm  One of these three doesn t seem to belong in a statement about restoring the credit of the nation  How does adding jobs   stimulus  that is   help the situation  It was a strange statement Portugal s situation is worsening again as President Silva is insisting on a broader  unity  government in which all parties participate in the government  and take the heat for austerity measures   Not all of the other parties agree  in particular the Socialists are demanding new elections  while declaring  we must abandon the politics of austerity  and renegotiate the terms of our adjustment programme   In this dust up  the more extreme elements of the political sphere in Portugal are calling for debt repudiation  Portuguese bond yields  10y  are back up to 7 35   which is well above the 5 20  lows from May although also a far cry from the 16  levels in the teeth of the crisis early last year  see chart  source Bloomberg   Philadelphia Fed President Plosser  on Friday that the Fed should start exiting from the asset purchase program in September  and completely cease buying bonds by the end of the year  He is concerned about causing another housing boom  too late    and thinks the costs outweigh the further benefits  He is right  and bonds took some brief grief before investors remembered that  a  he s not the Chairman  who has the only vote that matters  and  b  he s not even an FOMC voter this year  None of this   not France  not Portugal  not Plosser   rattled the U S  equity market in the slightest  because Bernanke has pledged to keep the taps running as long as possible  tapering slowly  and then maintaining easy policy for a long time  So investors are delighted to see stocks at all time  nominal  price highs with nearly a 24 Shiller P E  At these levels  the expected real total return for the next decade from the stock market is less than 1 75  per annum with 10 year TIPS yielding 0 50   So does the continued presence of easy money from the Fed warrant exceptional risk taking and valuation in equities  It seems to me that it does not  Removing QE is  of course  tightening relative to the baseline of current policy  Policy may remain absolutely easy  but it is going to be relatively tighter and the direction of interest rates  not merely their level  matters to investors  Of course  Fed mouthpieces clearly want to suggest that  policy will remain accommodative   Indeed it will  and it will also remain accommodative when the Fed Funds rate rises to 1  and 2  and 3  someday  But it will be less accommodative  or in other words  more restrictive  The word smithing by the Chairman in this regard is understandable  because the jawboning is an important part of policy for a central bank that is nearly impotent due to prior decisions  But it is absurd  Previously  investors were asked to stomach the  Perpetual Motion Machine  interpretation of policy  that buying bonds would push interest rates lower and increase economic activity  while selling them wouldn t push rates higher or decrease activity  or prices in related markets   This latest tweak to the argument asks us to believe also that buying fewer bonds has the same  positive  effect as buying a lot of bonds  Again  I completely understand why the Fed is trying to jawbone the markets to their way of thinking  But you can t jawbone a bungee jump  and the inflection of policy here is the start of a bungee jump  The risk here is that investors decide that the Fed is really going to be slow at removing accommodation  which I think is correct   but inflation is going to start to be problematic sooner than that  That sort of attitude adjustment may be closer than you think  for two reasons  First of all  the CPI report is due on Tuesday  Market expectations are for a figure lower than last month s  0 17  rise in core inflation  and a decline in the year year core inflation rate to  1 6   from 1 7   as last June s  0 21  rolls out of the 12 month comparison  I believe there is a good chance that core comes in better than that  although it is unlikely to push the year on year change higher  But it could  since housing continues to accelerate and these low figures require ever increasing drag from core goods prices  In any event  though  inflation will accelerate on a year on year basis in August  because the easy comparisons begin   0 10    0 06    0 15    0 17    0 12   and  0 12  are the monthly changes in core prices for the last six months of 2012  a 1 4  pace in aggregate  And the underlying inflation dynamics are accelerating at the same time  The second reason that inflation expectations may begin to rise among investors soon is more pedestrian  in more ways than one   gasoline prices have recently spiked 40 cents in the futures markets  from near the lows of the year to near the highs of the year  This will pass through to retail gasoline prices over the next few weeks  If gasoline prices do not rise further from here  then no important shift in inflation perceptions will likely happen  But keep an eye on this   sophisticated measure of  consumer inflation angst  has been at multi decade lows for some time  see chart   but a fairly reasonable shortcut way to evaluate how consumers are feeling about inflation is to look at prices at the gas pump  You should note that there are two spikes on this chart  One covers the move higher from March 2001 to February 2003  a period during which stocks fell 28   The second covers May 2007 to July 2009  covering a 35  slump in prices   There is also a minor blip from November 2010 to September 2011  a period during which the S P only dropped 4   Of course  increasing consumer inflation angst wasn t the only thing that was happening during those periods that helped to drive stocks down  Among other things  valuations were high  Indeed  valuations were high partly because inflation angst was so low  And one ought to consider this  if stocks decline from here in concert with rising inflation expectations  we would be able to say the same thing looking back  it isn t only rising inflation expectations  but also high valuations and plenty of bad news to go around ,2013-07-14,Michael

106201,327716,A,Amazon Invests  2B To Expand Operations In India,opinion,"Online retailing giant Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  recently announced that it is planning to invest  2 billion  INR12 000 crore  to expand its operations in India 
The news comes on the heels of the recent announcement by Flipkart  India s largest e tailer  to raise funds worth  1 billion  further heating up the competition 
Amazon stated that India is a fast growing e Commerce market which offers ample expansion opportunities  The additional investment will support its online retail business and enhance the customer and seller experience in the country 
Amazon forayed into the Indian market in Feb 2012 with the launch of Junglee com  a site which allows customers to compare prices online and read customer reviews but not purchase items directly 
In Jun 2013  Amazon launched its online marketplace in India where it sells books  films  TV shows  mobile phones and cameras among other items through its website Amazon in  Seeing the overwhelming response in India  Amazon plans to further increase its investments in India and gain from the country s rapidly growing online retail market 
According to the global management consulting firm Boston Consulting Group  BCG   India is the third largest country after U S  and China in terms of Internet users and is now on the verge of a digital revolution  The firm expects Internet users in India to increase threefold from 120 million in 2011 to 330 million by 2016 
According to BCG  India is  however  far behind other countries like China and the United States in terms of online shopping  Nevertheless  given the Internet savvy population  BCG predicts that there is room for further growth 
Naturally  established U S  based e Commerce players like Amazon will try to make India the future e Commerce hub  Recently  the company announced its plan to build five more fulfillment centers in India  bringing the total number of large warehouses to seven  These warehouses help online retailers to store products and handle shipments and returns quickly 
With the expansion of Amazon  we can expect more fulfillment warehouses to serve major Indian metropolitan areas 
As Amazon is way ahead of the other online retailers due to its product selection  pricing  deals and platforms  the company could give strong competition to local players  primarily Flipkart  The company  in our view  is performing true to its form recording revenue growth and generating significant cash flow quarter upon quarter  discounting seasonal variations  
However  uncertainty regarding its investment plans and the probability of incurring losses in the near term keep us on the periphery regarding the shares 
Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Stocks that have been performing well and are worth considering include E Commerce China Dangdang  NYSE DANG   Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Agilent Technologies  NYSE A   all carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ",2014-08-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amazon-invests-$2b-to-expand-operations-in-india-221322,221322

106203,327718,A,Historically  A Good Month To Trade,opinion,"Technical Outlook 
A respectable dose of selling yesterday that saw S P 500 pullback to  as noted in the chart below 
For the month  S P 500 managed to finish 1 05 points higher   a move of 0 05   Essentially the market spent the past month doing nothing 
S P 500 pulled back perfectly to the 20 day moving average as well as the 10 day moving average while breaking down and below the 5 day  
First day of the month can often times see significant moves take place in either direction  December  historically  is a very positive month for the market and I ll look for the that to hold true this year as well 
Volume came back yesterday as the market traded at average levels 
S P 500 30 minute chart is starting to show some  tendencies in the market  Today s gap up will need to hold and ultimately break out of the seven day narrow trading the range the market has been in 
CBOE Volatility Index popped yesterday 6 7  and back over 16 to settle at 16 13  Ultimately  I don t see this market seeing any heavy selling until it gets into the 11 12 range on VIX 
T2108    of stocks trading above their 40 day moving average  has shown very little movement of late  dropping 3  yesterday to settle in at 52  
I am still expecting at some point for there to be a break to the upside to challenge the rally highs and ultimately S P 500 s all time highs 
The rising trend line off of the September lows should be a strong support level for the market should this market breakdown  Its current support level rests at 2062 
Declining resistance off of the May highs on S P 500 still rests at 2116 
SPDR S P 500  N SPY  is essentially sitting in the middle of the range that has plagued the market all year long  outside of the August September sell off 
A massive inverse head and shoulders pattern is forming on S P 500 that is worth following  A move above 2116 area would confirm the pattern 
For twelve years straight  the market over the course of the last 30 trading days of the calendar year  has yielded a net positive gain  and thus reinforcing the concept of the  Santa Rally  
A rate hike is expected out of December s Fed meeting  However  I still would not be surprised if the Fed backed out of raising rates yet again  They ve been doing just that for years now

Sold Tesoro Corporation  N TSO  yesterday at  115 44 for a 1 7  gain

106224,327739,A,Austerity And Growth Perspectives  US  Europe  The IMF  China,opinion,IntroductionPart 1 of this report highlighted the positions of the IMF and Europe on the austerity growth trade off as reflected in discussion on what to do about the problems of Greece  Italy  Portugal  and Spain  This second part examines austerity growth perspectives in China and the US  As Table 1 makes clear  the economic situation in China and the US are quite different from the Euro countries covered in Part 1  China s growth  although slightly less than in earlier years  remains remarkably high  The US does appear to be recovering from the global recession  albeit slowly  And even though China and the US do not have the debt and unemployment problems of the Euro countries  there is still an ongoing debate on austerity growth in both countries Table 1    Economic Projections  Eurozone Countries  China and the USThe US  Is This the Time for Austerity in the US  In 2009 10  the depth of the global recession with 16 million unemployed  there was widespread agreement in the US that growth trumped austerity and a stimulus was needed  Consequently  Congress enacted a  787 billion stimulus package  But Congress has been unwilling since then to pass any significant stimulus bill  even though the economic recovery has been slow  There were several reasons for not further Congressional action  Republicans stated objective  block all Obama initiatives A debate over the size and role of government  a  Republicans favor lower taxes and expenditures  b  Democrats support higher government investment outlays and higher taxes on the rich  and  c  Others worry about the growing government deficit  With further Congressional action blocked  fiscal policy  higher government expenditures  lower taxes  was no longer available as a tool to stimulate the economy  However  Ben Bernanke took over for Alan Greenspan as the head of the Federal Reserve in 2006  Much of his research had been on just how long it took the world to recover from the  29 global recession  To avoid a repeat of the slow  29 recovery  he believed vigorous government stimulation efforts are needed  And with additional fiscal stimulatory efforts blocked  Bernanke said he would do all he could to stimulate the economy  And he has  since 2008  the US money supply  M1  has increased by 76   And the Fed has kept interest rates near zero  Arguments Pro and Con a  Pro Growth Stimulus Perhaps the most convincing argument for growth continuing stimulus has been made by Joe Stiglitz  a Nobel Prize winner and a former VP and Chief economist of the World Bank  After observing that the US recovery remains  anemic      The risks are asymmetric  if these forecasts are wrong  and there is a more robust recovery  then  of course  expenditures can be cut back and or taxes increased  But if these forecasts are right  then a premature  exit  from deficit spending risks pushing the economy back into recession  It is notable that the IMF  after the Greece fiasco  is supportive of the Stiglitz position  After reviewing the US situation     The recovery continues to be tepid  employment remains well below pre crisis levels  and the housing market is stabilizing but is still at depressed levels  Fiscal deficit reduction should proceed at a measured pace  to avoid undermining the fragile recovery  Monetary policy remains appropriately accommodative  with room for some further easing if the outlook were to deteriorate  More resources should be devoted to active labor market policies  including those aimed at the long term unemployed  to prevent long term unemployment from becoming structural  Further monetary easing may weaken the U S  dollar  but would have positive spillovers from strengthening the U S  economy and hedging against downside risks   The Fund mentions  further weakening of the US dollar   To put this in perspective  the dollar has weakened 28  in value against the dollar since the Eurozone came into being in 1999  That was very helpful  It has allowed the US to remain competitive with Japan  Since the  weak sisters  in the Eurozone do not have their own currency  they cannot use an exchange rate adjustment to stay competitive on world markets  But overall  unlike what is happening in Europe  there is general agreement on what is needed to resolve the twin concerns  a stimulus was needed to get the economy going and now a plan to curb the growing deficit should be put in place  The only issue now is when and how the deficit cutting should start  In actual fact  it has already started with the ending of the payroll tax holiday and the beginning of the  Sequester   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the sequestration will reduce government outlays by  100 billion in 2013 and 2014  The  estimates that ending the payroll tax holiday and other tax changes will mean tax increases of  400 billion in 2013  b  Pro Austerity Deficit Reduction As indicated above  the supporters of austerity include groups that want to reduce the size of government and those who are seriously concerned over growing debt  Their cause got a boost when Harvard professor and ex IMF economist Ken Rogoff teamed up with Carmen Reinhardt to write     The findings have been taken to mean that when the debt to GDP ratio of a government exceeds 90   GDP growth slows down  While the study has been largely discredited by other scholars e g   Robert Huebscher  because of statistical errors and questionable country groupings  the book did provide support for the pro austerity advocates  But the debate in the US is quite different then it is in Europe  In the US  both growth and austerity supporters agree that at some point  the focus should turn to deficit reduction  In fact  President Obama appointed Alan Simpson  Republican  and Erskine Bowles  Democrat  to head up a commission intended to find the best way to end the deficit  The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform  the Simpson Bowles report  recommended reducing the federal deficit by nearly  4 trillion and eliminating it by 2035  Outlays would be reduced from 24  of GDP in 2010 to 21  in 2035 while revenues would rise from 15  in 2010 to 21  in 2035  In addition  the report called for significant health care and social security reforms  And while the report was not signed by the 14 vote threshold of commissioners required to formally endorse the blueprint  the report provides all the information needed to end the deficit using different approaches  China  A Different Type of Austerity Growth Debate Table 1 indicates that China is very different position than Europe or the US  rapid growth  low unemployment  and low debt  But it also is facing growth austerity issues  they are just longer term  For the last two decades  China s amazing growth has been fueled by exports to the West  And in recent years  as export growth has slowed  the government has launched major infrastructure programs for roads  railroads  and energy  And at the same time  the private sector has supported huge urban real estate developments  The result has been a 52  investment rate  Perhaps austerity in China should be measured by it consumption rate of only 48  of GDP  Until the mid  90s  the Chinese government made it very difficult for citizens to move from rural to urban areas  These policies were then relaxed  in part to supply the workers needed for the explosion in urban real estate development   The result has been a rush to urban areas  Since 1990  the China s workforce has grown by 25   In that same period the urban population has more than doubled  growing from 300 million to nearly 700 million  The  growth  question in China is where future jobs will come from  Exports are no longer generating new jobs  urban real estate development is slowing  and how much more infrastructure investment makes sense  The hope is that demand from the growing middle classes will pick up the slack   less austerity But here is the rub  much of the demand from the growing middle class will be for Western products  And this is the point at which discussions of austerity start  China is a resource poor country  Iron ore is good example  Unlike the US that makes all the new steel it needs from scrap  China needs to import iron ore to make steel  Energy is another case where China is resource poor  Since 1995  Chinese energy imports are up 13 times to 16  of total imports  Commodities have increased 17 times to 23  of total imports  53  of China s energy imports are for oil  and oil imports will continue to grow  China s middle classes want autos and other import intensive consumer goods  Consider autos  a product that the Chinese middle class wants  In the US  there are 802 motor vehicles per thousand people  It is interesting to ask what will happen to oil consumption when there are 400 motor vehicles per thousand people in China  That would mean more than an eightfold increase in Chinese vehicles  Assume they drive the same distances as the current vehicles and are powered by and get the same miles per gallon as the current vehicles  This would cause Chinese auto fuel demands to increase by almost 9 times  That growth would increase global oil demand by 77  over its current production level  This will not happen  Something has to give In March of this year  China ran  800 million international trade deficit  OK  So while FocusEconomics predicts a  248 billion trade surplus for 2013  China is changing  China s demand for foreign goods is growing  At the same time  rising labor costs are reducing export margins  Would lower growth help  Consider the IMF  judgment   The economy seems to be undergoing a soft landing  though global headwinds are increasing  Growth is expected to moderate to around 8 percent this year and inflation to drop to 3  percent  Meanwhile  a political transition is underway  The economy has been slowing partly as a result of policy action to moderate growth to a more sustainable pace  but a worsening of the euro area crisis poses a key risk to the outlook China s growth has become increasingly dependent on investment  a pattern that will be difficult to sustain  Therefore  there is a need to accelerate progress in transforming the economic growth model to be more reliant on consumer demand  Such a transformation would substantially boost living standards and make growth more balanced  inclusive  and sustainable   In other words  less austerity ConclusionsAn austerity growth debate is happening in China and the US  But it is quite different than what is being discussed in Europe  Austerity in Greece and Spain has caused overall unemployment rates to approach 30   with unemployment rates of young people exceeding 50   And yet the Germans continue to push austerity  It appears the IMF has learned its lesson  it is calling for stretching out government deficit reduction periods and lower debt  presumably via defaults   not something the European banks want to hear  The US is different  while there are political blockages  the austerity growth trade offs are clearly understood  And assuming the recovery stays on track  the focus on reducing the government deficit will gain momentum in the next few months Looking at China from a Western perspective  things look great  should the GDP growth rate be 8 or 10   But there are clouds on the horizon  Will its huge trade surplus of recent years of recent years turn negative  And if so  will it be forced to borrow huge sums internationally to finance its imports And then there are the growing energy needs  Global warming will get much worse as both China and India burn all the fossil fuels they can obtain to satisfy the energy needs of their more than 2 billion citizens ,2013-05-24,Elliott

106225,327740,A,USD Rallies On Rising Rates,opinion,Impressive US economic data  higher home prices and a cyclical high in consumer confidence  sent US interest rates soaring  which pushed the dollar higher against almost all currencies overnight  10yr US Treasury yields jumped 17 bps while expectations for Fed funds in January 2016 also rose 17 bps to 0 86   It was noticeable that the stock market managed to gain nonetheless  which indicates that this was a  good  rise in rates   one caused by an expectation of a better economy  not expectations of Fed tightening to dampen the economy  as happened last week  The next step will be to see how the Fed reacts to the higher rates  Will it see the move as an appropriate reflection of the signs of an improving economy  or will it think that the market is over reacting  Chairman Bernanke gave a speech about interest rates in March in which he said    w e anticipate that long term rates will rise as the recovery progresses and expected short term real rates and term premiums return to more normal levels   But if the market is over reacting  then   a djustments to the pace or timing of asset sales could be used  under some circumstances  to dampen excessively sharp adjustments in longer term interest rates   Perhaps when Boston Fed President Rosengren speaks in Minneapolis today he ll address that issue in the Q A afterwards In any event  the divergence in monetary policy between the Fed and almost all other central banks around the world is why we expect the dollar to rise overall this year  Rising house prices and strong consumer confidence as we saw overnight suggests that the US economy can withstand modestly higher interest rates  When almost all other countries are likely to keep their rates steady or lower them further  the rising interest rate differential should support USD  particularly against countries that will maintain a loosening bias  such as Japan or the UK  and perhaps the Eurozone   Today  German CPI for May  EU harmonized version  is forecast to rise to 1 4  yoy from 1 1   This would probably be EUR positive  because it implies less need for the ECB to cut rates next week  The German employment data is not expected to be particularly exciting  As for EU money supply  the continued decline in lending may be more important than the headline figure as pressure grows on the ECB to do more to help businesses  The European Commission will make its annual economic policy recommendations for each country today and European austerity programs will be under consideration  In the US  the weekly mortgage application figures are the only data out today  Elsewhere  today is Mark Carney s last meeting as Governor of the Bank of Canada  No change in rates is expected  rather  the question is whether they will tinker with the last sentence of the statement  which promises that rates will be steady for some undefined  period of time  and then rise  Several other central banks around the world have shifted to an easing bias  and with the Canadian CPI now down to a mere  0 4  yoy   0 5  yoy core   it s possible that they shift their bias as well The

106226,327741,A,Emerging Markets  What Has Changed ,opinion, from my colleagues Dr  Win Thin and Ilan Solot    This is what has changed in the EM space in  our view   1  Brazil is stepping up its defences against market volatility  2  Signs that China is looking for more  and better  sources of external funding sources is mounting  3  Turkish central bank governor Basci seems ready to take action to stabilize markets   1  Brazil is stepping up its defences against market volatility  Finance Minister Mantega announced Wednesday the lowering of IOF tax on foreign investments in local fixed income markets from 6  to 0   The tax was introduced in 2011 when the real was under pressure to appreciate   Now both the Finance Ministry and the central bank  via swaps  are together trying to  A  slow down further BRL depreciation and or  B  cap the move at 2 15  Their intention is not yet clear  and we may never know  Still  we think their commitment  and capability  is strong enough to help BRL outperform other EM currencies in periods of broad dollar strength   2  Signs that China is looking for more  and better  sources of external funding sources is mounting  This week  the media suggest that plans are moving ahead to cut red tape to boost foreign investment by easing application and approval procedures for foreign investors  Separately  we are hearing more talk about the development of local bond futures markets to give investors better hedging tools   These developments are in line with the view that there may be growing urgency to attract more stable funding capital to make up for the diminished capacity of local lenders  In fact  reports suggest that China s big four banks issued only RMB208 bln loans in May  down from RMB245 bln in April   This will surely lead to a downward revision of expectations for the May new yuan loans data release next week  where consensus is currently at RMB850 bln   3  Turkish central bank governor Basci seems ready to take action to stabilize markets  Expectations have now rightfully shifted from easing to tightening of monetary conditions  We could see the bank return to the policy framework of using  special  days and  normal  days for liquidity management and guiding the interbank rate higher   The interbank rate has risen from around 4 0  in mid May to 5 6  now  At this point  the upper end of the corridor set at 6 50  represents the upper limit for the interbank rate  Raising the top end of the corridor would be a drastic measure  and we don t think it will happen unless the situation gets a lot worse  We do note that rising political concerns go hand in hand with steadily deteriorating economic fundamentals in Turkey ,2013-06-08,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/emerging-markets:-what-has-changed-170266,170266
106227,327742,A,Emerging Markets Outlook  Scarcer Capital Adds Pressure,opinion,Emerging market currencies will remain under pressure this week  We continue to think that countries with poor fundamentals and high financing needs  twin deficits  will fare poorly as fears of scarcer global capital build ahead of the FOMC meeting this week   The central bank of Turkey meets Tuesday  and is not expected to change policy rates  For now  the corridor mechanism continues to work as the central bank tightened liquidity last week by raising the average cost of funding from 4 5  to near 5 0   This was in response to the weak lira  which has since stabilized  The corridor is currently 3 5 6 5   and so there is some upside for the average COF before the central bank would need to raise the ceiling   However  the political situation remains very fluid  worsening over the weekend after some conciliatory signs from Erdogan last week  The risk  therefore  is for tighter policy  USD TRY is likely to move higher as political risk worsens  Near term  resistance seen near 1 88  1 90  and then the June high near 1 91  while support seen near 1 86  1 85  and 1 84   South Africa reports May CPI on Wednesday  expected to remain steady at 5 9  y y  Q1 current account is also due out that same day  and is expected to widen to  6 9  of GDP from  6 5  in Q4  We think the data will underscore the problems facing the country right now  namely high inflation and widening external deficits at a time when global capital flows are likely to start ebbing  Some signs of progress between the unions and mining companies are welcome  but we think social tensions will still remain high  We think USD ZAR should have trouble staying below 10 for an extended period of time  Support seen near 9 85 and then 9 50  resistance seen near 10 00 and then 10 37   Taiwan reports May export orders on Thursday  expected at  1 3  y y vs   1 1  y y in April  The export driven model of growth is clearly not working at a time of slowing global growth  Inflation remains very low  and would certainly justify monetary easing  However  we think that the focus will more likely be on keeping TWD competitive  Recent yen gains are welcome  as the TWD JPY cross has fallen about 10  from its mid May peak near 3 48  Much will also depend on mainland growth  and that is looking more problematic  For USD TWD  support seen near 29 60 and then 29 40  resistance seen near 30 00 and then 30 20   HSBC China flash PMI for June will be reported Thursday  expected to remain steady at 49 2  Slowdown fears are picking up in China  The official PMI improved in May to 50 8  but is seen as overstating IP  HSBC reading tracks IP better  and it fell back below 50 in May for the first time since October 2012  The failed bond auction on Friday  first in 2 years  continues to reverberate in markets  We think there is a fragile balance here  with  A  local financial institutions strapped for cash   B  low interest rates driving depositors to seek higher yielding  wealth management products   and  C  much of the additional funding coming from hot money inflows  On the latter  PBOC data released on Friday showed that inflows remained positive in May but slowed considerably  We think the need to attract capital is a major reason why PBOC continues to allow the yuan to appreciate  USD CNY was fixed Monday at a new low just below 6 16   On Thursday  Poland publishes central bank minutes for the June meeting  when it cut rates 25 bp to 2 75   Official comments suggest another 25 50 bp of easing is likely for this current cycle  We concur  Ahead of the minutes  Poland will report May wages and employment on Tuesday and May IP on Wednesday  Data seen coming in weak will likely justify further easing  We do not think officials are targeting any particular level for EUR PLN  despite recent FX intervention on the spike above 4 30  For now  we see the 4 20 4 3 range holding  A break below 4 20 targets 4 15 and then 4 10  while break above 4 30 opens up a test of 4 35 and then 4 40   Brazil reports mid June IPCA inflation Friday  expected at 6 66  y y vs  6 46  y y in mid May  If so  this would be the highest rate since mid November and back above the 2 5 6 5  target range  May current account data is also due out Friday  and is expected at   6 11 bln vs    8 3 bln in April  FDI is seen slowing to  2 9 bln vs   5 7 bln in April  Brazil also is facing high inflation and widening external deficits at a time of slowing capital inflows  and that s a major reason why recent measures to shore up the currency have not gained much traction  The USD BRL continues to trade around the 2 15 area  just below the cycle high near 2 1650 from June 11  We expect sporadic FX intervention to prevent runaway BRL weakness  but we do not think the defense of the 2 15 area will be aggressive within the context of general dollar strength   Mexico central bank minutes are due out Friday  Despite market expectations of a more dovish Banxico  we think the central bank sent a very consistent message as it kept rates steady in early June  After the decision was announced  the bank acknowledged softness in the economy but did not seem in any hurry to cut rates again  With inflation still well above the 2 4  target range  we think easing is highly unlikely near term  For USD MXN  support seen nears 12 60 and then 12 40  resistance seen near 12 80 and then 13 00   On Monday  the Reserve Bank of India met and kept policy unchanged  as expected  The weak rupee and still high inflation were simply too much for the central bank to ignore  The fundamentals remain poor and the economic outlook remains weak  Given the lack of policy tools available to the authorities  we believe India is in for a period of subpar growth and rising downgrade risks  For USD INR  support seen near 57 00 and then 56 00  resistance seen near 58 00 and then 59 00 ,2013-06-18,Marc

106230,327745,A,Muni ETFs  Dividend ETFs For When The Fed Smoke Clears,opinion,In a   Jon Hilsenrath posed several hypothetical questions concerning the Federal Reserve as well as the U S economy  As I read the piece  I found myself answering each query aloud  Later  I decided to chronicle some of the those thoughts in digital ink  Hilsenrath asked   Might the prospect of withdrawing stimulus undermine the recovery the Fed has been struggling for years to engineer   This question assumes that there has been a recovery to undermine  Granted  it is true that the Federal Reserve s policy of manipulating interest rates has allowed individuals and companies to benefit from borrowing cheaply  Yet economic growth has been anemic outside of rate sensitive areas such as real estate  auto and debt restructuring  It follows that the possibility of the Fed slowing down its program of purchasing government quasi government bonds has been enough to send interest rates skyward  In essence  the prospect of withdrawing stimulus is already undermining economic expansion because that stimulus is why we have any economic improvement to date  The author also wonders   Are the economy and the markets healthy enough to stand on their own   Not if consumers find themselves priced out of homes and or vehicles  And if companies as well as municipalities need to pay more to service their debt  there won t be as much money for new hires  In truth  corporations aren t particularly keen on hiring anyway  going forward  central bank policy is far too murky  As for the markets ability to deal with less stimulus  risk takers began abandoning ship the moment Mr  Bernanke discussed  tapering  on May 22  The iShares DJ Real Estate Fund  IYR  was particularly hard hit  as were nearly every type of real estate investment trust asset  In fact  rate sensitive assets from high yield bonds to preferred stocks to munis to utilities have endured a great deal of pain in a very brief period At this point  even broad market index funds like the SPDR Dow Jones Industrials  DIA  has failed to maintain support above a near term  50 day moving average  While that may not seem like a big deal in the context of the year to date gains  it is a humongous deal for those who wish to keep unrealized profits  Volatility is likely to remain elevated until Bernanke decides to remove  if then  from Fed policy altogether   If the economy improves  then we will taper  and  If the economy does not improve  then we will keep buying bonds in the same amount at the same pace  have added uncertainty  not clarity While nobody can predict the future  we can anticipate the following   a  China s dual dilemma  i e   manufacturing slowdown  bad loans in banking  will drag on the revenue of global corporations   b  multinational companies will provide little evidence of earnings or revenue growth for the 2nd quarter  and  c  few investors will celebrate reasonable stock valuations until the Fed acknowledges that it is stuck with its previous commitment of  85 billion per month for an extended period of time  I don t view my outlook or expectations as bearish  on the contrary  I believe in the value of health restoring corrections  where volatile price movement and anxiety provoking moments provide opportunity  Let s put it this way  you re going to get a chance to buy lower  Not everyone s going to jump at the opportunity to buy dips  Similarly  not every dip is a buying opportunity  An exchange traded fund enthusiast will need to choose his her spots wisely  Equally important  he she will need to select from a  personal wish list  of ETF possibilities  For taxable accounts  Muni ETFs may be a surprising place to find value  The iShares National AMT Free Muni  MUB  is trading at a 3  discount to its underlying net asset value  Eventually  the discount premium will return to parity  better yet  if you believe that the 10 year yield is likely to be lower than 2 55  by year s end  MUB will provide desirable tax free income through year s end  As for stock ETFs  my song remains the same  I prefer defensive equities with less rate sensitivity  High atop that personal wish list are funds like   1  iShares High Dividend Equity  HDV    2  Market Vectors Retail  RTH  and  3  iShares DJ Health Provider  IHF   and  4  PowerShares Dividend Achievers  PEY

106231,327746,A,Current Trends In The US Economy  Expecting The Boom,opinion,Summary  Last week we gave a high level look at the US economy  Here is the fourth in a series in which we drill down to see the trends playing out today  attempting to foresee what lies ahead  We see big hopes  as yet unfulfilled  The next post examines the strong aspects of the US economy ContentsExpecting the boom Asset Prices are rising Economic trendsOther posts in this seriesFor More Information 1  Expecting the boom  GDP has grown at a bit over 2  for the past 3 years  stall speed below which the economy risks falling into recession   and  see faster growth ahead  accellerating through 2016  As does Wall Street  per the   10 May 2013  shown below   Hence the recent rise in interest rates  as investors can taste the coming boom and act now  That s the pattern of this cycle  Economists believe that monetary stimulus must work  so they expect the recovery to arrive soon  In 2011  No  in 2012  No  in 2013  As seen in the Fed survey forecasts of 2013GDP in Q1 2010  3 1 in Q1 2011  3 0 in Q1 2012  2 7 in Q2 2013  2 0 actual  probably something less than expected  Q1 was 1 77   est for Q2 is 1 8   2  Asset Prices are rising  Prices of real estate and equities are booming  This has almost no effect on the US economy  The top 10  own almost everything  and their propensity to spend changes only little with more wealth  There have been brief periods when the masses benefited from asset booms  such as the tech and housing bubbles  Those were dreams  The Fed would have to continue QE3 for a long time before they boost asset prices to the point where many Americans trade up to larger homes  borrow against their home equity  or speculate on the stock market  Why the focus on these prices  Reading the news media  one might believe these were the absolutely critical economic variables  That s because those industries are the source of information about the economy  Real estate brokers tells us that existing home sales   the source of their commissions   substantially affect the broad economy  which is obviously daft  Wall Street tells us that stock prices affect the economy through the  wealth effect   despite the little evidence and less logic for this theory   3  Economic Trends The data is not difficult to interpret  But it tells us only about the present  not the future  Note that these graphs show different measures  some are totals  some are rates of change   chosen to best highlight each trend  They give different perspectives on our large  complex  ever changing economy   a  Employment  YoY   change in the BLS Establishment Survey  NSA Slow but steady growth since late 2011  The raet of growth peaked in January 2012 at just under 2   and since then has slowly decelerated  i e   slowing rate of growth    despite frequent predictions since 2009 that job growth will zoom very soon  b  Purchasing managers have their fingers on the pulse of the US economy What do they say  We turn to the monthly survey by the Institute of Supply Management  ISM   Here is   below 50 is contraction    The PMI  registered 49   a decrease of 1 7 percentage points from April s reading of 50 7   indicating contraction in manufacturing for the first time since November 2012 and only the second time since July 2009  This month s PMI  reading is at its lowest level since June 2009  when it registered 45 8   The New Orders Index decreased in May by 3 5 percentage points to 48 8   and the Production Index decreased by 4 9 percentage points to 48 6   Let s look at the trend  It peaked in February 2011  and has slowed since then  A narrower but stronger leading indicator is the Purchasing Mangers  Index of New Orders  It has a roughly similar trend as the broad PMI  c  Business borrowing  a driver of growth Total outstanding Commercial Paper  asset backed CP plus CP of non financial companies   NSA  This peaked in July 2010 Total business loans outstand from commercial banks  NSA This peaked in Q3 of 2011  fell  and has recovered   d  Exports of good and services Contrary to what you re often told  US exports have been growing as a share of GDP  i e   growing faster than GDP  since WWII But since Q2 of 2010 the YoY rate of export growth is slowing  as the US dollar rises and the world economy slows  4  Other posts in this series Better days are

106255,327770,A,North Korea And Event Driven Markets,opinion,World events are getting more complicated  U S  markets are ignoring these issues as central bank zero interest rate policies continue to drive asset prices higher When things are event driven  an investor has two options Stand aside  Today that means cash earning zero while inflation erodes value An investor can remain nervously invested and attempt to move nimbly  Other options are really allocation combinations of these first two This Year s AnticsThe list includes  Washington s political antics  China s growth vs  real estate bubble policy  Japan s central bank s highly stimulative regime change  Italy s government election mess  Eurozone recession risk  the Bank of England governing body s recomposition  Egypt s civil instability  Syria  Iran nukes  the dispute between China and Japan over islands and what lies beneath them or in the territorial waters around them  Nigeria s instability  and post Chavez Venezuela  Lastly in this partial list  and newly on the front page  is North Korea Let s Get To North KoreaThe situation seems to be intensifying  The young Kim has set a course that is more harsh and militaristic than expected  When armistice agreements are revoked and readiness states of armies ratchet up  the risk rises of an accident leading to war We have obtained permission to post a March 7  2013 commentary about North Korea on our website  NightWatch is following these events closely  You can find their discussion Two key points must be noted In the NightWatch experience  the last time North Korean media and behavior were so bellicose was prior to the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul  That s the historical reference North Korea failed to act in the late 1980s  At that time the U S  had an aircraft carrier group and a battleship group deployed off the North Korean coast  Contrast then with now  as we find ourselves dealing with sequester induced defense cuts and withdrawal from wars of questionable value  Does North Korea perceive that the U S  is vulnerable  Add the Korea Iran scientific cooperation pact  Wall St  Journal  March 8  and you have missile and nuclear collaboration between two dangerous parties  We think the risk on the Korean Peninsula in 2013 is much higher than it was in the 1980s Is the recent behavior of North Korea mere bluster and nothing more  If yes  global monetary policy will prevail and markets will head higher  If no    and shooting breaks out    markets are in for a jolt The G4 LinkEssentially  80  to 85  of the capital markets of the world are now involved with or linked to one of the G4 currencies  The policy among all the managers of those currencies is to be stimulative  expansive as to central bank activities  and focused on a short term interest rate near zero  This is a truly global phenomenon We have long maintained that when the use of money has no cost  a zero interest rate   asset prices have an upward bias  We see that now in stock markets around the world  in the recovery of real estate  and in other asset classes as well  The dilemma that confronts an investor is whether to  a  wait for a pullback and enter the market   b  sit on the sidelines and possibly miss a very large upward move in asset prices  or  c  commit at new  high levels  with trepidation Last week  we covered 10 000 miles visiting clients  consultants  and referring professionals in several U S  locations  It was quite a week  At each stop  we found investors and their agents trying to determine what action to take  Rarely did we see them fully invested  Many suggested that a correction would create an entry opportunity and they would be buyers in such circumstances  Many are bewildered at the intensity of the rise in stock markets in the U S  and elsewhere  Many do not know what to do Reading The Central BanksThe global central bank policy of a zero interest rate has created a platform unlike anything seen in the modern era  Investors have to determine whether they can accept central bank policies that are likely to be in place for a considerable additional period of time  The longer investors wait  the harder it will be for them to make a move into markets  Meanwhile  the pressures will mount for central banks to alter policy and change direction  They  too  are not sure what to do  but as central bankers they can hardly say so On the stock market side  Cumberland remains fully invested in a selection of exchange traded funds  ETFs   We are deployed into sectors  industries  and broad based ETFs in ways that will let us capture the upward bias of these markets  FOR TODAY we are fully invested  We will again emphasize the words for today  In an event driven world   for today  must be part of the conversation Depends On The Exit StrategyAs long as this existing central bank policy continues to unfold  markets will have an upward bias  However  if central banks act in any way to create a disorderly exit strategy  Cumberland fears there will then be a shock  The idea now is to patiently experience the present upward bias in assets worldwide  Do so nervously and with uncertainty  And thoughtfully start to rebalance early and be ahead of what may be a big shock in the future At Cumberland  we remain fully invested on the stock market side and are gradually hedging duration or using barbells on the bond side  with emphasis on spread product rather than U S  Treasuries  The stock side can change any day or may not change for months  Zero interest rates are ubiquitous worldwide and very bullish for all asset prices  including global stock markets The bond strategic change process takes months  We believe we have months to work with  since the Federal Reserve has committed itself repeatedly to a prolonged period of very low interest rates  Also  increasing geopolitical risks result in the driving of global money flows into the U S  dollar  and that helps the Fed keep the Treasury yield curve at low interest rates for all maturities We leave on Sunday for Paris and then on to Dubai  All meetings in Paris are private  In Dubai  besides private discussions  we will take part in one public forum  and we are excited about it  GIC has teamed with Wharton for a conference  See  for the full schedule  Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher is scheduled to keynote  My friend John Silvia and I are the discussants  My slides will be on the Cumberland website after my return We fly back to New York from Dubai on March 27 and are scheduled to

106258,327773,A,Telling Stories About TIPS,opinion,It always bugs me a bit when a market event that happens for one cause is attributed to another cause merely to advance an easy narrative  The awful 5y TIPS auction Thursday and subsequent flush of TIPS breakevens is being attributed to a  fading of inflation concerns   There may be some fading of inflation concerns  although as I demonstrated in my last article expectations for core inflation haven t been fading  But the main reasons the auction failed were far simpler  Prime among these is that the 5 year TIPS have always had more problems being sold  because people who want inflation protection tend to primarily want long inflation protection  In the last couple of years  I ve had discussions with many institutional investors who expressed interest when I discussed a 50 year inflation linked bond  But the 5y TIPS are mainly of interest to  a  indexers and  b  foreign central banks  As such  they are prone to occasional disasters when the central banks don t show up  dealer risk taking appetite is low  and market momentum is such that dealers don t feel like warehousing the auction risk until the indexes are rebalanced at month end and the indexers come for the paper  This isn t to say that I expected this to be a bad auction  because the last few auctions of all kinds have been pretty normal  that is  more like normal Treasury auctions than like TIPS auctions of old   But it s not surprising to me that it happened  And it has nothing to do with inflation fears fading  except that some buyers perhaps figured they could buy at better levels later because of the market narrative about inflation fears fading  And Friday  we saw a big bounce back in breakevens  What does that do to the narrative  Disclosure  As an aside  our Fisher model identified TIPS as exceptionally cheap compared with nominal bonds after the auction and went fully long breakevens on the close ,2013-04-21,Michael Ashton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/telling-stories-about-tips-163730,163730

106262,327777,A,Post Employment Report  Not Too Shocking,opinion,upward surprise   upward revision in  Payrolls   not too shocking  as I pointed out in last article  Weak hours though Here is part of what s happening in  payrolls  more jobs  fewer hours   employers cutting back hours to avoid Obamacare coverageQuestion is  which is better for confidence  More jobs  lower earnings   wages  or fewer  but better  jobs  Probably the former average weekly hours have stagnated since 2011  even as Unemployment has fallen Today s Employment report was pretty straightforward  an upward surprise to payrolls and upward revisions  a decline in the Unemployment Rate  and declines in hours worked  The upward revisions to Payrolls is not really a surprise  although seeing the Unemployment Rate continue to decline when Consumer Confidence  Jobs Hard to Get  is increasing is unusual   Two years ago  the  Average Hours Worked  was 34 4 hours and the Unemployment Rate was 9 0   Today  average hours worked is still 34 4 hours and the Unemployment Rate is 7 5    What I said about Obamacare coverage should be expanded a bit  There have been anecdotal reports that many employers are cutting back hours for some employees  because they are required to offer health insurance  at steep premium increases  to part time employees working at least 30 hours per week  The incentives are large  especially for employers who are near the 50 employee cutoff  to cut back employee hours  The way this would show up in the data  if the behavior was widespread  would be  a  a decline in average hours  as more people work shorter shifts  and  b  potentially  but not automatically  an increase in the number employed  since an employer who cuts 100 hours of work from existing employees is now 10 hours short of the labor input needed  I suspect this is only partly the case   if you cut 100 hours  maybe you add three 25 hour part timers  it still costs money to hire  after all    but it may help explain why the payrolls number keeps rising and the jobless number keeps falling although the average hours worked is pretty stagnant   It would also help resolve the conundrum between the  Jobs Hard to Get  survey result and the Unemployment Rate  although it is a small divergence at present  If respondents are answering the survey as if the question is whether good or full time jobs are hard to get  it may well be the case that those jobs are getting more difficult to find while there are more part time positions being offered   This is mere speculation  and storytelling  but I think it s plausible that this is happening and may be affecting the data ,2013-05-04,Michael Ashton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/post-employment-report:-not-too-shocking-165595,165595

106264,327779,A,What Would It Take To Get To A Steady State Economy ,opinion,Humans live in equilibrium with other species in a finite world  In such a world  there is never really a Steady State  Instead  there is a constant ebb and flow  One species may be dominant in an area for a while  and then another  If populations are closely matched in  ability   then the ups and downs aren t too severe  If a predator depends on a particular type of prey for its dinner  it can t eat all of the prey  or it will go hungry When the populations of various species are graphed  they rise and fall  We usually think of a close match  such as depicted in this graph Figure 2  Volterra Lotka equations used to illustrate situation where population of predators and prey do not vary over too wide a range  Source  Wikipedia In fact  the variability of the many species over time tends to be greater than this  as illustrated by the following model that started with 80 baboons and 40 cheetahs Figure 3  Lotka Volterra equations used to illustrate situation that begins with 80 baboons and 40 cheetahs  Source   If species evolve together  a natural balance tends to remain in place  If a species suddenly finds a new  better source of nourishment  really  energy supplies  since food supplies energy   its population may increase greatly  For example  yeast may metabolize the sugar in grape juice  converting it to alcohol  The yeast population temporarily rises and then declines  as the food source disappears and  the yeast  Or bacteria may multiply inside the human body  and the body s systems for fighting them off are not sufficiently activated  An example is sometimes given of reindeer introduced to St  Matthews Island near Alaska  where there was considerable lichen on the rock  The reindeer ate the lichen at a speed faster than the lichen could reproduce  Soon the lichen was gone  and the reindeer population crashed  Figure 4  Assumed population of St  Matthew Reindeer herd  with actual counts given  Based on  of University of Alaska  The reindeer example is similar to a very severe predator prey curve  The reindeer ate a renewable resource faster than it could reproduce  There were a few other food sources a reindeer could eat  so a few reindeer remained  but there was a very sharp drop in the number of reindeer  The population of humans has ramped up greatly in recent times   Figure 5  World population based on data from  Atlas of World History   McEvedy and Jones  Penguin Reference Books  1978 and Wikipedia World Population  The most recent growth coincides with the addition of fossil fuels to the energy supplies used by humans  starting about 1800  If we look back  we see though that human population has been ramping up for a very long period  Humans discovered how to   Since 75 000 BCE  there has been fairly consistent population growth  if we look at the data on a log log graph  Figure 6  Log log graph of human population growth  with energy sources giving rise to this growth  The initial growth of human population occurred with the discovery of how to burn biomass  and how to use it for such purposes as cooking  keeping warm  honing stone tools to a sharper edge  and scaring predator animals away  All of these uses allowed ancestors of modern man to spread over a wider area of the globe  while at the same time wiping out many species of animals    Biologist and paleontologist  says that Phase One of the  began when the first modern humans began to disperse to different parts of the world about 100 000 years ago  Phase Two began about 10 000 years ago when humans turned to agriculture  Even at these early stages  energy use by humans allowed human population to grow at the expense of the population of predator species  There was a lull in human world population growth between 1 CE and 800 CE  Figure 6   In this period  there were many local collapses  so growth in one area tended to offset collapse in another area  When these collapses happened  they generally looked financial in nature  according to the research of Peter Turchin and Surgey Nefedov in  Populations had found a new resource that allowed them to have more food supply say cleared land of trees or learned to do irrigation  But over time  population grew  and caught up with available resources  At the same time  the resources started degrading  The soil started eroding  or became less fertile  and or salt built up from irrigation  Wages of the common worker dropped  and it was hard to get adequate nourishment  Epidemics became common  The general shape of these collapses was approximately as follows  Figure 7  Shape of typical Secular Cycle  based on work of Peter Turkin and Sergey Nefedov  So even in the Year 1 CE to Year 800 CE period  there was not a Steady State  Instead  there was a combination of overshoot an collapse type waves of the types seen with other species in different parts of the globe  which together averaged out to relatively flat world population growth   He concluded that the per capita GDP was was slightly lower at the end of the period  453  than at the beginning of the period  476   He doesn t give amounts at the Year 800  But assuming that the change was fairly representative  the period 1CE to 800CE or 1 CE to 1000CE was close to a Steady State economy  with lots of collapses   considering the lack of both population growth and GDP growth per capita  In more recent times  humans were able to add more energy sources  including   windmills  and water mills   The also developed better ocean going ships that allowed them to make colonies  and spread agriculture further  and demand that these colonies extract resources to support the home country  Also  with a more globalized world  agriculture could be improved by allowing a wider choice of domesticated plants and animals  by introducing species from other parts of the world  Since 1800  the growth in fossil fuels has helped ramp up both population and standards of living   Figure 8  Per capita world energy consumption  calculated by dividing world energy consumption  based on Vaclav Smil estimates from  together with BP Statistical Data for 1965 and subsequent  by population estimates  based on   What Are Human s Options for Living in a Steady State Economy  I am not sure there are many good choices  1  If we went back to the period before the ancestors of humans discovered fire  about 100 000 to 200 000 of us could live in the warm areas of the world  eating raw food  and living much as chimpanzees and baboons do today  based on populations of those primates today  The population of humans under such a scenario would fluctuate upward and downward  perhaps as in Figure 1  At this point the internal organs of human have adapted to eating a diet that includes many cooked foods  so it is not clear that our teeth and internal organs could handle such a diet  unless we happened to live in a part of the world where a soft diet  berries  fish and worms  was available  It would also need to be warm  so our lack of fur would not be a problem  To meet these criteria  the population might need to be even lower  2  Having no humans at all is by definition a Steady State  I am doubtful that most people would consider this an acceptable Steady State  however  3  If we did not have globalization  and stopped adding energy supplies  we might continue to have local collapses  as in the 1CE to 800CE or 1000CE period  and sort of approximate a Steady State  Of course  now with globalization  a problem in one part of the world quickly spreads to other parts of the world  4  If we want 7 billion people to be able to continue to live  we will need some basic level of energy supplies for these 7 billion people  If we assume that as a minimum  people today will need at least the 1820 level of energy consumption  based on Figure 8   we will need total energy consumption of at least 22 gigajoules per capita  This would amount to about 7  of the current energy consumption of the United States  It would not be enough to perform what we now consider basic functions such as maintaining roads  electrical systems  water systems  and sewer systems  so would be a major step down for US residents  At the 1820 level of energy consumption  we would still need to continue a portion of fossil fuel consumption  since there are now so many of us that biofuels no longer suffice  Figure 8 read across at 1820 level   Also  renewables  including today s modern hydroelectric and solar panels are made and transported with fossil fuels  so in order to have what we now consider renewables  we would need to continue to have some fossil fuel use  Also  electricity from wind and solar PV needs to be backed up with natural gas electricity generation  In addition to needing energy to maintain a population of 7 billion people  we would also need a way to  a  keep population down  and  b  keep people from using available energy supplies  beyond the 22 gigajoules per capita allotted   to improve their lifestyles  The way we often hear proposed for keeping population down is  and availability of birth control measures  Unfortunately  this approach is energy dependent  Unless considerable external energy is available  women will have to work in the fields to produce food  This will give them little time for education or the jobs that education would provide  There are a some cultures that have been able to keep population down by less energy dependent means  For example  China uses strict controls from above  Cultural and religious practices may also be used  such as delayed marriage and long breastfeeding  In some cases  abortion or infanticide may be used  Keeping people from using available energy supplies to improve their lifestyles is even trickier  Some central authority can dictate that the US will use only 7  of the energy the population used in the past  meaning that everyone has to give up nearly everything  But enforcing this will be a real trick  unless energy supplies really are constrained  There seems to be a common belief that cutting down on personal transportation fuel would have a big impact on total energy consumption  In the US  gasoline amounts to about 44  of US oil consumption  If we eliminated all gasoline consumption  even that by police  ambulances  and sales people   it would only reduce US energy consumption  all types  not just oil  by 16   On a worldwide basis  much less oil is used for personal transportation  so eliminating all oil for personal transportation would likely reduce world energy consumption by something like 10  to 12   Is There a Reason for Aiming for a Steady State Economy   At this point  we seem to be headed for collapse  because humans  growth is so far out of line in relationship to that of other species  In addition  we are many other limits  including the cost of oil extraction  availability of fresh water  and amount of pollution  including CO2 pollution   Also  governments are increasingly poor financial condition  because when there are not enough resources to go around  governments tend to  come up short   They can t collect enough taxes relative to the benefits they pay out and all of the government programs they administer  The only way a Steady State would make sense would be if there were some level of Steady State that humans could fall back to  instead of collapse  Unfortunately  it is hard to see a good place to fall back to  The only period where human population was relatively constant was in the period 1 CE to 800 CE  when frequent collapses kept populations down  It is difficult to see any point at which humans have not increased population  or increased resource use  if resources were available  except when frequent civilization collapse overwhelmed the system  If our civilization does collapse to a lower level  but not all the way back to 0  it seems likely that humans will again repeat the pattern they have experienced  over and over  They will again grow population and resource use  if resources are available  This pattern seems to be an instinct for all species  which is why it is virtually impossible to eliminate  Humans will then again collapse back  to a more sustainable level ,2013-05-16,Gail

106293,327808,A,Our Oil Investment Sinkhole Problem,opinion,We are used to expecting that more investment will yield more output  but in the real world  things don t always work out that way Figure 1  Comparison of 2005 to 2011 percent change in real GDP vs percent change in oil consumption  both on a per capita basis   GDP per capita on a PPP basis from World bank  oil consumption from BP s 2012 Statistical Review of World Energy  In Figure 1  we see that for several groupings  the increase  or decrease  in oil consumption tends to correlate with the increase  or decrease  in GDP  The usual pattern is that GDP growth is a little greater than oil consumption growth  This happens because of changes of various sorts   a  Increasing substitution of other energy sources for oil   b  Increased efficiency in using oil  and  c  A changing GDP mix away from producing goods  and toward producing services  leading to a proportionately lower need for oil and other energy products The situation is strikingly different for Saudi Arabia  however  A huge increase in oil consumption  Figure 1   and in fact in total energy consumption  Figure 2  below   does not seem to result in a corresponding rise in GDP  Figure 2  Total primary energy consumed per capita  based on BP s 2012 Statistical Review of World Energy data and population data from EIA At least part of problem is that Saudi Arabia is reaching limits of various types  One of them is inadequate water for a rising population  Adding desalination plants adds huge costs and huge energy usage  but does not increase the standard of living of citizens  Instead  adding desalination plants simply allows the country to pump less water from its depleting aquifers To some extent  the same situation occurs in oil and gas fields  Expensive investment is required  but it is doubtful that there is an increase in capacity that is proportional to its cost  To a significant extent  new investment simply offsets a decline in production elsewhere  so maintains the status quo  It is expensive  but adds little to what gets measured as GDP The world outside of Saudi Arabia is now running into an investment sinkhole issue as well  This takes several forms  water limits that require deeper wells or desalination plants  oil and gas limits that require more expensive forms of extraction  and pollution limits requiring expensive adjustments to automobiles or to power plants These higher investment costs lead to higher end product costs of goods using these products  These higher costs eventually transfer to other products that most of us consider essential  food because it uses much oil in growing and transport  electricity because it is associated with pollution controls  and metals for basic manufacturing  because they also use oil in extraction and transport Ultimately  these investment sinkholes seem likely to cause huge problems  In some sense  they mean the economy is becoming less efficient  rather than more efficient  From an investment point of view  they can expect to crowd out other types of investment  From a consumer s point of view  they lead to a rising cost of essential products that can be expected to squeeze out other purchases  Why Investment Sinkholes Go UnrecognizedFrom the point of view of an individual investor  all that matters is whether he will get an adequate return on the investment he makes  If a city government decides to install a desalination plan  the investor s primary concern is that someone  the government  or those buying water  will pay enough money that he can make an adequate return on his investment over time  Citizens clearly need water  The only question is whether citizens can afford the desalinated water from their discretionary income  Obviously  if citizens spend more on desalinated water  the amount of discretionary income available for other goods will be reduced The same issue arises with pollution control equipment installed by a utility  or by an auto maker  The need for pollution control equipment arises because of limits we are reaching too many people in too small a space  and too many waste products for the environment to handle The utility or auto makers adds what is mandated  since clearly  buyers of electricity or of an automobile will recognize the need for clean air  and will be willing to use some of their discretionary income for pollution control equipment  Mandated renewable energy requirements are another way that governments attempt to compensate for limits we are reaching  These  too  tend to impose higher costs  and indirectly reduce consumers  discretionary income All types of mineral extraction  but particularly oil  eventually reach the situation where it takes an increasing amount of investment  money  energy products  and often water  to extract a given amount of resource  This situation arises because companies extract the cheapest to extract resources first  and move on to the more expensive to extract resources later  As consumers  we recognize the situation through rising commodity prices  There is generally a real issue behind the rising prices not enough resource available in readily accessible locations  so we need to dig deeper  or apply more  high tech  solutions  These high tech solutions indirectly require more investment and more energy  as well While we don t stop to think about what is happening  the reality is that increasingly less oil  or other product  natural gas  coal  gold  or copper  is being produced  for the same investment dollar  As long as the price of the product keeps rising sufficiently to cover the higher cost of extraction  the investor is happy  even if the cost of the resource is becoming unbearably high for consumers The catch with energy products is that consumers really need the products extracted the oil to grow the food they eat and for commuting  for example  We also know that in general  energy of some sort is required to manufacture every kind of product that is made  and is needed to enable nearly every kind of service  Oil is the most portable of the world s energy sources  and because of this  is used in powering most types of vehicles and much portable equipment  It is also used as a raw material in many products  As a result  limits on oil supply are likely to have an adverse impact on the economy as a whole  and on economic growth  The Oil and Gas Part of the ProblemA major issue today is that oil supply is already constrained it is not rising very quickly on a world basis  no matter how much investment is made  Figure 3   Figure 3  World oil supply with exponential trend lines fitted by author  Oil consumption data from BP 2012 Statistical Review of World Energy  As noted above  the easy to extract oil and gas was extracted first  New development is increasingly occurring in expensive to extract locations  such as deep water  Canadian oil sands  arctic oil  and  tight oil  that requires fracking to extract  This oil requires more energy to produce  and more inputs of other sorts  such as water for fracking  Because of rising costs  the price of oil has tripled in the last 10 years  Because of rising extraction costs  investment costs continue to soar  Worldwide  oil and gas exploration and production spending increased by 19  in 2011 and 11  in 2012    Such spending produced only a modest increase in output about 0 1  increase in crude oil production in 2011  and 2 2  increase in the first 10 months of 2012  based on EIA data  Natural gas production increased by 3 1  in 2011  according to BP  Estimates for 2012 are not yet available  If we want to  grow  oil and gas production at all  businesses will need to keep investing increasing amounts of money  and energy  into oil and gas extraction  For this to happen  prices paid by consumers for oil and gas will need to continue to rise  In the US  there is a particular problem  because the selling price of natural gas is now far below what it costs shale gas producers to produce it a price  of Douglas Westwood  The  is now only  3 38  The question now is whether oil and gas investment will keep rising fast enough to keep production rising   in worldwide oil and gas investment in 2013  According to the forecast  virtually none of the investment growth will come from North America  apparently because oil and gas prices are not currently high enough to justify the high priced projects needed  The flat investment forecast by Barklays suggests a major disconnect between what the  that North America is on its way to becoming an energy exporter and the actual actions of oil and gas companies based on current price levels  Of course  if oil and gas prices would go higher  more investment might be made a point I made when   What will the ultimate impact be on the economy  I would argue that for most of the developed  OECD  countries  the ultimate impact will be a long term contraction of the economy  similar to that illustrated in Scenario 2 of Figure 4  What happens is that as we increasingly reach limits  more and more investment capital  and physical use of oil  is allocated toward the investment sinkholes  This has a double effect   1  The prices paid for resources that are subject in investment sinkholes need to continue to rise  in order to continue to attract enough investment capital  This is true both for goods that directly come from investment sinkholes  oil  gas and water  and from products that have a less direct connection  but depend on rising cost inputs  such as food and electricity    2  Products outside of essential goods and services will increasingly be starved of investment capital and physical resources  This happens partly because of the greater needs in the sinkhole areas  Also  as consumers pay increasing amounts for essential goods and service because of  1   they cut back on the purchase of discretionary items  reducing demand for non essentials  In some real sense  because of the sinkhole investment phenomenon  we are getting less and less back for every dollar invested  and every barrel of oil invested   This phenomenon as applied to energy resources is sometimes referred to as declining   As discussed above  world oil supply in recent years is quite close to flat  Figure 3   The flat supply of oil is further reduced by the additional oil investment required by sinkhole projects  such as the ones Saudi Arabia is undertaking  Also  there is a tendency for the developing world to attract a disproportionate share of the oil supply that is available  because they can leverage its use to a greater extent  Both of these phenomena lead to shrinking oil supply of oil for OECD countries  This combination shrinking OECD oil supply  together with the need for oil for many functions necessary for economic growth  leads to a tendency for the economies of OECD nations to shrink  It is hard to see an end to this shrinkage  because there really is no end to the limits we are reaching  No one has invented a substitute for water  or for unpolluted air  People talk about inventing a substitute for oil  but biofuels and intermittent electricity are very poor substitutes  Often substitutes have even higher costs  adding to the investment sinkhole problem  rather than solving it Where we are nowWhen resource prices rise  the impact is felt almost immediately  Salaries don t rise at the same time oil prices rise  so consumers have to cut back on some purchases of discretionary goods and services  The initial impact is layoffs in discretionary sectors of the economy  Within a few years  however  the layoff problems are transformed into central government debt problems  This happens because governments need to pay benefits to laid off workers at the same time they are collecting less in taxes The most recent time we experienced the full impact of rising commodity prices was in 2008 2009  but we are not yet over these problems  The US government now has a severe debt problem  As the government attempts to extricate itself from the high level of debt it has gotten itself into  citizens are again likely to see their budgets squeezed because of higher taxes  lay offs of government workers  and reduced government benefits  As a result  consumers will have less to spend on discretionary goods and service  Layoffs will occur in discretionary sectors of the economy  eventually leading to more recession Over time  we can expect the investment sinkhole problem to get worse  In time  the impact is likely to look like long term contraction  as illustrated in Scenario 2 of Figure 4 Is there an End to the Contraction It is hard to see a favorable outcome to the continued contraction  Our current financial system depends on long term growth  The impact on it is likely to be huge stress on the financial system and a large number of debt defaults  It is even possible we will see a collapse of the financial system  or of some governments In a way  what we are talking about is the Limits to Growth problem modeled in the 1972 book by that name  It is the fact that we

106294,327809,A,Explaining The WTI Brent Spread Divergence ,opinion,Something totally bizarre has happened in the last three years  Oil in America has become much  much cheaper than oil in Europe  Oil in America is now almost  30 cheaper than oil in Europe This graph is the elephant in the room And this graph shows how truly historic a move this has been  Why  The ostensible reason for this is oversupply in America  That s right   American oil companies have supposedly been producing much  much more than they can sell  This is hilarious if prices weren t so damn high  but despite a robust export market for finished products  crude oil is backing up all the way to Cushing  Oklahoma  and is only going to get worse in 2013  Now that Enterprise Products Partners LLP has let the cat out of the bag that less than a month after expanding the Seaway pipeline capacity to 400 000 barrels per day  The Jones Creek terminal has storage capacity of 2 6 million barrels  and it is basically maxed out in available storage  But there s something fishy about this explanation  I don t know for sure about the underlying causality   and it is not impossible that the oil companies are acting incompetently   but are we really supposed to believe that today s oil conglomerates in America are so bad at managing their supply chain that they will oversupply the market to such an extent that oil sells at a 25  discount on the price in Europe  Even at an expanded capacity  is it really so hard for oil producers to shut down the pipeline  and clear inventories until the price rises so that they are at least not haemorrhaging such a huge chunk of potential profit on every barrel of oil they are selling  I mean  that s what corporations do  or at least  what they re supposed to do    they manage the supply chain to maximise profit  To me  this huge disparity seems like funny business  What could possibly be making US oil producers behave so ridiculously  massively non competitively  The answer could be government intervention  Let s not forget that the  gives the President and the Department of Homeland Security the authority to   c  be prepared  in the event of a potential threat to the security of the United States  to take actions necessary to ensure the availability of adequate resources and production capability  including services and critical technology  for national defense requirements     d  improve the efficiency and responsiveness of the domestic industrial base to support national defense requirements  and  e  foster cooperation between the defense and commercial sectors for research and development and for acquisition of materials  services  components  and equipment to enhance industrial base efficiency and responsiveness  And the ability to   e  The Secretary of each resource department  when necessary  shall make the finding required under section 101 b  of the Act  50 U S C  App  2071 b   This finding shall be submitted for the President s approval through the Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism  Upon such approval  the Secretary of the resource department that made the finding may use the authority of section 101 a  of the Act  50 U S C  App  2071 a   to control the general distribution of any material  including applicable services  in the civilian market  My intuition is that it is possible that oil companies may have been advised  or ordered  under the NDRP  or under the   to keep some slack in the supply chain in case of a war  or other national or global emergency  This would provide a capacity buffer in addition to the  If that s the case  the question we need to ask is what does the US government know that other governments don t  Is this just a prudent measure to reduce the danger of a resource or energy shock  or does the US government have some specific information of a specific threat  The other possible explanation  of course  is ridiculous incompetence on the part of US oil producers  Which  I suppose  is almost believable in the wake of Deepwater Horizon ,2013-02-13,John Aziz,https://www.investing.com/analysis/explaining-the-wti-brent-spread-divergence-155091,155091
106295,327810,A,What I ll Be Watching In 2013,opinion,I ll be watching a number of things in 2013 in order to get a better sense of what the future will bring  On January 22 Princeton University Press published my book  The Great Rebalancing  Trade  Conflict  and the Perilous Road Ahead  and in the last chapter of the book I argue that the great trade  capital flow and debt imbalances the were built up over the preceding two decades must reverse themselves  Imbalances can continue for many years  I argue  but at some point they become unsustainable and the world must adjust by reversing those imbalances  One way or the other  in other words  the world will rebalance  But there are worse ways and better ways it can do so  Large trade surpluses can decline  for example  because exports fall  or they can decline because imports rise  Large trade deficits can contract under conditions of high unemployment  but they can also contract under conditions of low unemployment  Low savings rates can rise with declining household income or with rising household income  Repressed consumption rates can reverse through collapsing growth or through surging consumption  Excessive debt can be resolved by default or by growth  Any policy that does not clearly result in a reversal of the deep debt  trade and capital imbalances of the past decade is a policy that cannot be sustained  The goal of policymakers must be to work out what rebalancing requires and then to design and implement the least painful way of getting there  International cooperation  of course  will reduce the pain  For this reason I have no doubt that over the next few years we will see the imbalances I have identified over the years in this newsletter reverse themselves  but whether they reverse in more orderly or less orderly ways will depend on policy decisions  It is likely to be political considerations that determine how quickly the rebalancing processes take place and whether they do so in ways that set the stages for future growth or future stagnation  My guess is that we have ended the first stage of the global crisis  and most of the deepest problems have been identified  In 2013 we will begin to see how policymakers respond and what the future outlook is likely to be  Here is what I will be watching this year in order to figure out where we are likely to end up  1  Watch how quickly growth adjusts  The speed with which China s GDP growth slows in 2013 will tell us a lot about how determined Beijing is to rebalance the economy in such a way that growth is driven more by higher household income and consumption and less by investment funded by rising government and government related debt  It will also tell us how successful Beijing s new leadership will be in consolidating power and forcing the kinds of economic and financial reforms on which most economists now agree  but which are likely to be politically difficult  China is ending the year on what many are interpreting as a strong note  Manufacturing seems to be growing at its fastest pace in a while  Here is the relevant  in an article from the People s Daily    December s HSBC China final manufacturing PMI rose to a 19 month high of 51 5  thanks to stronger new business in take and expansion of production  according to figures released by HSBC Monday  The statistics suggest that China s economy remains on track for recovery as it enters 2013  said the HSBC report  Despite persistent external headwinds  as indicated by still contracting new export orders  the financial organization expects China s GDP to rebound to 8 6 percent in 2013  underpinned by China s continued policy support  An  in Monday s Financial Times puts a little more meat on the bones    China s economy has ended the year on a strong note after a gauge of its manufacturing sector rose to a 19 month high  The HSBC purchasing managers  index for December climbed to 51 5 from 50 5 a month earlier  according to figures published on Monday  In rising further above the midpoint of 50  the reading signalled an accelerated pace of expansion    Although China is still set for sub 8 per cent growth in 2012  its weakest in more than a decade  momentum picked up noticeably in the fourth quarter after the government increased its spending on infrastructure   Such momentum is likely to be sustained in the coming months when infrastructure construction runs  at  full speed and property market conditions stabilise   said Qu Hongbin  HSBC chief economist for China  As most of us expected  the end of the year saw a reversal of the attempts earlier in 2012 to slow investment growth  and as a result GDP growth and manufacturing activity have picked up  but so has debt  Beijing probably needed to do this for good political reasons   I suspect that there are many who would have strongly opposed a very weak ending for the Hu Wen period of government   but the longer they keep this up  the worse the overall adjustment will be  and it will be politics that determines how quickly they can return to a real rebalancing of the economy  I expect GDP growth in the first half to be fairly high  probably close to 8   continuing the investment boom that was recently unleashed  I am not fully confident of this number because there seem to be significant strains in the banking system  and without easy credit growth there cannot be much investment growth  Of course part of any credit tightness will be  resolved  by the tried and true method of vendor financing  which is already becoming a problem for SOE balance sheets  see for example this  on Zoomlion  the construction equipment manufacturer  which has seen its sales rise in 2012 largely in line with their increased financing of customer purchases   but the idea that Chinese SOEs are rushing in where Chinese bankers fear to tread is not much of a comfort for me  As an aside  one of my former students  now an investment banker working on the domestic IPO market  came to visit me today and warned me that there is a huge backlog of companies trying to get approval to sell shares  One of the requirements is that they must have two consecutive years of rising net earnings  Many of these firms expected to come to market in 2012 and were able to manage the needed two years of rising net earnings to 2011  but now that they have been pushed back  at least to 2013  they are struggling to show that net earnings in 2012 also went up  For that reason his firm is especially wary of sneaky attempts to boost reported earnings  There are hundreds of companies waiting for approval  At any rate it is second half GDP growth that interests me more  If Beijing has really gotten its arms around the rebalancing problem and is serious about adjusting quickly  I expect reported growth to drop sharply  perhaps to close to 6   If not  I expect reported growth to remain well above 7  in the second half of 2013  This would worry me    2  Watch how quickly new debt emerges  Debt problems are going to continue to emerge in 2013  but as long as each new manifestation of excessively rising debt is treated as a specific and localized problem that can be resolved with specific polices  overall balance sheets will continue to get worse  We need to watch what Beijing does to rein in the growth in debt  and of course this is closely related to overall GDP growth  As long as GDP is growing at levels above 6  or 7   it is almost a certainty that debt is rising too fast  If GDP growth levels come in much below 6 or 7   there is a chance that debt growth is not excessive  How do we keep track of debt levels  Obviously this is no easy task in China  where both the banks and the informal banking system have done a great job in recent years of hiding loan growth and keeping formal debt levels from looking to risky  But follow the cash  Large increases in infrastructure investment and in real estate development are almost always funded  directly or indirectly  by increases in debt  Many of the banks seem to be facing tight liquidity conditions  so we should also be watching payables and receivables on the SOE balance sheets  We should also be watching off balance sheet activity by the banks    3  Watch for financial scandals  We should also be keeping track of stories about defaults and bank runs  Remember that the Chinese financial system does not really  do  defaults  When borrowers are unable to repay debt out of operating cashflow  the problem is usually  managed  away by forcing losses onto some other entity    South China Morning Post columnist Shirley Yam  who  I am glad to say  recently returned from a one year leave of absence  wrote one of her typically intelligent  earlier this month explaining how a RMB 3 5 billion default by Metallurgical Corporation of China was resolved  It is worth reading to get a sense of how low non performing loan numbers in the Chinese banking system are nonetheless compatible with a surge in bad investments funded by debt  This is why those economists who understand the structure of Chinese growth and who worry about the consequences of rising debt notice even relatively small defaults  When a default actually takes place  it usually means that the relevant principals have exhausted all other means of hiding the debt and were forced into recognizing the losses  For example  on Saturday the South China Morning Post published this     A former employee of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank is alleged to have acted as a loan shark and run illegal businesses to the tune of 6 4 billion yuan  HK 7 9 billion   It is the latest scandal to reflect the severity of the mainland s shadow banking problem and banks  lax management of their branches  Ma Yijiang  formerly deputy head of a branch in Zhengzhou  Henan province  allegedly used the money from cash rich depositors for loan sharking schemes  The bank said in a statement it was assisting the authorities in their investigations    Last month  the failure of a wealth management product  WMP  issued by Huaxia Bank s Jiading branch in Shanghai  which resulted in depositors losing several hundred million yuan  set off alarms in the country s banking sector  and analysts warned similar scandals would surface in the coming months    A Zhengzhou court heard Ma s case earlier this week  The Shanghai bank said he resigned in October 2011  The 21st Century Business Herald  an influential business newspaper  said Ma enticed depositors to hand their money to him by offering lofty interest rates between 2009 and 2011    He lent the money  reported to to amount to 6 4 billion yuan  to other businesses  such as property developers  charging super high interest  the newspaper said   It again proved a lack of proper supervision of banking outlets around the country   said an official with the Shanghai branch of the China Banking Regulatory Commission   There are increasing risks that the defaults in the shadow banking system would lead to a credit crisis   Old news  you might say  and no big deal  but remember that these kinds of problems when they arise tend immediately to be suppressed  and only become public when there is no way to prevent information from leaking out  The fact that we are being regaled almost weekly with stories of banking fraud and scandals suggests just how unsteady credit in China has been  Remember what Irving Fisher told us in The Debt Deflation Theory of Great Depressions    The public psychology of going into debt for gain passes through several more or less distinct phases   a  the lure of big prospective dividends or gains in income in the remote future   b  the hope of selling at a profit  and realizing a capital gain in the immediate future   c  the vogue of reckless promotions  taking advantage of the habituation of the public to great expectations   d  the development of downright fraud  imposing on a public which had grown credulous and gullible    When it is too late the dupes discover scandals like the Hatry  Krueger  and Insull scandals  At least one book has been written to prove that crises are due to frauds of clever promoters  But probably these frauds could never have become so great without the original starters of real opportunities to invest lucratively  There is probably always a very real basis for the  new era  psychology before it runs away with its victims  This was certainly the case before 1929  The late stages of a debt bubble are almost always characterized by the sudden emergence of financial fraud  and the huge extent of the frauds lead many to assume that fraud was the source of the credit problems  when in fact widespread financial fraud is more typically a symptom of a financial system that has already gone to excess  This is why I am going to be following financial scandals closely  no matter how arcane or small  The occurrence and pattern of financial scandal will tell us a lot about the likely problem areas in the financial system    4  Watch bank activities  More generally I am going to watch the relationship between total credit growth and the growth in RMB loans  Much of the off balance sheet financing in China is designed specifically to skirt regulations  and the relative size of these transactions will tell us about transparency  or lack thereof   A typical example of this might be this Bloomberg article from last Wednesday    China s bank loans as a share of funding in the economy may have fallen to a record low  highlighting the growth of alternative financing channels that have prompted warnings of rising credit risks  New yuan loans probably dropped 14 percent last month from a year earlier  according to the median projection in a Bloomberg News survey of 37 analysts ahead of data due by Jan  15  That would give bank lending a 55 percent share of aggregate financing for 2012  based on UBS AG estimates  the least in figures dating to 2002    The decline underscores the waning ability of official loan data to capture the scale of debt in the world s second largest economy as borrowers and investors turn to less regulated  higher return shadow banking products  The People s Bank of China is putting greater emphasis on aggregate financing and the International Monetary Fund says the growth of nonbank credit poses  new challenges to financial stability   In 2002  if I remember correctly  bank lending represented 93  of aggregate financing as defined by the PBoC as total social financing    5  Watch inflation  Inflation is actually a positive indicator for China s rebalancing  and also worth watching because I expect  hope  it to rise in 2013  although not by too much  This may sound like a strange thing to say   everyone else thinks of rising inflation as a bad thing   but remember that the more you repress household income growth  the more you divert resources  especially through cheap financing  from consumption into production  and so this tends to be disinflationary  If China is truly rebalancing  at least part of this is going to show up in upward inflationary pressure  although it is likely to be the  right  kind of inflation   i e  it will hurt the rich more than the poor because it will be based on non food rather than food items  Perhaps this inflation is already starting to happen  although not in the way I would like it to happen  There has been an uptick in inflation but it seems to have been caused by the impact of cold weather on food prices  rather than because consumption of manufactured goods is rising faster than production  According to an  in Friday s South China Morning Post    China s inflation spiked to a six month high in December after a freezing winter pushed up vegetable prices  possibly complicating efforts to sustain a shaky economic recovery  Consumer prices rose 2 5 per cent over a year earlier  up from November s 2 per cent and the fastest rise since June  the National Bureau of Statistics reported    That was driven by a 14 8 per cent jump in vegetable prices after the coldest winter in seven years led to smaller harvests  The statistics bureau said vegetable prices in some areas rose as much as 40 8 per cent  Higher inflation could hamper the government s ability to support China s recovery with interest rate cuts or other moves for fear of igniting a politically dangerous price spiral  Consumer prices are especially sensitive in a society where the poorest families spend up to half their monthly incomes on food    6  Watch the prices of hard commodities  Of course I will be watching copper prices and prices of other hard commodities  I expect that hard commodity prices will fall sharply over the next two to three years  but to the extent that prices rise in the short term  as they have in the past three months  it is likely to reflect additional investment growth in China  As a quick measure this means that declining copper prices can be seen as a measure of the extent of Chinese rebalancing  The longer it takes for copper prices to drop  the slower is the Chinese adjustment likely to be  There has  I should add  been a lot of talk recently about the price impact of copper ETFs  Here is a relevant  from the Financial Times    A group of copper users has rounded on the Securities and Exchange Commission for its  arbitrary and capricious  decision to approve the first US investment product that would hold physical copper  The move is likely to pave the way for a formal appeal  potentially further delaying the launch of the product by JPMorgan  which was first publicly proposed in October 2010    The users  including fabricators who account for about half of US copper demand as well as London based trading house Red Kite  said the SEC had insufficient evidence for its conclusion that the launch of the product would not affect supply of the metal    In a letter sent to the SEC by their lawyer  the copper users reiterated their view that the launch of the exchange traded fund would  obviously drive up the price of copper available for immediate delivery and create shortages of such supply   The SEC s conclusion to the contrary was  not based on substantial evidence and is therefore arbitrary and capricious   they alleged  I think I would agree with the SEC here  If there is significant stockpiling of copper to back these ETFs  clearly it can have a short term price impact  but I don t see how the price impact can be sustained much beyond the purchasing period  and even this is likely to be muted if buyers of the ETF substitute it for other long positions in copper  Still  even if it only has a short term impact on prices it might muddy the water and make it a little hard to interpret the impact of copper price changes  but the price of other hard commodities  including iron ore  can help clarify the role of Chinese demand    7  Watch the trade numbers  China s trade surplus for November came in much higher than expected  although there are so many discrepancies in the numbers that not all of us are confident about how to interpret the numbers  It seems like growth in both imports and exports may have been exaggerated  as local authorities may be round tripping both exports and imports in order to make their numbers look good  In addition  as I have argued many times  China s exports are likely to be misleadingly low and its imports misleadingly high  and so its real trade surplus higher than the official trade surplus  to the extent that there is significant commodity stockpiling and hidden capital flight  Of course destocking and capital inflows will have the opposite effect  But in spite of all this confusion the direction of the trade numbers  especially the trade surplus  tells us something important about the rebalancing process  Remember that the current account surplus is simply equal to the excess of savings over investment  China must bring both its savings rate and its investment rate down sharply  If it can bring savings down faster than investment  China is probably rebalancing in the right way  and this should show up as strong growth and a declining trade surplus  If  however  the trade surplus rises  then clearly savings are contracting more slowly than investment  This means that consumption isn t growing fast enough to compensate for the reduction in investment growth  It is easy to bring investment rates down  ignoring the political opposition to doing so   It has proven very difficult to bring the savings rate down because this can only happen by diverting resources away from wealthy and powerful groups and families in favor of ordinary households  The evolution of the trade surplus will tell us something about how successful China has been in bringing down the savings rate    8  Watch the Spanish bond market  Obviously I  like everyone else  will be watching the Spanish bond markets  They ended the year relatively well  Here is the relevant  in El Pa s    Taking advantage of improved market conditions  the Spanish Treasury comfortably exceeded its maximum issue target at its first bond auction of the year  The debt management arm of the Economy Ministry sold 5 817 billion euros in two   five  and 13 year bonds  compared with its goal of five billion euros as the rates offered fell in line with an easing of yields in the secondary market    It sold 3 397 billion euros of a new two year benchmark issue carrying a coupon of 2 75 percent  The marginal yield emerged at 2 587 percent  down from 3 280 percent at an auction for paper of a similar maturity held in October of last year  Bids for the issue amounted to 7 016 billion euros    It issued a further 1 949 billion euros in bonds maturing in 2018 as the cut off rate declined to 4 033 percent from 4 769 percent in a tender held in November  Demand came to 5 050 billion euros  In the third leg of the auction  the Treasury sold 470 million euros in paper maturing in 2026 at a marginal rate of 5 569 percent  down from 6 218 percent in July    Analysts said the outcome of the auction reflected a reduced aversion to risk as investors seek higher yields   Today s  Thursday  auction reflects there s no imminent concern Spain might go down the same road as Portugal  Ireland and Greece   Fadi Zaher  the head of fixed income sales and trading for Barclays Wealth and Investment Management in London  told Bloomberg   I do not think anything important has changed as far as the European crisis is concerned  The fact that there is a additional liquidity for bond purchases does not mean  as I see it  that Spanish competitiveness has been resolved and it does not mean that the economy can grow out of its debt burden  It simply means that there is temporarily a little less pressure to resolve the underlying problems  I would guess that by the second quarter of 2013  and likely earlier  markets will once again have gotten much worse  More important to me is what is related in another  from the same newspaper  Spain s household savings rate fell to its lowest level on record in the third quarter of last year as high unemployment and wage deflation in the latest recession obliged them to devote more of their disposable income to consumption  according to figures released Wednesday by the National Statistics Institute  INE      The main reason for the drop in the third quarter was falling income  The INE said net disposable income in the period declined 1 6 percent from a year earlier to 164 675 billion euros  This in turn was the result of a 5 4 percent contraction in salaries and a fall in other sources of net income such as interest on bank deposits and share dividends of 4 4 percent  If the savings rate is declining even while national income declines  then Spain is not rebalancing properly  Rising unemployment of course generally results in a declining savings rate because people with income still need to consume  and they do so by either borrowing or by dipping into their savings  but if Spain is going to repay its debt it probably will need to be a net exporter of savings  which means that savings have to exceed investment  If savings decline  the only way for this condition to be met is for investment to decline much more quickly  This  of course  isn t good for growth    9  Watch Target 2  On a related topic  I will continue to watch Target 2 closely as an indicator of strains within the European banking system  This too ended 2013 on a positive note  Here is an  from Spiegel    There is cause for hope in Southern Europe  New numbers indicate that trust is returning to banks located in countries that have been hit hardest by the euro crisis  But even as discrepencies in the Continent s Target2 payment system shrink  danger still lurks    The turning point came almost exactly four months ago  On Sept  6  2012  22 men gathered on the 36th floor of the European Central Bank building in Frankfurt to reach a momentous decision on the Continent s common currency  The euro  said ECB President Mario Draghi at the press conference following the meeting  is  irreversible   To save it  he added  his bank would undertake unlimited purchases of sovereign bonds should it become necessary    Since then  an amazing thing has happened  Although the ECB has yet to embark on any such bond shopping sprees  countries such as Italy and Spain  at risk of being engulfed by the crisis  no longer have to pay the horrendous interest rates they did in the middle of 2012  Furthermore  the massive imbalances that have recently plagued the European banking system have shrunk  if only slightly    As recently as the summer of 2012  investors and those with savings accounts in crisis stricken countries were moving their money out as quickly as they could  Billions of euros were withdrawn from accounts in Greece and Spain and banks in stable countries such as Germany put a cap on the amount of money they were willing to lend business partners in countries hit hardest by the euro crisis    But since last autumn  this trend has come to a stop  Indeed  the most recent numbers indicate that a slight reversal is underway  with ECB statistics showing that deposits in Spanish and Greek banks have recently ticked upwards  Furthermore  Germany s central bank  the Bundesbank  reported this week that imbalances in Europe s so called Target2 settlement system  in which euro zone central banks and the ECB transfer money across the common currency union  have declined  As the euro crisis progressed  the system had become massively imbalanced  which could result in massive losses for countries such as Germany should Greece  for example  be forced to exit the euro zone  For the same reason that I am not optimistic about the Spanish bond market I am also not optimistic that Target 2 will continue to reverse  If it does  of course  that will be a great sigh  but if it doesn t  and if in fact the imbalances continue to grow  that will put additional stress on Germany s ability to maintain the euro system    10  Watch Japan  Remember that Japanese attempts to get their arms around their huge debt burden will almost certainly affect China and the rest of the global economy  If Japan tries to increase domestic savings to fund the debt  for example by limiting wage increases  or by taxing consumption  both of which they have proposed  these measures may well cause domestic investment to fall  Whether or not they do  if domestic savings rise faster than domestic investment  which is the only way to increase the domestic savings pool available to fund Japanese debt  then by definition the current account surplus must rise  I am not smart enough to tell you what Japan will do  but I do know that almost anything it does must affect the relationship between its savings and its investment  and hence Japan s current account surplus  which I suspect everyone hopes will rise  Of course everyone else wants the same thing too   rising exports relative to imports   which is clearly impossible  but Japan needs it more urgently than most of the rest of us  This is going to increase strains on the global trading system ,2013-02-14,Michael Pettis,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-i’ll-be-watching-in-2013-155306,155306

106297,327812,A,COLA Changes  Pros And Cons,opinion,The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  released a report that evaluates the consequences of adopting the chained CPI  I was surprised by the results  The numbers are  so good  that this approach will rise to the top of the budget cutting debate  I m sure that was the intent of the folks at CBO with  If America is going to accomplish anything with the debt deficit issue it needs to either generate more revenue  or cut expenses  Some combo is going to be the outcome  The numbers have to be big  Anything less than  1T over ten years is hardly worth the effort   2T would be desirable  but hard to achieve  Something around  1 5T over ten years would take all the bull shit over this issue off the front pages for a few years  So we  need   1 5T stretched out over a decade  The CBO concludes that we can come up with  340B  25   of the nut by changing inflation calculations  That s a big down payment  Some details  Changing the CPI has consequences to both government revenues and expenses  Expenses  like Social Security and other retirement programs will be reduced from what is now scheduled  Tax revenues will rise as a result of the inflation adjustments on tax brackets  and changes to refundable tax credits under ACA  The breakdown For every dollar of increased revenue there is  1 7 dollars of expense cuts  Is this  fair   I don t know  but it isn t unfair   59  of the savings comes from reduced Social Security payments  while 17  of the reductions come from the retirement plans for the Military and Federal workers  The net reductions hit all of the government retirement programs equally  so this also seems fair   Adjustments to COLA will result in relatively small changes in early years  In 2014  the expense reduction is only  3 4B  in 2023 the reduction will be  70b  This a  desirable  outcome as those who will lose benefits will have a significant time to adjust to those changes   Most economists believe it would be a mistake to make sharp cuts in spending today  The consequences of adjusting COLA are consistent with what the economists  want    If the changes in COLA were extended for another ten years beyond 2023  the cost savings would get larger and larger  Over a 75 year period the changes in COLA would save trillions  but in 75 years a cup of coffee will cost  5 000  so I m not sure what any of these big numbers really mean Having discussed why the changes in COLA are economically significant  its now time to look at what is wrong with this proposal   The AARP  the liberal press and many progressive politicians are going to hate this plan  The mantra  Don t touch Social Security   it s off budget   is going to be heard again and again  Changes to COLA can only be accomplished as part of a broader plan  That plan must included changes to Medicare and Medicaid  It will require that more revenues  eliminate deductions  be part of the deal  I have a difficult time believing that a  big deal  can happen given the rancor in D C  today   The Generals Admirals and Federal workers are going to get clipped along with SS recipients  I see that as a big problem   In the CBO projections there is an assumed increase in SNAP costs  SNAP   Food Stamps  Why would Food Stamp costs go up if COLA is adjusted  The CBO answers this CBO estimates that the proposal would reduce income to individuals who also receive SNAP    Aha  Poor people will get poorer as a result  and therefore they will qualify for more Food Stamps  so costs go up  This is an unintended consequence  but it is a dumb one  This demonstrates how difficult it is to actually  fix  problems    Adjustments in COLA represent across the board cuts  This is stupid  70  of SS beneficiaries NEED the benefits they will get  30  don t  There is no  fairness  to that outcome  This may prove to be the fatal flaw of this proposal    The changes in the COLA formula should result in  positive  YoY changes  But there is no guarantee according to the CBO  The actual difference in any year could vary noticeably from that average    The estimates behind the  good  results are flaky  I hate it when that happens     The projected increase in revenue comes substantially from how the Affordable Care Act  ACA   Obamacare  will be  paid  for  But ACA doesn t exist today  This means we were sold a bill of goods when ACA was invented  Adjustments to COLA means that the cost of healthcare for all Americans will be higher than what has been previously projected  So the biggest changes in the US healthcare system in 50 years is put on  more  shaky legs when COLA changes are made  This is the Whack A Mole problem  When one problem is  fixed  it pops up someplace else and causes even bigger problems    The proposed changes to COLA have a significant consequence to SS beneficiaries  But compared to what is programed to be spent  the changes are a drop in the bucket  These charts tell the story    To me  the issue of greatest concern is how SS will influence the Debt Owed to the Public  The following graph looks at the projected negative cash flow at SS with and without changes to COLA Conclusions Changes in COLA are coming   provided it is packaged with other measures that  A  decrease Medicare and Medicaid spending   B  reduce military spending   C  reduce other discretionary spending and  D  the elimination of many personal income tax deductions  What s the probability of that package being realized from the current crop of legislators  Does Zero seem about right  I don t see it happening Adjustments to COLA can add up to big numbers  But the numbers we are faced with are so large  the COLA changes are really just a rounding error ,2013-03-03,Bruce

106326,327841,A,2012 Market Wrap Up  U S  Major Indices ,opinion,Here s what I wrote  about 2011  2011   what a year  A year of social unrest  demonstrations  riots  government overthrows  mass murders  earthquakes  tsunamis  floods  nuclear reactor meltdowns  political discord  economic distress  the  R  word has resurfaced   austerity  financial weakness  credit rating downgrades  volatility  financial fraud  law suits  assassinations  and the passing of Steve Jobs   no wonder the markets have been so reactive  sometimes quite violently  rather than proactive in a measured manner   and The question will be whether stability returns to the European markets and whether recent stability can hold and improve in Emerging Markets for 2012  or whether volatility  VIX  will rise again   the VIX is still elevated  so there is a good possibility that it will  No doubt  all market action will be reflective of upcoming world news events  as well as consumer and investor sentiment  together with risk vs safety appetite  A couple of gauges that I ll follow in this regard are the VIX  U S     and Copper  as well as the other instruments noted above  Without benefit of major Fed QE intervention  I imagine that next year could be range bound   within this year s high and low  generally   although unforeseen catastrophes could send the Major Indices below this year s lows   2012 has been slightly quieter    just remove the words  nuclear reactor meltdowns  and the passing of Steve Jobs   but repeat the rest  Add to the mix the fact that  a  Central Banks around the world have poured huge amounts of monetary stimulus into the markets   b  there have been a variety of government elections around the world  and  c  the markets have gone through a Presidential Congressional election in the U S  and have faced turmoil related to the  Fiscal Cliff  and  Debt Ceiling Limit  issues    and you get the following results on the U S  Major Indices  Each candle on the following charts of the Major Indices represents a 1 Year period  You can see that 2012 closed modestly higher than 2011  but is facing all time major resistance Each candle on the following charts of the Major Indices represents One Quarter  While Q1 of 2012 made a promising start  the next three quarters really didn t progress any higher  Instead  they chopped around inside this range and closed near the high of Q1 on negatively diverging RSI on the Dow 30  S P 500  and Russell 2000 Indices  while the Nasdaq 100 Index closed a bit below on falling RSI  The Q4 candle ended the year as a bearish  hanging man   The RSI and  hanging man  issues are signalling caution here for the bull case These markets will need to break out and hold above 14000 on the Dow 30  1500 on the S P 500  3000 on the Nasdaq 100  and 900 on the Russell 2000 Index in order to  potentially  attract serious buyers to sustain and produce significant gains for 2013  A failure to do so  will likely keep them range bound in 2012 s range  or send them lower The following graphs show percentage gained lost on the Major Indices for 2012  The Nasdaq 100 made the most gains  while the Dow 30 made the least  We ll see whether or not buying picks up in the blue chip stocks  or whether the markets continue to favour the more risk oriented stocks in the Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2000 Indices The latest Consumer Confidence numbers show that  while they were slightly higher in 2012 than 2011  they have plateaued  and dropped lower this past month  and are still well below those experienced from 2000 to 2007  less than half   It s one to watch over the coming months for signs of either increasing weakness  or renewed strength  and by how much  inasmuch as such data may have an impact on the markets    as you can see from the index charts above  the consumer confidence graph for 2012 is similar to those markets In summary  without the added monetary stimulus from the Fed  the U S  markets would have likely pulled back considerably this year due to the lack of a cohesive fiscal governance of economic policies and programs  Whether we see any strengthening of bi partisan ties that produces creative growth policies and programs to provide sufficient consumer  business  institutional  and domestic and foreign investor confidence remains to be seen   If we don t  then I think we ll see a repeat of choppy  non directional  and volatile  low volume market action with unsustainable follow through in 2013    a market that is continued to be ruled by news headlines and Central Bankers  rather than one that is based on sound economic conditions and individual company fundamentals   If the in fighting that we ve witnessed in the  Debt Ceiling Limit  debate and  Fiscal Cliff  discussions are any indication  both of which are still unresolved as at Monday s market close   I think they are a snapshot of what is to come for 2013 and  likely  until the next Presidential Congressional election    there seems to be a growing bitter divide between parties  and even among members in the same party  Therefore  I think the latter scenario will dominate market action for the next four years  particularly since these markets are at all time major resistance   I hope I m wrong  since I d like to see everyone do well  As I mentioned in  I ll be watching the Index Volatility Ratio Charts  30 Year Bonds  the U S     and the  Fed Monetary Stimulus Program Canaries  to gauge short term market sentiment for equities ,2013-01-01,Candy

106328,327843,A,New Trading System  Comparing The Close With Last 3 Days  High Or Low,opinion,I have been testing a new trading system that I came up with while I was reading Suri Duddella s book  Trade Chart Patterns like the Pros  This particular idea came across my mind during the first chart patterns that Suri describes how he trades in his trading book  First I noticed that he enters the market on the very next day after the pattern is complete and only if the price trades in the same direction  Then I began comparing the day s close with last three days  high or low  since he often mentions in the first pages how this specific chart pattern has provided positive signals  In the last weeks there have been numerous bullish and bearish signals that look quite promising according to the rules above  I m testing this trading system on stocks and forex but I suppose it can also be applied to any other instrument  Rules of the trading system  There are two basic rules to trade long  Close  C  must be higher than the highest high of the last 3 days The signal is confirmed on the next trading day if the price trades above the high of the previous day Similarly  there are also two basic rules to sell short  Close  C  must be lower than the lowest low of the last 3 days The signal is confirmed on the next trading day if the price trades below the low of the previous day A stop loss order is recommended of course and in the case of long trades  we should usually set it below the most recent low  Respectively  the stop loss order for short trades should be set above the most recent high  Additionally  the trading system performance can be further improved by combining the rules above with other elements of technical analysis  like support and resistance levels  Fibonacci retracements  ascending and descending triangles or other formations  Example In stock trading  Google  The first long trade could have been initiated in June  A   After a retracement that lasted five days  a long green candlestick closed higher than the last three days  high  On the very next day Google shares began trading close to the last day s high  The system would instruct us to trade long as soon as Google stock traded higher than that high at about  570  The stop loss would be set at  550  although it would never be hit  According to your personal management of the trade  returns could have reached 35  if you held your position until GOOG hit  770  Another profitable long trade could have happened in November  C   The gaining candlestick with an open gap right after the doji candlestick indicated an uptrend resume  Google stock traded above  670  previous high  on the next day alerting traders to go long  although shares closed at the opening price  Still the uptrend has been confirmed and long positions have been favored in the last two months Obviously the system cannot make 100  correct predictions  far from it  That is why we would lose money if we traded long in late October  B   The green candlestick printed a close higher than the previous days  high and GOOG stock printed new highs on the next day  but eventually shares collapsed below the support level of  670 in the following days  Hopefully a stop loss would minimize the losses  D  is a sell short signal but I wouldn t recommend following that signal  The frightening falling candlestick that shows a  100 decline of Google share price surely went south of the previous lows  but it also disallowed of a fruitful reward risk trade  In order to trade short at  670 using a 2 to 1 reward risk ratio  one should set a profit target at  460  having previously set a stop loss at  760  Good luck predicting a retracement back to the 2010 low Example In Forex  EUR USD According to the rules of the trading system  a forex trader could have bought Euros in July  A  at 1 2340 when the currency pair printed new high following the long green candlestick  This kind of trading should be considered as long term trading  given the fact that the stop loss would have been set 300 pips lower at 1 2040  leading to a similar profit target at least  EUR USD did climb up to 1 3150 in September for about 800 pips   title  eurusd stock chart daily  width  600  height  575    A short trade signal is noted at  B   As Euro seemed unable to penetrate the resistance level at 1 3150  the third confirmation of that specific level added more value to the signal  Unfortunately for those who trusted the U S  dollar  Euro didn t go much lower before managing to print new highs at 1 33 in the year s end That was an introduction to a trading system that is still work in progress  I can t yet comment on investing facts like ROI regarding the system  as no backtesting has been done  Hopefully I will have more news to share in future posts ,2013-01-04,Jim Makos,https://www.investing.com/analysis/new-trading-system:-comparing-the-close-with-last-3-days’-high-or-low-149609,149609

106331,327846,A,Ten Reasons Oil Prices Are A Problem,opinion,A person might think from looking at news reports that our oil problems are gone  but oil prices are still high Figure 1  U S  crude oil prices  based on average prices paid by U S  refiners for all grades of oil based on EIA data  converted to 2012 dollars using CPI Urban data from the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics In fact  the new  tight oil  sources of oil which are supposed to grow in supply are still expensive to extract  If we expect to have more tight oil and more oil from other unconventional sources  we need to expect to continue to have high oil prices  The new oil may help supply somewhat  but the high cost of extraction is not likely to go away Why Are High Oil Prices A Problem 1  It is not just oil prices that rise  The cost of food rises as well  partly because oil is used in many ways in growing and transporting food and partly because of the competition from biofuels for land  sending land prices up  The cost of shipping goods of all types rises  since oil is used in nearly all methods of transports  The cost of materials that are made from oil  such as asphalt and chemical products  also rises If the cost of oil rises  it tends to raise the cost of other fossil fuels  The cost of natural gas extraction tends to rises  since oil is used in natural gas drilling and in transporting water for fracking  Because of an over supply of natural gas in the U S   its sales price is temporarily less than the cost of production  This is not a sustainable situation  Higher oil costs also tend to raise the cost of transporting coal to the destination where it is used Figure 2  U S  Energy Prices as   of Wages and as of GDP  Ratio to GDP provided by EIA Short Term Economic Outlook    Figure 27  converted to Wage Base by author  using same wages as described for Figure 3 Figure 2 shows total energy costs as a percentage of two different bases  GDP and Wages 1 These costs are still near their high point in 2008  relative to these bases  Because oil is the largest source of energy  and the highest priced  it represents the majority of energy costs  GDP is the usual base of comparison  but I have chosen to show a comparison to wages as well  I do this because even if an increase in costs takes place in the government or business sector of the economy  most of the higher costs will eventually have to be paid for by individuals  through higher taxes or higher prices on goods or services 2  High oil prices don t go away  except in recession  We extracted the easiest  and cheapest  to extract oil first  Even oil company executives say   The easy oil is gone   The oil that is available now tends to be expensive to extract because it is deep under the sea  or near the North Pole  or needs to be  fracked   or is thick like paste  and needs to be melted  We haven t discovered cheaper substitutes  either  even though we have been looking for years In fact  there is good reason to believe that the cost of oil extraction will continue to rise faster than the rate of inflation  because we are hitting a situation of  diminishing returns   There is evidence that world oil production costs are increasing at about 9  per year  7  after backing about the effect of inflation   Oil prices paid by consumers will need to keep pace  if we expect increased extraction to take place  There is even evidence that sweet sports are extracted first in Bakken tight oil  causing the cost of this extraction to rise as well 3  Salaries don t increase to offset rising oil prices  Most of us know from personal experience that salaries don t rise with rising oil prices In fact  as oil prices have risen since 2000  wage growth has increasingly lagged GDP growth  Figure 3 shows the ratio of wages  using the same definition as in Figure 2  to GDP Figure 3  Wage Base  defined as sum of  Wage and Salary Disbursements  plus  Employer Contributions for Social Insurance  plus  Proprietors  Income  from Table 2 1  Personal Income and its Distribution  as Percentage of GDP  based on U S  Bureau of Economic Analysis data   2012 amounts estimated based on part year data If salaries don t rise  and prices of many types of goods and services do  something has to  give   This disparity seems to be the reason for the continuing economic discomfort experienced in the past several years  For many consumers  the only solution is a long term cut back in discretionary spending 4  Spikes in oil prices tend to be associated with recessions   Economist James Hamilton has shown that 10 out of the last 11 US recessions were associated with oil price spikes When oil prices rise  consumers tend to cut back on discretionary spending  so as to have enough money for basics  such as food and gasoline for commuting  These cut backs in spending lead to lay offs in discretionary sectors of the economy  such as vacation travel and visits to restaurants  The lay offs in these sectors lead to more cutbacks in spending  and to more debt defaults 5  High oil prices don t  recycle  well through the economy  Theoretically  high oil prices might lead to more employment in the oil sector  and more purchases by these employees  In practice  this provides only a very partial offset to higher price  The oil sector is not a big employer  although with rising oil extraction costs and more US drilling  it is getting to be a larger employer  Oil importing countries find that much of their expenditures must go abroad  Even if these expenditures are recycled back as more US debt  this is not the same as more US salaries  Also  the United States government is reaching debt limits Even within oil exporting countries  high oil prices don t necessarily recycle to other citizens well  A recent study shows that 2011 food price spikes helped trigger the Arab Spring  Since higher food prices are closely related to higher oil prices  and occurred at the same time   this is an example of poor recycling  As populations rise  the need to keep big populations properly fed and otherwise cared for gets to be more of an issue  Countries with high populations relative to exports  such as Iran  Nigeria  Russia  Sudan  and Venezuela would seem to have the most difficulty in providing needed goods to citizens 6  Housing prices are adversely affected by high oil prices  If a person is required to pay more for oil  food  and delivered goods of all sorts  less will be left over for discretionary spending  Buying a new home is one such type of discretionary expenditure U S  housing prices started to drop in mid 2006  according to data of the S P Case Shiller home price index  This timing fits in well with when oil prices began to rise  based on Figure 1 7  Business profitability is adversely affected by high oil prices Some businesses in discretionary sectors may close their doors completely  Others may lay off workers to get supply and demand back into balance 8  The impact of high oil prices doesn t  go away  Citizens  discretionary income is permanently lower  Businesses that close when oil prices rise generally don t re open  In some cases  businesses that close may be replaced by companies in China or India  with lower operating costs  These lower operating costs indirectly reflect the fact that the companies use less oil  and the fact that their workers can be paid less  because the workers use less oil  This is a part of the reason why US employment levels remain low  and why we don t see a big bounce back in growth after the Great Recession  Figure 4 below shows the big shifts in oil consumption that have taken place Figure 4  Percentage growth in oil consumption between 2006 and 2011  based on BP s 2012 Statistical Review of World Energy A major part of the  fix  for high oil prices that does takes place is provided by the government  This takes the place in the form of unemployment benefits  stimulus programs  and artificially low interest rates Efficiency changes may provide some mitigation  as older less fuel efficient cars are replaced with more fuel efficient cars  Of course  if the more fuel efficient cars are more expensive  part of the savings to consumers will be lost because of higher monthly payments for the replacement vehicles 9  Government finances are especially affected by high oil prices  With higher unemployment rates  governments are faced with paying more unemployment benefits and making more stimulus payments  If there have been many debt defaults  because of more unemployment or because of falling home prices   the government may also need to bail out banks  At the same time  taxes collected from citizens are lower  because of lower employment  A major reason  but not the only reason  for today s debt problems of the governments of large oil importers  such as U S   Japan  and much of Europe  is high oil prices Governments are also affected by the high cost of replacing infrastructure that was built when oil prices were much lower  For example  the cost of replacing asphalt roads is much higher  So is the cost of replacing bridges and buried underground pipelines  The only way these costs can be reduced is by doing less going back to gravel roads  for example 10  Higher oil prices reflect a need to focus a disproportionate share of investment and resource use inside the oil sector  This makes it increasingly difficult maintain growth within the oil sector  and acts to reduce growth rates outside the oil sector There is a close tie between energy consumption and economic activity because nearly all economic activity requires the use of some type of energy besides human labor  Oil is the single largest source of energy  and the most expensive  When we look at GDP growth for the world  it is closely aligned with growth in oil consumption and growth in energy consumption in general  In fact  changes in oil and energy growth seem to precede GDP growth  as might be expected if oil and energy use are a cause of world economic growth Figure 5  Growth in World GDP  energy consumption  and oil consumption  GDP growth is based on USDA International Macroeconomic Data  Oil consumption and energy consumption growth are based on BP s 2012 Statistical Review of World Energy The current situation of needing increasing amounts of resources to extract oil is sometimes referred to one of declining Energy Return on Energy Invested  EROEI   Multiple problems are associated with declining EROEI  when cost levels are already high  a  It becomes increasingly difficult to keep scaling up oil industry investment because of limits on debt availability  when heavy investment is made up front  and returns are many years away  As an example  Petrobas in Brazil is running into this limit  Some U S  oil and gas producers are reaching debt limits as well  b  Greater use of oil within the industry leaves less for other sectors of the economy  Oil production has not been rising very quickly in recent years  Figure 6 below   so even a small increase by the industry can reduce net availability of oil to society  Some of this additional oil use is difficult to avoid  For example  if oil is located in a remote area  employees frequently need to live at great distance from the site and commute using oil based means of transport Figure 6  World crude oil production  including condensate  based primarily on U S  Energy Information Administration data  with trend lines fitted by the author  c  Declining EROEI puts pressure on other limited resources as well  For example  there can be water limits  when fracking is used  leading to conflicts with other use  such as agricultural use of water  Pollution can become an increasingly large problem as well  d  High oil investment cost can be expected to slow down new investment  and keep oil supply from rising as fast world demand rises  To the extent that oil is necessary for economic growth  this slowdown will tend to constrain growth in other economic sectors Airline Industry as an Example of Impacts on Discretionary Industries High oil prices can be expected to cause discretionary sectors to shrink back in size  In many respects  the airline industry is the  canary in the coal mine   showing how discretionary sectors can be forced to shrink In the case of commercial air lines  when oil prices are high  consumers have less money to spend on vacation travel  so demand for airline tickets falls  At the same time  the price of fuel to operate airplanes rises  making the cost of operating airplanes higher  Business travel is less affected  but still is affected to some extent  because some long distance business travel is discretionary Airlines respond by consolidating and cutting back in whatever ways they can  Salaries of pilots and stewardesses are reduced  Pension plans are scaled back  New more fuel efficient aircraft are purchased  and less fuel efficient aircraft are phased out  Less profitable routes are closed  The industry still experiences bankruptcy after bankruptcy  and merger after merger  If oil prices stabilize for a while  this process stabilizes a bit  but doesn t really stop  Eventually  the commercial airline industry may shrink to such an extent that necessary business flights become difficult There are many discretionary sectors besides the airline industry waiting in the wings to shrink  While oil prices have been high for several years  their effects have not yet been fully incorporated into discretionary sectors  This is the case because governments have been able to use deficit spending and artificially low interest rates to shield consumers from the  real  impacts of high priced oil Governments are now finding that debt cannot be ramped up indefinitely  As taxes need to be raised and benefits decreased  and as interest rates are forced higher  consumers will again see discretionary income squeezed  New cutbacks are likely to hit additional discretionary sectors  such as restaurants  the  arts   higher education  and medicine for the elderly It would be very helpful if new unconventional oil developments would fix the problem of high cost oil  but it is difficult to see how they will  They are high cost to develop and slow to ramp up  Governments are in such poor financial condition that they need taxes from wherever they can get them revenue of oil and gas operators is a likely target  To the extent that unconventional oil and gas production does ramp up  my expectation is that it will be too little  too late  and too high priced Note   1  Wages include private and government wages  proprietors  income  and taxes paid by employers on behalf of employees  They do not include transfer payments  such as Social

106335,327850,A,Learning The Wrong Lessons,opinion,  investors are the most optimistic on stocks they have been in 3  years  As is normal  investors mistake a sense of optimism about the economy for a sense of optimism on equities  As is normal  investors are reaching this peak of optimism as the stock market achieves its highest nominal level in five years  and among the highest valuation multiples in   hey  about five years  What a coincidence   Incidentally  while we calculate our long term valuation metrics ourselves  is a pretty good source for a quick and dirty view of valuations  I don t have any relationship to the company and this is the only page on the site that I ve used so I am not endorsing any other page   Now  while I am probably as optimistic on the economy as I have been in the past few years  I m still less optimistic than the crowd since I think the crowd hasn t yet assimilated the fact that the little growth spurt at the end of Q4 owes quite a lot to the movement of dividends and incomes into Q4 from Q1  and thus the first quarter of this year will probably look rather poor  In fact  while I am clearly negative long term on the prospects for nominal Treasury bonds  that s my investment view  My trading view is that at 1 84   Treasury bond yields are probably going to go lower before they go higher  That s partly because the present yields incorporate a lot of enthusiasm about growth   enthusiasm I think will be dashed once the January numbers begin to be reported in earnest  But the trading view is also because the Fed is buying virtually all of the net supply the Treasury is supplying to the market  with no sign that project is ending  I have no illusions that buying 10 year Treasuries at 1 84  and holding to maturity will be an awful investment  But if I was a short term swing trader  I d play for the next 20bps to be lower  not higher  in yield  With respect to January data  incidentally  here is what we have so far  outside of Initial Claims  which as I have pointed out previously are all over the map at this time of year  For the most part  these are not just misses but big misses  I wonder how long it will take for investors to notice  Initial Claims on Thursday could get attention as the numbers start to converge on the actual condition of the underlying economy  but the first big January datum is the January 29th release of Consumer Confidence  which is currently expected to rise slightly from December  That is followed by ADP on January 30th  but any weakness there will likely be tempered by the advance release of Q4 GDP on the same day   the Chicago PMI on the 31st  and the ISM PMI and Unemployment on February 1st  Regardless of what happens over the next few days  I don t want to be short bonds headed into that gauntlet next week  I said the January data were big misses  for the most part   because the NAHB miss wasn t really a big miss  Housing is even strong enough now to resist downside surprises  As an aside  although it is a December number  the median price of existing home sales rose 10 89  year on year  Adjusted for the level of core inflation  so that we re looking at the real rise in existing home prices   this is the fastest rise in history except for several months in 2005   see the chart   source     As for stocks  the fact that investors are as bullish as they have been in a third of a decade is sad but not terribly surprising  although this is a survey of Bloomberg users  which supposedly are much more astute since they have to come up with the 1700 clams per month for the service   On a related note  I was recently reading an article  called  I Saw The Movie   in the January issue of Financial Advisor Magazine  In the article  the author compares the fear that some investors have of the stock market to the  irrational  fear of going into the water after watching Jaws  The author notes that  If your balance in 2011 resembled your balance in early 2008  you lost three years   but you didn t lose any money  unless you sold out of panic the vast majority of big losers were those who sold at the ebb of fall of  08 to the spring of  09 and parked their boats in the shallows of rock bottom savings accounts   This  it occurs to me  is the real toll that the Fed s QE has had on the investor class  It taught the wrong lesson  The lesson that has been taught is that you should hold on through all things  good and bad  and things will be okay  It is true that with hindsight  those who sold with the market finally at fair value  but no cheaper  in March of  09 missed a rollicking rally all the way back to similar levels of overvaluation  But the real lesson should have been that most investors shouldn t have been overweight in equities in 2008 or in 2007  based on market valuations  In the absence of manipulation of asset prices through the  portfolio balance channel   see my discussion of this phenomenon in my recent article  A Relatively Good Deal Doesn t Mean It s A Good Deal    those who sold in March of 2009 would have missed an average market return rather than the 21  per annum the market actually delivered since then  So the problem isn t that they got out in 2009  but that they got in  or stayed in  in 2007 and 2008  and then got out in 2009  Investors who heeded the overvaluation of the market at  say  year end 1998 and never got back in have earned a compounded return of 2 54  in T Bills  7 39  in TIPS  5 64  in commodities  or 5 77  in the Lehman Barclays Agg  nominal bonds  compared with 2 94  in stocks  And that return is based on the pumped up valuations that still exist in stocks today  Investors  and their advisors for the most part  haven t learned the right lessons yet  which is why patient investors are still having to wait to get back into equities even though the Federal Reserve is working very hard to force them back into the market via the portfolio balance channel  The right lesson is this  investing for the long term is mostly about valuations  and very little about the economic cycle  the news cycle  or the lunar cycle  And two of those three we can t predict  anyway  Yes  there is a tactical element of trading  but most investors should be  a  rebalancing on a regular basis   b  paying attention to basic rudiments of asset valuation so as to adjust   mainly at the margin   their basic asset mix  and  c  turning off the television ,2013-01-22,Michael Ashton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/learning-the-wrong-lessons-151909,151909

106337,327852,A,Not Growing To The Sky   Nor Ready To Fall  Yet,opinion,If only we could dwell permanently in January  looking at December 2012 economic data  the U S  would be a warm and sunny place  Yesterday s Durable Goods number came in above expectations  although with revisions the ex transportation figure was only slightly above forecasts  Again  though  this is a report for December  when incomes were higher due to the tax anticipation  The December data is mostly finished  however  and now the January data begins to be reported  That starts with Consumer Confidence  Consensus  64 0 from 65 1  today Tuesday  It can t happen soon enough for the bond market  The 10 year Treasury note touched 2  yesterday  for the first time since last April  10 year TIPS got above  0 60  for the first time since August  although  to be fair  11bps of that is due to the roll  since the old 10 year TIPS are still at  0 69  which wouldn t even be the highest yield this month   It is impressive to see the bond market selling off even though the Federal Reserve continues to buy  Partly  this may be because investors are fearful that the strong data will cause the Fed to stop buying  whereupon we all know we don t want to be overlong  That is unlikely to happen  certainly at this week s meeting  It is no mystery that December s numbers were pumped up by large distributions being made in 2012 over 2013  and the Fed would want to see  a  more strength than was evident even in December and  b  that strength maintained for a little while at least  And  of course  while the fiscal cliff can has been kicked down the road a couple of months  there is also still a debt ceiling debate that must be had in the next month or two  It seems unlikely that the Fed would stop buying Treasuries while those uncertainties still loom  Over the last 18 months  the 10 year note has come up to the 2  level a number of times  Usually  that level has been pierced by 3 4bps before the market reversed again  but on two occasions yields went as high as 2 40   I think the top in bonds  lows in yield  have been reached  but I don t think the market will break to higher yields just yet  As I noted last week  I really don t want to be short bonds headed into the next week plus of data  Now  looking at a long term chart the current set up in 10 year yields is interesting  The chart below  Source  Bloomberg  is of monthly closing levels in 10 year yields  with the y axis drawn with logarithmic scale  For years  I ve always drawn the channel shown on the chart  such that it contained the entire bull market until the breakout around the time of the 2008 crisis A more common  but I think arguably less correct way  is to draw the y axis with a normal linear scale  In this case  the most recent low actually makes a rare 6 point support trendline on the monthly closes  The channel is no longer truly a channel  the lines are not quite parallel   and the channel doesn t include the two 1980 1984 spikes  but it s a much prettier picture  In either case  there is nothing to suggest that the secular downtrend in rates has yet become an uptrend  Someday  it will  because trees don t grow to the sky  and I wouldn t want to wait until 3 50  to start re positioning  much less  the 4  implied by the log chart   But I don t think that day is here yet  Now  while most people are still not afraid of inflation   which is the most likely reason for nominal interest rates to eventually normalize   inflation swaps continue to rise  The 10 year inflation swap rate reached 2 80  yesterday  about 10bps from the post Lehman highs  see Chart  source    Some people  evidently  are starting to be concerned  Incidentally  some might be tempted to attribute yesterday s inflation market rally to the rise in unleaded gasoline futures  Unleaded  that Hess Corp  HES  is closing its NJ oil refining facility and its U S  terminal network  However  this did not seem to translate into the inflation markets  as it often does   normally  the inflation swaps curve would flatten as the gasoline move has more relevance for a shorter inflation horizon  but today the front of the curve if anything underperformed after carry is taken into consideration  The rise in inflation swap quotes is deeper than this ,2013-01-29,Michael Ashton,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/not-growing-to-the-sky-–-nor-ready-to-fall,-yet-152794",152794
106359,327874,A,Conservative Positions For A Liberal World,opinion,Wow  where do we begin after a hurricane induced hiatus  So much has happened  Since I last wrote  the U S  elections have fallen into the rear view mirror  the Bank of Japan has increased its asset purchases again  Greek inflation has accelerated to 0 9  from 0 3   while Greek Industrial Production contracted for the 49th of the last 53 months  illustrating again how helpful it is to look at the growth rate of a country as a guide to deflationary pressures   and the stock market has moved to 3 month lows  and 10y note yields to 2 month lows  while the dollar has strengthened  By far the largest event of the last couple of weeks  besides the restoration of power to my home  has been the U S  elections  The immediate weakness in equity markets is completely understandable  but for the most part doesn t reflect a vote against the President  Real equity market returns will be weaker over the next couple of years  but that s because current valuation levels are high and future earnings will be lower than they would be under a more capitalist government  I don t think investors are putting prices lower on that theory  indeed  as I wrote just before Sandy I thought that stocks are more likely to go higher than lower in the short term with an Obama victory  But let me define short term  because in that post I completely neglected the very short term effect of the days just after an Obama victory  I think an important part of the selling of equities now is reflecting investor realization of tax gains now  versus in the future when capital gains and income tax rates are likely to be at least somewhat  and potentially significantly  higher  That s not a long term effect  because those investors will also buy companies they perceive to be relative bargains in the case of a profligate spending policy  which is what everyone agrees we are likely to get   although some people think that s a good thing  I suppose your own feeling on that matter likely defines how you voted   So this is mostly a cycling of positions  a re setting of tax basis at a higher level  and shouldn t amount to a major selloff by itself  There still may be some net selling while the twin risks of the  fiscal cliff  and the Greek exit from the Euro remain uncertain and near term  And here is where I am getting somewhat uneasy with my bullish argument  which hinged on the notion that typically myopic investors would prefer a 2013 recession that is shallower  due to heavy government spending  than a deeper one due to a Republican shrinking of government aka  austerity    I think there are some bigger issues that are hard to look past right now  and they are related to those twin risks I just mentioned  One of those issues concerns the  fiscal cliff   Perhaps I am cynical  but I have long expected the issue to be averted at the eleventh hour  as usual   for example  see the annual  doc fix  for Medicare   But it now occurs to me that the Republicans have absolutely no reason to compromise on their demand for no increase in taxes  Under a President Romney  the Republicans would have been able to leverage their control  make a few key concessions  and avert much of the damage  Under a President Obama  forcing the cliff to take effect is now the only way that the minority party of smaller government can force any austerity over the next few years  Especially if you believe   and I think it s worth considering   that the failure of the Republicans to unseat a President with sub 50  approval ratings and an  8  Unemployment Rate indicates that the argument is lost that we should take short term pain in order to restore fiscal sanity  this represents the best remaining hope for fiscal sanity  The only way I can see the Republicans giving in on the  fiscal cliff  is if  a  they sell their principles  which is always a possibility  or  b  the Democrats promise considerable compensation in terms of future legislation  I can t imagine what that would be  So  in short  I think the odds that there will be a resolution of the  fiscal cliff  have dropped considerably  The second issue is the one of Greek exit from the Euro  I think I have been very consistent on this issue  I do not believe there is a viable future path in which Greece remains in the Euro  Whether the exit is clean and negotiated or sudden and traumatic or painful and drawn out is the issue  This has been clear for months  even years  now  Yet  for a couple of months there has been relative quiet on this front  until the last week or two as the Eurogroup considers the distribution of the next aid tranche to Greece  We ve also stopped hearing much about Spain  Italy  and Portugal although the Spanish 10 year bond yield is creeping back to 6  again  5 88  today   I don t think this silence heading into the U S  elections was accidental  The relationship between the U S  President and the citizens of the world ex U S  is a very strong one  and I have no doubt that the politicians in Europe recognized that their chances of getting help from U S  taxpayers would be much better after November 6th if Obama won re election  Now that he has  the European issue must be confronted as world growth is weakening again  I have no idea whether the U S  will try and contribute to a solution  which would ensure a painful and drawn out resolution in which Greece would still  at the end  leave the Euro   but in any event this set of events is back in motion  and is not positive in the short term for world growth or equity markets  So in short  while I still think we can trust the myopia of equity investors to push markets higher over the next couple of months  I am less sure of that than I was  The election was a

106361,327876,A,Oil Forecast Unrealistic  Misses Diminishing Returns,opinion,The International Energy Agency  IEA  provides unrealistically high oil forecasts in its new   WEO   It claims  among other things  that the United States will become the world s largest oil producer by 2020  and will become a net oil exporter by 2030 Figure 1  Author s interpretation of IEA Forecast of Future U S  Oil Production under  New Policies  Scenario  based on information provided in IEA s 2012 World Energy Outlook Figure 1 shows that this increase comes solely from the expected rise in tight oil production and natural gas liquids  The idea that we will become an exporter in later years occurs despite falling production  because  demand  will drop so much The oil price forecasts underlying these and other forecasts in the report are approximately as follows Figure 2  Author s interpretation of future average world oil prices  as provided by IEA in their 2012 WEO report   Forecast provided by IEA is more  concave downward    Historical amounts are based on BP 2012 Statistical Review of World Energy amounts  One reason the WEO 2012 estimates are unreasonable is because the oil prices shown are unrealistically low relative to the production amounts forecast in the report  This seems to occur because the IEA misses the problem of diminishing returns  As the easy to produce oil becomes more depleted  and we need to move to more difficult reservoirs  the cost of extraction increases  In fact  there is evidence that the  tight  oil referenced in Exhibit 1 is already starting to reach production limits  at current prices  The only way these production limits might be reasonably overcome is with higher oil prices much higher than the IEA is assuming in any of its forecasts  Higher oil prices cause a huge problem because of their impact on the world economy  The IEA in fact mentions that current high oil prices are already acting as a brake on the global economy in its first slide for the press  Higher oil prices also mean that investment costs required to reach target production levels will be even higher than forecast by the IEA  adding another impediment to reaching its forecast production levels  If higher prices put the economies of oil importing nations into recession  then oil prices will drop lower  reducing the incentive to invest in new oil production infrastructure  In fact  we could find ourselves reaching  peak oil  because of an economic dilemma  while there seems to be plenty of oil available  the cost of extracting it may be reaching a point where it is more expensive than consumers can afford  As a result  some oil that we know about  and have been counting as reserves  will have to be left in the ground  The IMF has recently done modeling that is relevant to this issue in a working paper called   This analysis may provide some insight as to what the real situation will be  The Problem Of Diminishing ReturnsOne issue that the IEA has not properly modeled is the issue of declining resource quality  leading to diminishing returns and a rising  real   inflation adjusted  cost of production  This situation is often described as reflecting declining Energy Return on Energy Invested  EROEI   The reason diminishing returns are a problem is because when a producer decides to extract oil  or gas or coal  the producer looks for the cheapest  easiest to extract  resource first  It is only when this resource is mostly depleted that the producer will seek locations where more expensive  harder to extract resource is available  Thus  over time  the inflation adjusted cost of extracting a resource tends to increase  Figure 3  Author s illustration of impacts of declining resource quality In terms of the triangle shown  producers tend to start at the top  with the  best  of the resource  and work their way toward the bottom  One result of this approach is that the cost per unit of production tends to rise  even as there are technology advances and efficiency gains  because the quality of the resource is declining Reserves tend to increase over time with this approach  because as producers work their way down the triangle in the diagram  they always see an increasing quantity of lower quality resources  The new reserves are increasingly expensive to extract  in inflation adjusted terms  There is no flashing light that says   Above this price  customers won t be able to afford to purchase this resource any more   though  As a result  the increasingly low quality reserves get added to reported amounts  even though in some cases  the cost of products made with these reserves  say gasoline or diesel  will send economies into recession It should be noted that the issue of diminishing returns exists for almost any kind of resource  It exists for uranium extraction  since there is always more available  just harder to reach  or in lower concentration  Diminishing returns exists for gold  copper  and for nearly any other kind of metal  This means we often need more oil for metal extraction and processing  as we dig deeper or find ore that is mixed with a higher proportion of waste product The problem of diminishing returns also seems to hold for renewables  The first biofuel developed was ethanol from corn  since the process of making alcohol from corn has been known for ages  Newer approaches  such as ethanol from biomass and biofuel from algae  tend to be much more expensive  As a result  when we add new biofuel production  it is likely to be more expensive  and thus harder for the customer to afford  If we want it  we will need increasingly high subsidies Wind energy is also subject to diminishing returns  Onshore wind was developed first  and it is far less expensive than offshore wind  which was developed later  Early units of wind added to an electric grid do not disturb the electric grid to too great an extent  Later units of wind energy add increasingly large costs  long distance transmission lines  electrical storage  and other balancing something that is generally overlooked in making early cost analyses Diminishing returns seem even to happen for energy efficiency  We have been working on energy efficiency a very long time  We have a tendency to pick the low hanging fruit first  Later expenditure for efficiency may be less cost effective Why Light Tight Oil Won t Increase As In Figure 1Tight oil  also referred to as  shale oil   is supposed to be the United States  oil savior  if we believe the IEA  The Bakken and Eagle Ford plays are the best known examples  Rune Likvern of The Oil Drum has shown that drilling wells in the Bakken already seems to be reaching diminishing returns  The choicest locations appear to have been drilled first  and the locations being drilled now give poorer yields  He has also shown that the average well in the Bakken now requires a price of  80 to  90 barrel  which is close to the recent selling price  If increased production is desired  the price of oil will need to start increasing  and keep increasing  to provide the incentive needed to drill wells in less choice location  There are other issues as well  If there is a need to drill an increasing number of wells just to stay even  or an even larger number  to increase the amount of oil produced  we start to reach limits on many kinds  number of rigs available  number of workers available  miles driven for water to be used for fracking  Perhaps the issue that will limit production first  though  is limits on debt available to producers  Rune Likvern has also shown that cash flows from tight oil extraction tend to run  in the red   so an increasing amount of debt financing is needed as operations ramp up  At some point  companies hit their credit limit and have to stop adding new wells until cash flow catches up  Evidence Regarding Rate Of Growth Of Oil Extraction CostsBernstein Research  information showing that the marginal cost of oil production was  92 barrel in 2011 for non OPEC  non Former Soviet Union oil producers at the 90th percentile of production  This cost is increasing at 14  per year  or about 12  a year in inflation adjusted terms   Even at the median marginal cost level  costs appear to be increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 9   or about 7  in inflation adjusted terms   See also this  If we take the  92 barrel cost in 2011 at the 90th percentile of production and increase it by 7  a year  arguably we should be using 12  per year   the real cost will be  169 barrel in 2020  and  467 a barrel in 2035  These are far in excess of the IEA oil price estimates shown on Figure 2  There is no reason to believe that Bakken and other tight oil production costs would be substantially cheaper  Other Issues That Appear Not to be Handled Well by IEA WEO 2012 There are three other issues that the IEA has not handled well  in my opinion  1  Rising Real Need For Fuels Of Some SortWEO 2012 shows falling  demand  for fuel  Demand  as economists define demand  has to do with how much customers can afford  It is quite possible that demand will fall because people can t afford the fuel  It seems to me would be better to start by analyzing how the real need for fuels is changing  Once this is determined  adjustments can be made to reflect other ways the same benefits can be provided  assuming this is possible  Regarding the real need for fuel  if we look at species that are in some ways similar to humans  such as chimpanzees and gorillas  we find that these animals have no need for fuels  because they live in the way that they are biologically adapted  There are only a relatively small number of them  less than 1 000 000 per species  living in territory which is restricted to their biological adaptation  They do not need their food cooked  or spears or other tools to keep away predators  or shelter from the elements  Humans don t live in the way that we are biologically adapted  Because there are so many of us  we need to grow our own food  and gather water from natural sources  Because we do not have big heavy jaws because there is little easy to chew food available  we need to cook much of our food  Because we live in diverse areas of the world  we need shelter and adaptive clothing  As humans move to cities  we have even greater needs  We need antibiotics and immunizations to prevent epidemics  We need fuel for commuting  unless we sleep on the floor of the factory where we work  We need fossil fuel for cooking  because traditional fuels such as dung or twigs are not available in sufficient quantities in urban areas  Another need for fuel  besides directly responding to human needs  is to offset the continued degradation  entropy  of built infrastructure  As the number of humans expands  so do the miles of roads  the number of bridges  the miles of pipelines  the number of homes and schools  and many other kinds infrastructure  All of this infrastructure wears out  Roads need to be repaired almost every year  especially in cold climates  Electrical transmission lines need to be put back in place after every major storm  Population is also  of course  rising  When we put these issues together  rising fuel need with urbanization  rising population  and increasing entropy   it is clear that the services humans need from fuels will continue to rise  whether or not  demand  as economists measure it appears to rise  Most of these fuel services will need to come from fossil fuels  rather than renewables  for two reasons   1  This is the way our infrastructure now is built  and it is expensive and time consuming to change it   2  Biological sources are quite limited compared to the needs of 7 billion humans  According to Chew in The Recurring Dark Ages  deforestation started to occur in multiple locations 6 000 years ago  when the world population was about 20 million people  2  Substitution For OilThe IEA seems to err in the direction of assuming that substitution can be made more quickly than it really can be  In general  whenever substitution is done  new devices need to be created that use the new fuel  or new plants need to be developed that transform one type of fuel to another type of fuel  Doing either of these things will temporarily add to demand for fossil fuels  There is also a cost involved  Only the heavier portion of natural gas liquids can be added directly to gasoline supply  Most natural gas liquids are used for other purposes  such as making plastics  or propane for home heating  or making liquid petroleum gas  LPG   LPG is used for cooking in some parts of the world and for operating vehicles that have been designed to use it  The IEA seems to assume that efficiency gain can have a big impact on the need for oil  The issue it seems to lose sight of is that efficiency gains are a two edged sword  When a device is made more efficient  the usual effect is that it can be operated more cheaply  This meansthat more people can afford it  and demand may increase  In the early days  electricity was very expensive  As its cost came down with efficiency gains  its use went up dramatically  Putting All Of These Issues TogetherIt is very clear to me that the IEA oil estimates way too high  unless prices are much higher  Of course  prices can t really be much higher  or the economy will go into recession  As a result  production both for the U S  and the rest of the world is likely to be much lower than forecast by the IEA  It would be useful to have a better estimate of exactly where the world is headed  One way this might be done is by adapting the indications of a new IMF working paper called   The working paper considers some unknown time  between now and 2020  when the rate of increase in oil supply is assumed to decrease by 1   While it is not stated in the report  it appears to me that this is similar to what actually happened about 2005  when the rate of oil production increase dropped from 1 3   annual increase to 0 1   a 1 2  decrease   Figure 4  below   Figure 4  World crude oil production  including condensate  based primarily on U S  Energy Information Administration data  with trend lines fitted by the author I have a few observations regarding such an adaption  a  The model could be adjusted to consider the fact that a drop in the trend rate of about 1 2  actually took place in 2005  rather than simply assuming that a 1  decrease will happen at some unspecified point in the future  It appears to me that shift in the oil extraction trend line underlies many of the world s problems in the last several years  b  The treatment in the model of diminishing returns should be adjusted  It is my understanding that this is currently handled assuming a 2  annual increase in real costs of production  The model could be adjusted to reflect a more realistic  higher  annual cost in oil production  and indirectly  required selling price  c  The authors of the IMF report suggest building a more resource based model  and I would agree that this would be helpful  There are many interlinkages that the current model cannot adequately capture  A more resource driven model  especially one that considers balance sheets of world governments  would appear to be better My View Of What is Happening NowAs noted above  world crude oil production seems to have hit a plateau  starting about 2005  This is working its way through the economy with varying effects over time  The major effect at this point of time seems to be on the finances of governments that import oil  although it started earlier  with different aspects more apparent In general  what happens as we reach a situation of diminishing returns  and thus rising real oil prices  seems to be as follows As the price of oil rises  the price of food and commuting tend to rise  Both of these are considered essential by most consumers  so consumers cut back in discretionary spending  to have sufficient funds for the essentials  This leads to layoffs in discretionary industries  such as vacation travel and restaurant eating  The rise in laid off workers leads to an increase in debt defaults  and problems for banks  Housing and commercial real estate prices tend to fall  because of reduced demand  further adding to debt default problems Governments of oil importers get drawn into this in many ways   1  Their revenues are reduced  because they receive less tax revenue from people who are laid off from work and from businesses with fewer sales   2  They are asked to prop up failing banks  and to stimulate the economy   3  They are also asked to pay workers who have been laid off from work  The net of all of this is that the governments of many oil importers find themselves with huge budget deficits  and declining ability to fix these deficits  This pattern is precisely what we are seeing today in many of Eurozone countries  the United States  Japan The statements about rising oil production in the U S  are just a distraction  Diminishing returns mean that U S  oil production will never increase very much  Oil costs will remain high  and this will be the real issue disturbing economies around the world ,2012-11-14,Gail

106363,327878,A,Climate Change  The Standard Fixes Don t Work,opinion,World leaders seem to have their minds made up regarding what will fix world CO2 emissions problems  Their list includes taxes on gasoline consumption  more general carbon taxes  cap and trade programs  increased efficiency in automobiles  greater focus on renewables  and more natural gas usage Unfortunately  we live in a world economy with constrained oil supply  Because of this  the chosen approaches have a tendency to backfire if some countries fail to adopt them  But even if everyone adopted them  it is not at all clear that they would provide the promised benefits Figure 1  Actual world carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels  as shown in BP s 2012 Statistical Review of World Energy  Fitted line is expected trend in emissions  based on actual trend in emissions from 1987 1997  equal to about 1 0  per year  The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997  If emissions had risen at the average rate that they did during the 1987 to 1997 period  about 1  per year   emissions in 2011 would be 18  lower than they actually were  While there were many other things going on at the same time  the much higher rise in emissions in recent years is not an encouraging sign  The standard fixes don t work for several reasons  1  In an oil supply constrained world  if a few countries reduce their oil consumption  the big impact is to leave more oil for the countries that don t  Oil price may drop a tiny amount  but on a world wide basis  pretty much the same amount of oil will be extracted  and nearly all of it will be consumed  2  Unless there is a high tax on imported products made with fossil fuels  the big impact of a carbon tax is to send manufacturing to countries without a carbon tax  such as China and India  These countries are likely to use a far higher proportion of coal in their manufacturing than OECD countries would  and this change will tend to increase world CO2 emissions  Such a change will also tend to raise the standard of living of citizens in the countries adding manufacturing  further raising emissions  This change will also tend to reduce the number of jobs available in OECD countries  3  The only time when increasing natural gas usage will actually reduce carbon dioxide emissions is if it replaces coal consumption  Otherwise it adds to carbon emissions  but at a lower rate than other fossil fuels  relative to the energy provided  4  Substitutes for oil  including renewable fuels  are ways of increasing consumption of coal and natural gas over what they would be in the absence of renewable fuels  because they act as add ons to world oil supply  rather than as true substitutes for oil  Even in cases where they are theoretically more efficient  they still tend to raise carbon emissions in absolute terms  by raising the production of coal and natural gas needed to produce them  It is really unfortunate that the standard fixes work the way they do  because many of the proposed fixes do have good points  For example  if oil supply is limited  available oil can be shared far more equitably if people drive small fuel efficient vehicles  The balance sheet of an oil importing nation looks better if citizens of that nation conserve oil  But we are kidding ourselves if we think these fixes will actually do much to solve the world s CO2 emissions problem  If we really want to reduce world CO2 emissions  we need to look at reducing world population  reducing world trade  and making more  essential  goods and services locally  It is doubtful that many countries will volunteer to use these approaches  however  It seems likely that Nature will ultimately provide its own solution  perhaps working through high oil prices and weaknesses in the world financial system    Elastic Versus Inelastic SupplyIt seems to me that many bad decisions have been made because many economists have missed the point that crude oil supply tends to be very inelastic  while other fuels are fairly elastic  Let me explain    Elastic supply is the usual situation for most goods  Plenty of the product is available  if the price is high enough  If there is a shortage  prices rise  and in not too long a time  the market is well supplied again  If supply is elastic  if you or I use less of it  ultimately less of the product is produced  Coal and natural gas usually are considered to be elastic in their supply  To some extent  they are still  extract it as you need it  products  Supply of natural gas liquids  often grouped with crude oil  but acting more like a gas  so it is less suitable as a transportation fuel  is also fairly elastic  Crude oil is the one product that is in quite short supply  on a world wide basis  Its supply doesn t seem to increase by more than a tiny percentage  no matter how high the price rises  This is a situation of inelastic supply  Figure 2  World crude oil production  including condensate  based primarily on US Energy Information Administration data  with trend lines fitted by the author Even though oil prices have been very high since 2005  shown in Figure 3  below   the amount of crude oil has increased by only 0 1  per year  Figure 2  above   Figure 3  Historical average annual oil prices    Brent  or equivalent  in 2011   from BP s 2012 Statistical Review of World Energy  In the case of oil  both supply and demand are quite inelastic  No matter how high the price  demand for oil doesn t drop back by much  No matter how high the price of oil  world supply doesn t rise very much  either  In a situation of inelastic supply  the usual actions a person might take appear to work when viewed on a local basis  but backfire on a world basis  if not everyone participates  When one country tries to conserve crude oil  whether through a carbon tax  gasoline tax  or higher automobile mileage requirement   it may reduce its own consumption  but there are still plenty of other buyers in the market for the oil that was saved  So the oil gets used by someone else   perhaps at a tiny bit lower price   and world production and supply are virtually unchanged  Thus  a reduction in oil usage by an OECD country can translate to more oil consumption by China or India  and ultimately more development of all types by those countries  Adding Substitutes Adds to Carbon EmissionsIf we don t have enough oil  to a limited extent substitutes are available  Because oil supply is inelastic  though  these substitutes really aren t substitutes for world oil supply  they are  add ons   and this is one source of our problem with increasing emissions  What do we use to make the substitutes  Basically  natural gas and coal  and to a limited extent oil  because we can t avoid using oil   The catch is  that to make the substitutes  we need to burn natural gas and coal more quickly than we would  if we didn t make the oil substitutes  Since the supply of coal and natural gas is elastic  it is possible to pull them out of the ground more quickly  Thus  making the substitutes tends to increase carbon dioxide emissions over what they would have been  if we had never come up with the idea of substitutes  The increased use of coal and natural gas is pretty clear  if a person thinks about coal to liquids or gas to liquids  Here  we need to first build the plants used in production  and then with each barrel of substitute made  we need to use more natural gas or coal  So it is very clear that we are extracting a lot of additional coal and natural gas  to make a relatively smaller amount of oil substitute  There is often a substantial need for water to make the process work as well  adding another stress on the system  But the same issue comes up with biofuels  and with other renewables  These too  are add ons to the world oil supply  not substitutes  While theoretically they might produce energy with less CO2 per unit than fossil fuel systems  in absolute terms they lead to natural gas and coal being pulled out of the ground more quickly  to be used in making fertilizer  electricity  concrete  and other inputs to renewables  Using More Biomass is Not a Fix Either Twenty noted scientist published a paper in the journal Nature in June 2012 called Approaching a State Shift in the Earth s Biosphere  This report indicates that humans have already converted as much as 43  of Earth s land to urban or agricultural uses  In total  20  to 40  of Earth s primary productivity has been taken over by humans  The authors are concerned that we may now be reaching tipping points leading to a state shift  and thus  severe climate change   because of loss of ecosystem services as use of biological products increases  Simulations indicate that this tipping point may occur when as little as 50  of land use is disturbed  This tipping point may be even lower  if world wide synergies take place  Carbon Taxes And CompetitivenessEach country competes with others in the world market place  Adding a carbon tax makes products made by the local company less competitive in the world marketplace  It also signals to potential coal users that the countries adopting the carbon taxes are willing to a leave a greater proportion of world coal exports to those who are not adopting the tax  thus helping to keep the cost of imported coal down  Asian countries already have a competitive edge over OECD countries in terms of lower wages and lower fuel costs  because of their heavy coal mix   when it comes to manufacturing  Adding a carbon tax tends to add to the Asian competitive edge  This tends to shift production offshore  and with it  jobs   Figure 4  China s energy consumption by source  based on BP s Statistical Review of World Energy data  China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001  Figure 4 shows clearly that its fuel consumption ramped up rapidly thereafter  It seems likely that the number of Chinese manufacturing jobs and spending on Chinese infrastructure increased at the same time  Economists seem to have missed the serious worldwide deterioration in CO2 emissions in recent years by looking primarily at individual country indications  including CO2 emissions per unit of GDP  Unfortunately  this narrow view misses the big picture that total CO2 emissions are rising  and that CO2 emissions relative to world GDP have stopped falling   See my posts   See also my Figure 1 at the top of the post   The Employment Connection I have shown that in the US there is a close correlation between energy consumption and number of jobs   For more information  including a look at older periods  see my post     Figure 5  Employment is the total number employed at non farm labor as reported by the US Census Bureau  Energy consumption is the total amount of energy of all types consumed  oil  coal  natural gas  nuclear  wind  etc    in British Thermal Units  Btu   as reported by the US Energy Information Administration  There are several reasons why a connection between energy consumption and the number of jobs is to be expected   1  The job itself in almost every situation requires energy  even if it is only electricity to operate computers  and fuel to heat and light buildings   2  Equally importantly  the salaries that employees earn allow them to buy goods that require the use of energy  such as a car or house    Energy demand  is what people can afford  jobs allow  demand  to rise    3  The lowest salaried people can be expected to spend the highest proportion of their salaries on energy related services  such as food  oil for commuting   The more wealthy spend their money on high priced goods and services  such as financial planning and designer clothing  that require much less energy per dollar of expenditure  The thing I find concerning is the close timing between the ramp up of Asian coal use and thus jobs using coal  and the drop off of US employment as a percentage of US population  as illustrated in Figure 6 below  Arguably  the ramp up in world trade is just as important  but some aspects of programs that are intended to save CO2 emissions also seem to encourage world trade   Figure 6  US Number Employed   Population  where US Number Employed is Total Non Farm Workers from Current Employment Statistics of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Population is US Resident Population from the US Census  2012 is partial year estimate  Of course  the US did not sign the Kyoto Protocol or enact a carbon tax  and it is its jobs that I show falling as a percentage of population  It is more that the CO2 solutions act as yet another way to encourage more international trade  and with it more  growth   and more CO2  Nature s Solution  It is not clear to me that any solution to rising CO2 emissions is available  beyond what Nature provides  One issue is that it is necessary to leave carbon in the ground for all time  not just to temporarily slow the rate of extraction  if the buildup of CO2 is to be stopped  I don t see that there is any way that we can impose our will on people living 10 or 50 years from now  The Maximum Power Principle of H  T  Odum would seem to indicate that any species will make use of whatever energy sources are available to them  to the extent that it can  Even if we temporarily defeat this tendency with respect to human s use of fossil fuels  I don t see any way that we can defeat this tendency for the long term  Nature provides that finite systems  such as the Earth  will cycle to new states of equilibrium over time  as conditions change  While we would like to defeat Earth s tendency in this regard  it is not at all clear that we can  Part of this cycling to a new state is likely to be a change in climate  This is state change reference in Nature article earlier  A state change is a cause for concern to humans  but not necessarily to the Earth itself  The Earth has moved from state to state many times in the last 4 billion years  and will continue to do so in the future  It seems likely that when a state change occurs  different species that can make use of higher CO2 levels will become dominant  rather than humans  A financial collapse related to high oil price may be part of Nature s approach to moving to a new state  It could bring about a reduction in world trade and a scale back in CO2 emissions 3 The resulting change could be abrupt  and not to many people s liking  since most will not be prepared for it  Steps That Might Work To Slow CO2 EmissionsIf we want to slow the rate of carbon extraction  it seems to me that we need to take the following steps   1  Reduce the world s population  through one child policies and universal access to family planning services  This step is necessary because rising population adds to demand  If we are to reduce demand  lower population needs to play a role   2  Change our emphasis to producing essential goods locally  rather than outsourcing them to parts of the world that are likely use coal to produce them  This will have a multiple benefits  It will  a  add local jobs  and  b  lead to less worldwide growth in coal usage   c  add protection against the adverse impact of declining world oil supply  if this should happen in the not too distant future  The costs of goods will likely be higher using this approach  leading to less  stuff  per person  but this  too  is part of reaching reduced CO2 emissions  It is hard to see that the steps outlined above would be acceptable to world leaders or to the majority of world population  Thus  I am afraid we will end up falling back on

106366,327881,A,Budget Talks Spark Risk On Rally,opinion,Another strong day for the Euro following last week So a few events today sparked more risk on trading Progress on a fiscal cliff dealJapan may agree to a Yen 10 trillion extra budgetGreece was upgradedBoth parties in America now look like the are progressing toward each other and may get some resolution on a deal  Although as highlighted in earlier commentary the deal looks like it will contain only part of a resolution for the rest to be battled about next year  it does progress the issue along U S  House speaker Boehner sparked the risk on rally with comments on the contingency plan in order to avert the year end tax increases should negotiations break down Greek UpgradeAs far as Greece is concerned  S P upgraded it to B   which surprised a fair few out there  though it s somewhat understandable if you consider that it has an unlimited credit line from the ECB  Still  it feels premature when they still have so many problems to resolve It seems now that the new norm on outlooks is the incredibly short term  which has turned currency markets extraordinarily fickle  It was just a few weeks ago the nerves about Spain s lack of a bailout caused a drop in the Euro  but oh how quickly that was forgotten Issues in Europe still haven t been resolved  as next year s outlook remains bleak with growth forecasts having only recently been revised down  We may get a resolution to the fiscal cliff  although I suspect it will only be a part resolution   but we could easily see some rather poor Q4 earning as well A lot of the action this year has been about buying more time and in that sense has been effective  but without real resolutions on many of these issues  Spain  France  Greece  Japan  UK  the path to recovery is very long That said  in market conditions today  as they have been for much of the year  long term views seemingly count for very little with the market using the latest headline as a catalyst for direction  However  if you stick to the key principles of only trading with clear signals  technicals rule fundamentals but both is better and you stick to your risk reward  feel free to add in  trend is your friend   if in doubt stay away   you will stay profitable in the long  broke higher and hit our initial interim resistance today  The pair continues its impressive rally even with relatively strong head wind  I now look for a test of the 1 3280 level Given the break above the weekly pivot high  bias should now be to the upside  therefore  we can look to buy on retracements and tests of key support levels  previous resistance now turned support  We still look overdone on the 4hr chart and dailies and therefore I would still expect to see some pull back The rally really shows the importance on standing aside and waiting for the right signals Our alternative play is a false break of the pivot high and a retracement  this would be confirmed on a break back below the 1 30   Daily

backs   unusual but not unheard of with fundamental and technical driversSome strong Divergence patterns forming on RSI and Stochastics   high highs in price but low highs in RSI and or Stochastics tends to mean a change of direction or that the rally is losing pace COT is at some significant extremes and if I look at the past history on the Yen it tends to point to a strong move lower in the near termGiven the extended rally and large numbers long from much lower levels we could see some profit taking into year endAll this said  there are some strong drivers in the Yen weakness and it is critical not to fight the over whelming trend  therefore until we get a large reversal signal I sit patiently waiting on the sidelines for the market to show its  Daily  width  500  height  431    USD

106396,327911,A,Who Will Survive The Natural Gas Shakeout ,opinion,With prices on the rise and a cold winter approaching  some gas names have already begun to rally  But Andrew Coleman of Raymond James takes a cautious approach    that s why he looks for oil and gas companies that can survive a tough market  In this exclusive interview with The Energy Report  Coleman shares how to gain exposure to promising shale plays using defensive investing tactics  Read on to learn which companies are measuring up with strong balance sheets  dominant acreage positions and top tier technology The Energy Report  In your last interview  you talked about raising price targets on energy sectors and individual stocks with promising reserves and production growth  Is that still your view  or have circumstances changed Andrew Coleman  What we re more worried about at this point is that the U S  economy has been slower to recover than we expected  Meanwhile  the situation in Europe is getting worse and China s growth is slowing  To help us evaluate oil and gas markets in this context  our team here at Raymond James put together a bottom up supply model looking at the oil shales  which was a follow up to work the team had done on gas shales a couple of years earlier The gas outlook has remained cautious  although not nearly as bearish as it was a couple of years ago  We have  however  become much more nervous on the short term outlook for oil  We have a  65 per barrel  bbl  forecast for West Texas Intermediate  WTI  and an  80 bbl forecast for Brent for 2013  The forward curve on gas is getting better  and certainly 2013 gas is over  4 per thousand cubic feet  mcf  right now  Oil is our big concern and back in June we downgraded virtually every name that we follow in the E P space to the point where we now have no strong buys in our coverage group The uncertainty on the demand side and increased production growth due to the shale drilling technology indicates a significant inventory oversupply by the second quarter of 2013  which should lead to lower oil prices  Although prices have remained relatively robust in the U S   we re waiting to see the supply and demand fundamentals even out before we get more constructive on the space TER  So  you figure that these prices are going to be affected worldwide  even with the difference between WTI and Brent AC  Yes  over time  We re still looking for a  15 differential between Brent and WTI  In North America  there s a lot of supply in just a few basins and transport options are still evolving to get those barrels to the most favorable markets  A reversal at the Seaway pipeline and the approval of Keystone XL would definitely help  The conclusion of the presidential election would remove one more big uncertainly  and the next step would be getting through any transition of power and seeing what happens with the fiscal cliff  Having a few more months of macro data never hurts either TER  Is the current gas supply and price playing any role in this AC  Yes and no  Generally speaking  oil is a transportation fuel  Natural gas is a power generation fuel  Natural gas and coal compete quite hardily  Gas prices have rebounded recently  but there was a tremendous amount of utilities switching from coal to gas  As natural gas goes higher  more plants might switch back to coal  Gas remains cheap relative to oil and my view is that oil is still probably a better medium term commodity to be in  The current headwinds for oil point to it potentially falling by 25   which would be very bearish for oil stocks in the short term The warmer than normal winter last year caused an excess supply of propane  and natural gas   which in turn put pressure on ethane  Average natural gas liquids  NGLs  prices followed gas prices lower  putting pressure on the entire gas value chain  With winter just around the corner  there is some optimism that normal weather will improve both the gas and NGL price outlook  If not  then weakness in oil prices would further hurt gas producers  as liquids revenues comprise up to 50  of total unhedged revenues for even the heaviest gas producers TER  Your downside price for oil is lower than what I ve heard anyone else talk about  What s your upside for the next year or so AC  Longer term  we re looking for  80 bbl WTI  and with a  15 differential for Brent  so we re looking at  95 bbl  The current large crude stocks and diminishing storage for all that crude  along with continued production growth  mean that pricing could fall in the early part of 2013  We think the price will average  65 bbl next year  based on our math  which suggests  65 bbl is the price at which most U S  oil drilling stops  Remember  in the fourth quarter of 2008  WTI averaged around  60 bbl followed by  40 bbl in the first quarter of 2009 before averaging  62 bbl for the year  We think that WTI may bottom at  60 bbl and then start rebounding back to  80 bbl by 2014 TER  That will make for a lot of happy drivers  but isn t it going to change the planning for companies in the production business AC  We ve continued to hear expectations of service caused cost deflation from exploration and production  E P  companies  A couple of years ago  everybody needed frack crews  frack sands  rigs  drill pipe and lots of other service components  Now with most companies not investing in any dry gas production and with oil price uncertainty and additional services capacity being brought to the market  we see an opportunity for service costs to come down a little  which would be a positive for the E P guys TER  What factors are you considering most important in deciding which stocks look like the best buys at this point in time AC  We definitely try to do a lot of work at the beginning when we select companies for coverage  Between nine analysts and fourteen associates  our energy team covers around 150 energy stocks  On the E P side  we start by looking at where the most activity currently occurs and where we think that activity will be in a couple of years  We also look at the major players  like Anadarko Petroleum Corp   APC   Devon Energy Corp   DVN  and Chesapeake Energy Corp   CHK   and try to find nimble small or mid capitalization peers positioned to succeed in those same areas Ultimately  we want to follow high quality management teams because economic conditions continually change  If a management team can stay ahead of those tides  then shareholders benefit from growth  an improving asset mix and returns TER  Maybe we can look back on some of these companies that you talked about last year that you still cover and like  and you can bring us up to date on what s happened with them AC  Of the 21 stocks that I follow there are eight that I have an Outperform rating on  Because of our oil price call  we do not have any Strong Buys  My top three picks would be Continental Resources Inc   CLR   Energy XXI  EXXI  and EOG Resources Inc   EOG  followed by QEP Resources Inc   QEP   Bonanza Creek Energy Inc   BCEI   Denbury Resources Inc   DNR   Devon Energy Corp  and Anadarko Petroleum When I look at companies  what I consider first is the commodity backdrop  which is currently cautious  I tend to pick names that have better balance sheets when we don t know about the direction of the commodity or we think it s down  All three of my top picks have excellent balance sheets  EOG s debt to EBITDA is less than one times  Continental Resources is around 1  times and Energy XXI is around one times  They re some of the best levered names in the group in terms of liquidity and their ability to take on debt  should their revenues fall because of quickly softening oil prices Continental Resources is the biggest landowner in the Bakken and at its analyst meeting last week  management highlighted additional inventory potential there Secondarily  I m looking for companies that have dominant acreage positions or top tier technology in what they do  Energy XXI is one of the highest oil weighted players on the shelf in the Gulf of Mexico  This company has been a strategic acquirer of assets  It purchased about a billion dollars of assets from Exxon about a year and a half ago  which really expanded its footprint  At the time of that deal  it operated one of the top thirteen biggest fields ever discovered on the shelf  After the Exxon deal  it now operates six  of the twelve largest oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico  and has a working interest on the seventh  So it s the third biggest player in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and is 70  oil  Continental is 80  oil EOG is a gas story and one of the largest names I follow  It s been hugely successful in developing its Eagle Ford shale acreage and getting oil and liquids throughout that field  It s become a great stock to hold in an uncertain environment  Of the eight names that I follow  those three are the most interesting to me  given our commodity outlook  They have dominant acreage footprints  excellent execution and great balance sheets to withstand any price softness that could come down the short term pike TER  They re more defensive stocks than they are aggressive buys  Is that right AC  Yes  When we look at our coverage in general  we don t have any Strong Buys  We define strong buys at Raymond James as outperforming the market over both a six and twelve month basis  The Outperform rating is what we think will outperform the market over a twelve month basis TER  How about some small  or micro cap companies  I was looking at your coverage list and there are some that are fairly low priced compared to a lot of the others that are in the  50 to  100 share range  Do any look interesting AC  Bonanza Creek Energy Inc  is one I would point out  It went public last year and is a Niobrara oil shale producer  The Niobrara is outside of Denver  Colorado  Anadarko Petroleum has a huge footprint in the Niobrara  To incentivize the construction of the transcontinental railroad  the government granted right of way access to the railroads and Union Pacific  which ultimately became Anadarko  and the company now owns that acreage in what has turned out to be the heart of the play at the Wattenberg field Bonanza Creek has 30 000 net acres adjacent to some of Anadarko s lands in the core of the Niobrara  called the Wattenberg field  This is a company that has a great balance sheet with a one time debt to EBITDA while it s ramping up its drilling program  It s basically following on what Anadarko or Noble Energy Inc   NBL  will do    those companies are the two biggest landholders in the Wattenberg  Bonanza is hoping to prove up its Niobrara oil shale acreage and almost double production this year  to almost 10 000 barrels per day  bpd   up from nearly 6 000 bpd at the start of the year Shares at the time of the deal fell to  12 as this was IPOed in December 2011  which was a very difficult market at the time  It has now rebounded into the low  20 range  From my conservative standpoint  it s worth between  25 40 share  The large range depends on whether you re evaluating the stock on a pre tax or post tax basis and on how much activity you re giving them credit for  We risk the acreage pretty heavily and think that getting into the upper twenties is really what happens when the company executes like its peer group The first hurdle it has to get over is to show investors that it can execute as well as everybody else  Then  the next step is to show that it can find and develop new plays  the Niobrara being one of them  Transitioning into a peer resource E P then drives a lot more value creation  which can get you north of  30 share  I think Bonanza Creek is a small cap name that has the right ingredients to outperform TER  Any other smallcaps worth looking at AC  You can also look at Swift Energy Co   SFY  and PetroQuest Energy Inc   PQ   I rate both as Market Performs PetroQuest is a more gas weighted E P company  It has a discovery well at the La Cantera prospect that adds more drilling inventory  The company also built a nice Mississippi Lime presence in Oklahoma to go along with their Woodford shale acreage in Oklahoma and their East Texas acreage in the Carthage field  It has attractive economics in the Mississippi lime and Woodford resulting from a joint venture with NextEra Swift Energy is a smallcap that has 78 000 net acres in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas  South Louisiana  and 100 000 net acres in the Austin Chalk trend in south central Louisiana  Some of its south central Louisiana acreage could be prospective for the Tuscaloosa Marine shale  so we are watching players like Encana Corp   ECA   Devon  Goodrich Petroleum Corp   GDP   EOG Resources  Anadarko and Halcon Resources Corp   HK   which we do not cover  Swift recently closed its 2012 funding gap  but its higher beta would make it a stock to watch should  a  the pricing environment improve  and  b  the TMS data points surprise to the upside in 2013 TER  What do you see in the near term for the O G sector and how should investors approach this market to take best advantage of what lies ahead AC  Clearly  gas has some sex appeal at the moment  The forward curve has moved up north of  4 mcf and heading into earnings season  we ll be watching to see if these producers are adding price protection  e g   hedges  for 2013   On average  shares of gassy E Ps are up 10  in the past three months  with a name like Southwestern Energy Co   SWN  leading the pack In the short term  some exposure to gas certainly doesn t hurt  If we think oil is going to suffer  perhaps gas can be the beneficiary as we go into the winter heating season  We should get a sense in the next couple of months as to what winter weather will be like and if we can repair the NGL market  which is the next leg of the gas market  Then we ll get some views as to what s going to happen with oil  based on global demand  supply growth and this economic expansion  Heading out of winter  we ll have to see if we have enough data to say that the oil players can hold up  or if it is still time to be cautious  That s why we don t have any Strong Buys and remain defensive  with maybe a little bit of gas exposure  heading through year end  TER  When do you think there might be a turnaround in the whole picture AC  I d still like to see gas production decline  No company that we follow is drilling any dry gas wells but they re still drilling wet gas wells to get the NGLs  and oil players are getting associated gas with their production  A meaningful slowdown in gas production should be positive for prices  Also  if we get increased demand due to colder weather  that would also help to underpin a more positive sentiment on the space From a funding standpoint  credit remains relatively accessible  but we are in the period when company credit facilities are reevaluated  Any pressure here could lead to more producer hedging  but overall we are not overly concerned  Recent high yield deals have been done at rates between 5   large cap companies  and 7 8   smallcaps   The improved sentiment for gas likely points to improved liquidity  While we re worried about the short term  we don t see a huge amount of distress right now TER  We appreciate your thoughts and insight today

106397,327912,A,False Dawn Or False Dusk For Markets ,opinion,Much like watching animals in a zoo  particularly dangerous ones  rangey markets create excitement the closer they get to their boundaries  Last week s excitement in the bull pit has already faded as the beast retreated back into the shadows and yesterday the excitement was in the bear enclosure as equities approach various supports  But TMM are as sanguine as ever towards many of the screams of encouragement As far as earnings seasons go  this one has been somewhat disappointing  While earnings have beaten expectations  they have not done so at historical beat rates  revenues have missed and guidance has been rather downbeat  The question  as always  when interpreting such releases is deciding whether  a  the information is new  and therefore forward looking  and  b  what the implications of that news are  So what do we learn from these reports then  Global growth was pretty weak over the quarter   particularly in China and in Europe  CapEx intentions have fallen in the face of electoral and fiscal cliff associated uncertainty  Well TMM would argue that none of those are particularly ground breaking observations  in the light of the macro data over the summer and the constant barrage of debate around the election and the fiscal cliff  And on the guidance front  it doesn t exactly seem as though corporates know any better than the rest of us  with Caterpillar  CAT   for example  forecasting that their earnings over the next year would be in the range  5  to  5   i e     We ll either make more money    or we ll lose money   Thanks guys  really insightful So in our eyes  while bears are excited to seize on disappointing earnings news  TMM reckon these are all a bit backward looking  And there are several reasons why  First  unlike late 2007 early 2008 when earnings news began to worsen  policymakers are no longer behind the curve   cast your mind back to that period  and it was marked by large intra meeting rate cuts by the Federal Reserve  attempting to catch up with the fast deteriorating economic data  while the ECB and BoE refused to ease policy due to still worrying about inflation risks  This time around  earnings season has come just a few weeks after the most extraordinary central bank easing measures introduced to date  QE Infinity and the ECB s OMT  These have had a dramatic effect in easing financial conditions over the past six weeks  the effects of which will not have fed through to the real economy yet   it s just too early  Markets  as forward discounting machines  are likely to concentrate on future earnings  rather than backward looking ones Second  again   unlike late 2007 early 2008   the economic data has begun to rebound  particularly in the US and Asia  but also in Europe  The bottoming in PMIs  exports in Asia and the reacceleration of China into the New Year are all positive for earnings going forward  Third  it appears to TMM that many are extrapolating the weakness seen in Tech earnings to the broader market  but that masks a rotation that is ongoing and a positive one at that   out of defensives and into cyclicals  See below chart of GS Cyclicals vs  Defensives  Fourth  the weakness in risk has thus far appeared restricted to equities themselves  as cross asset correlation has collapsed  as has that of the index itself  see below chart of implied correlation   Add to that the volatility bleed across the board as central bank liquidity suppresses risk premia  and it is hard to get too excited about a down trade  That said  as per TMM s last post  we do advocate buying cheap tails for protection  Fifth  regarding the election and fiscal cliff debate  TMM are of the mind that this is a two stage wall of worry  Once the election is over  that is one hurdle of uncertainty passed  and markets are likely to squeeze higher  no matter who the winner  And secondly  TMM struggle to think of an  issue  that markets have discussed both so much and so early  than the fiscal cliff  The result of that  in TMM s minds  is that the market already discounts a significant probability of going off the cliff  and that even a going over the cliff for a few days until an agreement is made is unlikely to phase markets much beyond a knee jerk  and certainly not anything like last August s broad de risking  This is as much a fact of investors not exactly holding a huge amount of risk   Finally  while Monday night s late rally was attributed to a spurious article suggesting further FOMC easing  it has been noted by many that there are often mutual fund inflows at the close  And the large nine week stretch of equity outflows finally came to a close last week  So TMM are of the view that real money is likely to be accumulating length into weakness   and the low volume sell off yesterday morning feels to us as though it is merely HF and CTA activity  Absent major macro news  TMM would argue the old adage applied   Don t sell a quiet market   Buy the dip ,2012-10-24,Macro Man,https://www.investing.com/analysis/false-dawn-or-false-dusk-for-markets-140987,140987
106398,327913,A,Two Storms Coming,opinion,Since the financial markets were almost shut yesterday due to  Frankenstorm   and will in fact close early  I am writing this article early on the notion that  a  it will be difficult to write later and  b  there will be little additional news worth writing about Not much paradigm changing economic data has come out recently  Thursday s Durable Good numbers were approximately on target  ex transportation  2 0  versus  0 9  expected  but with a revision to August s figures of  0 5    as were Initial Claims  369k  right in the middle of the range  and Friday s initial release of the Q3 GDP report  2 0  vs 1 8  expected  with Personal Consumption  2 0  vs  2 1  expected   Yesterday s Personal Consumption and Spending reports were as expected  as were all of the price deflators  The Dallas Fed Manufacturing Report was a bit stronger than expected but is merely back in the middle of the 3 year range There is  though  some positive economic news although it will take some time to be realized in the official figures  Gasoline futures recently approached the lows for the year  although in the last few days the approach of Hurricane Sandy and the general tightness in the delivery markets has caused a not negligible rally   and retail gasoline prices which were recently threatening  3 90 are back to  3 54  I wait with bated breath to see whether the people who shriek about the inflationary impact of gasoline rising will shriek with joy now that it s falling   this volatility  folks  is why the Fed focuses on core inflation not because they don t drive   This is an unmitigated positive  if a small one  for the economy  While gasoline prices are still a multiple of where they were at the 2008 lows  they are only 18  above where they were to end 2007  see chart  source Bloomberg  Here is why dozens of chief executives have inserted themselves into the debate over reducing the federal budget deficit  Some say uncertainty over the looming  fiscal cliff  of tax increases and spending cuts already is hurting their business   It s a pause button   Robert Swanson  executive chairman of Linear Technology Corp   told investors Oct  17  after the semiconductor maker reported a 3  drop in fiscal first quarter profit  Chief Financial Officer Paul Coghlan said companies that use Linear s chips are growing more cautious before the election and the Dec  31 deadline It isn t merely the fiscal cliff itself  I ve heard from a number of potential clients  in the financial industry and elsewhere  that there is great uncertainty associated with the results of the election itself  While the  fiscal cliff   a collection of tax increases and spending cuts that automatically kick in at year end if Congress and the President do not agree to an alternative budget  could cause great short term damage to growth in 2013  business owners also believe that for the first time in the last half dozen or so elections the results of the Presidential contest will have a significant effect on the business climate going forward  From a taxation perspective  on the basis of the future of Obamacare  on the degree of regulatory intrusiveness  the candidates seem to differ much more significantly than were McCain v  Obama  Bush v  Kerry  Bush v  Gore  Clinton v  Dole  or Clinton v  GHW Bush  Arguably Dukakis vs  GHW Bush showed a meaningful difference  and certainly Reagan v  Mondale  but it has been a generation since the election was thought to matter very much to business  This year  it certainly does  A storm is coming on November 6th  but like Frankenstorm it will pass But that doesn t mean the election frees the stock market  I believe that a Romney victory  which is the current odds on bet since undecideds typically break heavily for the challenger and he already has a lead overall and is tied or ahead in every important battleground state  would send stocks lower  while an Obama victory would send them higher   in the short term  The reason I believe this is that I think investors will interpret a Romney victory as producing a greater chance of fiscal austerity  relatively  that is   we re not getting any important austerity in this country for a while  and a greater chance of a less accommodative Fed over the next couple of years especially when a President Romney would replace Bernanke  whose term is up in January 2014  with a hawkish Chairman  These things would be more likely to produce a deeper recession in 2013 than we are already likely to get under Obama However  let me be clear  I think the Romney policies are closer to the correct policies  and I am highly confident that the stock market in five years would be significantly higher under Romney s stated policies than under Obama s  But the stock market is full of short term focused investors these days  and the more immediate focus would be on the near term implications of a change from a relatively profligate fiscal and monetary policy  that anaesthetizes near term pain even as our limbs are sawed off  to one that aggressively moves to address the nation s financial future sanely  at a somewhat higher short term cost The data seems to support this  Below is a chart combining the Intrade market for the probability of President Obama s re election  in white  and the S P 500  Source  Bloomberg   showing that this phenomenon has existed for a while  There is some argument that the causality runs the other way   that a lower stock market indicates a slower economic outlook and therefore a lower likelihood of Obama s re election  and I agree there is some circularity there  But I suspect the current consensus view  that a Romney victory is a big win for  risk on  assets  is wrong in the short term Now  I should say that I think Intrade investors are far off on the actual probabilities  but the point is the direction of movement  Also note that because the Intrade market is a binary option that either ends up at 100 or 0  it will naturally gain volatility as the market gets closer to election day  A similar effect will happen in the equity market  but it will not of course be as pronounced   See my note on the subject of option like market behavior here   I expect to get some partisan vitriol on this article  Save it   the power is going to be out  and so your anger will go unrequited   Do you think it was an accident that I wrote this article today    Good luck to all in the hurricane s path  It s going to be a bumpy ride ,2012-10-30,Michael

106410,327925,A,Exploring Relationship  Currency In Circulation  Treasury Gold Holdings ,opinion,Some investors believe that gold is the  real  money  and some believe that is nonsense   Some of those who believe it is real money express that belief in terms of currency debasement through an ever expanding quantity of currency in circulation  Their argument is that the wealth of a nation at any moment is a fixed value  and that by merely printing more fiat currency  paper money declared by government to be legal tender with no asset backing required   the currency is worth less and less and gold worth more and more   Weimar Republic hyperinflation and Zimbabwe hyperinflation being the extremes of that  Historical Narrative Perspective  In 1900 the U S  Dollar became convertible and redeemable into gold for any holder  both citizens and foreign governments  During 1933  the Dollar was made convertible into gold only by foreign governments  not U S  citizens  In 1971  the U S  Dollar was made not convertible into gold by any party  Here is how it is explained by the    March 14  1900   The Gold Standard Act officially placed the United States on the gold standard   H J  Res  192  approved by President Roosevelt on June 5  1933  provided that obligations payable in gold or specific coin or currency are contrary to public policy  and that those obligations could be discharged dollar for dollar in legal tender  After that resolution was adopted  currency of the United States could not be converted into gold by United States citizens  but the Treasury would convert dollars into gold for foreign governments as a means of maintaining stability and confidence in the dollar  Because the dollar was no longer freely convertible  one could consider that the United States was no longer on the gold standard at that time  If  however  one considers the gold standard as a monetary system in which the unit of money is backed by gold even if the monetary unit cannot be converted into gold  one could argue that the United States went off of the gold standard on August 15  1971 when President Nixon announced that the U S  dollar would no longer be convertible into gold in the international markets  The President was able to suspend the ability to convert the dollar into gold because there was no legal requirement that the United States exchange gold for dollars     when the United States stopped selling gold to foreign official holders of dollars at the rate of  35 an ounce in 1971  it brought the gold exchange standard to an end  In 1973  the United States officially ended its adherence to the gold standard  Many other industrialized nations also switched from a system of fixed exchange rates to a system of floating rates  In August 1974  President Ford repealed the prohibition on the public s owning gold or engaging in gold transactions  Today  no country bans private ownership of gold   Prior to 1968  the U S  was committed to maintain 25  gold reserves versus the conversion privileges of the paper currency  There is no such requirement today  Beginning and Ending Data  According to the US Treasury s    the 10 12 2012 US gold hoard is 261 497 506 ounces  According to the   the September 1  2012 quantity of U S  currency in circulation is  1 064 Trillion  The price of gold on September 1 was  1 692  The ratio of currency in circulation per ounce of gold held by the U S  based on this data was  4 079  let s term that the  conversion ratio    We should point out that the European Union has nearly the same conversion ratio  Japan  however  has a much higher conversion ratio  indicating a greater currency debasement on their part than in the U S  and in Europe   For contrast  they reported the a July 199 gold holdings slightly greater than now at 261 615 927 ounces  and a quantity of currency in circulation of  0 488 Trillion  The price of gold back then was  258 per ounce  The conversion ratio then was  1 864  Currency In Circulation Changes  From 1969 through now  the average annual rate of change of currency in circulation was 6 98   Figure 1 shows that data  with more significant variation since about 1990  Figure 2 presents the same data for the shorter period from 2000  since which the average annual currency expansion has been 6 28  Figure 1  Long Term Rate of Change Of USD In Circulation Figure 2  Intermediate Term Rate of Change of USD In CirculationIndexed Currency In Circulation vs  Indexed Gold Price Starting in July 1999  we indexed the amount of currency in circulation and the price of gold to see what that might reveal  The gold price really took off after 2003  which happened to be the bottom in the stock market  Figure 3  Indexed Change in M0  M Zero  vs Indexed Gold PriceM0  M zero  is the letter designation for total currency in circulation Gold Price vs  Conversion Ratio The price of gold and the conversion ratio seem to move in parallel as shown in Figure 4  but by starting at different base levels had quite different growth patterns  as shown in Figure 3  Figure 5 shows the spread between the price of gold and the conversion ratio  Interestingly  the spread has been roughly steady with an average spread of  2 221  The spread went above the average in 2008 when gold declined 30   and above the average when gold surged during the stock market recovery  now is closer to average  If the average persists  the current price of gold might be expected to be about  1 860 Figure 4  Actual Gold Price vs USD Currency Treasury Gold HoldingsFigure 5  Gold Price and Conversion Ratio SpreadAccording to the  gold is real money  advocates  there should be some kind of long term relationship between the price of gold and the conversion ratio   remember  the conversion ratio shows the price of Treasury gold per ounce that under a hypothetical full conversion regime would result in no outstanding fiat currency and no gold in the Treasury    From that perspective  how then could the gold price vary so much versus the conversion ratio from 1999 to now  given there was plenty of time between 1971 and 1999 for the gold market price to adjust to the fiat currency world regime If the real money theory holds water  and it may or may not be adequate as a single variable to explain gold price movement over the long term   the likely explanation would be that ebbing and flowing of investor interest and trust in the stock market and government  and fears of deflation or inflation  and exchange rates the put the Dollar higher and lower at times  all added layers of upward and downward pressure on gold  causing it to fluctuate around a more central value based on the concept of gold being real money that in the end would be based on how much gold was potentially behind it Other Factors Potentially Better Related To Gold Price We think there should be some metric or some set of metrics that can be tracked to help establish when gold is overvalued or undervalued  Fiat currency per ounce of central bank gold is the most logical fist suspect since that is actually the way it was under the legal system as one time in the past There may be others  and we are looking for them  Our prior blog post did an historical chart review of the relationship between the price of gold and several other assets and did not find any essentially better metric  That doesn t make the conversion ratio a good or the best metric  but it doesn t knock it out of consideration either Perhaps there is a polynomial metric that we will find with further research  but pending that we are inclined to think that  all other things being constant  which they seldom are   gold is likely to find a current center around  1 860  advance at least 6  per year as the currency base appears likely to do  and perhaps break with its multi year spread behavior and approach  4 000 per ounce to reach the conversion ratio  Then again it could drop into bear market territory under recession deflation conditions As time goes by and the likely 6  currency expansion continues  the  1 860 center and the  4 000 price potential would probably increase proportionately Gold could  of course go well beyond the currency growth adjusted  4 000  but the rationale would need to be established to understand it or manage around it  e g a collapse in the exchange rate of the Dollar  which is the global price base of gold  or currency printing presses gone crazy  Temporary Gold Price Decline Scenario As we have noted in other posts  there is also a realistic chance of gold at least temporarily declining to something like  1 300 if it goes down 30  from its recent peak  as it did in the 2008 market crash  That possibility arises because  a  gold is in a decline at the moment  and  b  the fiscal cliff has the potential to be market disrupting and deflation fear generating as was the case in 2008 Figure 6  Current Daily Chart For GLD  gold ETF

vicinity of 1 10th the price of gold  The daily fluctuations in the ratio  represent the inefficiencies in the arbitrage process that is intended to keep the price and the NAV close  The gradual decline in the ratio probably represents the drag effect of fund expenses Figure 9  GLD and GOLD Plotted Side by Side The price ratio might give a more severe interpretation of the price relationship

106419,327934,A,Relief On The Way ,opinion,Does Chad  Ochocinco  Johnson deserve another chance  That s a question I saw several times bandied about last night on the NFL Network   It is  after all  kickoff night of the NFL and so you will perhaps forgive the digression   But no one seemed to ask the question that I find much more interesting  and more relevant in other familiar contexts as well  Does any other team deserve to be saddled with Ochocinco for another season  Because really  it isn t just a question of whether he deserves another chance  That would imply there is some objective standard by which his  deservedness  should be measured  It seems to me that this begs the question  Shouldn t the arbiters of whether he deserves another chance be the people who actually have to be saddled with the consequences of giving him another chance  I m just saying  There is a very interesting development in inflation land  Deutsche Bank  which along with Credit Suisse distanced themselves from less innovative firms earlier this year when they issued ETN ETF structures that allow an investor to invest in a long breakeven position    Now  it isn t any mystery that you can create core inflation by taking headline inflation and stripping out energy  and  if you feel like torturing yourself with tiny futures positions  food    for example  I presented a chart of  implied core inflation  in the article linked here   so the DB product doesn t break any new theoretical ground  But it is a huge leap forward in that it allows more market participants to trade in a direct way something that acts like core inflation  Why would an investor care about core inflation  Is it because he  doesn t care about buying gasoline and food   No  an investor may wish to buy a core inflation linked bond for the same reason that a Fed governor wants to focus on core even though all prices matter  core inflation moves around less in the short run  but in the long run core and headline inflation move together  The chart below  Source  Bloomberg  shows the core CPI price index  and the headline CPI price index  normalized so that they were both 100 on December 31  1979  Since then  prices have tripled  whether you are looking at headline or core  The difference in the compounded inflation rate  Core inflation has risen at a 3 471  inflation rate  while headline inflation has grown at 3 415   This is why central bankers want to focus on core   headline provides lots of noise but almost no signal  And it s the same reason that investors should prefer bonds linked to core inflation  you get virtually all of the long term protection against inflation that you do with headline inflation linked bonds  like TIPS   but with much lower short term volatility  Now  Deutsche s index isn t truly core inflation  but a proxy thereof  It appears to be a decent proxy  but it is still a proxy  and we have some more theoretical quantitative critiques that are beyond the scope of this column   And their product is a swap  not a bond  although it would not surprise me to see bonds linked to this index in the very near future   So it isn t perfect   but it is a huge step forward  and Deutsche Bank  and Allan Levin  the guy there who has the vision  deserves praise for actually innovating  Innovation tends to happen on the buy side  and with smaller firms  not with big sell side institutions  and we should cheer it when we see it    Now  back to actual markets  today  the ECB is expected to announce a new program of buying periphery bonds when necessary  Actually  it is a bit more than expectation  since the plan was leaked yesterday  Supposedly  the ECB will announce that they are going to do  unlimited  sterilized bond buying  of securities three years and less in maturity  The euro was somewhat buoyed by this news  The idea is that big bond purchases will bring down sovereign yields  but sterilization of the purchases will mean that it isn t truly monetization and therefore not inflationary  This seems ridiculous to me  I am not surprised at the idea that the ECB would conduct large purchases of bonds that no one else seems to want  they did quite a bit of that with Greece  after all  But I ve lost track   are they still sterilizing the billions in bonds that they ve already bought  as well as the two LTRO operations which they claimed to sterilize  but never explicitly did except through the expedient of paying interest on reserves to sop up the liquidity  How are they going to sterilize more purchases  There are basically three straightforward ways for a central bank to remove liquidity from the market  We used to think that there were only two  because the only ways the central bank ever did it was to  a  conduct large reverse repurchase operations in which the central bank lent bonds and borrowed cash  taking the cash temporarily out of the economy and  b  to sell bonds outright  to make a permanent reduction in reserves  Now we recognize a third option  although we re not sure how efficacious it is   c  raising the interest rate on deposits of excess reserves at the central bank  so as to discourage the multiplication of those reserves  But for the ECB s purchases to be effective in terms of their size  they will be far too large to use reverse repos as a sterilization method  and it doesn t seem to make much sense to be selling bonds when they re buying other bonds  unless they want to try and push up the yields of countries like the Netherlands and Germany  which might not be politically too astute  at the same time that they re lowering the yields of Spain and Portugal  And they just cut the deposit rate to zero in July are they going to raise it again  I can understand the political cleverness of such an announcement  if the ECB makes it  make the bond buys  unlimited  to suggest that they can t be outmuscled  but also sterilized so it s not printing  But these can t both be true   because there is not unlimited capacity for sterilization  That plan can only work if  in fact  the ECB doesn t actually buy many bonds  In the past  they ve tried to trick the market into rallying with  bazooka like  comments so that they didn t actually have to do anything  To date  it has never worked  I doubt this will  either    Back in the U S   the wave of Employment data is about to hit  Later this morning  Initial Claims  Consensus  370k  will be released  about Claims the only thing I want to note is that while it is down considerably from the peak of the most recent recession  it is only slightly below where it was at the peak of the last recession  Over the last 52 weeks  Claims have averaged 381k  in May of 2002 that average reached 419k  Also due out today is the ADP report  Consensus  140k   which is expected to weaken slightly from last month s figure  On Friday  of course  the Payrolls report is expected to show a rise of 127k new jobs with the Unemployment Rate steady at 8 3   Some observers have made a lot of the fact that the Citigroup Economic Surprise index has risen from  65 or so in July to nearly flat now  But this is not a sign of improving economic conditions  it is a sign of improving economic forecasts  Remember that this index doesn t capture absolute levels  but the degree to which economists are missing  The current level is near flat because economists adapted their forecasts to the weak data  not because the data improved to catch up with the over optimistic forecasts  I wouldn t draw much relief from that indicator  Now  with the ECB and the Fed on the calendar over the next week  markets may well get some relief  But the economy  not so much  even if we do deserve it ,2012-09-06,Michael

106423,327938,A,Incredible Inflation Bond Bargain,opinion,The economic data continues to drip weaker  Yesterday s Chicago Fed index was the lowest since 2009  and while the Dallas Fed index rose  it remains negative  These aren t major indicators  but the general tone of data recently has been weak and nothing recently stands out as positive except for Existing Home Sales  which raises other issues as noted last week  A friend in the southwest U S  describes the local housing market in Phoenix as  definitely bubblicious  and passed along   describing how rental properties in Phoenix are seeing aggressive bidding from would be renters  Now  economic activity is also not exactly falling off a cliff  and some Americans insist that the economy is doing just great  these seem to be the Obama voters but I can t tell which way the causation runs   are they Obama voters because they think the economy is doing well  or do they think the economy is doing well because they are Obama voters and that s the story    But to listen to Fed speakers  you would think economic collapse is imminent  Last week   1  advocated keeping monetary policy extraordinarily accommodative until the unemployment rate gets down to 5 5  or until the medium term outlook for inflation rises above 2 25   on core PCE   Yesterday   that he expects the Fed to end asset purchases  before late 2014   which  for those of you scoring at home  would imply the Fed has about a trillion dollars to go  and shouldn t raise rates until mid 2015  I wonder what it is that Fed officials are forced to check at the door  their brains  or their optimism  No wonder that inflation linked bonds are so expensive these days  Which brings me  actually  to the main topic I wanted to discuss today  A reader asked me the other day about   For those of you who aren t familiar with them  I bonds are like regular savings bonds except that they pay a real interest rate  That is  instead of getting a fixed coupon  you get a fixed coupon plus inflation  which is added to the principal and compounded until the bond is redeemed  You can buy them on Treasury Direct and keep them in electronic form  and in fact that s the best way to buy them  You can buy up to  10 000 per Social Security number per year  And that limit turns out to be a good thing  because if it weren t for that limit hedge funds would be going nuts on series I bonds right now  Because the people who created I bonds never contemplated a negative real interest rate  or else thought the marketing angle of selling bonds at a negative real interest rate would be too bad  the fixed part of the I bond coupon is floored at 0   This is significant  since the market rate for a 5 year TIPS bond right now is  1 59   The coupon rate on the I bond is set for the next six months of new sales  the fixed coupon stays the same for the life of any given bond  every May and November  and typically is set very close to the 5 year TIPS rate  see chart below  source Treasury Direct and Bloomberg   Notice  though  that at the far right hand part of the chart the last few I bonds issued have had coupons of 0   since the actual TIPS rate has been considerably below that  And that means that if you are going to buy TIPS  then before you spend a single dollar on the April 2017 TIPS you should buy your full  10 000 limit on I bonds  because you save 1 59  compounded for at least 5 years  That s an extra 8 2  total return on your money over that period  2  Occasionally  there can be good deals when the TIPS market moves between the setting of a coupon and the next coupon set  When the current series coupon was set at zero  back in May 2012  the advantage was only about 125bps and it s now 159bps  But the current advantage is in good measure structural  rather than due to timing  As a consequence of that structural mistake  not allowing a negative real coupon   combined with the TIPS market s rally since May  the current spread is actually the highest ever seen for the program  see chart below  source Treasury Direct and Bloomberg   I don t regularly recommend specific trade ideas in this  public  space  for a whole host of regulatory reasons  but I can say this  look into series I bonds unless you  a  don t care about inflation   b  feel like you need to take lots more risk   c  feel comfortable that if you wait long enough  you ll get a better investment opportunity in inflation linked bonds  or  d  have so much money that  10 000 per member of your household  per year  simply isn t meaningful And if it s case  d   then please write because I need more friends like you  1  Kocherlakota is described by some as a hawk  but he can most accurately be described as  confused    that the Fed might have to raise interest rates  even if inflation expectations were low  to force them higher  getting the causality exactly backward   2  Note that if you do not intend to hold the I bond for at least 5 years  there is a penalty associated with early redemption   you lose some interest accrual  Even with that  it s not a terrible deal given how cheap these are now  and most investors should have some inflation protection in their portfolios to diversify the risk of all of those investments  equities  nominal bonds  that do poorly in inflationary environments  So  for the buy and hold part of your portfolio  these are terrific ,2012-09-25,Michael Ashton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/incredible-inflation-bond-bargain-137501,137501
106427,327942,A,The NFL Lockout And Monopoly Power,opinion,One might think from some of my writing that I m opposed to unions  In actuality  I think unions are a very complex subject  A labor union is  at its core  a monopoly  Just like corporate monopolies are often undesirable and even abusive toward consumers  labor monopolies can also create very undesirable results  But that doesn t mean that labor unions are always bad  The NFL referee lockout is a classic case of why labor unions are sometimes necessary Labor unions are necessary when there s some economic distortion that weakens the power of workers  Indeed  this was often the case in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th Century  While a lot of historians inaccurately label that era as  laissez faire   in actuality  nothing could be further from the truth The U S  government of that time heavily intervened in the markets in order to protect American exporting companies  But by doing so  it fattened the profits of capitalists in these industries  while weakening the purchasing power of the broader American public via trade protections that kept lower cost goods from elsewhere from entering the U S  The end result  capitalists get richer while workers get poorer  In this context  it made sense to form unions in order to force companies that were protected by the government to pay their fair share to employees The Shift To Free Trade And The Obsolescence Of UnionsFast forward a few decades  and America begins a shift towards free trade  Suddenly  the big premise underlying labor unions is undermined  With free trade  goods become cheaper in the U S  and the average American workers becomes better off as a result  With a competitive market and no state intervention favoring the owners of exporting industries  labor unions become rather unnecessary and even burdensome Since these unions had developed an adversarial culture  they often view the corporations they work for as treasure chests to be raided for maximum gain  And of course  the problem with that is that with free trade and increased competition  these corporations simply could not compete with the rest of the world in this environment  This more than anything explains the death of the American labor union We  of course  still have some labor unions  but very few of them are necessary or useful  Rather  most private sector unions are ancient relics of a protectionist past  Meanwhile  public sector unions are nothing more than an attempt by union leaders to maintain their power base by expanding their operations to a new and completely unnecessary front  Indeed  public sector unions are extremely egregious  because there was never an economic distortion that ever justified their existence to begin with  Back in the 1930 s  nearly all major labor leaders and President Franklin Roosevelt all opposed public sector unions as harmful to the taxpaying public  Interesting how times have changed Due to the changes in trade  coupled with the rise of harmful public sector unions  I would say that I more often than not see unions as a destructive force in American economics and one that we are normally better off without There are exceptions  however  and the NFL referees show this Monopoly vs  MonopolySo why are the NFL referees different than steelworkers or autoworkers  Because the NFL is a monopoly  As I ve said  unions are typically only justified when there is an economic distortion that makes them necessary  The NFL s state protected monopoly is a great example of one such distortion There s been a trend over the past several decades for American corporations to switch over from defined benefit pension plans to defined contribution plans like 401 k s  There s a great reason for this  defined benefit plans are risky for someone  In the case of a private sector union with a defined benefit plan  the underlying company must absorb a significant amount of interest rate and market risk  This risk has often lead to bankruptcy The same is true in the public sector  though  it s slightly different  Public employee unions that have defined benefit plans pass on massive interest rate and market risk to the taxpaying public  And the question becomes  why should the taxpaying public absorb this risk  rather than simply giving public employees 401 k s The NFL  too  is now trying to switch over to 401 k s for their referees  And they are right to do so  The risks and uncertainties associate with defined benefit plans are detrimental to companies  so I think every corporation should switch over The Devil Is Always In The DetailsThe problem isn t the NFL s shift to 401 k s  so much as it s the way they are trying to do this  The NFL has said   we re going to shift you over to 401 k s  but we re not going to compensate you for this  or make any attempts to delay implementation so that it only affects new employees   In essence  they are trying to lower the salaries of the refs in a very stealthy way  And the reason the NFL is doing this is because it s monopoly power  It believes that by virtue of having a monopoly over professional football  it can dictate its own terms It s not as if the NFL is in economic dire straits  It s the wealthiest sports league in America and this clearly seems to be an abuse of monopoly power  Unlike a lot of the private sector companies that have switched over  there appears to be almost no economic reason whatsoever that the NFL must immediately switch over  Indeed  the refs  benefits are probably pretty minor in the grand scheme of things  This is just an ill advised power play by the NFL and it goes to show that how government protection of sports monopolies can often have detrimental results It s very clear from everything that has happened over the past few weeks that NFL referees are a highly skilled bunch  There are only so many people that can do the job that they do  and the replacement refs may take a few years to even become semi competent at what they do  They don t make a ton of money for what they do and the NFL clearly seems to be in the wrong here What Should The NFL Do There are two reasonable solutions to the labor impasse  The first is that the NFL decides that only new referees are switched over to 401 k s  This seems simple enough  and it s unclear why the NFL didn t offer this to begin with  As I said  the salaries of the refs are probably minor enough so that there s no major economic rationale as to why the NFL can t continue to pay the defined benefit plans for the current refs The other solution would be to completely eliminate the defined benefit plans  by offer payoffs for the old plan  or salary increases to compensate  Indeed  the NFL could even offer this as an option  For example  either a ref  a  Makes  50K and gets defined benefit  or b  Makes  54K and gets a 401 k This seems like a very simple solution and the NFL is being hard headed in

106434,327949,A,Registration Deadline For Formerly Exempt CPOs Looms ,opinion,On September 28  the Managed Funds Association and other asset management industry groups  the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  expressing their  serious concerns about the consequences on the impending registration and compliance deadlines  especially with regard to whether foreign exchange products are to be treated as  swaps  under the CFTC s regulatory system  Under the existing definition of swap  these products are included unless the Treasury decides they shouldn t be  The MFA et al have also written  seeking such a determination  but if Treasury doesn t act before October 12  the consequences of other regulations  for which it very much matters what does or doesn t count as a swap  begin to kick in  By Serendipity As it happens  just three days before this letter went out  Patricia Cushing and Tracey Hunt  both of the National Futures Association  offered a regulatory update to the Illinois CPA Society that illuminates its significance  Cushing is the compliance director and Hunt is the associate compliance director at the NFA  They began their presentation by reminding the CPAs that the CFTC rescinded regulation 4 13 a  4  early in 2012  Under that reg  a commodity pool operator had been exempt from the requirement of registration with the CFTC if all the investors in the pool are qualified eligible persons  The great thing about this exemption was that it didn t impose any limits on the number of participants or the amount of futures trading the operator of the pool could conduct  Thus  this was the exemption of choice for hedge fund managers for a long time  A CPO that had claimed this exemption prior to its rescission can continue to rely thereon through the   But of course that clock is ticking down  If you manage such a pool  and if you want to find another exemption under which you can avoid registration  your remaining choices are  4 5  an exemption for certain entities that are otherwise regulated   4 13 a  1   for operators with only one privately operated pol   4 13 a  2   aggregate subscription of  400 000 or less and participants of 15 or less   or 4 13 a  3   trading in only a minimal amount of futures   The de minimis test under  has two parts stated in the alternative  first  the exempt entity s aggregate initial margin premium must not exceed 5 percent of the liquidation value of its pool s portfolio  or  second  the aggregate net notional value of its commodity interest positions must not be more than 100 percent of that liquidation value  More Time That brings us back to the MFA s letter to the CFTC Friday  because under the Dodd Frank Act  swaps have been added to the list of commodity interests  along with futures contracts  options on futures contracts  and options on commodities  The CFTC defined swaps in the relevant sense this July  and it has said that it believes the half year between that definition and the deadline is sufficient time for CPOs to  conduct the necessary calculations  to determine whether they must register or can remain under that threshold  The MFA et al disagree  Their letter to the CFTC says that most market participants thought a Treasury ruling imminent this summer  and implies that the market has been caught rather flat footed by Treasury inaction  If the Treasury doesn t act by October 12  it says  the CFTC should announce that it will not treat FX products as swaps  until the effective date of the Treasury s final determination   and that if it becomes apparent the Treasury won t exclude FX as swaps   then we respectfully request that the CFTC allow for a significant transition period  before it treats them as such  Back to the IlCPA Presentation Cushing and Hunt also discussed changes affecting FCMs  All FCMs now regulated by a U S  prudential regulator  or registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission  were required to must designate a chief compliance officer by October 1  2012  FCMs not regulated by a U S  prudential regulator have until March 29  2012 to comply with the CCO requirement   of some complacent near stranger as a CCO isn t going to work  The designated CCO must either be already a listed current principal of the FCM  or the FCM must file a CFTC Form 8 R and a set of fingerprint cards  In the latter case  too  the designated CCO has to verify the accuracy of the 8 R  Indeed  however complacent a near stranger might have been until approached  the news that he s expected to submit his fingerprints will probably be a good sign he s entering into a serious commitment  Part of that commitment is  the CCO of an FCM will have to prepare the annual report outlined in Regulation 3 3 e   A newly appointed CCO will have to file the first such Annual Report as of the date of the FCM s fiscal year end  electronically through the Winjammer system

106437,327952,A,Who s Winning Big In Lopsided Energy Markets   Kim Pacanovsky,opinion,Industry experts are all over the map on short  and long term projections  but producers are still pumping and there s money to be made in oil and gas  In this exclusive interview with The Energy Report Kim Pacanovsky  managing director of research at MLV   Co   discusses some sweet spots in energy markets  including some companies that are enjoying success at the well  The Energy Report  In the past few weeks  commentators have expressed more varied sentiment on oil markets  with some pretty astute analysts now turning bearish  What do you see on the horizon  Kim Pacanovsky  You re asking the question at the right time because the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  inventories came out today  and they were up 8  million barrels  That was an extremely bearish number  putting oil down over  3 per barrel  bbl   But what oil does in the longer term is a complicated projection  First and foremost   it s the economy  stupid   right  If it continues to weaken  we re going to be using less oil  A few days ago  the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development forecast the G7 to have growth of about 0 3  in the third quarter  That s a pretty weak number  The Japanese have been helping the market by buying a lot of oil to make up for their off line nuclear reactors  but that purchasing may slow down  We have a price range between  90 100 bbl to the end of 2013  I would be reluctant to change that right now  Once the election is over and some of the stimulus measures take effect  I think we ll get back to that higher number  It s politically very bad for Saudi Arabia to see very low oil prices  They have a vested interest in keeping prices where they are  TER  The other side of the coin is natural gas  which has been good for consumers and not so good for producers  What do you think its prospects are in the near term  KP  The rig count has been consistently coming down  with 448 rigs drilling for gas as of last Friday  The EIA noted last week that gas drilling in Pennsylvania has declined sharply in the last few months  yet production is up  That s not surprising because these wells come on at very high rates and it takes time to see a response in the market  The high gas liquids prices early in the year supported active gas drilling in places like the Marcellus  while low gas prices caused a big decline in dry gas Marcellus drilling  But as we see from Lower 48 statistics  there is a time lag between dropping rigs and supply  The Lower 48 gas rig count has been sliding since the high in late 2008  but we are just now seeing U S  marketed production finally leveling out  This year  average injections have been below the five year average for all but three weeks  So we have made a lot of progress in rebalancing the gas markets and I think the lows are behind us even though storage is still above the five year average  TER  Are a lot of these companies surviving on the liquids portion of the gas production  KP  They re absolutely surviving on the liquids  Also  while we are seeing a little bit of weakness in the oil price right now  gas pricing has actually been quite strong compared to where it s been over the past year  We re dancing above the  3 per thousand cubic feet  Mcf  mark again  The other consideration is that the costs are coming down  particularly frack costs  TER  Have we seen the bottom in natural gas  KP  I do think we ve seen the bottom  Right now we re entering the shoulder months  with low gas demand  If we have a colder than normal winter  which is what a lot of the longer term models are predicting  that will be very positive for the gas market  TER  MLV   Co  covers quite a few companies for a smaller firm  How do you choose which companies to include in your coverage universe  KP  We cover companies where we can add value through research  I look to cover companies that have promise  that have very clear catalysts on the horizon  Because we re a small firm  we need to deploy our resources very carefully  We cover about 16 companies in oil and gas  and we have an analyst who covers MLPs  TER  Do you see M A activity on the horizon for a lot of these smaller companies  KP  I think that s the exit strategy for a lot of small companies  Cash flow multiples are one of the valuation metrics we look at very closely  If you look at the industry group of companies under  2 billion   2B   they re trading at 6 5 times cash flow for 2012 and 2 8 times cash flow for 2013  That s a huge difference  Larger companies in the  2 10 billion range are trading at 6 5 times for 2012 and 5 4 times for 2013  The  10B  companies are 6 8 times cash flow for 2012 and 5 7 for 2013  So  if you re one of those big guys and you see some attractive assets that the little guys hold  why wouldn t you look at a company that s being valued under three times its assets and capture your higher multiple by rolling those assets into your company  TER  Let s talk about some of your favorite names  KP  My favorite company is FX Energy Inc   FXEN NASDAQ   which operates almost exclusively in Poland  There are advantages and disadvantages to operating there  The advantages are a very high realized natural gas price  which is not likely to weaken over the foreseeable future because it is tied to oil pricing and is basically set by negotiations with Russia  from which Poland imports over two thirds of its gas  That takes out a lot of the commodity risk you have here in the U S  Poland has low taxation and royalties because it wants to encourage natural gas investment  The negative side involves some difficulties dealing with a state energy company that still has a very  behind the Iron Curtain  way of doing things  There s still a slow moving bureaucracy  Before FX entered the country  the state oil company had a turnaround time of more than seven years between spud and sales  FX s turnaround time now is about two years  and we expect to see improvement as the company starts to gain critical mass in areas where it doesn t need to do as much permitting for infrastructure and it can just permit for interconnects into a main line and get production on more quickly  Because Poland was behind the Iron Curtain for so long  there wasn t a lot of very good geology and best practices in data collection  The actual number of wells drilled was so much lower than in the non Eastern Bloc countries that host the same formation  called the Rotliegend sandstone  which is the primary target of FX Energy in Poland  So  this gave FX an opportunity to bring in the best science and drilling practices  resulting in drilling 8 out of 11 wells successfully  TER  What are you projecting for revenues and earnings  KP  For 2012 we re looking at production of about a little more than 13 million cubic feet per day  MMcf d  growing to 15 MMcf d in 2013  But there s a significant well that s coming on line at the end of 2013  So  the production in the fourth quarter of 2013 should be closer to 19 MMcf d at over  8 per Mcf  There s a lot of pressure on the government to price gas at a market price  not a negotiated price  like it is in the rest of Europe  So  there s more chance of the price going up than down  For next year we re expecting around  43 million   43M  in revenue and  0 08 in earnings and  0 40 in cash flow  TER  And  the stock is now at  KP  The stock has had a little run of late  It s just shy of  8 00 and trading at a fairly rich cash flow multiple  But  I don t think that it should be valued in the way many of our domestic shale players are because of the lag time that it takes to get wells in production  The company is drilling several very high impact conventional prospects this year in stratigraphic traps of this thick sandstone formation and are strictly a conventional explorer  TER  FX is pretty unique in that it s not competing against 20 other companies in the same area  KP  That s true  Just to highlight a couple of things that it s drilling this year  the biggest prospect is called Kutno  which is a 9 trillion cubic foot  Tcf  prospect  That well has been cased to the top of the target formation  called the deep Rotliegend sandstone  There should be results on that well within the next few weeks  It s very high risk and could be dry  But  if it s not dry  it s going to be big for the company  TER  So the stock could have a kick  KP  There could be a very large kick if the results are good  It s also drilling some satellites around another discovery called Lisewo  one of which looks like it s going to be a successful well in nice  gas charged sands  It has several other prospects in that area  which is already substantially derisked with two discoveries  It has also drilled a tight sand gas well in the northern border of its concession  which will soon be fracked  That s about a 150 Bcf prospect  If that s successful  the company would probably sell its interest there  redeploy those funds and focus on the conventional Rotliegend play  Up until last year  FX was drilling one or two wells per year and didn t have the funding and the prospects to drill at its current pace  We predict it could have six or seven well results per year starting in 2013  which is very exciting  TER  What else do you like  KP  I like Magnum Hunter Resources Corp   MHR NYSE MKT   which has been successfully building a base in the Bakken  the Eagle Ford and in Appalachia  What s so impressive about this company is how the oil cut has been growing  which is important because of the weak gas market  Its average oil production in 2011 was about 2 000 barrels a day  bblpd   In 2012  it will average almost 7 000 bblpd  and  we re looking at over 10 000 bblpd in the fourth quarter  TER  Is the market recognizing this huge jump in production  KP  The stock had actually been surprisingly weak  but it s had some strength in the past few weeks  hitting  5 again  I think that there is now some recognition of the growth  It has been outspending its cash flow  which in 2012 should be a little over  120M  growing to over  260M in 2013  This will be a pivotal year for it because  unless it has a huge budget increase  it will  for the first time  be able to spend within its cash flow  TER  So there s some reasonable upside to look forward to  What else do you like that you re currently covering  KP  Evolution Petroleum Corp   EPM NYSE  is a buy rated stock and it s very oily  Evolution is a non operator  It s the only company I cover that is a purely non op company  Most analysts try to stay away from non operators because they re not in control of their own destiny  That s the disadvantage  But Evolution has a very unique situation where it has a royalty interest in the Delhi field  which is operated by Denbury Resources Inc   DNR NYSE   the expert in CO2 floods  Evolution s growth has been due to great success in this tertiary recovery oil field where it has no capex or operating expense on a 7 4  royalty interest  Anybody on earth would love to take that deal  TER  So all it has to do is accounting  KP  That s right  It can back in for about a 24  reversionary interest after payout  which should happen sometime in 2013  Then it ll have its operating expense with respect to that 24  interest  That field is going to produce oil for a very long time and it s basically an annuity for Evolution  The company has also acquired acreage and a 45  share of a joint venture in the Mississippi Lime  where it will be drilling three wells  The first is waiting on completion right now  TER  What are your projections for that one  KP  On the revenue side  we are at just shy of  18M for 2012  going up to  33M  and cash flow is  10M going up to  20 7M  There s no credit in those numbers for anything coming out of the Mississippi  So that would be a nice catalyst for the stock if that works out  TER  What other picks are looking good  KP  GreenHunter Energy Inc   GRH NYSE MKT  is an exciting  early stage company in what I call the cradle to grave water handling business  Unconventional drilling uses a lot of water  which has to be sourced and transported to the well site to frack the well  A lot of that water comes back nearly immediately  and it s contaminated  It then has to be transported to an injection well and either injected into the ground or recycled  But recycling is very expensive  The chairman of Magnum Hunter is also the chairman of GreenHunter  The company looks at the business from the producer point of view  It has six disposal wells on line and about 100 tanks and 30 trucks  But one of the things investors should look for is its new tank design  called the  MAG Tank   Traditional tanks that are used at the well site are small 50 000 gallon steel tanks that have to be transported  necessitating a lot of back and forth trips  and this creates more pollution and noise from trucks   The other alternative is to store fluid in a pit called a frack pond  which creates a whole array of other environmental issues  The industry would like to see the water and fluids become more contained  with a more portable tank that could better fit on well site spaces in constrained locations  GreenHunter decided to redesign a tank  and its design is now being fabricated and should be tested in October  If it passes muster  it s an extremely high margin business  and we think there s great demand for it  That s a catalyst to watch  There s absolutely nothing in our numbers for the tank  but it could be a very substantial boost in 2013 if the design works  TER  What would take the stock from a hold to a buy  in your estimation  KP  There are many potential acquisition targets out there and GreenHunter has a lot of competition in the water handling industry  I would like to see it make some smart acquisitions  It made a few previously and I d like to see that continue  I d like to see some growth in the Bakken  which has the best economics for handling water  And I d like to see the MAG Tank roll out with contracts from producers to purchase the tanks  hopefully by the end of the year  TER  Can you summarize your thinking at this point in regard to the oil and gas markets and where you think people should be looking to hopefully maximize their returns  KP  From a retail investor perspective  I think that companies that have growing crude production with large acreage positions in gas plays are very attractive now because the market is placing little to no value on the gas  and that gas will have great value in the coming years  The fundamentals for gas are changing  Look at a company like Comstock Resources Inc   CRK NYSE  or Goodrich Petroleum Corp   GDP NYSE   which have large positions in the Haynesville shale and transitioned into oil when gas prices weakened  These companies are not getting any credit for that Haynesville acreage  Once you see gas prices turn around  those companies will do quite well  Magnum Hunter also has very large gas exposure through its acreage in Appalachia  Its Bakken and Eagle Ford are pretty much all oil  but Appalachia gives it a big call on gas  Those are the types of companies that investors should look for  TER  And there are a number of those all over the map as far as size and potential  KP  Absolutely  TER  You ve given us a good overall view of the industry and some pretty interesting names to look at  Thanks for joining us today  KP  Thanks for

106440,327955,A,How Energy Shapes The Economy,opinion,In the beginning  the Master Economist created the Economy  He created businesses large and small  consumers  governments with their regulation  and financial institutions of all types  And the Master Economist declared that the economy should grow  And it did grow  but only for a while  Then it stalled  Then He declared that stimulus of various types should fix it  and it did  for a while  Then He declared that if humans would just wait for a while  it would fix itself  but it wouldn t   We all know that the foregoing isn t the real story about the economy  but what is the real story  I think if we dig deeper  we discover that energy plays an all powerful role  just as it does in the natural world in general  Population  How Inadequate Energy Acts as a Limiting Factor  Human population is of course an important part of the economy  If population keeps growing  it helps the economy grow  because more consumers mean more demand  Can human population keep growing Figure 1  World Population Growth  based on   Population growth became much more rapid after fossil fuels began adding to food supply  in the 1800s  Coal enabled much greater use of metal and glass  allowing changes which permitted horses to do more work on farms  and innovations such as electric light bulbs  The answer seems to be no  Here we find that researchers have found an extremely important role for energy  The relationship they have found relates to any species  not just to homo sapiens  Ecologists often talk about the existence of a natural cycle between predators and prey  The predators eat the prey that is available  but in time  the predators drop in number  as less food becomes available  When the population of predators drops  the prey is able to expand its population  In fact  Lotka and Volterra created a model that has been used to model a number of predator prey relationships  including the wolf and moose population on Isle Royal National Park  Lotka   Volterra      Figure 2  Lotka Volterra Predator Prey Model Source   Humans are now the dominant predator species on earth  Our numbers have grown from a relative handful in our earliest days to over 7 billion in 2012  Other species have had to contract in relationship to the advances man has made  The United Nations is now forecasting a world population of over 9 billion in 2050  and over 10 billion in 2100     If this happens  the populations of other species will need to be pushed down to offset the growth in the human species  Eventually  this situation will reach a limit  since we need to eat other species  both plants and animals  The situation is more complicated than Figure 2 suggests  because there are many species involved  and there are many other changes taking place temperature of the sun is gradually changing  the earth s orbit around the sun varies  etc  Also  external energy  including fossil fuels and nuclear  is adding to total energy available to man  But the point remains  we cannot expect population growth to continue indefinitely  The situation in Figure 2 is described as a predator prey situation  but if we analyze the situation  it is really an energy situation as well  because prey is an energy source to the predator  Howard T  Odum has written extensively on this subject  Let me explain his view  The Role of Energy in the Population of Species Energy plays a major role in the balance between predators and prey  Natural systems  such as groups of plants and animals  arrange themselves to get the best possible use of energy resources available  All of us know that if there is a bare spot on our lawn  and enough sunlight and water  it is not long before some kinds of plants come along to fill the gap  Sunlight allows photosynthesis to take place  producing food for plants  If more sunlight is available  more plants will grow  This tends to work with animals as well  Let s take the example of wolves that are predators of moose  mentioned above as being modeled using Lotka Volterra equations   From the point of view of a wolf  a moose is a form of stored energy  since eating it provides calories that provide energy to the wolf  If at some point more moose become available to eat  then more offspring of wolves will be able to survive to adulthood  under survival of the fittest  so the wolf population will increase  As a result  the wolves get as much use as possible of the energy available to them  Howard Odum  in A Prosperous Way Down  credits Lotka with discovering the fundamental energy law that underlies ecological systems  which Odum calls the Maximum Power Concept and rephrases as follows  In the self organization process  systems develop those parts  processes  and relationships that capture the most energy and use it with the best efficiency possible without reducing power  This means that ecosystems  and in fact  other self organizing systems  such as economies   will gradually adapt to get the best use possible of the energy available to them  Ecosystems are  self organizing  in that with the abundance of offspring of animals  and the abundance of seeds of plants  there are always offspring available to move into available niches with excess energy  There are other ways of making use of available energy for example  selection of the fittest can lead to people with the right skin color being adapted to best using the intensity of the suns rays in their part of the globe  Energy Use by Humans Energy plays an important role for each of us as humans  just as it does for other species in ecosystems  The most obvious use for energy is in the food that we eat  Some of the energy we use is embedded energy that is energy from the past that has been used to make something that we use today  The stored energy can be human energy  as in the energy it would take to shear wool from a sheep  make it into yarn  and knit a sweater from it  Stored energy can also be from other sources  For example  it takes a great deal of energy to extract and refine metals  It also takes a great deal of energy to make today s concrete  One type of stored energy comes in the form of education  Odum   Education is available because the student s labor is not needed in the workforce to create the food and other goods that he consumes while being educated  Education requires that teachers attend school themselves for many years  meaning that teachers must somehow be supported by the energy of the rest of society both during their own education and while they are teaching students  Education also involves the concentration of knowledge in the form of books and on the Internet  All of this requires energy  Books require energy to support the people taking time to write the books  to physically make the books  and to transport them to the location where they are read  The Internet requires electrical energy  Even thinking requires energy  The human brain uses a disproportionate share of man s energy  up to 20  of the energy used by humans     The people with the highest education tend to receive higher salaries than others  indicating that this form of embedded energy is highly valued by society  The Role of Energy in Numbers and Types of Businesses and Governments Businesses  governments  and consumers form another self organizing system  not unlike ecological systems  Odum   This system has gradually arisen over many years  and adapts itself as conditions change  The financial system is the part of the self organizing system that keeps track of the energy costs of the system  as well as other costs   and pushes the whole system toward the lowest cost approach to creating goods and services  Businesses tend to succeed or fail in ways that make the most productive use of energy resources  according to the rules set out by the system  Let s consider a small scale example of a potential addition to this self organized system  An entrepreneur decides to plant a field of turnips  In this case  part of the energy for the business comes from the sun  and part of the energy comes from the labor of the entrepreneur  The calories the entrepreneur eats provide energy for his labor  The entrepreneur s education represents another form of stored energy  affecting his success  If the entrepreneur buys fertilizer  it is an energy input as well  since energy was required to make and transport the fertilizer to the location where it is used  Part of the energy used by the entrepreneur may come from mechanical equipment that was made in the past using heat energy  and part from fuels that power that equipment  If purchased energy is scarce  and because of this  high priced  the entrepreneur will have to charge a higher price for turnips he sells in order to cover his costs  The entrepreneur has a much greater chance of success in selling his turnips to customers if energy is low priced rather than high priced because many more customers will be able to afford turnips at  1 00 pound than at  4 00 pound  So it is the price of goods  which is tied to energy costs  that helps determine both which goods are sold and which businesses will succeed  High energy cost tend to lead to business failures  Governments  too  use energy  and fit in with the same self organizing system as businesses  The type of government requiring the least amount of energy is one run by a single person  perhaps a king or dictator  In order to support the king  the economy needs to have enough spare energy  in the form of food  available so that the king or dictator doesn t himself need to work to grow food  It is also helpful if there is excess energy generated by society to provide clothing  a home  heat for the home  and the many other things that the king or dictator expects to own  More complicated governments require more energy  A government of elected officials requires not only the excess energy from society to feed and clothe the elected officials  it also requires the energy to build the buildings where polling takes place  and the energy for officials to travel to the location of the government offices  The offices themselves also require energy  both for their construction and their maintenance  If energy supply is constricted  the price of energy is likely to be higher  and thus the cost of government will be higher  Taxes will need to be raised  If there is a sufficient energy surplus elsewhere to afford these higher taxes  these higher taxes may be acceptable to taxpayers  If not  some government officials may need to be laid off  to balance the  energy  budget  What Happens When Energy is Deficient   Something has to  give   when there is not enough energy  A deficiency in solar energy would likely cause the world to get colder  Crops would fail  prices would rise  and the problem of low solar energy would affect both the natural world  and the economy consisting of businesses  governments  consumers  and financial institutions  The last time this was a major issue was during the Little Ice Age  The biggest impact seems to have been during the 1600s  What happens when energy supply such as wood  coal  oil or natural gas is constrained  Unfortunately  we are getting a chance to find out  There is considerable evidence that oil  our largest and most flexible source of energy  is now encountering supply issues  Oil price in 2012 is more than three times the price it was ten years ago  in inflation adjusted prices  Figure 3  Historical inflation adjusted oil price per barrel   Brent equivalent in 2011    based on amounts shown in BP s 2012 Statistical Review of World Energy It is during the time that prices have been high  indicating short supply  that the world has been suffering from recession  This is precisely the impact one would expect  if energy is closely tied to the economy  Adequate supply would be reflected in low price  When it is not  the economy of countries  especially of oil importers  tends to go into recession  We will discuss this more in future posts Figure 3 shows that there was a previous time  in the 1970s and early 1980s  when oil prices were very high in inflation adjusted terms  This was the time shortly after the United States discovered that its own oil supply was decreasing rapidly  Figure 4   Figure 4  US crude oil production based on data of the   After United States oil production began decreasing in 1970  a huge amount of effort was put into finding more oil supplies  increasing efficiency  and converting oil use to other types of energy use  There was considerable success in these areas  The second  bump  in Figure 4 reflects the addition of oil from Alaska  something that is now in decline also  Oil uses that could be easily switched to another fuel were switched away  For example  where oil had been used to create electricity  new generation using nuclear or coal was built  In the case of oil for home heating  the switch was often made to natural gas  Cars became smaller and more energy efficient during this period  It might be noted that the period of high oil prices in the mid 1970s and early 1980s was also a time of recession  Economist James Hamilton has shown that 10 out of 11 US recessions since World War II were associated with oil price spikes  Hamilton  2011   He has also shown that there appears be a direct connection between the price run up of 2007 08  cutbacks in consumer consumption and spending on purchases of domestic automobiles  and the economic slowdown of 2007   2008  Hamilton  2009   The run up in oil prices in the past few years seems to be related to a combination of  a  world oil supply that is not growing very rapidly  and  b  increasing demand from developing economies  such as China and India  and  c  higher production costs for oil  because much of the inexpensive to extract oil has already been extracted  There is a great deal more that could be said about these issues  but I will save this information for later  I will make a couple of observations  however  1  The United States has not been very successful in increasing its oil production  in spite of improved technology  The right hand side of the graph in Figure 4 is higher than what it would have been because of opening areas to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico  new technology  and enhanced oil recovery methods  But current production still lies far below the 1970 peak of oil production  2  The government has not been forthright in telling us about this problem  Science textbooks don t generally discuss this issue  nor do history books  Some things are embarrassing  This seems to be one of them    Footnote   Power is the rate at which energy is used  For example  a 100 watt light bulb uses more energy per unit of time than a 50 watt bulb  so has more power  Any organism has a rate at which it uses energy  For example  we may eat 2200 calories a day  This quote is just saying that the rate at which organisms use energy is considered in this self organization process ,2012-10-14,Gail

106456,327971,A,Good News About Jobs  Bad News About Jobs  The Reports Disagree,opinion,Summary  Looking at Friday s employment report    we can draw one big conclusion  The economy continues to growth more slowly than we d hope given the massive on going monetary and fiscal stimulus programs  which cannot be continued forever   Oddly enough  this is not obvious to everyone    Contents Good news  Bad news  Take your choice The cumulative change 2012 has been small This is bad news  worse might lie ahead For more information    1  Good news  Bad news  Take your choice Compare the July employment report results  seasonally adjusted  to the 90  confidence level for the monthly employment reports using the two metrics the Bureau of Labor Statistics provides  This month they disagree big time   a  The household survey  CPS  source of the unemployment rate   a loss of 195 000 jobs in July    or   280 000  not a statistically significant change   The population increased by 199 000  the labor force dropped by 150 000 and the number not in the labor force increased by 348 000  The report didn t mention these odd swings   b  The establishment survey of non farm employment  CES   a gain of 163 000 or   100 000  a statistically significant change   Quite an improvement over recent CES monthly changes April   68 000May   87 000June   64 000 2  The cumulative change 2012 has been small The monthly numbers are noisy  More useful are the longer term trends     a   The not seasonally adjusted change over the past 12 months of nonfarm jobs per the establishment survey  1 83 million  1 4    That s faster growth than both population and the labor force  both roughly 1  per year  Due to revisions to the data  year over changes in the household survey are too complex for us to do here     b  Look at the changes this year  the seasonally adjusted change from January to July  in thousands   The two reports have diverged somewhat on the number and per cent change in jobs YTD  with the establishment report showing faster growth than the household report  More important is that both show growth  roughtly steady over the past year  The establishment survey Jan 12 July 12 Change   Change132 461 133 245 784 000 0 6 The household survey provides looks at the civilian non institutionalized population  age 16    3  The details show continued slow growth Many who look at these numbers debate the tiny details  but ignore the large fact  both measures show slow recovery from the depths of the recovery  Very slow recovery  These numbers are less accurate than the headline numbers  The number of long term unemployed continue to shrink  down 16  YoY to a still high 5 2 million The number of discouraged workers  drop outs from the labor force  continues to shrink  down 24  YoY to 852 000 Libertarians rejoice  The number of government employees continues to shrink  down 105 000 YoY  0 5   to 22 million With so many companies closely managing their workers  hours  average weekly hours might no longer tell us much  It s flat YoY at 34 5 The number of full time jobs have risen faster than part time  2 1  vs  1 4   from the Household survey   There are 27 million part time jobs and 116 million full time jobs The alternative measures of unemployment  there is no  right  number  als0 improve  The broadest metric  the U 6  has dropped from 16 3  last July to 15 2  now  non seasonally adjusted   4  The big picture We are applying powerful fiscal and monetary stimulus to get this slow recovery  Near zero interest rates plus borrowing  1 3 trillion dollars over the past 12 months   8 3  of GDP   and we get only a 1 4  increase in jobs  America s economy is among the strongest in the world lately  but only because of our borrowing  Italy s deficit is aprox 2 4  of GDP  cut our deficit by 70  and our economy probably would look like Italy s  So far no evidence of the powerful sustainable recovery the optimists have promised so many times since the trough in Spring 2009  The reason is obvious  the stimulus provided first aid  It stabilized the economy  buying time for measures to rebalance our warped somewhat dysfunctional economy  We wasted that time  as we squandered our government s spending  eg  our infrastructure is still rotting away   We have borrowed  6 trillion since the recession began in December 2007     we cannot keep this up forever  Now for the bad news  the world economy is slowing  The economic and social stress of a slowly growing world might be heavenly compared to what lies ahead if the world slumps again into recession in its weak condition  Really awful would be a US recession  One starting with an 8 3  unemployment rate and an 8   fiscal deficit  But we re probably not in a recession yet  The most reliable real time indicators suggest stablity  or slowing growth  If you watch just one indicator  I recommend the weekly new claims for unemployment  It clearly flagged our descent into the 2008 09

106459,327974,A,The Second Circuit  A Wrestling Ring For Argentina And Creditors ,opinion,One of the classic alpha strategies  the  vulture  or distressed debt strategy  as applied to sovereigns involves an asset manager s willingness to bet that it will eventually recover on non performing instruments  usually bonds  issued by sovereign states  instruments that may unsurprisingly be purchased at a deep discount on face value after the default  On Monday  July 23  the U S  Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard oral arguments on an appeal from the Manhattan district court in litigation that is symptomatic of how such strategies work  It isn t so much betting  after all  as it is wrestling  Or  if you will  a manager s bet on its own ability in the wrestling area of contemporary litigation  Not the London Games  but    NML Capital Ltd  is pursuing a lawsuit against the Republic of Argentina in regard to bonds it issued in the 1990s and on which it defaulted in 2001  On October 20  2010  NML moved to amend its complaint to add a claim for the breach of what is known as the pari passu clause in the issuing documentation  The legal Latin phrase pari passu means literally  on the same footing   and such clauses are meant to protect the creditors bondholders from involuntary subordination to new or existing classes of debt  In 2005  Argentina put forward an exchange offer  allowing holders of the defaulted upon bonds 25 to 29 cents on their dollar  Seventy six percent of the bondholders accepted this deal  The legislature also that year enacted the  Lock Law   which carved this take it or leave it position in stone  prohibiting the government from conducting any sort of in court  out of court  or private settlement with holdouts  But in April 2010  Argentina temporarily suspended the Lock Law  and made a second exchange offer  this time offering to replace certain of the replacement bonds with a face amount equal to 33 7 percent of the defaulted debt  On December 7  2011  the district court in New York  Judge Thomas Griesa  granted partial summary judgment to NML and others with regard to the pari passu claims  holding that they prohibit any arrangement by which the holdout creditors  NML and its co litigants  don t receive payments while other creditors  not their senior  do  On February 23  the district court went further and entered an injunction against such payments  That is what Argentina appealed  and why the matter came before the appeals court in July  The litigation is not just legally but diplomatically sensitive  The U S  has filed an amicus brief that expresses the government s concern that the district court ruling  if upheld  will render it impossible for a variety of countries in distressed circumstances to reschedule their debt  Also  The Clearing House Association has filed   effectively acting on behalf of its member banks  arguing that the pari passu language there follows  standard language included in substantially the same form in numerous credit documents   and contending that a decision upholding Griesa would upset  the long understood meaning of these clauses in the market   Narrow Decision Coming Intriguingly  TCH did not take a position on whether the Lock Law itself violated the pari passu clause  Its concern was that the district court s order didn t rest on the Lock Law  or any other respectably narrow ground  but on a broader view that paying the bondholders who complied with the earlier exchange without also paying the holdouts was in itself a breach  In the wake of the oral arguments   one of JPMorgan s researchers for the Latin America Emerging Markets  offered a commendably clear brief statement about the range of likely results  Werning  on the basis of the gist of the judges  questions  contends that if the higher court upholds the district judge s injunctions it will do so on a narrow basis  what he calls the  least compromising  basis   that is  one that does not necessarily compromise other sovereign s abilities to restructure  will  be one focusing on the lock law  which is a feature of the situation unique to Argentina  Gratuitous Prediction It is not our purpose at AllAboutAlpha to take a side in the underlying argument  In general the vulture funds play a valuable ecological function in world markets  But this hardly implies that they don t also sometimes misread contract language in their own favor   a common enough temptation  I bring up this litigation because  as noted above  it is symptomatic  The strategy of seeking alpha from the distress of certain sovereigns works  when it does  precisely because the logic of mutually independent sovereign nations collides headlong with the logic of the global interlocked marketplace  In that collision resides the continuing irrationality  and the continuing inefficiency  that bright people like the ones involved in NML repeatedly exploit  But here is a gratuitous prediction  The court will take the hint that TCH has offered  It will find  a  that pari passu has a fairly narrow significance as a consequence of long practice  and is not inconsistent with the sort of restructuring Argentina attempted here  but  b  it will either find that the country s on again off again Lock Law has had the effect of involuntary subordination  and uphold the injunctions on that convenient basis  or it will remand the case for further Lock Law specific proceedings

106460,327975,A,The Widget Illusion ,opinion,The Economist runs a discussion forum titled   In this  they recently setup  about  about the future of manufacturing led growth in emerging markets  I  which is reproduced here  The role of manufactures I agree with a small element of Dani Rodrik s argument  but mostly for different reasons  Rodrik says  Except for a handful of small countries that benefited from natural resource bonanzas  all of the successful economies of the last six decades owe their growth to rapid industrialization   I have seen this kind of thinking among some policy makers in India also  that industrialisation is somehow special and good when compared with services  I would question this proposition  that I term  the widget illusion   What matters to a country is having sophisticated firms that have a high marginal product of labour  We should not care whether this happens in services or in manufacturing  If anything  the opportunity to do it is perhaps better in services  India is a good example of a country which embarked on its catchup by connecting into globalisation late  from 1991 onwards  It was probably the last country in the world to shed autarkic policies  This has given a remarkable growth acceleration  Sustained growth of 7 per cent is pretty good by world standards These achievements have been significantly driven by services production in India within global supply chains  whether within production facilities owned by global MNCs who are operating in India  or contracted out by global MNCs to Indian firms   If your null hypothesis was that industrialisation is essential to growth  then you would not have predicted what happened in India  where manufacturing was hobbled by an array of policy mistakes  This illustrates the limitations of manufacturing focused thinking  which seems  in today s world economy where most output is services  Agriculture and manufacturing have wilted away in the consumption of the global representative agent  to succeed in the world economy today requires prime attention upon services  Rodrik says  Consider India  which demonstrates the limitations of relying on services rather than industry in the early stages of development  The country has developed remarkable strengths in IT services  such as software and call centers  But the bulk of the Indian labor force lacks the skills and education to be absorbed into such sectors  In East Asia  unskilled workers were put to work in urban factories  making several times what they earned in the countryside  In India  they remain on the land or move to petty services where their productivity is not much higher   As Rodrik points out  there are important gaps between the skills of the great unwashed masses in India versus China  where elementary technical training reached a larger mass of humans  In addition  China did better on core economic policy choices about  a  Removing protectionism   b  Removing barriers to FDI   c  Building hard infrastructure   d  Labour law and  e  Rationalising taxation  What policy advice would flow from this  India should not have have made these six mistakes in economic policy  low training for the masses  protectionism  barriers to FDI  weak investments into infrastructure  labour law and mistakes in tax policy   At the same time  this does not recommend a bias in favour of manufacturing  It is hard to discern a meaningful choice about emphasising services versus manufacturing in Indian economic policy  Participation in all global production is good  Governments should remove all barriers that inhibit global integration whether in goods or in services   e g  the six mistakes in Indian policy sketched above  A paragraph earlier  Rodrik says  To be sure  some modern service activities are capable of productivity convergence as well  But most high productivity services require a wide array of skills and institutional capabilities that developing economies accumulate only gradually  A poor country can easily compete with Sweden in a wide range of manufactures  but it takes many decades  if not centuries  to catch up with Sweden s institutions   I would point out the contradiction   A poor country can easily compete with Sweden in    manufactures  but earlier it was asserted that the gaps in Indian skills inhibited India s ability to compete with Sweden in manufactures  Doing things that push skills and institutional capabilities I would go further to say that it is good to go after fields which require a wide array of skills and institutional capabilities  I am reminded of Ricardo Hausmann s  Good Cholesterol  argument about financial globalisation as opposed to mere FDI  When a poor country operates in an institutional vacuum  foreign investors are uncomfortable  and the only thing that can happen is FDI  To obtain financial flows  the country has to build institutions  laws  regulators  property rights  and so on  This is a good thing  A country that gets to FDI and gets stuck there should ponder what is going wrong  In similar fashion  no country aspires to have low wage production  every country wants to understand the secret sauce through which a part of the labour force can earn high wages by world standards  As a country rises out of poverty  it is essential to build up skills and institutional capabilities  If policy makers hinder services and or favour manufacturing  there is a greater chance of being stuck in low skills and low institutional capabilities  I am not proposing industrial policy in favour of services  I am only proposing the absence of industrial policy  we should avoid a  widget illusion  and foster more global integration without trying to push towards one industry or another  In India  with 7 per cent growth  GDP doubles every decade  As a thumb rule  I feel that a comprehensive transformation of skills and institutions is required across each doubling of GDP  which is roughly each decade for India  A country that is stuck in low skill manufacturing will find it difficult to achieve the reinvention of this  soft infrastructure  of the mind  If policy makers tried to push a country towards doing low end grunge work  it would be harder to obtain these repeated transformations of institutions and the furniture of the mind  which would lead to growth decelerations  As an example  in the article   John Markoff says  Foxconn has not disclosed how many workers will be displaced or when  But its chairman  Terry Gou  has publicly endorsed a growing use of robots  Speaking of his more than one million employees worldwide  he said in January  according to the official Xinhua news agency   As human beings are also animals  to manage one million animals gives me a headache     The project of economic development requires sophisticated interactions between firms and workers  The laws  human rights and management practices that are required when dealing with humans are different from those required when running a firm with  one million animals   I would hence argue that it is limiting for a country to focus on the political  legal and institutional requirements to produce a la Foxconn It is better to confront the complexities of high skill  high wage production  and to build the environment for this to happen  in the political and legal system  in management practices of firms  and in the power structure embedded in a conversation between two citizens who are co workers within a firm  Services production is a valuable learning ground where the complex management practices that involve high skill humans can be learned  The new world of manufacturing Rodrik correctly points out that manufacturing has become more sophisticated in recent years  This has some fascinating dimensions  The rapid improvements in capabilities and declining costs of  The rise of open source design coupled with 3 d printers  If a 3 d printer in the US fabricates a part close to its usage in an assembly line  while the labour intensive design work   services   that controls the 3 d printer is done in India  does this entail manufacturing or services work in India The world economy is likely to be in a low interest rate environment for a long time  which will encourage capital intensity worldwide  robots  3 d printers   thus blunting the value of low wages Momentous changes are afoot  which challenge our traditional notions of manufacturing versus services  To some extent  we are even seeing   Things that might  go wrong Finally  Rodrik talks about reduced willingness in the West to tolerate unfair tactics like the Chinese exchange rate regime  I would generally consider this to be a good thing  both for developing countries and for the world  In any case   seems to be subsiding  As an example of the disenchantment with exchange rate distortions  From 2004 to 2007  India debated exchange rate rigidity  and  The links between undistorted exchange rates and growth have not been adequately emphasised in the discourse  A developing country builds up inferior skills and institutional capabilities by exporting under a subsidised exchange rate  it is better to force firms to confront the market price and achieve the productivity required to participate in globalisation when facing an undistorted price vector  He worries about a rise in protectionism in the West  but we have to admit that the 2008 2012 experience has been pretty good in this regard  by and large the West has not succumbed into protectionism  In 2008  all of us worried about Smoot Hawley  Today  things seem to be be going well  Conclusion In summary  I would argue that we should avoid a  widget illusion   There is nothing special about manufacturing or industrialisation  as long as people in India get high wage jobs  this is good  Getting there requries deep integration into the world economy  which includes policy battlefronts such as  Openness to the InternetUse of EnglishInbound and outbound FDIThe array of cross border financial services that are the enablers of complex globalised production of both goods and servicesGlobalisation compatible tax policy on both trade and financeThe absence of either protectionism or mercantalismFostering high quality human skills  andInfrastructure To the extent that globalised production of goods and services happens in areas which involve high skills and complex institutional development  this is a bonus  since any high growth country needs a rapid pace of reinvention of laws and institutions  Most of this is the old orthodoxy  Policy makers worldwide are generally focused on these issues  as they should be  From the 1960s onwards  dirigisme has generally subsided  with the twilight of policies like fixed exchange rates  industrial policy  capital controls  protectionism  etc  These key lessons remain intact in the 21st century ,2012-08-21,Ajay

in his morning speech at Jackson Hole   literally kicks the market in the teeth  A second potential cost of additional securities purchases is that substantial further expansions of the balance sheet could reduce public confidence in the Fed s ability to exit smoothly from its accommodative policies at the appropriate time  Even if unjustified  such a reduction in confidence might increase the risk of a costly unanchoring of inflation expectations  leading in turn to financial and economic instability  NDX meets Cycle Top Resistance   As mentioned two weeks ago  NDX met Cycle Top resistance at 2818 71 and has stalled there since August 21  The market has very likely been held aloft by those on Wall Street who wanted to see a positive close for yet another month and possibly the Jackson Hole meeting  Did you know that  In a mere 20 milliseconds  the world s  traders  had managed to read Bernanke s 4549 word script  interpret it  as bearish in this case   which apparently is wrong now   and start to sell down the major equity indices  As   not only was the reaction lightning fast  actually faster than lightning  but it occurred in their newly created  fantaseconds  as trades were

bullish since 2008   Gold broke above its sideways consolidation to complete another zigzag formation  Zigzag patterns do not generally go in a trending direction and are usually associated with retracements  Therefore  we should see this pattern reverse quite hard into a wave  C  decline very soon  The article below adds credence to this view  Gold option traders most Bullish since 2008 lows       A new and important bullish indicator for the gold market is that gold calls are at highs not seen since the October 2008 low as option traders go long gold in the belief that it will go higher  It suggests that option traders believe that U S  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will hint at or announce additional money printing and monetary easing at the Jackson Hole  Wyoming  symposium

take its August 23 high  A slip below mid Cycle support and the 10 week moving average at 91 09 puts crude oil on a sell signal  China considers its 2 year decline   The Shanghai index extended its Master Cycle low until August 30  Thursday was its cycle pivot datewhere it touched its Cycle Bottom support at 2035 57  This is a classic buy signal  even though the Cycle Bands are pointing lower    Quite a number of commentators  particularly those within China  believe that there is no money for the government to spend to offset the current slowdown  Many points to some statistics showing that local governments obviously do not have enough tax revenue to support any large scale investment projects  as we have mentioned some of the figures    not to mention that many local governments have also become quite overstretched after the massive credit expansion post financial crisis  These are not inaccurate  yet we believe that the idea that the Chinese government can actually run out of money is not correct  The idea that a country can possibly run out of the money which they print is absurd  The India Nifty begins a strong decline   The India Nifty closed beneath its 10 week moving average at 5267 76  The sell signal is now activated in CNX Nifty  CNX Nifty is closely aligned with the Liquidity Cycle  which is bearish through early October  The next wave appears to be shaping up as a  3  of III of Cycle wave c  which may be the strongest decline yet  The Bank Index is now rolling over   BKX made a new retracement high in a final panic blow off on August 21  The attempts to reflate the Bank Index to its former highs is failing and may lead to disastrous results  This  kick the can  mentality on Wall Street only makes the inevitable declines worse  The problem with the

106481,327996,A,Important Step Backwards For Pension Reforms In India ,opinion,In the best of times  consumers do badly in personal financial decisions  Here is a stark example of what goes wrong   in the New York Times  about research by     MANY index funds track the Standard   Poor s 500  but they differ from one another in one major respect  their fees  You d think that it would be obvious to investors to pick the fund that charges the least  But you d be wrong    In fact  this truth was anything but obvious to a group of elite students  In an elaborate simulation created by several researchers  many students at  and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania failed to select the lowest cost index fund for their portfolios  even when they were all but spoon fed the right answer    There is a problem of consumer protection here  Financial policy cannot and must not be designed on the premise of caveat emptor  that the individuals making choices are the ones best equipped to look out for themselves  The great bulk of financial regulation is about making the world safer for the individuals making those choices  These problems are present with insurance and mutual funds in India  where sales practices and product features have been a scandal for a long time  until C  B  Bhave s SEBI started trying to do something about it  These problems would be present to an even greater degree in a nationwide pension system  where participation has two features   a  To some extent  it would be involuntary  many people would be pushed into pension system participation without self selecting themselves as is the case with products such as mutual funds  and  b  Whether participants come into a nationwide pension system through voluntary choice or not  they are likely to be less sophisticated than the  elite students  described above  and thus face even more difficult problems of household financial choice  The key insight of what I term the  second generation pension reforms  is that while we must do defined contribution  DC  pension system so as to keep pension planning away from the balance sheet of the State  we should use public policy decisions about design of the pension system in order to further the goals of consumer protection  One big insight in this is on pricing  Households are seldom able to understand the charges of fund managers  The  elite students  that do fine in comparing an iphone versus an Android phone on features and pricing tend to fumble when it comes to financial products  The clean answer to this is  Standardise fund management into a group of index funds  one for equities  one for government bonds  etc  and procure fund managers through an auction  This has two consequences  economies of scale  a small number of very large AUMs  and low prices  since fund managers compete with each other in an auction   This idea is found in the original Project OASIS report which designed the New Pension System  NPS   it   it has been used in other places such as the EPFO  the civil service pension of the US  which is named the Thrift Savings Plan  TSP    etc  For the back story of the NPS  see  and   To use Raju Chitale s phrase  we are using public procurement to overcome the market failures of the fund industry  In this setting  I was disappointed to learn that  that they have given up on this key idea of the NPS    19 1 The PF can fix the Investment Management Fee to be charged to the subscribers subject to a ceiling cap  as may be prescribed by the Authority from time to time    I disagree  This loses one of the essential features of the NPS  This makes the NPS closer to the fund management products run by mutual funds and insurance companies  To this extent  the value added of NPS is contaminated  why construct the NPS if households can do this same thing through mutual funds  It is important to worry about the political economy of finance  The financial industry will generally tend to achieve dominant mind share within regulatory agencies  The great unwashed masses  the greatest beneficiaries of sound economic policy  will never have a voice in the policy discourse  In India  our puzzle is that of avoiding both extremes  of socialist stagnation  to use Arvind Virmani s phrase  at one extreme  and crony capitalism at the other  PFRDA runs the risk of veering towards the latter ,2012-07-13,Ajay Shah,https://www.investing.com/analysis/important-step-backwards-for-pension-reforms-in-india-129498,129498
106482,327997,A,A Look At Forecasts For Peak Oil   And The End Of Civilization,opinion,Summary   A common concern in the comments expresses fear of resource exhaustion  perhaps even leading to collapse of civilization  Here we examine the theory  evaluate the risks  and point to sources of more information    Such     how do you think the US will cope with the return to a preindustrial lifestyle     A more sophisticated version is this excerpt from a  posted in the comments to last week s Question Time    It is a popular idea among degrowth people and some sections of the Green movement and of the far left  My last girlfriend was very much into it  and it definitely is a bad idea   The main reason for it should be obvious to anybody vaguely aware of the coming energy descent  Even its proponents acknowledge that the feasibility of a basic income system is highly dependent upon the continued existence of the industrial civilization      The problem  of course  is that this future of robots automated factories shall never come to pass  It is not automation per se that fueled the industrial revolution and gave our society  but access to fossil energy  Without coal  oil or gas to fuel them and the highly complex social apparatus they need for their manufacture and maintenance  our machines are useless    Perrotin graciously  to the discussion with more details  Excerpt     b   We won t run out of oil any time soon  Discoveries  however  have peaked in 1964 and are declining since  Production is plateauing since 2006 and will begin to decrease in the relatively near future  It certainly won t be a cliff but a long and progressive descent  Alternatives won t be developed  because there is none  The last breakthrough in energy  nuclear energy  happened during the fifties and was an economic failure  The other alternatives are low quality     c   Industrial civilization needs a constant inflow of high grade energy   Without it they will collapse  but that will take some time  We won t have any instant Dark Age    What will happen is that we will be forced to replace high grade fossil fuels by lower grade   alternatives    which will result in cycles of steadily worsening economic crisis with periods of temporary recovery  According to the Meadows report  it should begin during the first decades of the XXIst century     d   Don t expect the Middle Age 2 0 before 2100  at the very earliest  and while we may lose a lot of technology  we won t get back to medieval level    These things we discussed in several posts  even the extreme version  in    This post gives a brief reply to Perrotin s concerns  In brief  we should worry about the consequences of peak fossil fuels  Bad luck  an early peak and fast decline  might mean a long recession or even depression  But we can prepare  and we can cope with the consequences  Preparation now minimizes the pain of the inevitable transition to new energy sources  and reduces the risk of a long and severe transition    Now for a look at the specifics Perrotin raises  focusing only on oil    UPDATE   Perrotin generously replied in the comments  Als0  consider subscribing to the FM website feed and Twitter feed  see the upper right corner      1    Production is plateauing since 2006    Yes  but the reason why is important  Using EIA data  liquid fuels consumption  which include non oil sources  peaked at the start of the great recession  at 87 8 million barrels day in February 2008  as prices spiked     The combination of slower growth offset by OPEC production quotas AND the slow sure response to 5 years of rising prices resulted in demand dropping  The trough in May 2009 was 87 9 mbd   6    A slow acceleration in GDP offset by continued efficiency gains brought demand back up to 2008 in July 2010  and to 89 7 mbd  up 2   in February    Summary  consumption is flattish because of demand  not supply  Otherwise prices would be rising to destroy the excess of demand over supply  as it did in Spring 2008      2    and will begin to decrease in the relatively near future     Perhaps  but such confident predictions are not a good idea  First  there is insufficient publicly available information to forecast peaking with reasonable reliability  Data about the oil fields of many nations with large reserves is either sketchy   old  ie  Iraq  or secret  eg  Russia and most in the Middle East     And there are too many variables  economic growth  expenditures on projects to increase both supply and efficiency  and technology  eg  as fracking disproved the  of an imminent  cliff like  crash in North American natural gas production    Which is why forecasts for peaking range from now through 2020   and beyond    But there are people who know the answer    1 November 2007     3    certainly won t be a cliff but a long and progressive descent     Agreed  Data from fields and regions that peaked suggest a possible long plateau  followed by annual declines of 3   12   depending on a wide range of factors   The worst case  peaking in the next decade  a brief plateau  and double digit decline rates   would be horrific  although not civilization ending     For more about this see    23 April 2008     4    we won t run out of oil any time soon      Agreed  Most forecasts  eg  the large collection used by the IPCC to estimate CO2 emissions  estimate that we ll reach the point at which we ve used 90  of reserves  ie  recoverable using current technology  sometime in the late 21st century    That estimate is speculative for two reasons  First  what s economically recoverable will certainly expand due to new extraction   refining technology  Second  see the next point    For an explanation of why peaking does not mean  running out  see this important post     27 January 2011     5    Alternatives won t be developed  because there is none     Perhaps  but IMO that s stating as a certainty something about which we can only guess  Also  that s a astonishingly confident statement to make about technology over the next 50  years  As you know  the history of such assertions is not pretty  although providing much laughter to later generations     It s especially odd given the range of technologies under development  First  nuclear has great potential   despite its incompetent application so far  For details see the reports listed in the nuclear section on the    Second  there are other sources   such as    that have severe limitations  eg  dirty  expensive  but can help carry us from oil to better sources    Third  there are many promising research programs in fusion  see  for an overview   Such as the Polywell invented by the great late physicist Robert Bussard  for more information see  and    We can only guess which   if any   of these will prove feasible  none will have significant production during the next two decades  But during the mid 21st century during which fossil fuel shortages become serious they have great promise    What are the alternative sources under development   How long might it take until they re in large scale use   For a summary answer see   For details about specific energy sources     Note that all of these require electrification of surface transportation  A National Academy of Sciences study      December 2009  shows that this is feasible  although  like all large scale capital projects  requires one or two decades to do economically  ie  not on a wasteful  panicked crash basis     When should we begin to prepare for peak oil    President Kennedy gave us the answer in his  on 23 March 1962     Knowledge is the great sun of the firmament   said Senator Daniel Webster   Life and power are scattered with all its beams     In its light  we must think and act not only for the moment but for our time  I am reminded of the story of the great French Marshal Lyautey  who once asked his gardener to plant a tree  The gardener objected that the tree was slow growing and would not reach maturity for a hundred years  The Marshal replied   In that case  there is no time to lose  plant it this afternoon     Today a world of knowledge   a world of cooperation   a just and lasting peace   may be years away  But we have no time to lose  Let us plant our trees this afternoon For more information  a   The FM Reference Pages about energy on the right side menu bar    Articles discussing all these issues in detail  with links to authoritative outside sourcesEspecially see the  studies and reports  page  On that is a link to the US Department of Energy s Mitigations report by Robert Hirsch et al  2005   that discusses these things at length  Hirsch is IMO our  America s  greatest living energy export  He saw this crisis coming in 2002  before prices

106485,328000,A,The Euro As The SDR Of Europe ,opinion,The euro is the national currency of a country that does not exist  Though there is a continent of Europe  as there is of America  there has never been a country of the United States of Europe  and there probably never will be  The euro is therefore not a currency as is the American dollar  and yet it is forced to masquerade as one badly by the Maastricht Treaty  in which the countries of Europe abandoned the right to produce their own genuine national currencies  With the volume of the euro being controlled by a supra national authority  the ECB   and member states punished for breaching rules on government spending  the 3  maximum deficit and 60  accumulated deficit rules   the euro is closer in function not to a currency  but to Special Drawing Rights as they were conceived of by Keynes at  In his plan for a post WWII international monetary system  Keynes proposed that common supranational currency be used for international trade  the      while domestic currencies should be used for internal trade  The exchange rates between national currencies and the Bancor were to be fixed  with persistent trade deficit countries being forced to impose austerity and devalue  while persistent surplus countries were taxed Bancors  and required to stimulate their economies to increase imports  Keynes s Plan was scuttled by the USA s insistence on its  first among equals  status after WWII  leading to the crisis that the global economy is in today  The euro  with its half hearted hybrid structure as a currency that is not a currency  and its punitive rules on  government  deficit nations sans stimulatory rules on  government  surplus nations  has turned that crisis into a catastrophe  Keynes would have railed against idea that the Bancor should also be the currency of national commerce as sheer madness  given his prescient position that  above all  let finance be national   Yet that is what the euro attempts to be  Some see the way out of today s catastrophe as creating what does not exist the United States of Europe  But if that were ever a possibility  it is far less one after the damage done by Maastricht  and the Franco German insistence on austerity for the periphery in this crisis  However what is a possibility and which has echoes in some of the contributions here  such as    proposal from Gerald Holtham  is to move the euro closer to a continental version of Special Drawing Rights  The euro could be the currency of inter European and international trade  while  sub euros   created by each of the nations of Europe  could be used for domestic trade and  importantly  domestic financial arrangements  The disciplinary aspects of Maastricht which are currently inappropriately directed at government deficits and are amplifying the downturn would then be redirected at trade deficits within Europe instead  and matched by pressures to minimize intra European trade surpluses as well   The euro drachma  euro peso and euro mark could be introduced at one to one parity with the euro  and all financial assets and liabilities would be denominated in these national currencies rather than the euro  These national currencies would then float freely for a period  say one year   after which they would be fixed in proportion to the euro The obvious devaluation that would occur for the euro drachma and euro peseta would reduce their foreign debts and force the nations whose banks over lent to them to deal with the consequences  It would also end the currency flight that is currently occurring  a euro drachma would still be a euro drachma  whether it resided in a Greek or German bank account  The introduction of such a system could provide a rapid resolution to the current crisis  It could not be pain free  but it would be difficult to imagine that it would impose more pain than is currently being felt by Greece and Spain  or is about to be felt by other countries once the contagion passes on to them  This system would also introduce what is otherwise impossible in the euro  exchange rate flexibility  Economists as widely apart ideologically as Wynne Godley and Milton Friedman observed long before the euro began that it would fail  a  because it imagined that a market economy would reach a harmonious equilibrium on its own without government intervention which  as a deluded neoclassical fantasy  and  b  because it pushed together widely disparate nations which  were utterly unsuited to a currency union  A step backwards by Europe from dystopian fantastical object of a single currency  to a mini version of what Bretton Woods should have been  could thus be a workable way out of this crisis and towards the political dream of a non fractious Europe ,2012-07-26,Professor Steve Keen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-euro-as-the-sdr-of-europe-130928,130928
106741,328256,A,Elliott Wave  GBP USD Big Picture,opinion,A decline from 2008 peak to 2009  1 3500 low was in five waves  which in Elliott Wave theory indicates a direction of a larger trend  This is called an impulse wave  and once this leg is complete you will see a reversal in price  against the trend  normally into a slow  choppy and overlapping price action which is personality of a correction  Well  this is exactly what market experienced since 2009 lows  As such  we are very confident that pair is trapped in a corrective pattern  triangle which is still incomplete  based on the latest data  Because of correlations to other markets  we think that wave D  is still underway to 1 5000 level from where we would expect another bounce into wave E  From a long term perspective  this market is bearish while trades below 1 6744 invalidation level as we anticipate a huge fall into wave  C   back below wave  A  ,2012-07-31,Gregor Horvat,https://www.investing.com/analysis/elliott-wave:-gbp-usd-big-picture-131441,131441
