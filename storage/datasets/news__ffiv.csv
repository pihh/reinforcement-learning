in our SEC filings  Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call With that  I ll turn the call over to Francois Francois Locoh Donou    President  Chief Executive Officer  and DirectorThank you  Suzanne  and good afternoon everyone  Thank you for joining us today  I will talk briefly to our business drivers  before handing over to Frank to review the quarter s results in detail We have been investing to evolve our business to better meet our customers  changing application demands  Today  we are delivering our world class application services across a wider range of deployment and consumption models  As a result  customers are increasingly deploying F5 in multi cloud environments  driving a shift in our revenue mix toward software  Customer demand for consistent application security and reliable application performance  drove 5  total revenue growth in our first quarter Strong customer demand for security use cases  including WAF and SSL  as well as ongoing ELA traction  fueled our 50  software growth  We are very pleased with our continued software traction  We continue to expect 60  to 70  software growth for 2020  including contribution from Shape Security  which closed on Friday  last week  Our software growth was partially offset by our systems business  which was down 11   as customers increasingly look to consume F5 solutions as software Our services business was very strong in the quarter  delivering 8  revenue growth  Services is benefiting from our robust software sales over the last several quarters  including the second full quarter of NGINX related sales  Overall  we continue to execute well against our long term strategy  and are pleased by the pace of our continued transition to a software driven business I will speak more to our business dynamics and customer wins after Frank reviews the quarter s financial results  and our Q2 outlook  Frank Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Francois  and good afternoon everyone  As Francois noted  we delivered another quarter of strong revenue growth  First quarter revenue of  569 3 million  was up approximately 5  year over year  and near the top end of our guided range of  560 million to  570 million GAAP net income for the quarter was  98 5 million or  1 62 per share  Non GAAP net income was  155 4 million or  2 55 per share  This was well above the top end of our guidance range  due to our strong revenue performance as well as disciplined operating expense management in the quarter  Q1 product revenue of  235 million was flat year over year  and accounted for approximately 41  of total revenue As Francois mentioned  software revenue grew 50  year over year  Software represented approximately 28  of product revenue in Q1  up from approximately 19  in the year ago quarter  We continue to experience strong uptake on our software solution sold as annual subscriptions  including as ELAs  In fact  contribution from ELAs increased again year over year Systems revenue of  170 million was down 11  year over year  as customers continue to transition to software based solutions  Systems accounted for approximately 72  of product revenue in the quarter  Services revenue of  335 million grew 8  year over year  and represented approximately 59  of total revenue  There were three primary contributors to services revenue strong performance in the quarter  The primary factor is improvements to the tools and processes our team uses to identify and secure renewals  In addition  we continue to enjoy healthy services attach and renewal rates to software sold  as perpetual or as subscriptions  including NGINX related sales  And we have also seen a step up in consulting services demand associated with growing software sales On a regional basis  in Q1  Americas delivered a solid quarter with 3  revenue growth year over year  representing 53  of total revenue  EMEA grew 5  and accounted for 27  of revenue  while APAC grew 8  and accounted for 20  of revenue Looking at our bookings by vertical  enterprise customers represented 65  of product bookings  and service providers accounted for 16   Our government business was very strong  representing 19  of product bookings  including 7  from US Federal In Q1  we had three greater than 10  distributors  Ingram Micro  which accounted for 16  of total revenue  Westcon  which accounted for 11   and Arrow  which accounted for 10  Let s now discuss Q1 operating results  GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 84 4   Non GAAP gross margin was 86   GAAP operating expenses were  358 million  Non GAAP operating expenses were  297 million  Non GAAP operating expenses were at the lower end of our guidance range for several reasons  including disciplined expense management  and sales commissions back in line with historical levels  down from the highs of the second half of 2019  In addition  there were some timing differences for expenses expected between Q1 and Q2 Our GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 21 5   and our non GAAP operating margin was 33 8   Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 22 8   Our non GAAP effective tax rate was 21 4  Turning to the balance sheet  In Q1  we generated  144 million in cash flow from operations  This is down from last year  for several reasons  including lower year over year operating margins  commission payments from strong Q4 bookings  M A related expenses and restructuring  Cash and investments  totaled approximately  1 5 billion at quarter end  DSO of 56 days  and capital expenditures for the quarter were  22 million  Deferred revenue increased 8  year over year to  1 2 billion  The growth rate is down from 2019 levels  because we had lapped our 606 adoption  which as we consistently called out was accounting for roughly half our deferred revenue growth over the last year  We ended the quarter with approximately 5 305 employees  down approximately 20 from Q4  as a result of our ongoing efforts to better align spend with strategic imperatives We continue to view cash as a strategic asset for our future growth  Our near term priority will be paying down the  400 million Term Loan A  related to the Shape acquisition funding  We ll look to balance that with rebuilding our cash position for strategic purposes  We also may opt to repurchase shares  during any open trading window Now  let me share our guidance for fiscal Q2 of 2020  Unless otherwise stated  please note that my guidance comments reference non GAAP operating metrics  In addition  with the Shape Security acquisition closed on January 24  our guidance is inclusive of Shape We continue to make strong progress  transitioning our business to a software driven model  We remain confident in our position in the market  and expect increasing demand for our multi cloud application services will continue to drive revenue growth  We also expect continued strong demand for our software solutions  In fact  in Q2  we anticipate software growth will reaccelerate above Q1 s 50  growth  even before any contribution from Shape As we noted  when we announced the Shape acquisition  Shape has a subscription revenue software model  with a significant deferred revenue balance  Purchase accounting will impact Shape related recognized revenue on a GAAP basis  principally over the next four quarters  Therefore  for that period  we will provide non GAAP revenue guidance  which excludes the impact of the purchase accounting writedown  We believe non GAAP revenue will provide a better reflection of our ongoing business results  We will report revenue on both a GAAP and a non GAAP basis  during this timeframe With this in mind  we are targeting Q2  20 non GAAP revenue in the range of  580 million to  590 million  In addition  we expect services Q2  20 annual revenue growth more in line with Q4 of  19  We expect gross margins in the range of 85  to 85 5   We estimate operating expenses of  325 million to  337 million in Q2  reflecting the addition of Shape  and the opportunity we have to invest in the scale of that business  We anticipate our effective tax rate for Q2 will remain in the 21  to 22  range  Our Q2 earnings target is  2 14 to  2 17 per share  In the quarter  we expect share based compensation expense of approximately  52 million to  53 million With that  I will turn the call back over to Francois  Francois Francois Locoh Donou    President  Chief Executive Officer  and DirectorThank you  Frank  I am going to begin today with a spotlight on NGINX  before highlighting some of the broader trends and customer wins in the quarter  First  today we announced an important milestone for the combined F5 and NGINX  The availability of Controller 3 0  Controller is a orchestration and analytic solution for NGINX  It simplifies how enterprises manage  monitor  and automate large scale NGINX deployments Prior to the acquisition of NGINX  F5 was working on a cloud native virtual ADC offering  that featured an application centric design  We expected the solution  appropriately named cloud native  would set a new benchmark for how modern developer teams could deliver new apps to market faster  Immediately after the close of the NGINX acquisition in May 2019  we merged the F5 team working on our cloud native project with the NGINX Controller development team  Today  as we begin only our third quarter  as a combined team  we are very excited to release the converged F5 NGINX solution  NGINX Controller 3 0  This controller brings together the best of NGINX Controller 1 0 and 2 0  and add the application centric design  and enterprise features  pioneered by F5 For context on why this new approach is so important  we first need to emphasize the fundamental shift in the way our customers manage and deliver applications  Originally  there was a divide between the application teams that develop the code  and the operations team that release and manage the finished application  DevOps evolved to bridge the divide  and many organizations embraced DevOps practices to deploy applications faster  As a result  organizations embraced software like NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus to empower developers with control over their own infrastructure  Although  this improved developer productivity  it also created shadow IT  Many of these developers worked outside of IT  outside of the compliance and enterprise security requirements  designed to protect applications and data  That is why we believe Controller 3 0 and its application centric approach is highly differentiated  The application centric design introduces a new self service portal  configuration API  application reporting and analytics  and built in security capabilities  These combined app centric capabilities and power developers  from a centralized solution that maintains control and compliance for security and operations teams Controller 3 0 shifts the center of gravity from the instance of infrastructure supporting the app to the application itself  With role based access spending  AppDev  DevOps  SecOps  and NetOps  it enables deployment of a consistent set of multi cloud application services across the application lifecycle  This enables different users to manage the tasks relevant to their role In summary  we expect the availability of Controller 3 0 will be an accelerator for our NGINX business for three reasons  First  it expands the addressable market for NGINX to include adjacent app services in security and service mesh  Second  it increases the average deal size by making large scale NGINX deployments easier to orchestrate  And third  it introduces new commercial capabilities that are attractive to NGINX s large open source base  Early feedback has been positive with customers noting that Controller 3 0 expands the number of use cases and deployments of NGINX  particularly for Kubernetes Ingress and API management In addition to delivering the Controller 3 0 release  NGINX had its strongest quarter yet in Q1 with the team hitting all of its significant integration  and value creation milestones  When we look at the future of F5  we are more confident now than ever before that NGINX will be a meaningful software growth driver  We continue to see evidence that NGINX is expanding our overall footprint  and allowing us to serve new applications  This includes enabling application services  consumption in native container environments As an example  during Q1  we secured an NGINX Plus and NGINX Controller win with a new customer  a large Australian mining company  The customer was looking to modernize a legacy business process  and its mine sites  where a single failure could result in up to  4 million in productivity losses  By using NGINX for the API and Kubernetes in their application  they now are able to collect and deliver over 30 different metrics  As a result  they re better able to ensure the speedy and reliable delivery of raw materials to their destinations  We are also seeing an uptick for NGINX inclusion in ELAs  both in concept with F5 solutions  and on a stand alone basis During Q1  we closed our first 100  NGINX ELA with a large streaming services provider  NGINX Plus is enabling seamless capacity and service offering increases without disrupting critical revenue producing applications  The ELA construct was meaningful in this case  because the customer is able to deploy additional NGINX Plus instances of subscribers increase  In fact  when the actual number of subscribers surpassed forecasts  out of the gate  the ELA provided the customer with the flexibility to immediately scale services with demand Beyond NGINX  we continue to gain traction in software across the other growth drivers  we have consistently highlighted  including ELAs  service provider use cases  security use cases  and deployments across multi cloud environments  I will highlight customer examples of each of these in Q1  In fact  the first example highlights an ELA win with a large UK based telecommunications provider  transitioning from hardware to software  In this case  the customer s ADC infrastructure based on F5 hardware was nearing end of life  The need to refresh provided the customer with the opportunity to rethink the design and build a flexible virtualized environment  aligned to its future business needs Despite a competitor touting analytics and commercial flexibility  F5 was able to demonstrate best in class software based security and ADC capabilities  In addition  our analytics and reporting outperformed the competition and reduced the customers  operational cost Looking at a security use case win in the quarter  During Q1  we secured a combined systems and software win with a German health system company  F5 is providing application security solutions  including Advanced WAF to secure a platform that allows doctors  hospitals  and health insurance companies consolidated access to patient records  Of note  we were the only provider able to meet the customers  security requirements of delivering a highly secure and scalable infrastructure that met stringent government standards In an example of F5 solutions deployed in multi cloud environments  we secured a win with one of the UK s most trusted financial brand  a large UK based mortgage provider  As part of their digital transformation program  they chose to deploy BIG IP Virtual Editions across two public clouds  thus provided the growth capability to support an ever increasing number of online banking customers and enabled consistent application services and security across the cloud and datacenter Before we move to Q A  let me say how very enthusiastic we are  to begin our integration work with our colleagues from Shape Security  To recap briefly  we believe the combination of F5 and Shape changes the game in application security  Shape is a leader in anti fraud and abuse protection  solving a mission critical problem for large enterprises  Together with F5 s world class portfolio of application services  Shape and F5 will deliver the most comprehensive application security portfolio available Beyond accelerating our growth momentum  and more than doubling our addressable security market  Shape s machine learning and AI powered capabilities also will scale and extend F5 s broad portfolio of application services  With Shape  we will expand our ability to optimize and protect customers applications in an increasingly complex multi cloud world  With the Shape transaction closing last week  the teams already have begun the integration process  led by members of our Chief Strategy Officer  Tom Fountain s team  under our value creation program  This is the same team that executed the very successful integration of NGINX  and we are confident they will do the same with Shape  leveraging lessons learned during the NGINX process  We are very pleased that Derek Smith  Shape s CEO  will continue to lead the team as part of F5 In closing  digital transformation has changed the competitive stakes for nearly every business on the planet  Beyond delivering a compelling reliable user experience  customers need partners and solutions that allow them to do more and move faster  At F5  we envision a future where all businesses can deploy new applications or make changes to existing applications in minutes  not days  We are transforming F5 to make that vision a reality for our customers  to enable  support and secure every application across any environment  with a consistent set of enterprise grade services My sincere thanks to the entire F5 team for driving another great quarter  My thanks also to our partners  our customers and our shareholders for joining us on our journey  I will remind you that our Analyst and Investor Day is scheduled for March 3  in New York  We look forward to seeing many of you there With that  operator  we will now open the call to Q A Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Tim Long with Barclays  Your line is open Tim Long    Barclays    AnalystThank you  Two questions if I could  First  Frank  I think you talked about last time the cloud related businesses  which are still in early phase  were a meaningful portion of the total software revenues  Could you just give us an update on how the cloud vertical did for you  And did you see some sequential growth there  And if not  were there ELA impacts or some other impacts  And then secondly  the services strength  it sounds like    the year over year growth rate will tick back a little bit next quarter  But could you just talk  looking out the next several quarters or year  should that line start to become under a little bit more pressure as the weight of the system  revenue declines hits the    hits the longer term model  Thank you Francois Locoh Donou    President  Chief Executive Officer  and DirectorHey  Tim  it s Francois  I ll take the first question  and then Frank will comment on the services question  On cloud revenues  Tim  we said last quarter that they represented a meaningful portion of our total software revenue  and that portion is continues to grow  because cloud business is growing even faster than our overall software business  And that s driven by a couple of things  One is  we have made our software solutions much easier to deploy in client environments with integrations  with essentially all the large public cloud providers  We have added some automation and orchestration capabilities that enable our customers to include our solutions in automation environment  And then in their CI CD development pipelines  much easier than in the past  And third  I think  we re continuing to see just significant growth in the marketplaces of our    of the large public cloud providers  where our solutions are also available for purchase on a utility basis So when you look at the consumption models that we ve enabled by both the technology and the commercial models that we ve enabled  that significantly reduced or eliminated any friction associated with using F5 in public clouds  Our ELAs are good example of that  where customers buy an agreement for three years  and then they can deploy licenses in any environment  including in public clouds and port licenses from one public cloud to the other  or one public cloud to back to on prem  So all of that leads to a growth in our cloud software revenue  which  I think  we said last quarter or in the last six months of 2019 when we had growth in our software business of 90  for Q3 and Q4  But our cloud business had grown even faster than that  and it continues to be on a very strong growth trend Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd Tim  in relation to the services revenue  obviously  we were really pleased with having 8  year over year growth in Q1  That was  obviously  above what we had guided to in the last time we talked about the service revenue components  which was all the way back at AIM of 2018  when we talked about mid to low growth  during the Horizon 1 timeframe  So this is    this is great performance to see What we re seeing actually is also an increase in the attach rates across all the cohorts of age contracts  and so it s not really from our perspective  any decline in hardware that is impacting over a longer period of time  the decrease in the services revenue business  What it actually is  is more of the mix of things that come through as subscription  where that subscription looks more like a SaaS subscription and a lot of that revenue gets recognized  Almost all of that revenue gets recognized in the product side  and not the services side  And so we continue to see strong growth in the services revenue  probably even above where we thought when we thought about this in March of 2018 But over a longer period of time  we do see those services revenues coming down in terms of growth rates  but that s really more of a mix issue than anything to do with a systems versus the software sale Tim Long    Barclays    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler  Your line is open James Fish    Piper Sandler    AnalystHey guys  thanks for the question here  If I can squeeze in two as well  Enterprise still grew about 5  this quarter  yet the industry    not everyone is seeing that kind of strength  I guess  can you guys just go into what s going on in enterprise  specifically that is showing that resiliency  Thanks Francois Locoh Donou    President  Chief Executive Officer  and DirectorHi  James  Thanks for the question  The    generally  on the enterprise  we continue to see spending patterns that are    we ve got to call them relatively healthy  In  Technical Issues  healthy as they were in 2018  But we haven t seen a change overall from the spending patterns that we saw in 2019  So we seem to continue on that trend  There are some changes or variations by geography  And as you know  we pointed several times that we were seeing softness in Europe and in the UK  and DACH  in particular  And I think  we continue to see that today  But overall  the spending patterns are healthy  When you look  by the way  it s your context is that of other  perhaps providers in infrastructure of data centers  What we re seeing more and more  James  is the spending with us is tied to applications and the growth of applications not tied to data center infrastructure per se  So perhaps over time you will see more and more of that difference  But the spending patterns  I relate to  is what we see with our customers  application projects James Fish    Piper Sandler    AnalystGot it  And just a follow up on that  I mean it was a slight miss on what we were all expecting on products for the quarter  Were there any pause in orders ahead of the combined NGINX Plus F5 Controller  And why do you expect unattached software to accelerate next quarter Francois Locoh Donou    President  Chief Executive Officer  and DirectorJames  that s two separate question  I will start with the first one on product revenue growth  Product revenue growth was flat  And indeed it could have been a little bit better than that  What we saw in Q1  I think  there were really a couple of factors in Q1  One is  there were some lumpiness in some large deals that we expected  In Q1  we also did a relatively important realignment of our North America sales organization  in part to prepare to better focus on certain verticals  and to also evolve the alignment of our teams  given the evolution that s going on in our portfolio  with the new SaaS solution NGINX coming in  Shape coming in  And I think that realignment costs a bit of a short term pause on momentum  but it s also for the better and we ll see the benefits of that for the rest of the year  But I think those were two of the    two of the factors specifically on product revenue growth Your second question about  why we expect stronger revenue growth in Q2 for software  specifically  I think this issue of large deal lumpiness does apply also to large software deals  And we have a very robust pipeline of software deals going into Q2  And so we re pretty confident that we ll see a very strong growth in Q2 James Fish    Piper Sandler    AnalystThanks guys Francois Locoh Donou    President  Chief Executive Officer  and DirectorThank you  James OperatorYour next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse  Your line is open Sami Badri    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  thank you  I wanted to touch up on the percentage of enterprise wins that are tied more to security use cases versus more of the legacy business  or I guess you could say more ADC like product sales  So just trying to understand  has the importance of security for your customers shifted even further to the forefront of their decision making  Or would you say it s very comparable to how it was over the last year or so  Just trying to understand  has there been a big shift forward in terms of points of security use cases Francois Locoh Donou    President  Chief Executive Officer  and DirectorHi  Sami  You know  we don t    today  we don t break out our security revenues specifically  We continue to see strong growth in our security business  And as I said before  we see more growth in our security business than the rest of the portfolio  And so  the answer to your question is  yes  We continue to see more and more of our deals  driven by security use cases  In a lot of cases  these deals also pull other application services that you would classify more as application delivery services  But increasingly  in a meaningful portion of our business  security is the use case that actually pulls a    pull the deal together  The second factor that kind of accelerates that trend  if you will  is that in a multi cloud environments  we are seeing double the security attach rate to our solutions  that we were seeing on prem  And so given that more and more of our business is becoming multi cloud in terms of the deployment  we are seeing an increase of our    of our security business  And that    all of that by the way  we expect to see that accelerate with Shape  and the synergies that we expect to drive between the Shape portfolio and the F5 portfolio Sami Badri    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot it  Thank you  And then I kind of  just want to touch back on to the services growth rate that you saw in the quarter  Obviously 8  is a positive surprise for most people looking at your model  And you identified three factors for what s driving that  One of them was new tools  So given that this just played out in this quarter  should we expect similar high single digit growth or even in the same ballpark of growth in services for the rest of the year  as these three factors continue to drive the business forward  to continue to drive more services renewals  Or should we expect like a moderation on the growth rate Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSami  I think we gave some fairly specific guidance for Q2  in particular  that probably gets you to a number of that  Tim was getting too  which is slightly down from where we    where we printed Q1  but still very healthy in terms of the growth rate for Q2  As we look out over the course of the year  that services growth rate may start to modulate down  particularly as we get more and more traction with some of the pure SaaS type revenue models that we discussed  But I think it s safe to say that the overall services growth rate is going to be higher than probably what we thought about at the end of our Horizon 1 guidance  when we talked about this in March of 2018 Sami Badri    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot it  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan  Your line is open Samik Chatterjee    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  thanks for taking the question  Francois  if I can just start off with more longer term question  I mean you ve been making investments both organic  as well as inorganic since you kind of took over  and have been aligning the Company to growth areas now  As you think about the transformation  can you kind of help us think about which innings you re in  given that Frank s comments to prioritizing debt paydown seem to indicate you re kind of done with most of the heavy lifting in terms of the transformation that you envision Francois Locoh Donou    President  Chief Executive Officer  and DirectorThank you  Samik  Well  let me start with what s driving this transformation  Samik  we have a belief  So if you look at  you know  us versus other players in the industry  we have a very strategic position  In that  we are in line of the traffic between application and users for a very  very large number of applications  And with the acquisition of NGINX  we extended our reach very significantly  and we re not part of the flow for several hundred million applications  Our belief is simply driven by the fact that the number and complexity of applications in the future is going to increase  and increase exponentially from where we are  given everybody s digital transformations And as a result  we have an opportunity to extend that strategic position to more applications  And also unify more applications  more application services for each of these applications  And that s really what we have been doing with this transformation  Our priority is to do it organically  but when in the selective scenarios where we see an opportunity to accelerate that unification or within a window of time  we have decided to do that inorganically  and you ve seen two instances of that  Where we are in this transformation  I would say  we are in the early innings  because we think we are actually in the very early innings of the digital transformation of our customers  So I expect that the growth opportunity for F5  as we succeed in unifying these application services for this new multi cloud environment  is well ahead of us and is very significant Samik Chatterjee    JPMorgan    AnalystGot it  And if I can quickly follow up for Frank  Frank  how should we think about the trajectory for OpEx beyond 2Q s level  I think you said  325 million to  337 million  So beyond that  how should we be thinking about the trajectory Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Samik  so I would just go back to what I said  Pre the Shape acquisition  in terms of Q2 is always our seasonal low point in the OpEx cycle  and we tend to tick up in Q3 and Q4  In terms of operating margin expansion  we still feel very comfortable with our guidance that we put out for the year of 30  to 32  for the year  And so directionally  I think  Q2 will be the low point  and then we ll move back up from there in Q3 and Q4 Samik Chatterjee    JPMorgan    AnalystGreat  Thank you  Thanks for clarifying OperatorYour next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen  Your line is open  Paul Silverstein  your line is open Your next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs  Your line is open Rod Hall    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYeah  hi guys  I just wanted to ask a couple of things on the Shape acquisition  I think you guys called out the non GAAP adjustments to revenue  And I wanted to just come back to those  I wasn t    I m not sure I fully understand that  So maybe if you could go back into a little bit more detail on exactly what that is  And then I wanted to  also on Shape just ask    and maybe you said this earlier  but what was the contribution or what is the contribution of Shape to the guidance  It seems like  I think you guys had said there was an ARR of  70 million  growing at 50   And kind of  if I do some rough math on that  I get to  5 million bucks of maybe revenue contribution   maybe it s less than that  maybe more  But I m just trying to get some idea of what s in the guidance from Shape  Thanks Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Rod  So we re not specifically actually breaking out guidance for Shape  The reason why we did that with NGINX is because NGINX actually closed after we had given guidance  And so when we reported NGINX  we tried to be specific on what was the relationship of our recognized revenue versus what we have guided to and then the contribution from NGINX  But with Shape  we ve gotten it with it  and we re not breaking that out at this time  In terms of what we said and what Francois talked about when we actually announced the Shape acquisition and the non GAAP revenue  With a SaaS based business model  and you see this quite frequently in software SaaS land  where companies acquire with a    companies with a very large deferred revenue balance  given the way revenue comes into those SaaS models  where there is a significant writedown in that revenue as part of purchase accounting  And so  to try to give the users of our financial statements  a better sense for what the long term growth rate is going to be  as opposed to a muted revenue  we are going to be reporting both GAAP and non GAAP revenue to give better comparability in years to come Rod Hall    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAnd Frank  just one other thing to clarify  You guys said that services would grow at about the same rate  So I guess like 6   and that including Shape looks to me like it drops out about  260 million of product revenue in the guided quarter  I mean that s    is that a correct way to look at that Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat number isn t exactly what is familiar to me  but I think it s not so far off  I think the rate that we had probably for Q4 of last time was  I think  6 5     6  to 6 5  Rod Hall    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYeah  6 3  Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah Rod Hall    Goldman Sachs    AnalystSo   Speech Overlap  you re thinking almost exactly that growth rate Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah Rod Hall    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerRod  there is    there is no services revenue for Shape Rod Hall    Goldman Sachs    AnalystRight  Okay  Yeah  Thank you  Frank  That s helpful too  Thanks Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah OperatorYour next question comes from Fahad Najam with Cowen  Your line is open Fahad Najam    Cowen    AnalystThank you for taking my question  I m trying to also understand the software revenue trends  In terms of your software revenue  can you help us understand how much of it is recurring  and how much is ELA Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo  we really haven t  Phonetic  split that out  in the past Fahad Najam    Cowen    AnalystIn terms of    is it reasonable to assume that majority of your software revenue is still coming from ELAs Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThe    no  it s not  When we take a look  I think we talked about a few quarters ago  the pure percentage of recurring revenue of our total revenue was 60 percent plus  And we continue to build  and that s exactly what we saw in Q1 Fahad Najam    Cowen    AnalystOkay  And then  if I may ask one more question on    regarding the Shape Security  if we assume that almost all of Shape Security revenue  would you be breaking out your security revenue as a stand alone now that Shape is closed Francois Locoh Donou    President  Chief Executive Officer  and DirectorWe don t anticipate doing that at this time  Fahad  But we re talking about several different KPI metrics for AIM in March and TBD on what we decide there Fahad Najam    Cowen    AnalystAll right  thank you for my questions Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Thanks OperatorYour next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore  Your line is open Lexi Curnin    Evercore    AnalystHi  thank you for taking the question  This is Lexi on for Amit  So I guess what we re wondering about is when we re looking at the 60  to 70  growth in software moving forward  how much of that is organic versus M A driven  And then on the organic side  what are the top two or three contributors to that growth Francois Locoh Donou    President  Chief Executive Officer  and DirectorWell  I    let me  let me start with  as you know  we re not breaking out    you know Shape and NGINX sources the F5 business prior to Shape and NGINX  But let me give you some some indicators  Last year  the F5 software grew about 60  year on year  There was a very small contribution of NGINX in the second half of the year to that growth  We guided after the NGINX acquisition to growth in software in our Horizon 1 which includes 2020  that was 35  to 40  As you can see  we are well above that  We were at 60  for the full year last year  19   Phonetic  in the second half and we are at 50  this quarter  So this just gives you a sense that the growth in    I m going to call it F5 traditional software prior to even NGINX and Shape is very significant  and that s driven by a few things  It s driven by the work that we ve done on making our software easier to consume in private clouds and automated environments is driven by the work that we ve done in  Technical Issues  software in public clouds and is driven by the work we ve done in enabling new consumption models  ELAs  subscription utilities at such in all environment and that s    that F5 has done  but it s also as a primary driver coming from the customers  desire to move from sort of hardware first posture to software first postures  And we re seeing that change in our customers both in enterprise  and in the service provider  worldwide service providers start more and more virtualizing their infrastructure  So there are very strong demand drivers from our customers to move to a software consumption of F5  When you look at 2020  we do expect strong contribution from NGINX and from Shape to achieve or exceed our 60  to 70  guidance Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerLexi  the only thing I d add is that  we did say during the prepared remarks that even without Shape  we did expect our Q2 software growth to be above the 50  level that we experienced in Q1 Lexi Curnin    Evercore    AnalystGreat  Thank you very much Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham  Your line is open Alex Henderson    Needham    AnalystGreat  Thank you very much  I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the NGINX acquisition relative to the selling process  and the new products that you re introducing here  So as I understand it  the value of NGINX is predominantly in selling to application coders and DevOps peoples  that are generally focus on an application specific project  and have had little success selling the Controller  because that s generally sold back to NetOps and IT administration  Conversely  your historical footprint at F5 is predominantly been selling into the NetOps and IT stuff  but you didn t have really good access to the coding community  DevOps community  As you ve introduced this 3 0 and are now bringing that back to the F5 distribution architecture  are you going to then integrate that into Beacon  and then have the full value of the controls from the BIG IP through  the NGINX Controller to potentially manage the people  who are in the NetOps   Indecipherable   DevOps coder community  Does that bring power back to the NetOps people in a way that they ve been losing in the past  Can you talk a little bit about that dynamic Francois Locoh Donou    President  Chief Executive Officer  and DirectorYes  Thank you  Alex  Short answer to all this is  yes  But  let me    let me give you a bit of context  So if you look at where NGINX had gotten traction in terms of revenue is  really offering their data plane above the open source capabilities in the data plane  offering additional features in their data plan  and as well as support  And that s really how NGINX  so far  in the current model had monetized their technology  The Controller adds whole new dimension for that  sort of DevOps community because  number one  it makes it a lot easier to deploy and manage large scale implementations of NGINX data planes across a number of applications  And so if you look at the folks who really to date have been able to use NGINX  it s folks who are very sophisticated DevOps people and have the skills and expertise to integrate these deployments and manage them on their own  And so with the controller  it offers essentially an easy button that allows a much larger group of people that perhaps don t have the same sophistication to now use NGINX technology and use our technology on the large scale So that s kind of the first driver  The controller also integrates application centric design  which really is targeted at more of the enterprise users  including what we call Super NetOps users in large enterprises  And so it does    it does give an ability for the NetOps people to still have visibility of what goes on in the infrastructure under their applications and the DevOps people to have a self service model to deploy their applications faster and make changes to their applications very quickly So we  at the time of the acquisition  we said that F5 and NGINX together  we re going to bridge the divide between NetOps and DevOps  and the controller  Technical Issues  is really the manifestation of that strategy  and it s really the first offer in the market that truly bridges the divide and allow these two communities to work in concert serving the needs for speed of DevOps and serving the needs for visibility and compliance from the NetOps people  This controller will indeed integrate in a technological beacon which will give visibility and analytics across all F5 environment  NGINX  BIG IP and and other environments  So that s the convergence  We think this is a very important launch for our NGINX business because in addition to the capabilities around DevOps and bridging the divide  it also does increase the deal size for NGINX products because it makes large scale deployments easier and offer new and exciting capabilities for a number of open source users that may want to move up a tier and use the control as a commercial technology Alex Henderson    Needham    AnalystGreat  Thank you very much  It s pretty clear OperatorYour next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James  Your line is open Victor Chiu    Raymond James    AnalystHi  this is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold  Can you just give us an update on where the telco stand regarding the shift to software implementations of ADC and kind of the outlook there Francois Locoh Donou    President  Chief Executive Officer  and DirectorHi  Simon  we are continuing to see an acceleration in telco starting to move to virtualization  We saw a couple of large deals  again in that space this quarter with large service providers  And this is driven by essentially readiness for 5G  and also the desire for service providers to be able to move faster when they need to make changes to their infrastructure  and overall  be able to reduce their cost  What we re seeing for now is  service providers kind of keeping their more hardware based infrastructure in place  and starting kind of greenfield software implementations for virtualization  Over the long time  I think  these will converge  But for now  those we see in the service providers that we work with  we see these as two separate environment  for the time being  Overall  the trend is accelerating Victor Chiu    Raymond James    AnalystThat s helpful  Thank you OperatorYour final question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Instinet  Your line is open  Jeff Kvaal  your line is open  Your final question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley  Your line is open Meta Marshall    Morgan Stanley    AnalystLook at there  I get to benefit from Jeff  Quick question  On AWS partnership  just any update there that you could give  And then  I assume because you revalidated the 32  to 33  operating margin target  But just on the mid to high single digit dilution target  and kind of breakeven on 24 months for Shape Security  have any of those expectations change  That s it  Thanks Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerMeta  I just want to be clear  when we talked about 30  to 32  operating margin   Meta Marshall    Morgan Stanley    AnalystSorry  30  to 32   Yes  yes Frank Pelzer    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI just wanted to be sure that we re clear on the numbers  like  go ahead  Francois  you want to talk about the AWS Francois Locoh Donou    President  Chief Executive Officer  and DirectorYes  Meta  so we ve made good progress on execution of our roadmap with AWS on the strategic collaboration agreement  We have been prioritizing the  sort of highest impact opportunities  Both teams are now working very well in the field  We re seeing a number of new opportunities surface  that we didn t have access to before  And if you recall  in Q4  I said that that s what we expected in part because part of this agreement was that number of AWS solutions architects who faced customers every day  who are going to be trained on F5 solutions and we expected them to bring opportunities back to F5  but perhaps we would not have seen before  And that s exactly what we have started to see  So it s early days in the partnership and we said that    I think it was  we expected it to really give us a meaningful results in the second half of 2020  But from what we re seeing so far  we re pretty bullish about what we can accomplish together with AWS Meta Marshall    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  Thanks

123244,344759,FFIV,Why F5 Networks  Latest Big Bet Will Keep Shareholders in Good Shape,news,"Because the rise of cloud computing has pushed F5 Networks   NASDAQ FFIV  legacy hardware based business into decline  the company s own transition to a cloud based software model has become vital to its efforts to remain relevant 
Its fiscal first quarter results confirmed it s making encouraging progress in that direction  And last month  F5 accelerated the pace of those changes with its largest acquisition ever    it bought Shape Security for around  1 billion  The size of the transaction relative to F5 s scale represents a risky bet    but given the company s modest valuation  it also provides investors with an interesting investment opportunity 
A mandatory transition from hardware to cloud based software
F5 s legacy business consists of selling hardware based application delivery controllers  ADCs  that optimize the performance and security of computing architectures  These devices filter and distribute network traffic across server groups that host the applications users want to access  
However  with the growth of cloud computing  these on premises devices have become less relevant  For instance  during the last quarter  revenue from F5 s systems segment  which includes the company s hardware ADC  dropped 11  year over year to  170 million  This business remains important  though  It still represented 72  of the company s product revenue during that quarter   Outside of products  the company generated 58 8  of its revenue from services such as consulting  training  and maintenance  
But F5 initiated its transition to a software based model a few years ago  It virtualized its ADC    making the software independent from hardware    and developed a cloud native version 
This new software based ADC sits between remote users and applications hosted in the cloud  which is an ideal position to add cybersecurity features  For instance  F5 offers a web application firewall  which filters network traffic between clients and servers based on in depth web traffic analysis 
And in May  the company accelerated its transition to its software ADC business  It acquired the open source ADC company NGINX for  670 million to expand its footprint with developers and profit from that company s products  synergies with its existing solutions 
During the last quarter  F5 s growing software business offset its declining hardware portfolio    product revenue stayed flat year over year  Revenue from software increased to  65 7 million  up 50   The software revenue base remains small compared to the legacy hardware business  but management is confident that revenue growth from software will exceed 50  next quarter 

The acquisition of Share Security represents a risky bet
In fact  taking into account the acquisition of the cybersecurity player Shape Security in December  management indicated revenue growth from software would land in the range of 60  to 70  during fiscal 2020 
This deal makes sense since Shape Security offers a cybersecurity product that can be integrated with F5 s ADC cloud offering  In a nutshell  it uses artificial intelligence to prevent sophisticated bots from abusing the applications it protects 
In addition  Shape Security s application cybersecurity market seems attractive  A study from Mordor Intelligence estimates this market should grow annually by 25  and reach  15 25 billion by 2025 
This transaction represents a significant bet for F5  though 
The company didn t provide any financial details about Security Shape  But given the lofty valuations of other cloud based cybersecurity stocks  it s reasonable to assume F5 paid a high multiple of revenue  For instance  the market currently values CrowdStrike and Zscaler    two high growth cloud based cybersecurity vendors    at price to sales ratios of 29 6 and 21 7  respectively  Also  the purchase price of  1 billion in cash amounts to 2 5 times F5 s research and development expenses during fiscal 2019 
Attractive risk reward ratio
F5 must continue to achieve strong growth from its software solutions to offset the secular decline of its still important hardware based business  Given the synergies  the acquisitions of NGINX and Shape Security make sense and should contribute significantly to the company s software revenue growth  The successful integration of NGINX and Shape Security with F5 s portfolio involves important execution risks  though 
But given the company s modest enterprise value to sales ratio of 3 2 and its forward P E  of 12 2  the market seems to be pricing F5 for weak growth    at best    over the long term  Thus  its stock offers an interesting risk reward ratio for investors looking for exposure to the cloud computing space at a reasonable price ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/poi8j,2070805

FFIV   Social media provider Twitter  TWTR  and online payments company Paypal  PYPL  are also notable companies in this industry The industry participants use SaaS based cloud computing model to deliver solutions to end users as well as enterprises Here are the three major industry themes The industry is benefiting from continued demand for digital transformation  Growth prospects are alluring primarily due to rapid adoption of SaaS  which offers a flexible and cost effective delivery method of applications  It also cuts down on deployment time compared to legacy systems  SaaS attempts to deliver applications to any user  anywhere  anytime and on any device  It has been effective in addressing customer expectation of seamless communications across multiple channels

customer centric approach is allowing end users to perform all the required actions while minimal intervention is needed from the software provider s side  Moreover  the pay as you go model helps Internet Software providers scale their offerings according to the needs of different users  Further  the subscription based business model ensures recurring revenues for industry participants  The affordability of the SaaS delivery model  particularly for small and medium businesses  is also a major driver  The cloud based applications are easy to use  Hence  the need for specialized training reduces significantly  which lowers expenses  thereby driving profits  Additionally  the growing need to secure cloud platforms  amid growing incidence of cyber attacks and hacking  drives demand for web based cyber security software  Further  as enterprises continue to move their on premise workload to cloud environments  application and infrastructure monitoring are gaining importance  This is creating more demand for web based performance management monitoring tools  However  increasing worldwide regulations related to data privacy  and data protection and accessibility do not bode well

123258,344773,FFIV,Earnings Preview  F5 Networks  FFIV  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects F5 Networks  NASDAQ FFIV  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 27  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This computer networking company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 43 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10  
Revenues are expected to be  566 13 million  up 4 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 33  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for F5 
For F5  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 14  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that F5 will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that F5 would post earnings of  2 55 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 59  delivering a surprise of  1 57  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

F5 shares have lost about 2 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 2  
What s Next for F5 
While F5 has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for F5 was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

123323,344838,FFIV,F5 Networks  FFIV  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when F5 Networks  NASDAQ FFIV  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This computer networking company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 55 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 4  
Revenues are expected to be  546 70 million  up 2 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for F5 
For F5  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that F5 will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that F5 would post earnings of  2 54 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 70  delivering a surprise of  6 30  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

123342,344857,FFIV,Exclusive  Elliott target Gigamon prepares to explore a sale   sources,news,"By Liana B  Baker and Michael Flaherty
 Reuters    Gigamon Inc  a U S  network monitoring software maker targeted by activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp  is preparing to hold talks with potential suitors interested in acquiring it  according to people familiar with the matter 
The move would push Gigamon closer to being acquired  after Elliott reported a 15 3 percent stake in the company in May and said it would encourage it to undergo a strategic review process that could also include a sale 
Gigamon is working with investment bank  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS  as it prepares to engage in talks with companies and private equity firms interested in a deal  the sources said this week  No sale process has started yet  the sources added 
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential  Gigamon  which has a market capitalization of  1 5 billion  and Goldman Sachs both declined to comment  Elliott did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Gigamon could attract interest from companies such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and  F5 Networks Inc   NASDAQ FFIV   as well as technology focused private equity firms such as Thoma Bravo Llc  Riverbed Technology  now owned by Thoma Bravo  bought Gigamon competitor Opnet in 2012 for  1 billion 
Gigamon  based in Santa Clara  California  makes software that is installed in large data centers to boost the flow of traffic and prevent bottlenecks  Some of its competitors have been acquired in recent months  including Ixia  which Keysight Technologies Inc bought earlier this year for  1 6 billion 
Elliott has succeeded in pushing many technology companies to sell themselves in recent years  including Mentor Graphics  LifeLock Inc and Qlik Technologies ",2017-06-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/exclusive:-elliott-target-gigamon-prepares-to-explore-a-sale---sources-491464,491464

123360,344875,FFIV,F5 Networks  FFIV  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"F5 Networks  NASDAQ FFIV  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This computer networking company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 54 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 4  
Revenues are expected to be  546 65 million  up 4 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for F5 
For F5  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that F5 will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that F5 would post earnings of  2 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 90  delivering a surprise of  10 27  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
F5 doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/f5-networks-ffiv-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200376225,200376225

The December options chain shows biggest open interest at the 115 Put and 130 Call Strikes  but both are not large  In the January chain open interest on the Put side is again largest at the 115 Strike and 130 Call Strike  but more spread out to the upside on the Calls  And the April chain  the first covering the January 24th earnings report  has low open interest but it is at the same area  115 on the Put side and 125 and 130 on the Call side

Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 124 50 with a stop at 120 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 124 50 and add a December 124 120 Put Spread   1 60  as protection and selling a January 130 Call   1 56  to cover the cost 
Trade Idea 3  Buy a January 125 130 Call Spread   2 09  and sell the January 115 Put   1 27  
Trade Idea 4  Buy the December April 130 Call Calendar   5 25   and look to sell additional short term Calls as the December Calls expire 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which with November options expiration behind sees the markets driving into the shortened Thanksgiving week with a changing of the guard to the small caps 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in its uptrend while Crude Oil works through short term resistance  The US Dollar Index pauses in its short term uptrend while US Treasuries consolidate  The Shanghai Composite is taking a breather in its uptrend and Emerging Markets are consolidating their move higher 
Volatility looks to remain very low keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   On the shorter timeframe the IWM is now taking the lead as the SPY and QQQ consolidate  In the longer frame they still need to prove themselves a leader as the QQQ and SPY mark time  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

123451,344966,FFIV,ZAGG  F5 Networks And Snap Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 10  2017   Zacks Equity Research highlights ZAGG Inc   NASDAQ   NASDAQ ZAGG      as the Bull of the Day F5 Networks  NASDAQ   NASDAQ FFIV      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Snap Inc   NYSE   NYSE SNAP      Here is a synopsis of all five stocks     ZAGG Inc  NASDAQ      is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and carries a growth style score of  A  which automatically puts it on my radar screen   Following the recent beat the stock rallied over  10 and now that it is the Bull of the Day  it is on your radar screen Previously HeldI run Stocks Under  10 for Zacks and I used to have a position in this stock  It was about two years ago that I added the stock at  7 92 on July 28  2015   The position was sold on 12 29 15 for  11 40     the subscribers that followed that trade took home just short of 44  DescriptionZAGG Inc  makes mobile tech accessories for smartphones and tablets  The company operates through ZAGG and mophie segments  It offers screen protection products  battery cases and power management products for tablets  smartphones  MP3 players  cameras  and other electronic mobile devices  device specific keyboards and device agnostic keyboards  earbuds  headphones  Bluetooth speakers  and cables under the ZAGG  InvisibleShield  IFROGZ  and mophie brands  ZAGG Inc is headquartered in Midvale  Utah Recent EarningsThe company reported a solid quarter at the start of the month  The company beat the top and bottom line expectations and the stock moved higher by 4 7  as a result   Revenues were  115M   5M ahead of the expectation while EPS of  0 12 were  0 02 better than expected Estimates Move HigherBack in February of this year  the Zacks Consensus Estimate was  0 53   A few beats later the number has shot higher to  0 82   That is the 2017 number and most investors are looking ahead to the 2018 number The 2018 number started out at  1 00 in May  that kicked higher to  1 10 in July   In early August following the most recent beat  the number has moved higher to  1 13 This is the primary reason the stock is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Bear The Bear of the Day is an article that shows why a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  has become just that  a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The Zacks Rank looks at earnings estimate revisions and the stocks that see negative revisions slide lower on the scale F5 Networks  NASDAQ      has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last three reports   The two most recent reports have also seen the company report revenues that were below expectations DescriptionF5 Networks Inc  is a leading provider of integrated Internet traffic and content management solutions designed to improve the availability and performance of mission critical Internet based servers and applications  The company s products monitor and manage local and geographically dispersed servers and intelligently direct traffic to the server best able to handle a user s request  The products are designed to help prevent system failure and provide timely responses to user requests and data flow Earnings EstimatesThe biggest factor that influences the Zacks Rank is the movement of earnings estimates   When estimate revisions are positive  the stock tends to have a higher Zacks Rank   That is not the case for FFIV The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFIV was  6 47 in March of this year  but it slid to  6 35 in April and is now down to  6 28 The 2018 estimate has also fallen   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 was  7 41 in March and has dipped down to  6 87   That is a big move lower Additional content 3 Reasons to Be Cautious About SNAP s Upcoming Earnings ReportSnap Inc   NYSE      provides technology and social media services  The company s principal product  Snapchat  is a camera application that helps people to communicate through short videos and images  Furthermore  the struggling company will be releasing its quarterly earnings report after the market closes on August 10 Snap Inc  currently sports a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and defeated its earnings estimates last quarter by meager 0 86   Additionally  the company operates in the Internet Software industry  which sits in the bottom 42  on the Zacks Industry Rank Regardless of Snap s Earnings ESP of 3 45   the company holds an inadequate Zacks Rank and is expected to release lackluster earnings of   0 29 per share  which provides a murky financial outlook for the firm If that s not enough  here are 3 additional reasons to be cautious on Snap as we near its earnings report date 1        Signs Of An Overvalued InvestmentSnap currently holds an  F  grade for Value in our Style Score system  which means that we view the company as overvalued  For example  Snap features an Earnings Yield of  20 24  and price sales ratio of 9 06  both of which fall short of the industry averages of  2 12  and 3 62  respectively  Furthermore  Snap Inc  holds an underwhelming P E ratio of  4 80 and lackluster PEG ratio of  0 09  These metrics show that Snap Inc  might not be the smartest security to buy for an investor seeking impressive value on the market 2        Negative Earnings Estimate RevisionsEarnings estimate revisions are the main ingredient for determining a company s Zacks Rank  Snap possesses a murky future pertaining to earnings  For example  as of 30 days ago  Snap Inc  s current quarter earnings estimates were revised to   0 29 per share  which signifies a downward trend of  7 41   Also within the past 30 days  Snap s full year EPS estimates fell from   2 66 to   2 71 per share  which constitutes a decrease of  1 88   Overall  nine analysts covered Snap Inc  for this quarter s earnings release  and two negative revisions have been made 3        Poor Share Price PerformanceSnap s stock has been retreating since its initial public offering back in early March  without showing many signs of hope  Currently  the stock is trading at around  13 51  which is not too far off its all time low of  11 91  Snap s all time high of  29 44 was reached right after its IPO  a period in which a stock s price tends to rise considerably In essence  Snap s share price has fallen by 54 11  since this high was recorded  including a drop of a whopping 15 84  within the past four weeks  Those who have held on the stock since its initial public offering could continue to pay the price this earnings season More

four times the average daily volume over the last 50 days 
  This earnings season is an expectation game   said King
Lip  chief investment officer of Baker Avenue Asset Management

5 GARP Stocks to Benefit from Trump Induced Rebound

	Since Donald Trump s victory in the U S  presidential election  major benchmarks have witnessed a remarkable rebound and made the environment ideal for stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing  But choosing such stocks may not be an easy task and thus may prompt one to look for a strategy that can help in picking quality stocks  This is where growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy comes in 

	While a blend strategy calls for investments in value and growth stocks  GARP strategy tries to find stocks that are undervalued as well as have impressive growth prospects  This strategy is also best suited for an environment where major benchmarks are witnessing a strong rebound in the latter half of a particular time frame after plunging in the first half  Hence  one seeking favorable returns in the current scenario may follow this strategy to add potential stocks to their portfolios 

GARP  Best of Value   Growth Investing 

	Though investors following GARP consider popular metrics of both value and growth investing  the ideal range of these metrics are different from what value and growth investing consider  GARP investing employs popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  and price to book value  P B  ratio   to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued or not 

	In case of P E ratio  investors following the GARP strategy look for a higher value of the ratio compared to value investors  However  they avoid picking companies with extremely high price to earnings ratios  On the other hand  like value investors  GARP investors give precedence to low P B ratios  A ratio less than the industry average is preferred by GARP investors for choosing undervalued stocks 

	The other metrics that are borrowed by GARP investors from the growth investing strategy are strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings growth prospects in the coming years  Unlike growth investors  GARP investors look for stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate instead of choosing those with extremely high growth rates  Growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal in GARP strategy 

	Return on equity  ROE  is another growth metric used in GARP strategy  This strategy considers those stocks that have higher ROE compared to the industry average as a strong ROE is an indicator of superior stocks 

Screening Parameters

	Along with the criteria we discussed in the above section  we have also considered favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy    to make the strategy more profitable

verticals  Enterprise  Service providers and Government  including 4  from the U S  federal  accounted for 65   22  and 13  of total revenue  respectively The company s distributors Ingram Micro  Tech

operating margin  excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one time items but including stock based compensation  increased 100 basis points  bps  from the year ago quarter to 27 3   primarily due to lower adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  Adjusted operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues  decreased 102 bps on a year over year basis The company s

TakeF5 Networks reported dismal second quarter fiscal 2017 results  as both the bottom and top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  year over year comparisons on both counts were favorable  Nonetheless  the company provided a tepid third quarter revenue guidance It is worth mentioning that the company s GBB pricing strategy and its BIG IQ platform remain tailwinds  Revenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by strength across all its business segments and higher software revenues We believe that the company s product refreshes will boost revenues  going forward  Moreover  these initiatives are expected to expand the company s total addressable market and result in client wins Better execution and focus on enterprise and service providers have placed F5 Networks well in the application delivery controller market  Nevertheless  a volatile spending atmosphere and competition from Juniper Networks Inc    NYSE JNPR   remain concerns Currently

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 81 on  496 09 million in revenue  2 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top
F5 Networks has continues to report slowing top and bottom line growth due to the rapidly changing enterprise technology space
With hybrid cloud solutions taking the industry by storm  F5 is seeing waning demand for some of its key products
Enterprise technology is one of the fastest growing sectors in the technology space  F5 Networks is one of those companies that have seized this opportunity to reach new heights  The company is scheduled to release its FQ3 earnings this Wednesday  after the market closes  Despite strong upwards momentum  earnings are expected to continue its steady slowdown 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 81 on  496 38 million in revenue  2 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top  Compared to a year earlier this represents an 8  increase in earnings and 3  in sales  On average the stock increases after a report is released  Through earnings and 30 days following a report  shares have been found to jump by 2  

The company s last report was less than encouraging  with both the top and bottom line slowing down compared to previous quarters  Q1 results marked the first quarter that earnings dropped to single digits in over 2 years  Revenue growth has also creeped closer to flat and negative as F5 attempts to keep up with rapidly changing enterprise technology  As the landscape evolves  the company has been prone to unsold inventory  This has been particularly true with ADC architectures  which are slowly losing favor to hybrid cloud solutions  Though F5 could have a role in hybrid architecture  it isn t something that could happen overnight

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 96 on  520 86 million in revenue  2 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top
F5 Networks has continues to report slowing top and bottom line growth due to the rapidly changing enterprise technology space
A new version of its BIG IQ management platform introduced during the fiscal third quarter was designed to mitigate DDoS attacks like the one witnessed last Friday
What are you expecting for  
Enterprise technology is one of the fastest growing sectors in the technology space  F5 Networks is one of those companies that have seized this opportunity to reach new heights  The company is scheduled to release its FQ4 earnings this Wednesday  after the market closes  Despite strong upside in the industry  results are expected to maintain its steady slowdown 
Analysts surveyed by Estimize estimate earnings of  1 96 for the fiscal fourth quarter  reflecting a 6  increase from a year earlier  Revenues for the period are estimated to increase 4  to  520 86 million  marking a slight improvement from the third quarter  Shares are up 22 5  in 2016 and historically have increased 2  immediately through the print  Despite what appears to be decelerating growth  it clearly hasn t had an impact on share prices  F5 Networks most recent report was less than encouraging  with both top and bottom line growth considerably slower than previous quarters  The quarter recorded an 8  increase on the bottom line and 3  on the top  North American and Asian markets both contributed strong sequential growth while EMEA revenues were down following ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty  particularly the UK s referendum to withdraw from the European Union 
During the quarter the company also introduced a new versions of its BIG IQ management platform  aimed at mitigating DDoS attacks  This is particularly important given the recent cyber attacks last week that shut down some of our largest websites  Its widely expected that the platform will help boost top line growth along with strength across its other business segments and higher software revenues  Ongoing product refreshes coupled with better execution will help F5 capture greater market share 
There still remains a number of near term hurdles the company will need to overcome including weaker IT spending and competition from Juniper and Cisco ",2016-10-26,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-cyber-security-company-is-sending-a-strong-sell-signal-200160674,200160674

new Cloud MVX and MVX Smart Grid offerings  a lower cost intelligent threat detection solution for large enterprises as well as mid market businesses  While MVX Smart Grid is currently available  the Cloud MVX will be launched later this month All these indicate FireEye s efforts to move beyond the enterprise level  end point protection products it had initially started off with  These factors are also likely to aid the company s long term results However  an uncertain economic environment  competition from the likes of Palo Alto Networks Inc    NYSE PANW   and Juniper Networks Inc    NYSE JNPR

123558,345073,FFIV,F5 Networks  FFIV  Stock Up On Reports Of Acquisition Offer,opinion,F5 Networks Inc    NASDAQ FFIV   was among one of the biggest single day gainers during yesterday s trading session  Shares of the company gained nearly 13  yesterday after Reuters reported that it has hired investment bank  Goldman Sachs Group Inc    NYSE GS    to help it in evaluating takeover offers This was also its biggest single day gain in almost five years  At yesterday s closing price of  123 94  the company had a market capitalization of  8 3 billion Citing people familiar with the matter  the international news agency revealed that F5 Networks has received an acquisition offer and has thus approached Goldman Sachs to decide how to proceed F5 Networks is a leading provider of integrated Internet traffic and content management solutions designed to improve the availability and performance of mission critical Internet based servers and applications  In other words  it offers products that help organizations in boosting security and performance of applications and servers We believe that the company s recent move to consider the buyout offer may be aimed to create value for shareholders as slower sales growth and declining profits have led to a significant decline in share prices from the last 52 week high Notably  F5 Networks reported lower than expected results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 on Apr 20  A volatile spending atmosphere and intensifying competition negatively impacted the company s overall performance Furthermore  during the second quarter conference call  the company s management revealed that due to soft market environment in the financial and telecommunications carrier  it is witnessing a decline in bookings  Notably  a major part of the company s overall revenues come from these markets Therefore  by selling itself  F5 Networks will not only create value for investors but also bring in some new talent in the management level  which would reposition the company for growth For buyers too  this is the right time to make an offer as the stock is trading at a discount of 8  from its 52 week high of  135 20  which was achieved on Jul 31  2015 Nevertheless  sources remain doubtful if the recent offer will finally materialize  as F5 Networks has received takeover offers in the past too but had concluded none  As Reuters reported  the company  had previously attracted interest from companies that included IBM Corp   NYSE IBM    Oracle Corp  NYSE ORCL   and Juniper Networks   NYSE JNPR    We will have to wait to see what happens this time ,2016-06-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/f5-networks-(ffiv)-stock-up-on-reports-of-acquisition-offer-200134694,200134694
123585,345100,FFIV,S P 500  New All Time Highs With Room To Run,opinion,T2108 Status  56 0 VIX Status  13 8General  Short term  Trading Call  Hold   Aggressive traders who got long the breakout should stay long  otherwise  buy dips with tight stopsActive T2108 periods  Day  9 over 20   overperiod   Day  2 over 50   Day  32 under 60   underperiod   Day  36 under 70 Commentary It took a little over six weeks  but the S P 500  SPY  finally completed a manic roundtrip that reverses all its losses that essentially began when bond tapering fears gripped the market  While the Federal Reserve  especially Ben Bernanke  said almost nothing new during this time  the market convulsed through a breakdown of the 50DMA to deep oversold conditions to now a strong breakout to fresh  all time closing highs two days in a row The fascinating part of this run up is that all time highs have not yet coincided with a T2108 overbought signal  In fact  at 56 0   T2108 still has plenty of room to run  I am anticipating an overbought signal by Thursday of next week at the current pace  almost 4 percentage points a day on average   The T2108 chart below compares its level at the last closing and intraday all time highs in May and the current levels  The chart re emphasizes how much more room the S P 500 has before T2108 even gets to overbought  not to mention launch into an overbought rally Although there remains rooms to run  T2108  and the S P 500  have already run at a strong pace  The run from oversold conditions has nearly been straight up for T2108 and for the S P 500 a brief pause at 50DMA resistance that had an upward bias  A pullback  even if a brief brushback from the bullish plate for a day or two  would not surprise me but I would not bet on it  Such a dip should be very buyable  The June high at 1652 seems like a natural target The S P 500 has gained a nice 6 8  in the 12 days since the oversold bottom  It reminds me that one of the biggest things missing from my T2108 overhaul is a good way to estimate how long and or how well poorly the S P 500 will do after breaking through a threshold  I tried making 1  2  5 and 10 day predictions   For you machine learning types  I chose Supply Vector Machines with a radial configuration  I figured radial SVM was the best approach given the dispersion of the historical data  The reported error rates are very small but I think that is because the projection is just as likely to be too high as it is too low   The predictions generally only have an upward bias for short oversold durations  one implication is that a trader must be prepared for multiple oversold periods occurring close together  The two graphs below show how historical data drive predictions for S P 500 performance after 1  3  5  and 10 trading days in the 20  overperiod based on the number of days T2108 spent in the 20  underperiod  oversold   In most cases  the longer T2108 spends in oversold territory  the worse the predicted short term performance for the S P 500 The previous oversold period only lasted 2 days  the typical oversold period lasts 1 or 2 days   However  it is VERY unusual for the S P 500 to perform THIS well so soon after an oversold period of ANY duration  This is the context by which I chose to release my well timed SSO calls so quickly  I expected churn and multiple opportunities to get back in at good prices  even a slip back into oversold territory once or twice   The chart above is also a reminder of why I prefer the aggressive strategy of playing oversold conditions by buying BEFORE oversold conditions end  After they end  and they always do   the margin of performance is much slimmer  As I noted in   the benefit of waiting is a sharp reduction in downside risk  smaller drawdowns   Finally  the chart also shows that even after two weeks  traders may need more patience for the payoff from buying after oversold conditions end  there is the possibility for multiple oversold periods to occur in rapid succession before a lasting bottom finally gets printed  yet one more graphic I need to produce one of these days    I needed this patience for two of three of my oversold purchases in individual stocks  F5 Networks  FFIV  went absolutely nowhere after the S P 500 bounced out of oversold conditions  The stock finally sprang to life in the last three days  I sold my FFIV calls toward the end of the second day with the stock trading against 50DMA resistance and just over a week to go before expiration  The long wait made me very eager to lock in profits  but of course I now wish I had exercised just ONE more day of patience  T2108 tells us that there are plenty of stocks left just like FFIV that are late bloomers for the post oversold bounce  As traders and hedge funds scramble to play performance catch up  beaten up stocks like FFIV look more attractive than ever given the apparent upside potential between here and previous highs or even natural overhead resistance Consol Energy  CNX   a second pick  has only come alive in the past week  and I am now trying to wait out the clock to make a profit  My call options expire this coming Friday  Finally  Google  GOOG  has been a great play  but I have not even come close to maximizing the opportunity  The first set of calls were wasted with poor timing  The second set of calls had perfect timing and generated large profits  I never executed a third round to play what has become a very persistent drive following the upper Bollinger Band to fresh all time highs  With buying volume picking up  I think GOOG is a lock for  1000 in the near term  I plan to get more aggressive  but I still prefer to enter on SOME kind of dip Black line  T2108  measured on the right   Green line  S P 500  for comparative purposes Red line  T2108 Overbought  70    Blue line  T2108 Oversold  20  Be careful out there Disclosure  long GLD,2013-07-14,Dr.

123587,345102,FFIV,August Consolidation Offers Chance To Buy Top Stocks  Sectors,opinion,"Stocks saw elevated volume and volatility last week  and the 100 day simple moving average on the S P 500 proved to be the proverbial line in the sand for bullish investors  I opined last week that the market seemed to have sufficiently cycled back down to oversold territory  so with a little more technical consolidation and successful testing of nearby support levels  the next move higher could easily commence at any time  So  the question remains as to whether that was the big new buying opportunity  or whether more backing and filling is needed  Personally  I would prefer to see a successful test of the 200 day SMA  but the market might not be so generous 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market overview 
U S  Treasuries continue to enjoy strong demand  The U S  10 Year yield fell even further this past week  closing Friday at 2 42   So  the bond market is telling us that the Fed will not raise interest rates in the near term  However  high yield corporate bonds  which have enjoyed a multi year bull run as income investors have taken on risk in search of higher yields  saw accelerated losses last week  According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch  total dollar outflows last week were the largest ever and the fourth largest as a percentage of AUM  So  all in all  bonds displayed risk off activity  which of course should be no surprise 
Of course  overbought technical conditions combined with frightening geopolitical turmoil have made equity investors hesitant  And then there was the  100 billion in M A that suddenly collapsed last Tuesday when the Twenty First Century Fox  NASDAQ FOX  acquisition of Time Warner  NYSE TWX  and the Sprint  NYSE S  bid for T Mobile US  NYSE TMUS  both fell apart  Nevertheless  M A and stock buybacks remain robust    and are expected to continue as such 
And Friday saw quite a resumption in bullish sentiment  with green across the board  In fact  all 13 of Sabrient s Baker s Dozen top stocks for 2014 finished the day positive  Interestingly  the five leaders in the portfolio on Friday were those stocks that have been the laggards so far this year  including Huntington Ingalls Industries  NYSE HII   NetApp Inc   NASDAQ NTAP   Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU   Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX   and Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC   Top performers year to date are NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI  and Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  spiked a few times during the week above 17 but closed Friday at 15 77  which is back near the magic 15 level  If VIX can fall back below 15  equity bulls should be able to make a good upside run  Also  there was a lot of put buying last week  and those who took the other side of those trades at the strikes with highest open interest had to short stocks or futures to protect themselves  i e   delta hedge selling   So  if the market can hold up during this expiration week  short covering might be a source of added fuel for the bulls 
Looking at the ten U S  business sectors  Technology has surged to the year to date performance lead  up about  11   Utilities has lost its big lead and now sits in a virtual tie for second place in YTD performance at around  10  with Energy and Healthcare  Notably  since May 1  Utilities has lost about  4  while Technology has gained about  7   At the bottom are Industrial  Consumer Services Discretionary  and Telecommunications  As a reminder  our forward looking SectorCast rankings have consistently put Technology at the top  while Telecom and Consumer Services Discretionary have dwelled at the bottom 
By the way  have you noticed the tremendous outperformance so far this year in the Sabrient Defensive Equity Index  which is tracked by the Guggenheim Defensive Equity ETF  NYSE DEF   compared with the SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY   Guggenheim S P 500 Equal Weight ETF  NYSE RSP   and PowerShares S P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio  NYSE SPLV    DEF is up nearly  10  YTD while RSP and SPY are up less than  6  and SPLV is up less than  4   I have long considered DEF as the original low volatility large cap ETF since 2006  even though SPLV came along in 2011 to claim the mantle  as well as most of the assets  
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  SPY  closed last Friday at 193 24  which is up slightly from the prior Friday  after a week of consolidation and testing of support on elevated volume at the 100 day simple moving average  So far it has held  and Friday was a very strong day across the board  Additional support levels are nearby  including resistance turned support lines at 190 and 187 5  the 200 day SMA around 190  and the lower line of the larger rising bullish channel approaching 188  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic have all turned back up from oversold territory and could rally further from here 

The Russell 2000 small cap index closed Friday at 112 27 and remains well below its important 200 day SMA  But it rallied stronger last week than the large caps  and it looks like it could make a run at its 100  and 200 day SMAs  which are converging at 114  during this rally phase  How it behaves at that test of resistance might be a tell tale sign for the market overall 
Latest sector rankings  
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  iShares US Financials  NYSE IYF    Technology  iShares Dow Jones US Technology  NYSE IYW    Industrial  iShares US Industrials  NYSE IYJ    Healthcare  iShares US Healthcare  NYSE IYH    Consumer Goods  iShares US Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK    Consumer Services  iShares US Consumer Services  NYSE IYC    Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  NYSE IYE    Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM    Telecommunications  iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ    and Utilities  iShares US Utilities  NYSE IDU    Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 
  Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1   Technology still holds the top spot with an Outlook score of 83  The sector displays solid scores across most factors in the model  including solid Wall Street analyst sentiment  net upward revisions to earnings estimates   a good forward long term growth rate  and strong return ratios  The forward P E is below average  Financial has the lowest   as well as insider sentiment  open market buying   Healthcare remains in the second spot this week with a score of 75 as the sector continues to display the strongest  and still improving  sell side analyst sentiment  upward revisions   a good forward long term growth rate  and reasonable return ratios  Utilities has suddenly jumped into the third spot while Energy has plummeted to seventh  largely due to their respective Wall Street upgrades  Financial and Industrial round out the top five 
2   Telecom stays in the cellar this week with an Outlook score of 3  as the sector has low scores on most factors in the model  Consumer Services Discretionary stays in the bottom two with a score of 14  despite a strong forward long term growth rate  Telecom got hit with a lot of new analyst downward revisions 
3   Looking at the Bull scores  Healthcare displays the strongest score of 57  followed closely by Energy  while Utilities remains the clear laggard at 38  The top bottom spread is 19 points  reflecting lower sector correlations on particularly strong market days  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see lower correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the all boats lifted in a rising tide mentality that dominated 2013 
4   Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities is the clear leader with a score of 64  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  Telecom also has shown good relative strength in market weakness  Energy  which has displayed high Bear scores at times lately  now displays the lowest score of 41  The top bottom spread has expanded to 23 points  reflecting low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5   Technology and Healthcare display the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Telecom is clearly the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Healthcare is the leader  followed by somewhat surprisingly by Consumer Services Discretionary  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Energy  which at times has displayed the best Bull Bear combo score  suddenly shows the worst one now  indicating general investor avoidance during extreme conditions 
6   Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings look neutral to me  Utilities has risen at the expense of Energy  and the highest Bull and Bear scores are mixed across the rankings rather than congregated at the top or bottom 
These Outlook scores represent the view that the Technology and Healthcare sectors are relatively undervalued  while Telecom and Consumer Services Discretionary may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or bearish   suggests holding Technology  Healthcare  and Utilities  in that order  in the prevailing neutral climate   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to have moved to neutral from a rules based standpoint because SPY remains below its 50 day simple moving average while staying above its 200 day SMA   
Other highly ranked ETFs from the Technology  Healthcare  and Energy sectors include PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio  NYSE PSI   Market Vectors Biotech ETF  NYSE BBH   and  FirstTrust Utilities AlphaDEX Fund  NYSE FXU  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within Technology  Healthcare  and Utilities  some long ideas include F5 Networks  NASDAQ FFIV   Zillow  NASDAQ Z   Biogen Idec  NASDAQ BIIB   Illumina Inc  NASDAQ ILMN   NRG Yield  NYSE NYLD   and UGI Corp  NYSE UGI   All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also  except for the Utilities stocks  score within the top two quintiles  lowest accounting related risk  of our   a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics   Note  Utilities are not covered by EQR    We have found EQR quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
However  if you think the market will strengthen once again and you prefer to maintain a bullish market bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Healthcare  Technology  and Energy  in that order   But if you have a bearish outlook on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Technology  and Healthcare  in that order

123612,345127,FFIV,Sector Detector  Another Resistance Level Turning Into A Launch Pad,opinion,Well  Punxsutawney Phil didn t see his shadow on Saturday  so the weather forecast is positive  However  investors having their own version of Groundhog Day at Dow 14 000 and S P500 1500 are still trying to decide whether to retreat to safety in anticipation of a severe market pullback  Weakness on Tuesday seemed like the start of a correction  but alas the bulls would have none of that Technical consolidation rather than a steep correction is still the M O  Although bulls are struggling to turn yet another resistance level into a new launching pad  we have seen this dance before numerous times since mid November and really since the Fed quant easing programs launched the March 2009 V bottom  The all time intraday high for the S P500 at 1576  and 1565 closing high  sure seem to be in play for 2013 as some market commentators are thinking we have entered a secular bull market Of course  the ongoing Federal budget negotiations and looming sequester deadline on March 1 are the proverbial elephant in the room  But another possible fly in the ointment was pointed out by Mark Hulbert on MarketWatch on Wednesday when he noted that insiders are aggressively selling shares at an alarming pace  He says the last time the weekly sell to buy ratio was worse was in late July 2011  just before the debt ceiling debacle and resultant U S  credit rating downgrade  As you recall  the Dow eventually fell 2 000 points The S P500 SPDR Trust  SPY  closed Wednesday at 151 16 as it continues a slow technical consolidation since breaking out above tough psychological resistance at 150  The 50 day simple moving average has held after crossing bullishly through the 100 day SMA  Oscillators RSI and MACD have been slow to cycle back down from overbought  while Slow Stochastic is flat lining at the neutral line Since Friday s burst back through 150  SPY has spent the first three days this week testing resistance turned support and consolidating within a sideways channel  The uptrend line of support starting from the bottom of the New Year s gap might ultimately turn into the pole of a bull flag continuation pattern  Until the market can resume its uptrend  the New Year s gap between 142 and 145 is going to act as something of a magnet  since gaps tend to get at least partially filled  After the uptrend line  next support levels are 150  148  and then the convergence of the 50 day SMA and the top of the gap at 145 The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 13 41  and 14 seems to be offering some resistance  which of course is bullish for equities   It is possible for the VIX to continue to work off its extremely overbought technical condition without stocks giving up too much ground Although the frothy technicals are worrisome  odds are that the market goes up from here  A number of commentators have been pointing out similarities in chart patterns to prior periods just before the market tanked  And yes  chart patterns do tend to repeat until they don t  There is always an eventual break in a pattern  Although  This time is different  can be famous last words  it s also true that external conditions do change and new catalysts arise Today  the Fed remains accommodative  still pumping  85 billion per month into mortgage backed securities and Treasuries  Manufacturing is looking stronger  Jobs growth is ever so gradually accelerating  Corporate profits are generally stronger than expected  And the U S  economy continues to expand while Europe stabilizes  VIX remains historically low  There s lots of cash in corporate coffers and on the sidelines  itching to get in on the action  The  risk on risk off  asset allocation theme  with high equity correlations  appears to be giving way to a lower correlation stock picking climate  Overall  equities should continue to attract investors in this environment Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares  ETFs  by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based

As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions Observations  1  Not much changed in this week s rankings  Technology  IYW  stays in the top spot with a score of 81  while Healthcare  IYH  moves back into second place by one point in its battle with Financial  IYF   IYW shows strong projected growth and the best forward valuation  as well as solid return ratios  IYH got some renewed support from Wall Street analysts  although IYF is actually enjoying the most net upgrades 2  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with a dismal Outlook score of 3  as Wall Street has continued to slash estimates  It is again joined in the bottom two this week by Basic Materials  IYM  with a 26 as analysts continued to slash away at forward estimates in the sector 3  Overall  this week s rankings are a little less bullish than last week  Industrial  IYJ  and Consumer Services  IYC  both fell in their scores  while defensive sectors Consumer Goods  IYK  and Healthcare  IYH  rose 4  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy  IYE  is the leader on strong market days  scoring 56  while Consumer Goods  IYK  is the laggard on strong market days  scoring 46  This is only a 10 point range from top to bottom  which indicates high correlation on particularly strong market days  Energy stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Consumer Goods stocks have lagged 5  Looking at the Bear scores  Basic Materials  IYM   which used to be among the worst on weak days  is scoring the highest at 52  Energy  IYE  is the worst during market weakness  as reflected in its low Bear score of 40  But there s still only a 12 point range from top to bottom  which indicates high correlation on particularly weak market days  Energy stocks  which are the strongest on particularly strong market days  have been selling off the most when the market is pulling back  while Materials stocks have held up the best  relatively speaking 6  Overall  Technology  IYW  shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 178  followed by Financial  IYF  at 175  Telecom  IYZ  is by far the worst at 98  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Consumer Goods  IYK  is the lowest at 92  while Basic Materials  IYM  has the best score at 106  followed by Financial  IYF  at 104  This indicates that Materials stocks have tended to perform relatively well lately in all market conditions These scores represent the view that the Technology and Healthcare sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Telecom and Basic Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Top ranked stocks within IYW and IYH include

which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented

123613,345128,FFIV,Skittishness Neutralizes Bullish Conviction,opinion,Last week  I talked about the impressive strength this year in the Dow Jones Transportation Average  but it since has been hit by investors  renewed worries about global economic growth and financial stability  Its fall has been led by weakness in the airlines The bad news has included weaker than expected reports here at home on non farm payrolls  manufacturing and services indexes  and oil demand  along with precedent setting fixes in Cyprus and bellicose rhetoric out of North Korea   a country that increasingly has become a bizarre caricature of itself  All of us who thought the young heir with the Western education might decide to feed his people and seek to become a member of the global economy have been proven sadly mistaken Some end of quarter institutional buying last week with  new money  probably got quickly liquidated this week  It s understandable for investors to be skittish when the S P 500 just set a new all time high but had not yet confirmed the breakout  coupled with the uninspiring news and market commentators screaming for an imminent correction  New money trying to join the bandwagon usually becomes hot money when the breakout fails The iShares Dow Jones Transportation Index Fund  IYT  is down nearly 5  this week  through Wednesday  and sitting right on its 50 day simple moving average  Homebuilders also have taken a hit  as another big winner joins in the profit taking fervor  The SPDR S P Homebuilders ETF  XHB  fell below its 50 day SMA and is also down 5  this week Not surprisingly  the higher beta small caps are struggling  The iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund  IWM  violated its 50 day SMA on Wednesday and is down 3 5  this week  Among the 10 business sectors  Basic Materials and Energy have led to the downside this week  while Healthcare has held up the best  Healthcare now stands alone as the leading sector in year to date performance  while Materials has fallen so hard that it unseated Telecom as the worst performing sector The S P 500 set a new all time closing high of 1570 on Tuesday but failed to break the all time intraday high of 1576  Looking at the charts  the S P 500 SPDR Trust  SPY  closed Wednesday at 155 23 and remains within a sideways channel between about 153 and 157  After falling out of its earlier bullish rising channel  it has been unable to break back in  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all pointing down and touching the neutral line  Bollinger Bands are pinching together about as tight as they ever get during this ongoing technical consolidation beneath the all time high The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   has risen to close Wednesday at 14 21  but it is still quite low on a historical basis  We ll see if 15 remains strong resistance  which would bode well for equities As long as the central banks  led by the Federal Reserve  keep the liquidity spigots open as they intend to do  equities remain the primary beneficiary  particularly given the lack of appealing alternatives  We might get a long anticipated pullback that truly tests bullish conviction  but I would expect it to be followed by a strong resumption of the uptrend  Next week kicks off another corporate earnings season  so all eyes will be watching Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares ETFs by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  The multi factor model considers forward valuation  historical earnings trends  earnings growth prospects  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus estimates

portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions Observations  1  Technology  IYW  continues to hold the top spot  with an Outlook score of 81  which is down noticeably from past few weeks above 90  IYW continues to display a low forward P E  strong projected long term growth  and the best return ratios  but Wall Street support has diminished somewhat  Defensive sector Consumer Goods  IYK  stays in second place with a 71  Financial  IYF  holds third with a 65 and has apparently stabilized at this level 2  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with a rock bottom Outlook score of 0  It is the worst or nearly worst in every metric in the model  including poor support  negative earnings revisions  among Wall Street analysts  the worst return ratios  the highest  worst  forward P E  a low projected long term growth rate  and poor insider sentiment  It is joined in the bottom two this week by Basic Materials  IYM  with a score of 26  as it continues to swap positions with Consumer Services  IYC   IYM has endured the most net earnings downgrades 3  Overall  this week s rankings maintain a neutral tone  and might even be leaning slightly defensive  Defensive sectors IYK  IYH  and IDU rank in the top five  while economically sensitive sectors IYJ  IYE  IYM  and IYC are all in the bottom half and scoring well below 50  Only four score above 50  and the wide top bottom spread has narrowed a bit to 81 points 4  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy  IYE  remains the leader on particularly strong market days  scoring 59  Telecom  IYZ  is the laggard on strong market days  scoring 48  The top bottom spread is a relatively narrow 11 points  which continues to indicate relatively high correlation on strongly bullish days 5  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  is serving as the favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  scoring 60  but Healthcare  IYH  took a big 6 point jump to 58 this week as it held up well during the recent market weakness  Basic Materials  IYM  is the worst during extreme market weakness as reflected in its low Bear score of 42  The top bottom spread is 18 points  which indicates lower correlations when the market is particularly weak    i e   it pays to be in the right sectors when the market is weak 6  Overall  Technology  IYW  shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 183  Telecom  IYZ  is by far the worst at 104  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Healthcare  IYH  has jumped to the top with an impressive total score of 113  followed by Utilities  IDU  and Consumer Goods  IYK  at 110  Materials  IYM  displays by far the lowest score at 91  This indicates that Healthcare stocks have performed the best in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish  while Materials stocks are avoided altogether These Outlook scores represent the view that Technology and Consumer Goods sectors may be relatively undervalued  while Telecom and Basic Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Top ranked stocks within Technology and Consumer Goods include F5 Networks  FFIV   SolarWinds  SWI   NVR Inc   NVR   and Polaris Industries  PII  By the way  Sabrient s  Baker s Dozen  top 13 stocks for 2013 is still up a robust 8 7  through Wednesday since inception on January 11  despite taking hits this week in top performers from transportation and energy like Air Lease  AL   Alaska Air Group  ALK   and Marathon Petroleum  MPC   Over the same timeframe  the S P 500 is up 5 5   Note that Sabrient will soon

123616,345131,FFIV,Smash Hit Or Trash It  Gigamon s Upcoming IPO,opinion, I think you should call your broker immediately so that you can try to get some shares in the IPO  I expect it to be red hot   So said bombastic CNBC host  Jim Cramer  in reference to today s debut for Milpitas  California based Gigamon  GIMO   Given that Cramer is a tad prone to overhyping a situation  it s what attracts viewers  right    let s step back for a moment and give reason a chance to prevail  Let the Record Show  Not that I m keeping track or anything  but I did beat Cramer to the punch   singling out Gigamon as an IPO to watch back in December 2012  The reasons for my optimism couldn t be more straightforward  The company is leveraged to one of the most promising  forever growth  trends  Big Data  As I pointed out to Tech   Innovation Daily readers recently  the amount of data we create and share continues to boggle the mind  Based on the latest estimates  it s expected to more than triple by 2015  Gigamon fits into this trend nicely  as it helps companies manage their networks and the flow of data across them  Specifically  its patented Flow Mapping Technology helps blue chip companies ensure the reliability  performance and security of their network infrastructure  This isn t about simply being positioned to grow  though  It s about growing in the here and now  And Gigamon is doing that rapidly  In the last quarter  sales increased an impressive 55   The company is profitable  too  which is a true rarity in the world of tech IPOs  Gigamon reported annual earnings per share in 2010  2011 and 2012 of  0 19   0 58 and  0 21  respectively  On such merits  I have to agree with Cramer  even though I hate to admit it   The company does  indeed  possess the potential to be  red hot   Not to mention that it s coming to market at precisely the right time  Up  Up and Away According to Renaissance Capital  a total of 74 companies have gone public so far this year  raising  17 billion  On average  they ve rallied 19  over their offering prices  which is a tad better than the performance of the S P 500 Index  However  digging into the data reveals that technology IPOs   particularly those tied to the cloud computing space   have fared much better  Take Marketo  MKTO   for example  It s up 66  from its IPO price of  13  And then there s Tableau Software  DATA   which is up 78  from its IPO price of  31  It s important to put those gains in perspective  too  Both companies debuted less than one month ago  So  again  Gigamon appears to be hitting the market at a time when investors  appetite for tech IPOs is rabid  The key question remains  though  Is it attractively priced  If the Price is Right  By the time you read this  underwriters will have already priced Gigamon s IPO  and trading will be set to begin later this morning  For the purposes of our analysis  though  let s assume that it priced at  20 per share  the high end of the proposed range   That s being conservative  mind you  As John Fitzgibbon of IPOScoop com said in a note to subscribers yesterday afternoon  the deal is possibly five times oversubscribed  So anyone who followed Cramer s advice to call their broker for an allocation wasted their time  There won t be any shares available for us lowly retail investors  And we re bound to see pent up demand for shares once trading begins  more on that in a moment   For right now  let s work with numbers we can reasonably expect  At  20 per share  Gigamon would debut at a valuation on par with its peers   Infoblox  BLOX  and F5 Networks  FFIV    based on their enterprise value to sales ratios  Of course  there s a slim chance that the stock will begin trading anywhere close to where it officially prices  It s common for compelling IPOs to  pop  once trading begins  Especially when  as I mentioned above  there s so much interest leading up to the debut  That s what happened with Tableau Software  Despite pricing at  31 per share  the first trade in the aftermarket crossed the tape at  47 per share  52  higher   Same goes for Marketo  It  popped  25  out of the gate to trade at  20 per share  Now  Gigamon is growing sales at nearly identical rates to both Marketo and Tableau  at around 60    So it s certainly a possibility that Gigamon will experience a similar opening day boost  That would put shares in the  25 to  30 range when trading begins and we finally get a shot to buy  Bottom line  Again  I hate to admit it  but Cramer is right  Gigamon represents a compelling  Buy  under  25 per share  That being said  I typically insist on a profit potential of at least 25  when investing in IPOs  So we should look for a pullback closer to  20 per share before entering a position  I doubt we ll witness that in the first day of trading  But it s worth putting Gigamon on your watch list for an opportunity to buy on the dips in the coming weeks ,2013-06-12,Louis
