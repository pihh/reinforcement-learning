6331,227846,ANAT,Stocks Attempt A Pre Election Rally,opinion,I was supposed to be in New York City this week  but Sandy the super storm had other ideas  Some writers are suggesting that since the storm has passed  we can all start getting back to business  But of course  some densely populated areas In New York and New Jersey have been so devastated that normalcy is a long ways off  Staten Island  for example  was right in the bull s eye of the storm  but is largely still awaiting assistance  Desperation abounds With Election Day arriving next Tuesday  a logical question is how the massive storm hitting mostly Democratic   blue   states might impact the presidential election  Some believe that it allows President Obama the opportunity to stop campaigning and display himself as our strong and caring leader  to his advantage  On the other hand  some believe that the storm will reduce voter turnout among those who were less likely to go to the polls under the best of circumstances  which would play to Governor Romney s advantage  Furthermore  the election might become a referendum on the role government should play in our lives    including disaster relief Instead of flying to New York as originally planned  I drove down to Los Angeles a couple of times this week  and I was struck by the eerily light traffic  My theory is that we are so interconnected that a major storm on the East Coast can impact traffic on the West Coast  at least partly because of the rash of canceled flights  The stock market closure on Monday and Tuesday probably played a part  as well I find it notable that consumer sentiment continues to rise to its highest levels in five years  And despite a weak earnings season  stock valuations are still pretty good from a historical standpoint  However  not everyone feels that way  I was at the Singular Research  Best of the Uncovereds  Conference in LA today  and one of the attendees expressed his opinion to me that all stocks currently fall into one of two camps  those that are in distress and those that are soon to be in distress  He is focused on deep value stocks to buy long  but he also is evaluating opportunities to go short  For example  his recent successful plays include investor darling Apple  AAPL  The S P 500 SPDR Trust  SPY  closed Wednesday at 142 83  Looking at the chart  price remains below its 50 day simple moving average  the bottom of the bullish rising channel that was in place since the beginning of June  and the bottom of the sideways trading channel support line at 143  However  oscillators like RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic have each turned up bullishly  Price got a nice bounce from the prior support line at 140 and the 100 day moving average  so the new sideways channel is bounded by 140 and 147 Strong support is just below at the 200 day SMA near 138  Breaking back through the 143 level and the bottom of the prior rising channel  now nearing 145  might not be easy  Nevertheless  a rally into Tuesday s election is quite possible The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 16 69  which is still low in its historical range  All in all  this remains a bullish sign for stocks Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares  ETFs  by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions ObservationsFinancial  IYF  is still in the top spot with an Outlook score of 77  as stocks within the sector continue to be supported by Wall Street analysts raising earnings estimates  It has a reasonably low forward P E and strong return on sales  although its return on assets and return on equity are on the low side  The second spot now goes to Healthcare  IYH   which has received a surge in analyst sentiment and now scores 73  Technology  IYW  falls to third  even though its Outlook score rose a point to 70 Overall  the Outlook rankings remain decidedly neutral  with the more aggressive and defensive sectors mixed about in the rankings  Moreover  the range from the top to the bottom Outlook scores have tightened significantly this week  reflecting a lot of uncertainty in which sectors will emerge as the strongest  Last week the rankings had a top bottom range of 70  but this week it has tightened to 53 Telecom  IYZ  has made a huge jump out of the cellar all the way up to sixth place with a 20 point rise in its Outlook score from 13 to 33  mainly because Wall Street has suddenly started increasing earnings estimates in the sector  However  analysts have piled on with net downgrades on stocks within Basic Materials  IYM  and Energy  IYE   The bottom of the rankings shows Utilities  IDU  with an Outlook score of 24 and Materials  IYM  at 28 Looking at the Bull scores  Materials  IYM  is the clear leader on strong market days  scoring 66  Telecom  IYZ  is now the weakest on strong market days  scoring 43  In other words  Materials stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Telecom stocks have lagged Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  is the clear investor safe haven on weak market days  scoring 63  which is far ahead of second place IYH at 50  No other sectors have a Bear score above 50  Technology  IYW  remains the weakling during market weakness  as reflected in its low Bear score of 39  In other words  Tech stocks have been selling off the most lately when the market is pulling back  while Utilities stocks have held up the best Overall  Financial  IYF  shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a commanding total of 182  Telecom  IYZ  is the worst at 125  As for Bull Bear combination  Materials  IYM  is the best at 109  while Technology  IYW  and Telecom  IYZ  share the worst combined score of 92 These scores represent the view that the Financial and Healthcare sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Utilities and Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our one to three month forward look Top ranked stocks within IYF and IYH include American National Insurance  ANAT   Visa  V   The Cooper Companies  COO  and Watson Pharmaceuticals  WPI   Notably  Visa came through on Wednesday with an impressive quarterly report Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs ,2012-11-02,Scott Martindale,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-attempt-a-pre-election-rally-142078,142078
6335,227850,ANAT,Bulls Keep Their Powder Dry As Presidential Debates Begin,opinion,With all the recent central bank actions  e g   the Fed s unlimited QE3  the ECB s Outright Monetary Transactions  and the Bank of Japan s ongoing initiatives   the expectation of infinite liquidity is now baked into stock prices  So  further movement will have to come from new catalysts  like good old fashioned earnings growth   However  Wall Street s earnings projections have steadily dropped since the beginning of the year  and they are now forecasted to be negative for the third quarter indeed the worst quarterly performance since 4Q2008  Lately  many big firms have been guiding lower earnings during the pre announcement season  Although odds are that it would be taken by bulls as a welcome buying opportunity  a deluge of weak earnings reports could lead to some selling   Even Fed Chairman Bernanke opined that fiscal policy has to become more proactive to help push the economy forward  Gee  ya think  On Wednesday night as I write this  the presidential debate season kicked off in grand style  and I think Romney made a compelling case for a change in fiscal policy   Here are a few of my general observations after Wednesday s first debate  First  I was heartened to see that for a change we actually have two candidates who are competent  articulate  and passionate  yet mutually respectful  Nevertheless  gridlock in the Federal government might render essentially irrelevant the presidential election results  Second  it s a lot easier for an incumbent to shine in a debate when the country is doing well than when things are still rough  Four years ago  Obama was smooth  confident  and on the attack  This time he was on the defensive  Although he was still poised  confident  and presidential overall  he seemed almost fatigued to have to be going through all this re election stuff  uncomfortable with political posturing and unwilling to counterpunch   Romney eagerly played the role of attack dog  He was strong and well prepared  spry and energetic like a college student running for class president  His constant smirk was a little off putting  as was his propensity to talk too much  but I think it simply reflects his passion for the challenge  Romney s main weakness was his lack of details on how he pays for his   secret   plans or replaces existing legislation   The President was particularly vulnerable in that he has failed to stimulate job growth while ballooning the deficit  rather than cut it in half as originally promised  His regular excuse is that he inherited a crashing economy  but of course he knew that going in when the promises were made  Regulation has become notably more burdensome  and Romney kept harping on what a job killer this has been  Also  Obama often talks about how his policies are similar to Bill Clinton s  so they should produce the same thriving economy and debt reduction  But of course  Clinton was fortunate enough to reign during the golden years of world peace  unprecedented capital spending on technology  in preparation for Y2K   and the dawn of the Internet Age and e commerce it would have been hard to fail during such a time   All in all  Romney got off to a good start on his  Hunt for Red October   i e   the challenge of changing the swing states from Democrat blue to Republican red during this critical month   Almost all sectors  other than Energy and Materials  remain near their recent highs  demonstrating the strong correlations among equities  However  as ConvergEx pointed out recently  this might spell the end of the macro driven asset performance and high equity correlation of the past five years and usher in the return of the art of stock picking  If so  it will be a welcome change for many frustrated analysts  traders  and portfolio managers  not to mention quant modelers   Exactly one year ago  the market staved off a significant breakdown of support and the threat of yet another massive October selloff by staging a huge reversal in the last 45 minutes of trading resulting in a 4  intraday move for the S P 500  from down 2  to up 2   It turned out to be the start of an impressive 32  one year rally   During the past year  Financial  IYF  and Consumer Services  IYC  have been the leaders  up 40   as banks capitalize on yield spreads and consumer debt as risen  with Healthcare  IYH  close behind at 36   followed by Technology  IYW  at 32  carried mostly by incredible performance from mega caps Apple  AAPL  and Google  GOOG   up 79  and 54   respectively  AAPL sold off quite a bit recently after its iPhone 5 problems came to light  but late in the day on Tuesday it bounced strongly off support at its 50 day simple moving average  Not surprisingly given the bullish environment  defensive sectors Consumer Goods  IYK  and Utilities  IDU  were the laggards at 22  and 13   respectively   The S P 500 SPDR Trust  SPY  closed Wednesday at 145 09  It has been trading within a bullish rising channel since the rally started at the beginning of June  including a brief  false breakout  after the Fed s QE3 announcement  Price remains in the middle of that rising channel  hugging the 20 day simple moving average  but still above the 50   100  and 200 day SMAs  The 200 is fast closing in on the 100 day  Price seems to have found a higher line of support within a tighter trading channel  It also seems to be forming a neutral symmetrical triangle while the Bollinger Bands rapidly converge  which is like a coiled spring getting ready to break in one direction or the other  It just needs a new catalyst  There is a lot of strong support below current levels  including the previous triple top resistance turned support at 142  the rising 50 day SMA at about the same level  the bottom line of the rising channel just below  and then prior strong support at 140  Then there is the 100 day SMA near 138 and finally the rising 200 day SMA  Oscillators like RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all turning up bullishly  But of course they can turn on a dime   The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 15 43  This is still quite low and generally bullish for stocks   Now the big question is  what comes next  Well  I can tell you that lots of things remain on the side of the bulls   The trend is your friend    Don t fight the Fed    Seasonally strong time of year   Persistently low VIX   Increasing institutional volume   Strong contrarian indicator in high levels of bearish sentiment as reported by the American Association of Individual Investors  AAII    Infinite liquidity with no signs of inflation   A weak U S  dollar that helps boost earnings for the major multinationals   Low borrowing rates and historically high levels of corporate cash for buybacks  dividends  and acquisitions   Historically high risk premium for stocks vs  bonds    And of course  stocks usually precede the direction of the economy  With infinite liquidity baked into prices  they just need a new catalyst   Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares  ETFs  by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  In addition  the table also

indicators of recent sentiment trend   As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Observations 1  Financial  IYF  has risen to the top spot with an Outlook score of 81  followed closely by Technology  IYW  at 80   Stocks within IYF got a big boost from Wall Street s analysts this week as earnings estimates for banks were raised while estimates for Tech stocks were lowered  IYW still displays an impressive combination of low forward P Es  strong projected long term growth  and solid return ratios  Healthcare  IYH  remains in the third spot with an improved score of 70 2  Telecom  IYZ  stays at the bottom of the Outlook rankings with an Outlook score of 15  Stocks within the sector are burdened by the highest forward P Es and the worst return ratios  plus net downgrades from Wall Street  Utilities  IDU  rises out of the bottom two this week as Basic Materials  IYM   Energy  IYE   and Consumer Services  IYC  tie for second worst with a 25 3  Overall  I would categorize the rankings as neutral  with defensive sectors like Consumer Goods and Healthcare in the top five and Utilities rising to sixth  while economically sensitive sectors like Consumer Services and Basic Materials sit in the bottom five 4  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy  IYE  is the leader on strong market days  scoring 63  followed closely by Basic Materials  IYM   Utilities  IDU  is still by far the weakest on strong days  scoring 32  In other words  Energy stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Utilities stocks have lagged 5  Looking at the Bear scores  Healthcare  IYH  and Utilities  IDU  are the investor safe havens on weak market days  scoring 60  Surprisingly  Technology  IYW  has been abandoned the most by investors during recent market weakness  as reflected by its low Bear score of 40  followed closely by Materials  IYM   In other words  Tech stocks have tended to sell off the most when the market is pulling back  while Utilities and Healthcare stocks have held up the best 6  Overall  Financial  IYF  now shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 184  Telecom  IYZ  is the worst at 115  As for Bull Bear combination  Energy  IYE  remains the best at 108  while Utilities  IDU  is the worst with a dismal 92 These scores represent the view that the Financial and Technology sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Telecom and Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Top ranked stocks within IYW and IYF include  American National Insurance  ANAT   MasterCard  MA   Cognizant Technology Solutions  CTSH   and Cerner Corp  CERN
