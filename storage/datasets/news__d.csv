14740,236255,D,FSUTX Or PRUAX  Which Utilities Fund Should You Buy ,opinion,The U S  utilities sector has put up a decent performance so far this year  owing to the ongoing U S  China trade uncertainties that have lasted for more than a year now  In fact  investors who seek to shield their portfolios from the deteriorating trade war conditions could actually consider investing in the sector  After all  utilities are considered a defensive sector as it witnesses stable demand in times of market turbulence Utility Sector a Sweet SpotThe Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLU  has added 21 7  on a year to date basis  Needless to say  the sector acts as a safe haven for investors when trade uncertainties persist in financial markets  This is because the demand for products and services offered by this sector is seldom lower by virtue of their nature Earlier this week  President Donald Trump warned that the much awaited trade deal between the United States and China may take place after the 2020 U S  elections in November  Trump said that he was in no hurry to sign an agreement until he runs for re election  This puts the trade deal almost a year away from now Addressing a news conference in London  where he was attending a NATO meeting  the President said that the United States was doing  very well  from the trade war  He also claimed that the trade dispute was harming Beijing more than Washington and accused China of  ripping off the US for many  many years   Such developments have put equities in a tight spot Further  escalating trade tensions between the United States  Brazil  Argentina and France have kept investors on tenterhooks Trump tweeted on Dec 2 that he was re imposing tariffs on steel from Brazil and Argentina  Both countries had received exemptions from the 25  steel levies and 10  aluminum tariffs in May 2018 Choosing the Right Utilities FundConsidering the aforementioned events  one can note that trade related issues have only amplified and therefore  investing in utilities could be the right move  However  choosing the right mutual funds for your portfolio come be a tiresome task  Let us  thus  take a look at two mutual funds that invest in the utilities sector and discuss which of these is best suited for your portfolio Fidelity Select Utilities Portfolio  aims for capital growth  The non diversified fund invests the majority of its assets in securities of companies primarily engaged in the utilities industry and companies generating most of their revenues from their utility operations  FSUTX invests in U S

period  To see how this fund performed compared in its category  and other  1 and  2 Ranked Mutual Funds   The Fidelity Select Utilities Portfolio Fund  as of the last filing  allocates its assets in top two major groups   Intermediate Bond and Large Value  Further  as of the last filing  Exelon Corporation  NASDAQ EXC   Dominion Resources  NYSE D  and Sempra Energy  NYSE SRE  were the top holdings for FSUTX Sporting a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  1  Strong Buy   FSUTX was incepted on Dec 10  1981  and carries an expense ratio of 0 78   The fund requires no minimal initial investment PGIM Jennison Utility Fund   Class A  seeks total return by combining capital growth and current income  The fund invests the majority of its assets in equity and equity related and investment grade debt securities of utility companies  PRUAX is a non diversified fund This Sector Utilities product has a history of positive total returns for over 10 years   Specifically  the fund s returns are 12 6  over the 3 year and 7 5  of the 5 year period  To see how this fund performed compared in its category  and other  1 and  2 Ranked Mutual Funds   The PGIM Jennison Utility Fund   Class A  as of the

173118,394634,D,A Trump Darling  Gas Exports  Set to Gain as Iran Deal Dies,news," Bloomberg     Another darling of the Trump administration is poised to gain from the Iran deal breakup as oil surges  Natural gas exports 
With the move to curb Iran s oil output encouraging more shale drilling  prices for natural gas produced alongside crude in West Texas could crater  falling to zero some days  according to Tudor Pickering Holt   Co  Already  the gas sold at West Texas  Waha hub is down 51 percent for the year 
That s bad for producers selling the fuel in the U S   but good for companies that export it in tankers  As the market for liquefied natural gas grows in Asia  being able to source gas at its cheapest should give U S  exports a leg up 
From Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to the President himself  the White House has long sung the praises of increasing American LNG exports to help trim the trade deficit with Asian countries  Meanwhile  the Permian boom has filled pipelines to capacity  trapping gas in the region and making prices there the cheapest of any major U S  shale play 
 I doubt this was a driving factor by the administration  to impose sanctions because  we just don t have that much capacity built up for LNG exports   said Anastacia Dialynas  an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance  But indirectly  she said   if it results in a structurally higher oil price  it definitely makes U S  cargoes more attractive  
Only  Cheniere Energy Inc   NYSE LNG  and Dominion Energy Inc  NYSE D  are currently exporting U S  shale gas worldwide  but as many as three more projects could be up and running in the next year  Several other companies  including Tellurian Inc  NASDAQ TELL  and Nextdecade Corp  NASDAQ NEXT   plan to start LNG projects within the next decade 
Once the sanctions formally kick in  they ll make long term LNG contracts linked to oil prices in other parts of the world more expensive  potentially increasing demand for agreements tied to cheap and abundant U S  shale gas  West Texas gas has been slashed in half this year to reach  1 96 per million Btu Friday

The chance to ship LNG from the United States  where natural gas output is booming  was touted as the solution to Asia s soaring energy needs and mounting fuel import bill    and firms rushed in to grab a slice of the affordable action 
But after splashing out billions of dollars to build numerous plants to liquefy and export the gas by ship  at least three buyers spooked by the scale of their commitments and risks of heavy financial losses want out  in part 
Moves to sell off supply are likely to boost global spot market liquidity as trading houses vie for the business and challenge the historical dominance of the oil majors 
Japanese utilities Tokyo Gas  T 9531  and Osaka Gas  T 9532  as well as India s Gail  NS GAIL  are dialing back on their U S  LNG commitments via stake sales after realizing they cannot handle the initial surge of volume due to low demand at home 
 The large volumes they have taken on are a risk in the near term  but they make sense in the longer term as gas demand across the region will grow   an industry source said 
More critical  they sense that overexposure to U S  gas markets could prove costly after a recent run up in prices showed how the fuel s global competitiveness could be eroded 
All three players have tapped European trading houses  energy firms and utilities  including Germany s E ON  DE EONGn  
to take some of the LNG off their hands through five year sales deals  sources from the companies approached have told Reuters 
 Most of these Far East players are realizing they cannot handle exposures to the U S  Henry Hub  gas price  and now want to get rid of supply   said a trading house source whose company was approached by one of the sellers 
Falling crude oil prices have sharpened anxieties about the cheapness of U S  LNG as many existing long term gas supply deals in Asia reflect the price of Japanese crude imports 
With oil slipping below  100 a barrel  LNG deals linked to these prices become more attractive relative to U S  gas price linked LNG  which has rebounded in recent years  traders said 
Still  a true danger level for U S  LNG kicks in only if oil falls to  80 a barrel  seen as unlikely in the years ahead 
TRADERS SEE OPENING
The global LNG market has historically been dominated by oil majors including Shell  L RDSa   BP  L BP  and BG Group  L BG  hoarding supply and limiting access to new entrants  such as trading companies  whose arrival on the scene in recent years has renewed hopes of a growth spurt in spot trading liquidity 
While trading giants such as Vitol  Trafigura and Gunvor have established themselves as a force in LNG  helped by the gradual exit of U S  banks  they have not challenged the majors for market share as they did in crude oil trading in the 1970s 
Opportunities like the current one provide space for such maneuvering  say industry  company and trade sources 
 The trading houses are looking at this as an opening   a source from another approached European company said 
SELLING STRATEGIES
Tokyo Gas  which bought 1 4 million tonnes per annum of LNG over 20 years from U S  East Coast project Cove Point  has offered to sell over half  or 0 75 million tonnes year  to at least one southern European energy firm  a source there said 
Its offer for a five year supply deal was rejected due to the high price pitch  significantly above what it paid project developer Dominion Resources  N D  for LNG due to begin exports in 2017 
Part of the problem for Japanese players is that steps towards gas market liberalization at home make it hard to know how much gas utilities will need going forward  traders there said 
Following suit  Osaka Gas is offering five year deals to Europeans and others from its 2 2 million tonne year  1 tonne   1 102 metric tons  position at the Freeport facility  in Texas 
The mark up varies between sellers but in one case is at least  1 per million British thermal units  mmBtu     a reference term used to express LNG prices    above what it initially paid  a source with knowledge of the matter said 
Buyers of LNG export capacity in the projects cited above paid 15 percent above the benchmark U S  Henry Hub gas price  currently  4 per mmBtu  plus a premium of  3  3 20 per mmBtu  regulatory filings show 
A Tokyo Gas spokeswoman and an Osaka Gas spokesman declined to comment 
India s Gail  by far the biggest U S  LNG buyer of the three  is offering 1 million tonnes per annum for its first five years of supply from the Sabine Pass project on Louisiana s Gulf Coast  sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters 
Company officials were not reachable on Friday  but Gail in the past has stated its aim to trade some of its U S  LNG 
Deliveries from Cheniere Energy s  A LNG  Sabine Pass project are due to start in 2016  Gail has also signed up for 2 3 mtpa from Cove Point 
 Gail is offering cargoes from its Sabine Pass position    nobody wanted their Cove Point supply since the Gulf Coast terminal is attractively positioned closer to South America and the Panama Canal   which provides a short cut to lucrative Asian markets  an industry source said 
In a sign of the potential cost escalation for U S  LNG as it gets resold between companies  Gail at first demanded of buyers a  1 5 per mmBtu premium to the price it agreed to pay terminal developer Cheniere  the source said  It also wanted to sell the supply for a 15 year period  not five 
Roundly rejected by buyers  it changed tack by lowering its asking price and term offer to attract bidders 

A tender launched by Gail to sell the LNG will close this month  the industry source said

173256,394772,D,High Yield Stocks To Buy As Interest Rates Tumble,opinion,"The market seems to be following the old investment idiom  sell in May and go away  The S P 500 has fallen almost 6  since the beginning of May and the 10 Yr US Treasury note has seen its yield slide 12  in the same time frame  as investors flock to fixed income safe havens  Foreign bond options appear increasing destitute as economic uncertainty shake their financial positions and the US treasury yields look to be a much more attractive option for foreign investors facing negative interest rates  further driving down US Treasury rates 
I discussed the negative implication that these lowering interest rates have on banks in my article    In this article  I will take a look at stocks that thrive as interest rates decrease  More specifically  high yield stocks that investors will flock to as bond yields tumble 
Utility Stocks
Utility stocks have a similar flight to quality effect that treasury bonds do because of their consistent cash flows and dividend payouts  which is typically higher than the yield that treasury bonds can boast  In this uncertain market period  it is important to have some type of low beta utility stock in your portfolio to hedge some of the risks  Here I will take a look at a utility stock I like as well as entry and exit strategies 
Dominion Energy   NYSE D  
I ve been watching Dominion energy for about a year now  and over the past 52 weeks this utility powerhouse has outperformed not only the utility sector but also the broader market  Below you can see D s  blue  52 week performance  having gained 16 7   compared to the S P  red   which has only been able to return investors 2 2  in the same time frame 
 
Utility stocks like Dominion will continue to outperform the broader market in times of volatility  Dominion is able to boast of a 4 8  dividend  considerably higher than 3  average in the utility industry  As investors see rocky waters in the equity market and treasury yields dropping  a 4 8  yield in a growing utility company appears to be a savvy buy  D s beta is 0 23  making it an excellent portfolio hedge 
Dominion has been bouncing around the mid 70s range for the past month  I would buy D closer to  70 and hold until the equity market stabilizes 
MLPs
Master limited partnerships are set up so that profits are only taxed when they are distributed to investors  All available income is required to be distributed to shareholders making these stock very high yield  These types of firms are useful in capital intensive sectors such as energy  These won t have the low beta hedge of utility stocks but they achieve a much higher yield 
Enterprise Products Partners   NYSE D  
EPD is a midstream oil and natural gas firm that focuses on connecting producers with consumers  Its operations include 49 200 miles of pipeline and have a capacity of approximately 260 million barrels to store crude  LNG  and other commodities products 
Enterprise Products has been able to grow its margins considerably over the last 5 years  from below 8  gross margins in 2014 to the north of 15  that EPD is able to achieve today  Their bottom line has been able to attain very consistent growth with profits more than quadrupling in just 10 years 
EPD has shown investors 17  total returns so far in 2019 and it looks like these returns may endure  This stock has beaten the last 4 quarters of earning by double digit percentages and analysts have continued to raise EPS estimates propelling this stock into a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
EPD has a beta very close to 1  implying that it will follow the broader equity market closely  This is a great buying opportunity if you believe that the equity market will stay afloat for the next 12 to 18 months 
REITs
Real estate investment trusts are very similar to MLPs in that they are required to distribute almost all of their earnings to investors  meaning that these stocks will return investors a hefty dividend  There are all types of REITs  including residential  commercial  medical  or even tech REITs that are used to house servers  REITs will typically do better as interest rate fall due to the higher yield becoming sufficient return for the added risk of an equity investment 
The GEO Group   NYSE GEO  
GEO is a REIT that focuses on private correction   detention facilities  making up 64  of their top line  They also have a business segment called GEO Care  which assists with rehabilitation as well as proprietary electronic monitoring business that they are able to contract out to the government  Their fasted growing business unit is their international segment which  has grown 30  in the past year 
GEO has shown consistent top line returns over the past 5 years as well as a strong bottom line  but the stock has not been able to reflect this performance  Over the last 52 weeks  this stock has fallen more than 15   far below any benchmarks performance 
With this poor performance comes low valuation metrics across the board  GEO s forward P E is 8x  far below the industry average of 17 1x  The firm is also trading at a forward EV EBITDA of 10 9x significantly below the industries 18 8x  GEO is estimated to grow both bottom and top lines in the mid to upper single digits this year and continue that growth moving forward  GEO still boasts an 8 8  dividend yield which should make any investor feel warm and fuzzy inside 
Analysts have increased full year estimates a significant amount in the past month propelling this stock into a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   This stock is perceivably undervalued and would make a great value buy with the bonus of a massive yield 
Take Away 
Falling interest rates create an opportunity for investors to get long in some high yield options  As American and foreign investors continue to drive up bond prices and pull down yields these investments that I have discussed appear increasingly attractive  Make sure your investment strategy lines up with the high yield investment option  whether you are trying to hedge risk with a utility stock  follow the market with the MLP or take a chance with my low cap REIT option

 Beijing has reportedly pledged to reduce retaliatory tariffs and other barriers on American products  while Washington is set to reciprocate with the rollback of most  if not all  tariffs imposed on at least  200 billion worth of Chinese goods since last year  The expected improvement of the Sino U S  relationship should also act as a major tailwind for the global liquefied natural gas  or LNG  market as China is the second biggest importer of LNG behind Japan   In particular  shares of Cheniere Energy  Inc    NYSE LNG   gained around 1 6  on Monday on reports that the U S  s only listed LNG

demand reached 319 million tons last year   up by 27 million tons from 2017 and significantly higher than the 100 million traded in the year 2000  The 300  million tons of LNG trade in 2018 was enough to power about 643 million homes Global LNG demand is likely to continue growing for the next few years and is projected to rise to around 384 million tons per annum by 2020  Supplies from Chevron led   NYSE CVX   Gorgon and Wheatstone mega projects in Australia are already being absorbed by the strong demand While the increasing demand for gas in the European power sector will be a key factor in the near term LNG supply rise  the consumption boost is primarily set to come from Asian importers like China  India  South Korea and Pakistan as part of efforts to switch from coal and heating oil

imports of LNG rose 40  in 2018 to 16 million tons Investors should also note that China s crackdown on pollution has created a long term positive trend for LNG demand growth with the country required

173313,394829,D,Playing It Safe With Dividend Paying MLP And Utility Stocks,opinion,"Stocks on Thursday opened lower  putting the S P 500 on pace to snap its longest winning streak in months  Whether the streak will indeed be broken remains to be seen  but Thursday s uncertainty is a reminder that a continued rebound from December s selling won t always be smooth sailing especially with key companies issuing sluggish guidance 
Nevertheless  Associate Stock Strategist Ryan McQueeney did want to dip his toes back in the water  albeit cautiously  this week  after cutting some of the Income Investor portfolio s sluggish stocks before the New Year 
Ryan took a defensive posture  acknowledging that stocks were well off the lows but arguing that it still makes sense to be risk averse in our current climate  His picks to pull this off were MPLX   NYSE MPLX    a midstream energy master limited partnership  and utility giant Dominion Energy   NYSE D   
MPLX should provide some security because midstream companies are typically the least price sensitive  and as an MLP  it promises a steady cash income  Sure  there are some tax considerations to factor in with these types of companies  but the promise of near term gains and strong dividend payments were enough to convince Ryan 
Another factor behind Ryan s decision to add MPLX to the portfolio was a  Buy the beaten down stocks  philosophy  While not necessarily dependent on oil prices  MLPs didn t make it out of last year s volatility in equities and commodities unscathed  as the industry s index fell about 24  in the final three months of 2018  Ryan is hoping that MPLX will continue to rebound strongly from there 
Meanwhile  Ryan likes Dominion Energy for many of the same reasons people typically buy utilities  including its healthy dividend payout and promise of stability  Dominion Energy yields about 4 7  annually  and its shares are trading at a slight discount to their industry average  Plus  the stock has a beta of just 0 21 
Dominion even offers strong growth prospects  with analysts projecting a long term EPS expansion rate of 6 6  right now 
And what s the cherry on top of all of this  Both of these stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  earning them Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ratings  Check out today s video to hear more of Ryan s thoughts on MPLX and D

173327,394843,D,These 4 Natural Gas Stocks Could Be Big Winners In 2019,opinion,Natural gas futures took a tumble last week  declining around 15   after forecasts of bearish weather outlook raised some red flags regarding heating demand  On Friday  natural gas for January delivery fell 7 2   to settle at  3 827 per MMBtu  The contract was down 14 7  for the week   the biggest in almost three years Although expectations of milder than expected December temperatures hinted at softening consumption  we believe the commodity is still supported by a robust long term growth narrative  As such  we feel recent weakness is an opportunity to buy energy companies with a lot of exposure to natural gas Natural Gas Rockets Higher in 2018Natural gas futures  which last month rose to its highest in four years  returned attractive gains in 2018  and are still trading significantly up in the year to date  despite the recent plunge In fact  natural gas prices are on a tear  Prices are up around 30  since the start of the year and soared 41  last month  making it the market s best performing commodity of November  Natural gas recently broke the  4 per MMBtu mark for the first time in four years with cooler weather conditions resulting in strong demand for the heating fuel  Despite skyrocketing production  natural gas entered the winter season with stockpiles at their lowest in 15 years Even now  the current storage remains well below benchmarks  At 2 914 trillion cubic feet  Tcf   natural gas inventories are nearly 20  under the five year average and the year ago figure Positive Long Term Thesis  U S    AbroadThe fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run  considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia Pacific region in particular The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow 43  from 2015 to 2040  Countries in Asia and in the Middle East   led by China s transition away from coal   will account for most of this increase  The replacement of coal fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects have also contributed to the strength in natural gas demand At the same time  natural gas has now replaced coal as the top choice for electricity generation in the United States  The demand for cleaner fuels and the commodity s relatively lower price has catapulted natural gas  share of domestic electricity generation to   from 25  in 2011 New pipelines to Mexico  together with large scale liquefied gas export facilities like Cheniere Energy  Inc  s   NYSE LNG   Sabine Pass terminal and Dominion Energy Inc  s   NYSE D   Cove Point export plant  have meant that exports out of the U S  are set for a quantum leap  As per the Energy Department  gross liquefied natural gas exports are set to average 5 25 Bcf per day in 2019  increasing nearly 80  from this year  Apart from surging exports  higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand Natural Gas Roadmap for 2019Yes  natural gas had a great 2018  till now that is  but what about 2019  Will history repeat itself While it s hard to predict whether natural gas will soar again next year  there s reason to believe that 2019 could be an excellent one for natural gas stocks  In particular  if the current  2018 2019  winter turns out to be colder than normal  the surge in expected demand   in the face of relative deficit of natural gas inventory   could trigger a large rally in the commodity s price The strong year to date rally and the possibility of further price gains does not necessarily indicate that every natural gas scrip would be a wise pick  To guide investors to the right picks  we highlight four stocks that carry a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy

173360,394876,D,Warm Weather Boosts Natural Gas Consumption For Power Burn,opinion,The U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed a smaller than expected increase in natural gas supplies on rising power sector demand About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage ReportThe Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report   brought out by the Energy Information Administration  EIA  every Thursday since 2002   includes updates on natural gas market prices  the latest storage level estimates  recent weather data and other market activities or events The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of natural gas  It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas weighted companies and related support plays Analysis of the Data  A Smaller than Expected Rise in StorageStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 96 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended May 25  below the consensus market guidance of 100 Bcf gain The fifth injection of the 2018 refill season was also lower than the 5 year  2013 2017  average addition of 97 Bcf for the reported week though it exceeded last year s build of 80 Bcf  At 1 725 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    natural gas inventories are 500 Bcf  22 5   under the five year average and 788 Bcf  31 4   below the year ago figure Fundamentally speaking  total supply of natural gas averaged around 86 6 Bcf per day  up by 1  on a weekly basis due to slight increase in production  Meanwhile  daily consumption remained essentially flat at 70 2 Bcf as increase in demand triggered by higher natural gas usage for power generation was offset by weaker residential commercial demand In a boost to the commodity  warm weather in the South and Midwest increased natural gas demand for air conditioning by 7   The higher electricity demand supported prices  which ended the week at  2 962 per MMBtu   just shy of the psychologically important  3 level Positive Long Term ThesisThe fundamentals of natural gas continue to be favorable in the long run  considering the secular shift to the cleaner burning fuel for power generation globally and in the Asia Pacific region in particular The EIA predicts global demand for the commodity to grow from 340 Bcf per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040  Countries in Asia and in the Middle East   led by China s transition away from coal   will account for most of this increase Rising ExportsAnd it will be the world s largest gas producer U S   which will step up to meet this soaring demand  With domestic prices struggling to break the  3 per million Btu threshold  U S  natural gas companies see a big opportunity in selling cheap U S  production at higher prices to rest of the world  In fact  more than 50  of the domestic volume growth in the near future will be used for export in the form of liquefied natural gas  LNG   As per Paris based International Energy Agency  IEA   the United States will vie with Australia and Qatar as the top LNG exporter by 2022 New pipelines to Mexico  together with large scale liquefied gas export facilities like Cheniere Energy  Inc  s   NYSE LNG   Sabine Pass terminal and Dominion Energy Inc  s   NYSE D   newly constructed Cove Point export plant  have meant that exports out of the U S  are set for a quantum leap In fact  as per the Energy Department  gross liquefied natural gas exports are set to average 2 92 Bcf per day in 2018  increasing more than 50  from last year  Apart from the growing use of LNG and booming exports  the replacement of coal fired power plants and higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand with price eventually settling well above  3 The perceived price strength augurs well for natural gas heavy upstream companies like Cabot Oil   Gas Corporation   NYSE COG    Chesapeake Energy Corporation   NYSE CHK

173602,395118,D,Will LNG Exports Increase Your Electric Bill ,opinion,"By this time in 2015  the first liquid natural gas  LNG  exports from the United States should begin their journeys to points in Asia and Europe 


That s when Cheniere Energy Inc s  ARCA LNG  Sabine Pass terminal is scheduled to be completed and begin chilling natural gas to 260 degrees below zero for transportation 



The terminal marks the beginning of a major increase in LNG exports from the United States  And with increased exports comes new demand 



The problem is  many experts believe this excess demand will cause energy prices in the United States to spike higher   just in time for next winter 



According to speculators  you should be preparing for some hefty energy bills 



At least that s what conventional wisdom says 



Will Prices Skyrocket 



First of all  let me shed some light on the timeline for natural gas exports 



In reality  I doubt that Cheniere will meet its own deadlines  The fact that Cheniere has taken more than a decade to get the terminal even close to completion gives me little faith that the terminal will be ready next year 



The schedule seems too optimistic  Realistically  I think LNG exports will begin in earnest two years from now from a variety of sources  including Cheniere  Dominion Resources Inc  NYSE D  Cove Point Facility on the Chesapeake Bay and another facility that ConocoPhillips    is involved with in Texas should begin exports in 2016 and 2017  respectively 



Regardless of exactly when they start  however  LNG exports are on their way 



Based on the current natural gas prices of  4 per British thermal unit  Btu  in the United States  the price per Btu will be around  10 in Europe  slightly less for South and Central America  and close to  12 for Asia 



This will undercut the market prices that those countries are currently paying   between  1 and  3 per Btu  When you multiply the new prices by millions or billions of Btus  you re talking about some serious money 



The United States will be responsible for a large chunk of those exports  Cheniere has stated that when its operations are fully engaged  it will be buying over 6  of the natural gas produced by the United States  Add in the other projects I mentioned  and you re over 10  



With United States exports about to blast higher   along with the increased demand   experts are expecting LNG exports to force natural gas prices much higher 



Don t Jump Off the Bridge



The issue here is that conventional wisdom is often wrong 



Natural gas demand will increase   there s no doubt about that  By the end of this decade  the United States will grab the third spot  behind Qatar and Australia  on the LNG export leaderboard 



However  the price of natural gas in the United States will NOT spike as a result of anything other than speculation 



You see  the same thing happened   Speculation brought natural gas call options to a  10 strike price during the polar vortex earlier this year  That speculation sent natural gas prices shooting above  6 per thousand cubic feet  mcf   only for them to come crashing down to around  3 this past summer 



If there s one thing the United States is flush with  it s natural gas  Investors should keep in mind the solid evidence indicating natural gas  abundance 



For instance     burning the natural gas that accompanies the oil to the surface   because they had no market for it 



And consider that natural gas rigs have declined by more than 50  this past decade due to greater efficiency  yet supplies of natural gas have increased as more users have adopted this energy source 



Yes  natural gas is abundant  In reality  it s too abundant  That fact alone will keep natural gas prices in a tight range between  4 and  5 for the next few years with intermittent variations based on weather conditions 



LNG exports will do nothing more than stoke greater production from vast fields that are sitting idle  due to current prices   If you re going to bet on natural gas exports  bet on the companies that will export the gas   and not on the commodity itself 



And  the chase  continues ",2014-11-23,Karim Rahemtulla,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-lng-exports-increase-your-electric-bill-233389,233389

In my opinion  this changes the investing dynamic considerably  This change in the individual s investing dynamic primarily relates to suitability  When a person is younger and earning a paycheck  it can make sense to employ more aggressive growth oriented investing strategies  Both time  and ideally  a steady paycheck are working in your favor  If you make investing mistakes along the way  as most everyone does  you have the luxury of time and fresh capital coming in to bail you out 
In contrast  when a person matures and enters their retirement years  the capital they have accumulated is logically more precious  Consequently  preservation of the capital that you have spent a lifetime accumulating often does  and should  take precedence over making more 
This often reminds me of a couple of relevant quotes attributed to Will Rogers where he said   I am not so much concerned with the return on capital as I am with the return of capital   And perhaps more apt to the thesis of this article   Live your life so that whenever you lose  you re ahead   At this point I want to clarify what I speaking about  I am not simply suggesting that age in its own right should automatically change your investing dynamic 
In other words  I am not suggesting that a person automatically loses their edge or acumen simply because they have become older  The central issue is time   not advanced age 
One of the most important benefits with investing is time in the investment  Compounding is a powerful investment attribute  however  it is an attribute that functions best over long periods of time 
In the same vein  I am not a fan of the adage  I don t buy green bananas anymore  that many mature investors often declare  Stated more directly  I am not suggesting that retired investors should avoid taking any risk with their investment portfolios  Frankly  all investing entails a certain amount of risk  Therefore  avoiding all risk is literally impossible 
On the other hand  I am a believer in taking only calculated and thoroughly reasoned risks that are commensurate with your financial situation or status  In other words  no investor  whether retired or still earning a paycheck  can avoid all risks  However  they can to a great extent mitigate the risk they are taking by clearly understanding what they are  where they come from and how they can be controlled 
At the end of the day  and as it relates to all investing  there is no substitute for comprehensive research and due diligence  Knowledge is power for every investor in every stage of their life 
To summarize  it is often okay and even appropriate for retired investors to assume a certain amount of risk  However  it s critically important that the risk taken is clearly understood  and even more importantly  continuously monitored  Perhaps there is no area of investing where these principles more appropriately apply than in the high yield investing arena  Therefore  this article is offered to reveal and articulate the risks  dangers and advantages of reaching for yield  
Common Sense and Reaching For Yield
It is no secret to anyone that interest rates are near all time lows  As an alleged attempt to stimulate growth  the United States has implemented a zero interest rate policy  ZIRP   In part 1 of this series    I laid out the current yields on Treasury bonds from U S  6 Month bonds up to 30 Year bonds 
Almost unbelievably  a 30 year Treasury bond currently only yields a little over 2 9   let s call it 3  for expediency  As I did in the above article  and will do it again now  knowing the yield currently available from the lowest risk fixed income investments should serve as a common sense and most conservative benchmark for the yields you can expect on your investments  Consequently  when evaluating the yields available on any theoretically riskier classes of investments  the 3  available on riskless investments should serve as a guide 
In other words  when you come across any investments with yields above 3   you should automatically recognize that there is greater risk involved  In that context  the higher the yields are that you come across  it only logically follows that the risk taken to achieve them must become proportionately greater  When the yields get extremely high  you should immediately recognize that the risks become extreme 
In part 2A of this series  found here  I also presented a broad review of the current yields available from what I consider 4 primary categories of quality dividend growth stocks  Those yields generally ranged from a low of 1 1  to a high in the 7  range  However  there were a few outliers above that in the REIT category 
Therefore  we have a perspective of what level of yield we can reasonably expect from riskless Treasury bonds and relatively high quality dividend paying stocks  My point being that anything significantly above that should automatically raise red flags  
Aggressive High Yield Investments  Are They Suitable For Retirement Plans 
Just as I did with presenting the 4 categories of quality dividend growth stocks in part 2A of this series  I offer the following listings of the most prominent categories of extremely high yielding investments  However  there is a material difference between what I m offering here and what I offered in the previous installment 
With the quality dividend growth stocks  I screened the overall universe and only presented companies that I considered fairly valued or close to it  With these more aggressive investments  I am simply listing the most prominent that I was able to find  
Therefore  I want it to be crystal clear that I am not recommending any of the stocks on the following lists  Instead  I am simply offering a listing of what is available in high yield investments  Frankly  as a stickler for only investing in stocks when they are fairly valued  I will readily admit that I find it difficult if not impossible to value most of the entities listed below  There are reasons for that which I will elaborate on as I discuss each category 
However  this also leads me to state that in the general sense  one of the great disadvantages of investing in the most aggressive high yield entities lies in the complexity of analyzing them  Consequently  and based on what I submitted in the introduction to this article  as a general rule I do not consider most of the following entities suitable for retirement accounts  Of course  there are exceptions to every rule  Therefore  I am not emphatically stating that retired investors should never invest in any of the following entities  On the other hand  I do believe that they should only be invested in based on comprehensive due diligence and or a clear understanding of the characteristics they possess  especially those relating to risk  
Aggressive Yield  BDCs and MLPs
For efficiency s sake  I have grouped business development companies  BDCs  and master limited partnerships  MLPs  into one heading  Although there are significant differences between these two business structures  there are also similarities that motivated me to group them together 
The primary similarity is that both BDCs and MLPs generally offer high yields  Additionally  both entities have complex capital structures and significant tax ramifications and considerations for investors  Following the table which lists many of the prominent BDCs and MLPs I will feature examples utilizing the  on each entity where I will offer some general discussions about the nature of each entity 
Additionally  since the scope of this article is more general in nature  I will not be delving deeply into discussions about what either of them is or how they work  However  I will provide links to research on each that the reader can go to in order to learn more about BDCs and MLPs  
Main Street Capital Corporation  N MAIN   A Reasonable Quality Fairly Valued BDC
I offer the following brief explanation of BDCs courtesy of Wikipedia 

 A business development company  BDC  is a form of unregistered closed end investment company in the United States that invests in small and midsized businesses  This form of company was created by Congress in 1980 as amendments to the investment Company act of 1940  Publicly filing firms may elect regulation as BDC s if they meet certain requirements of the investment Company act  BDCs are similar to venture capital or private equity funds since they provide investors with a way to invest in small companies and participate in the sale of those investments  However  VC and PE funds are often closed to all but wealthy investors  BDC s  on the other hand  allow anyone who purchases a share to participate in the open market  This feature often attracts money to newly public BDC s  thereby giving them a faster way to raise capital for investments than VC funds  

I believe the above brief overview of BDCs provides insights into some of the risk associated with this asset class  BDCs are often investing in small startups  and there is an inherent risk that the small new enterprises will prove to be successful  I believe this also explains some of the operating inconsistencies found in many BDCs 
My first example in the business development company space is Main Street Capital Corporation  I specifically chose this example because its current yield is on the low end of what is often available from BDCs  This is consistent with my general theory that risk gets higher as yields get higher 
In the same context  Main Street Capital Corp has one of the highest S P credit ratings of any BDC on the list  Furthermore  as the following earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  reveals Main Street Capital Corp also has produced a consistent record of earnings and dividend growth  and price has tracked and correlated to earnings consistently over time  On that basis  this particular BDC also appears to be attractively valued  Given everything I have said so far on Main Street Capital Corp  it is one BDC that I might feel comfortable about recommending for investment in retirement portfolios  But frankly  my conviction is not high  
When you examine the performance of MAIN associated with the above graph  you can gain some insight on why I might potentially be comfortable with this particular BDC  Dividend payments have been reasonably consistent and have grown rapidly  Additionally  capital appreciation has correlated closely with the company s earnings achievements over time  Therefore  total return generated by this BDC has been significantly above average and its distribution of cash to shareholders extremely high relative to the average stock  
As previously mentioned  this article is offered as an overview of available high yield investments  Therefore  I will not delve deeply into the ins and outs of these asset classes  However  for those investors interested in learning more about BDC s consult the following links  and  

TICC Capital Corp  O TICC   A BDC offering Extreme Yield  Suspect Fundamentals
My second example in the BDC space goes to the opposite extreme of what we saw with MAIN  TICC offers a current yield of 16 8  which is quite enticing in today s low to moderate yield environment  It is understandable that income hungry investors might be enticed by such a generous dividend yield  However  current yield is rarely the whole story  In contrast to what we saw with MAIN  this BDC has a significantly less attractive earnings and dividend history  Consequently  I personally would not be comfortable recommending this BDC for investment in retirement portfolios   When you examine the performance of TICC Capital Corp associated with the above graph you discover some rather troubling results  Although income is important to retired investors  capital appreciation should also be an important consideration  In this case shareholders would have seen their capital depreciate by more than 55  from an original  10 000 investment to a current worth of  4 430  I believe this places a bright spotlight on the risks associated with investing in extremely high yield entities  On the other hand  total cumulative dividend distributions have been exceptional albeit inconsistent  TICC cut their dividend dramatically in 2008 and 2009  and there was virtually no growth in 2014  Importantly  consensus expects a significant dividend cut for 2016  This brings into question what the actual future yield on this BDC might turn out to be  br 
KCAP Financial  Inc   O KCAP   Another BDC offering Extreme Yield  Suspect Fundamentals
Since this article is significantly oriented towards the risk and dangers of investing in high yield securities  I offer a second example of a BDC I would not be comfortable recommending for investment in retirement portfolios  In this case I will let the earnings and price correlated graph and performance report speak for itself  My purpose for providing a second example is to drive home the risk aspect associated with investing in BDC s  
Energy Transfer Partners L P   N ETP   An Apparently Fairly Valued  High Yield Midstream MLP
MLPs have very complex business and ownership structures  For example  there are four publicly traded partnerships in the Energy Transfer family  ETP is but one of them  Additionally  MLPs technically pay distributions  not dividends  Consequently  investments in MLPs produce a K 1 which must be filed and reported on the investor s tax forms including IRAs  Therefore  although MLPs can be utilized in IRAs  the K 1 filing discourages many investors from utilizing them 
Additionally  there are three primary different types of MLPs each with different risk profiles  These are upstream  midstream and downstream  ETP is a midstream MLP which are considered the least risky MLP category  However  all MLPs contained a higher degree of risk than most traditional corporations  in my opinion  To learn more about MLPs  their complexity  advantages and disadvantages there were 2 recent articles on seeking alpha with contrasting viewpoints  and  
In my opinion  the greatest disadvantages of investing in MLPs relates to their complex ownership structures and tax filings  Consequently  as I previously indicated  I believe they are most appropriate for either sophisticated investors  or individual investors desirous and capable of performing comprehensive due diligence  Moreover  as most regular readers of my work will attest  I am a stickler for only investing when I believe fair value is manifest  However  I have found MLPs extremely difficult to analyze when utilizing traditional fundamental valuation techniques or tools 
The following earnings and price correlated graph on Energy Transfer Partners illustrates that there is a very poor correlation between price and earnings  However  upon closer examination  you will discover that there is a meaningful correlation between price and dividends  the honeydew green or white appearing line on the graph   br  Consequently  when I have analyzed MLPs I have discovered that the price to dividend  distribution  expression provides a reasonable perspective of fair value on most every MLP  Admittedly  I do not have a precise analytical thesis or principal to base this on  However  I have reviewed virtually every known MLP and have found that the relationship between price and dividend  distributions  to be highly correlated and therefore  valuable as a valuation expression 
The following F A S T  Graphs  on Energy Transfer Partners is presented with only dividends  distributions  and price  In other words  earnings and the normal P E ratio have been removed  By analyzing this view  we discover clear periods of time when price is above the dividend  distribution  line and therefore overvalued  Several times  when price is touching the dividend  distribution  line and therefore appearing fairly valued  and finally  times when price is below the dividend  distribution  line and therefore appearing undervalued  as is the case with Energy Transfer Partners currently 
I will repeat that this might not be purely scientific analysis  but the correlations are certainly evident  Consequently  I will be utilizing the same expression of price and dividends  distributions  on the additional MLPs I present  The reader can judge for themselves whether they see any value in this analysis when attempting to make buy  sell or hold decisions on MLPs   When evaluating the performance associated with the above graph  note that Energy Transfer Partners started the time frame fairly valued based on the price and dividend  distribution  analysis  and on that same basis  appears currently undervalued  Nevertheless  Energy Transfer Partners has produced impressive returns over this time frame  Both capital appreciation and cumulative dividend income has exceeded the S P 500 by a strong margin  However  I remind the reader that there are tax implications associated with those distributions  
Linn Energy  LLC  O LINE   A High Risk Upstream MLP with Deteriorating Fundamentals
Upstream MLPs are universally considered the most risky class of MLPs  The following graphs on Linn Energy clearly validates and justifies that view 
Note that the yield listed on the FAST FACTS box to the right of the graph is technically in error  This is primarily due to the current volatility and fluidity of their distribution policy   to their website which announced their current suspension of distributions  Nevertheless  the recent deterioration and operating results places a bright spotlight on the risk associated with investing in high yield MLPs  especially upstream MLPs  Admittedly  when things were going their way  LINE produced a high level of income distribution  However  the recent turmoil in the energy sector changed things dramatically and abruptly 
Just as I did with the Energy Transfer Partners  example above  I offer the price and dividend  distribution  only graph on Line Energy below  The correlation between price and distributions is quite profound  However  this also points out that valuations can change dramatically when fundamentals change  In the case of Line Energy  the biggest fundamental change has been the recent collapsing of dividends  distributions    When you evaluate the performance associated with the above graphs you discover a high level of cumulative dividends  distributions  over time  However  you also discover the potential capital appreciation  depreciation  risk that is associated  High yield can be very attractive when things are going well  but if you re not careful and diligent  it can bite you hard on the capital appreciation front  
Aggressive Yield  Mortgage REITs  mREITs 
Mortgage REITs are another high yield  high risk asset class that I personally do not consider suitable for most retirement portfolios  When you consider the baseline availability of current yields previously discussed  the extremely high yields available from mREITs should cause you to take pause and ask an important question  How can mortgage REITs provide such a high level of current yield relative to bonds and blue chip dividend growth stocks  The answer is simple and straightforward   leverage  Mortgage REITs are highly leveraged investments  and although leverage can dramatically increase returns  it can also wipe you out in a heartbeat  To learn more about how this works I offer the following  that discusses the risks associated with mREITs  
Annaly Capital Management  Inc   N NLY   High On Yield Low On Growth
Annaly Capital Management is perhaps one of the best known and most widely held mREITS  It offers a current yield of almost 12  and trades at what might at first glance appear to be a low P E ratio of 8 4  However  closer scrutiny would dictate that this has been a normal valuation level  normal P E ratio  for the company over time  I believe this chronic low valuation is indicative of the market s attitude regarding the risk associated with investing in mREITs  But perhaps the most important takeaway from analyzing the long term graph on Annaly Capital Management is the inconsistency of both historical earnings performance and historical dividend performance  When investors see a high yield reported as a mere statistic  it can be very misleading   When you review the associated performance with the above graph on Annaly Capital Management you discover that total cash distributions have been enormous over time  Cash distributions alone would have generated approximately 2 7 times your original investment This is one of the advantages of investing in extremely high yielding investments such as mREITs 
On the other hand  capital appreciation has been nil  but thanks to the total amount of cumulative dividends paid  Annaly Capital Management has actually outperformed the S P 500 on a total return basis  However  for investors relying on the income their portfolios generate to live on  numerous dividend cuts could be very trying  
Resource Capital Corp   N RSO   Extreme High Current Yield But Spotty Long Term Record
Resource Capital Corp  provides an excellent example where enticing current yields only tell part of the story  Once again  I will let the graphs speak for themselves  However  note the very poor record of historical earnings growth as well as the continuous drop in dividend distributions leading to under performance against the S P 500 on a total return basis  Dividend distributions were significantly higher  but capital was significantly destroyed  
Aggressive Yield  Royalty Trusts
The following is a brief description of royalty trusts courtesy of Wikipedia 

 A royalty trust is a type of corporation  mostly in the United States or Canada  usually involved in oil and gas production or mining  However  unlike most corporations  its profits are not taxed at the corporate level provided a certain high percentage  e g  90   of profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends  The dividends are then taxed as personal income  This system  similar to real estate investment trust  effectively avoids double taxation of corporate income  Royalty trusts typically own oil or natural gas wells  the mineral rights of wells  or mineral rights on other types of properties  An outside company must perform the actual operation of the oil or gas field  or mine  and the trust itself  in the United States  has no employees  Shares of the trust generally trade on the public stock markets  but the trust itself is typically overseen by a trust officer in a bank  

The following links to MorningStar s Stocks 500 Investing Classroom  and  describe the advantages and drawbacks of investing in royalty trusts  There are advantages and disadvantages to investing in royalty trusts and they are clearly articulated in the above links to MorningStar  However  for simplicity sake  the important factor is to recognize that royalty trusts own a finite amount of resources  and once those resources are depleted  the trust is typically closed  
Sabine Royalty Trust  N SBR   One of the Most Successful Of All Royalty Trusts
When Sabine Royalty Trust was originally formed in 1982 it was expected to have a life of approximately 10 years  Today  more than 30 years later  it has produced an extraordinary amount of profits and distributed cash flow for its shareholders  However  as I will later illustrate  this particular royalty trust appears to be the exception rather than the rule  
Sabine Royalty Trust could be the poster child for proponents of investing in high yield securities  Since 1996  the trust has produced almost  75 000 of distributable income based on a one time  10 000 investment  This represents a significant advantage of investing in successful royalty trusts when things work out  Additionally  Sabine Royalty Trust has also outperformed the S P 500 on a capital appreciation basis  
Dominion Resources  N D  Black Warrior  N DOM  and Hugoton Royalty Trust  N HGT 
I offer the following royalty trusts  Dominion Resources Black Warrior and Hugoton Royalty Trust  as examples of how royalty trusts are theoretically designed to work  Once again  I will let the graphs and associated performance reports tell the story  However  I direct the reader s attention to the continuing depletion of earnings and distributions over time 
On the other hand  I also direct the reader s attention to the significant amount of cash distributions that both of these royalty trusts have generated  One of the great advantages of royalty trusts are large distributions  However  one of the great disadvantages is the likelihood of eventual termination of the trust when all assets are depleted  Consequently  I don t consider most royalty trusts suitable for retirement portfolios  
As a bonus  I have prepared a free analyze out loud   which provides a more in depth and detailed look at advantages and disadvantages of investing in high yield securities  
Summary and Conclusions
As indicated in this article  there are many high yield investment opportunities that investors can consider  However  high yield alone does not tell the whole story  Each of the major high yield asset classes offer numerous risks that should be carefully considered before laying your money down  There can be great advantages to investing in high yield securities when things are going well  On the other hand  when things get bad  they can get very bad and it can happen very quickly  Consequently  I suggest only the most sophisticated or diligent retired investors include high yield securities in their retirement portfolios  If you reach too high for yield  you have to be careful you don t fall off the roof

173629,395145,D,Epic Opportunity In Gold Stocks,opinion,First  let me say I ve been way too early on this call  I ve been wrong and don t deny it  You have to own up to mistakes  learn from them and be humble  Moving along  the precious metals sector is likely days or potentially hours away from a bottom  With respect to Gold  we are targeting  1180 or slightly below with  1080 as a worst case scenario  The stocks are a bit more instructive for several reasons  First  they have a more consistent history and second  the stocks bottomed ahead of Gold  using daily closing prices  at the major lows in 2000 2001 and 2008  Using data from the Barron s Gold Mining Index  BGMI  and the HUI Gold Bugs Index  HUI  we put together a chart of all of the major declines in gold stocks  We also annotated the ensuing recoveries Downturns A  B and C occurred in a secular bull market while E occurred following the 1980 high  Note that the current downturn  D  is very similar to B C  and E in terms of length and depth  A B and C were followed by spectacular recoveries and even E resulted in a 205  rebound in only seven months  G and H also produced very strong rebounds  Also  Mebane Faber has provided some data that show how a particular market can perform after enduring 60  to 90  declines  Source Link Below we plot monthly charts of GDM  GDX   XAU and HUI  The sector appears to be one more or perhaps two more down days away from touching major  multi year support  One learning point for me is that when a market is in a severe decline  you have to wait for major support  That matters far more than negative sentiment or the secular trend The mainstream continues to be bearish on this sector and in some places  misinformed about the sector in general  Josh Brown is a widely read mainstream blogger who also appears on CNBC daily  I happen to agree with a fair amount of what he writes and his style is refreshing  He s also been bearish on the gold stocks for a while and I give him credit for that  while I became bullish way too early  A few days ago he posted some very negative thoughts on the sector following a television appearance by a gold fund manager who struggled to make a positive case for gold stocks  To be fair to the manager  one shouldn t expect to find any in depth or long term actionable analysis on a show known as  Fast Money   which is far more concerned about the next two days than the next two years Brown s blog post not only was devoid of any real fact based analysis but highlights how the mainstream continues to misunderstand precious metals  Given that he blogs  appears on tv daily and has to meet with clients  he may not have the time to do exhaustive historical research  Furthermore  I was quite surprised to see his post highlighted in Seeking Alpha as if it provided any worthwhile analysis He disputes the fact that Gold benefits from cracks in the financial system and asserts that nobody bought Gold when the cracks appeared  He goes on to say that if the stock market crashes  gold stocks crash also If one is focusing on a very tiny period  then this is true  However  the cracks actually appeared in early 2007 when Gold was trading in the mid  600s  It reached  1000 in February 2009 before the bear market in stocks ended  The gold stocks didn t perform as well but they bottomed five months before the stock market and by late 2009 had rallied back to their pre crisis highs   They performed even better after 1929   And this is the entire sector  Most industry insiders say it is a terrible idea to buy the entire sector  Mainstream oriented advisors like Brown play ETFs as they may not have the time to perform the research necessary to generate better returns  Furthermore  what is this obsession with such a small period of time  I don t know of anyone buying precious metals just to cash in on a potential immediate move  They buy because of long term trends Here is Brown s biggest mistake  While gold stocks did crash in 1929 and 2007  but quickly recovered in both cases   gold stocks can gain fantastically when the stock market is in a cyclical bear  The correlation between the two can take many different forms but when the two are negatively correlated it can be hugely positive for gold stocks The two were negatively correlated from 1972 through 1978  The gold stocks turned down in the middle of 1972 while the S P 500 continued to make new highs for almost six months  While the S P had its nasty bear market  the gold stocks absolutely exploded by nearly 400   Once the stock market bottomed  the gold stocks consolidated beneath their highs  As the recovery gained steam  the gold stocks brokedown  From 1976 1977 the gold stocks recovered as the S P declined about 20  The next example is from the late 1990s until late 2002  The two markets were negatively correlated during the end of the bull market and that correlation remained well intact until late 2002  The HUI Gold Bugs Index surged roughly 600  from late 2000 to 2003 This is an extremely important point  The gold stocks were positively correlated with the stock market prior to the 1929 and 2008 crashes  That s why they crashed with the overall market  However  prior to the cyclical bull markets which began in 1973  1977 and 2000  the gold stocks were negatively correlated with the stock market  That s also been the case for the past 22 months   Brown concludes   The game is up and all that s left is denial what s happening right in front of people s faces  If your job is to run a gold fund though  what are you going to say  If you re the strategist at a Canadian investment bank that s doing gold miner financing and shit  what choice do you have but to be  constructive   It s  frankly  depressing  I hope for a huge bounce from the miners so that people who ve made a big mistake can use that bounce to make some changes   Had Brown studied this sector and its history  and he can quickly look at our first chart  he d see that these types of declines are like clockwork and so too are the massive recoveries  In terms of the length and depth of this decline it is remarkably similar to both the declines that occurred within the 1960 1980 secular bull market  In terms of depth its nearly as much as the 2008 crash  Our first chart illustrates that this downturn is in line with an overall secular bull market  It s not the end  it s just the start of the last run   The game that is up or will be up shortly is the cyclical bear market in precious metals as well as the cyclical bull market in the S P 500  When the S P 500 and economy struggle it s going to be glorious for precious metals  The authorities in the US and abroad will do everything they can to prevent another bear market and recession  The result will be a global currency crisis  higher inflation and stock markets won t go up  Don t think it can happen  You might want to review history and take a long view  Frankly  when Mom and Pop investor are stuck in stock funds for the next several years with barely any return and no exposure to precious metals  that will be depressing  I hope people don t make that big mistake ,2013-06-28,"Jordan Roy-Byrne, CMT",https://www.investing.com/analysis/epic-opportunity-in-gold-stocks-173319,173319
173652,395168,D,Markets Bullish After QE Announcement,opinion,The FED said that it will continue with its debt buying program for another  45 billion a month  It simply means more easing  more money printing to support the economy  which is why the market made a strong push higher with EUR USD to 1 3100 and S P500 close to 1440 level  I would expect to see commodities much stronger than that  especially gold which is now reversing after earlier push up to 1723  0 38  in the green  Silver doing much better its up more than 2   U S  treasuries are down and yields are higher  up more than 2 5  right now  Notice that a few days back  prices bounced higher from a lower triangle range higher in wave  d   still only fourth leg of a the pattern  With that said  technical picture for U S  yields suggests that market is still sideways here  but that break of September highs will occur after wave  e   So our view is bullish for this market  which is also bullish for stocks and bearish for USD if correlations remain in current shape ,2012-12-12,Gregor Horvat,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-bullish-after-qe-announcement-147281,147281
173653,395169,D,Credit Spreads  Explained,opinion,Anyone who goes on an introductory course in options trading will no doubt become familiar with credit spreads  This remains one of the most popular trading strategies among traders of all levels for a variety of reasons Definition A credit spread is an  spread for which the trader does not have to pay an upfront fee  Instead the trader is actually paid to set up a credit spread  The reason for this is that credit spreads involve selling more expensive options and buying cheaper ones  which means the net premium results in a credit to the trader s account Margin and trading LevelThere is a trade off though  whereas a debit spread does not involve any margin  since the trade can usually not lose more than the net cost to set up the position  a credit spread sometimes has the potential to lose an unlimited amount of money  This results in broker requiring a margin deposit before a trader can set up a debit spread  For stock options a higher trading level is usually also required than for debit spreads Benefits of credit spreadsWhereas most debit spreads require the price of the underlying asset to move either up or down in order to profit  credit spreads have the unique ability to profit if the price of the underlying asset remains stagnant or moves in a narrow range Although some credit spreads have unlimited potential for loss  there are also many other credit spreads with a limited potential for loss While credit spreads require a margin deposit  they still require a smaller margin deposit than naked puts or naked calls  In fact the lower margin involved is one of the reasons why many traders prefer credit spreads over selling naked options Although most credit spreads will profit in a stagnant or range trading market  there are also credit spreads that will profit if the market breaks out either to the upside or the downside Examples A credit spread for bullish marketsBelow is an example of a typical bullish credit spread  the bull put spread  This involves selling ATM put options and simultaneously buying OTM put options for the same expiration date A credit spread for bearish marketsBelow is an example of a credit spread for a bearish market  The bear call is set up by selling ATM call options and simultaneously buying the same number of OTM call options for the same expiration date A credit spread for neutral marketsIf a trader believes the market will remain either stagnant or range bound until the expiration date he or she can t do much better than a credit spread specifically intended for neutral markets  One such example is the very popular iron condor  which consists of selling OTM calls and OTM puts while simultaneously buying further OTM calls and puts which are cheaper Fig  9 28 d  is an example of a typical iron condor credit spread A credit spread for volatile marketsIf it is highly likely that the price of the underlying asset will break out either to the upside or the downside  a trader should opt for a credit spread designed specifically to benefit from this situation  An example in this regard is the ever popular short butterfly spread that is illustrated below in Fig  9 28 e  This trade is set up by buying two ATM call options and simultaneously selling an OTM call and an ITM call  The higher premium income from the ITM call helps to more than offset the cost of the ATM calls  creating a net credit ConclusionWhile credit spreads can be ideal under certain circumstances  one always has to take into account a  the probability of the trade actually realising a profit and b  whether the maximum risk maximum profit payoff justifies the trade ,2013-01-22,Marcus Holland,https://www.investing.com/analysis/credit-spreads:-explained-151820,151820
173654,395170,D,Why I m Maintaining A Bearish Perspective On Miners,opinion,If you have followed me on Twitter over the past six months you know that one of my standing refrains throughout the weeks has been that the precious metals miners are still one of the larger value traps of this market cycle  And similar to the financials in the tail end of the previous cycle   it has ensnared some rather large whales in its net  From the sophisticated palettes of Einhorn to Gundlach  the extraordinary valuations of the miners   relative to gold  have been too attractive to simply pass up for these marque money managers  Generally speaking  I have maintained a bearish perspective on the miners   despite valuations  for the simple reason I believe d  weakness in the precious metals complex was and is ongoing Perhaps it may be come sooner than I anticipate  but similar to the financials trading through 2008 into the first half of 2009   cheap   can get a whole lot cheaper ,2013-01-28,Erik Swarts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-i'm-maintaining-a-bearish-perspective-on-miners-152643,152643
